The main purpose of this study was to investigate the factors causing the rural underdevelopment in Iran. To fulfill this objective, Delphi technique, as a method of refining group opinions and substituting computed consensus for an agreed-upon majority opinion, was used. The study used a series of three steps questionnaires. Findings indicated that lack of a coherent strategy for sustainable rural development, unavailability of appropriate infrastructures in rural regions, lack of coordinated programs in rural development, weak management of governmental structures and lack of diversification in non-agricultural activities such as tourism are the most important challenges which can create an inappropriate condition for the development of Iranian rural communities.

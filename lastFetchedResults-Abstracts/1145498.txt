An optimization model of flight paths is designed for minimizing aircraft noise at reception points around airports. It is stated as a nonconvex and nonlinear control problem governed by ordinary differential equations using a jet noise model. The vertical plan and the space cases have been solved using two approaches, one direct and one indirect. The objective was initially to apply these two methods, then to carry out comparisons, and finally to retain the method which would be applied for the general case including engine and airframe sources. Results showed that the direct method is adapted for solving the problem and can be implemented with moderate computing times. It is sufficient to analyze the constrained flight path optimization of commercial aircraft reducing noise levels. The three-segment approach procedure has been obtained as an optimized flight path which can substantially reduce noise levels. This modified approach procedure has been examined and could benefit both airlines and communities.

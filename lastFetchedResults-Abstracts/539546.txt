Borage (Borago officinalis L.) is an oilseed with a high gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) content in its seed. The objective of this study was to determine the response of borage seed yield, oil content, and fatty acid composition to N, P, K, and S fertilizer treatments. Three experiments were conducted in Osorno (40°22' S, 73°04' W; 72 m.a.s.l.), Chile. The first experiment was conducted during the 2005-2006 growing season, with four N rates (0, 100, 200, and 300 kg N ha-1), three P rates (0, 60, and 120 kg P2O5 ha-1) and two K rates (0 and 150 kg K2O ha-1). The second experiment was conducted in 2006-2007 and evaluated only the effect of four N rates (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha-1) was evaluated because there was no response to P and K in the first experiment. The third experiment was conducted in the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 and evaluated only two rates of S, 0 and 40 kg S ha-1 were evaluated. Seed yield was not affected by N, P, K, or their interactions in any of the experiments. As N rates increased GLA content increased. Mean seed yield increased to 98 kg ha-1 when appliying of 40 kg S ha-1. Results indicate that borage has a higher response to S applications than N. Further research is needed to determine the interactions between N and S applications, given that the experiments were conducted on soils with high levels of P and K levels.

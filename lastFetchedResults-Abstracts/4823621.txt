Time and frequency synchronization is one of the most important tasks in an OFDM system. An improved adaptive synchronization algorithm is proposed in this paper. It combines the advantages of both decreasing step-size and constant step-size algorithms, meanwhile, a bidirectional search method is introduced into the new algorithm to accelerate the tracking speed. Simulation results show that the new algorithm has a better performance in convergence speed and precision, while its computational cost is almost changeless.

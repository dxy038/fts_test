Introduction and Objective: Human cytomegalovirus infection has high incidence worldwide. This virus is an important mortality factor in some blood donors. The aim of this investigation was study of seroprevalence of anti-cytomegalovirus IgG and IgM in voluntary blood donors of Ardebil province.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study after blood samples collection and serum separation, the specific anti-cytomegalovirus IgG and IgM antibodies were evaluated on sera using ELISA method and the relation of the obtained results with different parameters including gender, age, blood group and Rh factor were analyzed with appropriate statistical method using SPSS 17 version software.
Results: From 182 collected sera, 180 samples were positive for anti-cytomegalovirus IgG antibody (98.9%) whereas only 10 samples were positive for IgM antibody (5.5%) and 1 sample was suspicious. There was not statistical significance between blood donorâ€™s sexuality and IgG class anti-cytomegalovirus prevalence, meanwhile, concerning IgM class anti-cytomegalovirus prevalence, it showed statistical significance (P < 0.05) as the prevalence of anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody in females was higher than males. In addition, among age and prevalence of anti-cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG antibodies, statistical difference was not significance. It has not been shown any statistical significance between blood group, Rh factor and mentioned antibodies (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: In recent study, the high seroprevalence of anti-cytomegalovirus IgG and IgM antibodies was found in voluntary blood donors of Ardebil province resemble of other parts of country.

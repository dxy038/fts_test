This paper considers the global exponential stability problem for a class of bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks time-varying delays. By employing Lyapunov functional method and resorting to the less conservative technique for estimating the derivative of Lyapunov functional, the improved delay-dependent exponential stability criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical example is presented to illustrate the less conservativeness of the obtained result.

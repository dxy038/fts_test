Our objective is the investigation of MOVPE growth mechanisms for InP. We focused on the surface topography observed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). It is known that growth conditions such as thermal annealing, growth temperature or V/III ratio have a strong influence on growth mechanisms and surface topography. We present recent results on growth mechanisms on vicinal and highly misoriented InP surfaces studied by AFM

Objective: Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is a common malignant tumor in immuno compromised individuals and in organ transplant recipients due to immunosuppressive drugs. The correlation of lymphotropic viruses such as HHV-8 and HTLV-1 to KS is currently being studied. These viruses may be the risk factors or the primary cause of KS. The presence of HHV-8 and HTLV-1 genome was determined in archived skin biopsies diagnosed as KS.
Material and Method: In this study we selected 35 paraffin embedded skin biopsies with KS diagnosis. These diagnoses were reconfirmed by careful microscopic examination. Five micron thick sections of the blocks were prepared; and after deparaffmization, their DNA was extracted. Using LTR, tax and pol specific primers and ORF-26 and ORFK9-1 specific primers the HTLVI and the HHV-8 genomes were amplified, respectively.
Results: Our results indicate that none of the KS tissues were infected with HTLV-1, however we detected the presence of HHV-8 genome in all of the specimens.
Conclusion: According to these findings, it seems that HTLV-1 infection does not affect the process of HHV-8 activation.

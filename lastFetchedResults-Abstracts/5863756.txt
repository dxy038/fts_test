Beauty is an abstract concept. How to quantify and evaluate beauty has always been a major concern among people. But few people adopt the way based on image processing and pattern recognition to assess beauty. For the first time, this paper proposed a way using computer image processing and pattern recognition for beauty assessment, and proposed a method based on the beauty- related feature points and the smoothness of the face skin. And by using the method of machine learning and pattern recognition, the paper formulates a standard to evaluate the beauty. The evaluation system proves to be simple, feasible and objective with regard to various testing samples.

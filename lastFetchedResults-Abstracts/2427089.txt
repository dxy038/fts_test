The 40% of wall thickness criterion has been used as a plugging rule of steam generator tubes but it can be applicable just to a single-cracked tubes. In the previous studies preformed by the authors, a total of 10 local failure prediction models were introduced to estimate the coalescence load of two adjacent collinear through-wall cracks existing in thin plates, and the reaction force model and plastic zone contact model were selected as optimum models among them. The objective of this study is to verify the applicability of the proposed optimum local failure prediction models to the tubes with two collinear through-wall cracks. For this, a series of plastic collapse tests and finite element analyses were carried out using the tubes containing two collinear through-wall cracks. It has been shown that the proposed optimum failure models can predict the local failure behavior of two collinear through-wall cracks existing in tubes well. And a coalescence evaluation diagram was developed which can be used to determine whether the adjacent cracks detected by NDE coalesce or not.

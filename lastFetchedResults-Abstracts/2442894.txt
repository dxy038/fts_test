Bioaugmentation of kerosene from contaminated soils by Pseudomonas putida and Serratia marcescens isolated of the activated sludge and a study on their growth
چكيده [English]
Background & Objective: Bioaugmentation is a great technique in bioremediation of contaminated soils with petroleum hydrocarbons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of isolated bacteria from activated sludge as non-indigenous bacteria in bioremediation of kerosene contaminated soils and study the growth of isolated bacteria in the presence of different concentrations of this product.

Materials & Methods: Sampling of activated sludge was taken from two treatment plants in Assaluyeh region. Isolation of degrading bacteria was performed by culturing the samples on basal mineral medium. Emulsification test and evaluating growth of bacteria were carried out in different concentrations of kerosene. Isolated bacteria were inoculated to polluted soils with kerosene oil compound for bioaugmentation. The evaluation of their bioremediationpotentialand the rate of biodegradation were measured by infrared spectroscopy (IR).

Results: In this study, two bacteria Pseudomonas putida and Serratia marcescens were isolated and identified as kerosene degrading bacteria from activated sludge. P. putida was recognized as the most powerful degrading bacterium of this oil product according to emulsification tests, measuring the growth of bacteria in various concentrations of kerosene, the results of Bioaugmentation of contaminated column of soil with kerosene and reduce the level of TPHs.
   
Conclusion: In regard to adaptation of activated sludge bacteria with variety of pollutants in sewage, they can be used as non-indigenous bacteria for bioaugmentation and cleaning up contaminated soil with petroleum hydrocarbons.

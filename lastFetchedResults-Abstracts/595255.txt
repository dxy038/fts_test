Objective: To know the significance of trigger point as an indicator of aberrant vascular loop in patients with trigeminal neuralgia.Material and Methods: This study was performed in the department ofneurosurgery Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from May2003 to April2006. Patients with clinical history oftrigeminal neuralgia were admitted for micro vascular decompression Detailed clinical history, along with clinical findings particularly side and site oftrigger point oftrigeminal pain were documented. Imaging studies like CT, MRI were done in these cases and per-operative findings were documented after surgical procedure.Results: Forty-three patients with trigeminal neuralgia were operated for micro vascular decompression during the study period. There were 24 (55.8%) males and 19 (44.2%) females with ratio of1.2:1, and a mean age of53 years. Duration ofsymptoms was from 3 to 7 years. A total of43 cases oftrigeminal neuralgia were recorded. Right side was involved in 19 and left side in 24 cases. Peri-oral and peri-nasal trigger point was observed in 39 (90.7%o) cases during examination while offending arterial loop was seen in 35 (81.4%) cases per-operatively, thick arachnoid adhesion in 4 (9.3%0) cases and veins in 4 (9.3%0) cases.Conclusion: Trigger point during clinical examination indicated the presence ofoffending arterial loops in patients with trigeminal neuralgia.

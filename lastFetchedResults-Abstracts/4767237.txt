Project controls over cost, time, quality and resource leveling is an important issue in project management. The systematic analysis and integrated optimization of the four elements play important roles in improving comprehensive benefits of project. Combination Weighting Method is applied in the project optimization and a new integrated optimization model is built in Combination Weighting Method with the multiple attribute decision making theory. In the model, chain ratio method is used in subject weight while maximum deviation in objective method. Finally, an example is given to verify the feasibility and practicality of the model.

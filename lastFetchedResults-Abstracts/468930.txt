Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine on the activity and secretion of the matrix metalloproteinases in the decidua, amnion, and chorion and the secretion of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1.
Study design
Samples from eight nonlaboring women were taken at elective cesarean section and incubated in an in vitro organ culture in the absence or presence of N-acetylcysteine. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinaseâ€“9 activity was measured with the use of gel zymography. Western blot analysis was used to measure matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 secretion. Data were analyzed with the paired Student t test.
Results
N-acetylcysteine had a direct inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, regardless of tissue origin, starting at 1.0 mmol/L. In cultured media, 20 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in all three tissues. A differential response was demonstrated for matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion, depending on the tissue that was studied. Its secretion was decreased in decidua at 10 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L; in amnion, the secretion was inhibited at 0.1 mmol/L and not affected at all in chorion. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion was not affected in a statistically significant manner in any tissue. In the chorion, matrix metalloproteinase-9 showed a trend toward increased secretion. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 secretion significantly decreased in the decidua at 20 mmol/L.
Conclusion
N-acetylcysteine, at higher concentrations, has an inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, regardless of the tissue origin and the differential effect on secretion depending on the tissue and N-acetylcysteine concentration.

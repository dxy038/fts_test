Objective.To design an instrument to assess the performance of a clinic in the delivery of preventive health services to a general population.

Methods.The study utilized a chart review of services delivered, abstraction of data from electronic databases, and a standardized provider assessment of each eligible patient. The study was conducted in a primary care clinic staffed primarily by internal medicine residents in an urban academic medical center. Patients who were receiving continuity care in the clinic and who were scheduled for an appointment during the 2-week study period were eligible for inclusion. Patients were identified prospectively from the appointment schedule. Charts were reviewed for the delivery of preventive health services prior to the patient's visit. Assessment forms were provided to the primary providers for review and completion. Demographic and appointment information was electronically abstracted from current databases.

Results.The rate at which services were provided varied considerably by service and over time. The reasons for nondelivery included disagreement with guidelines, patient resistance/refusal, and lack of priority.

Conclusions.It should be possible to assess a clinic's performance over a range of services over its entire population over time. There may be legitimate reasons for services not being provided to a sizable proportion of the population. These issues are complex and require sensitive detailed investigation.

The loss of packets is unavoidable when compressed video data is transmitted over error prone channels. In this study, an error resilient coding scheme based on pixel lines decimation is proposed to enhance performance of error concealment for both intra and inter frames. At the encoder, an input picture is decimated by pixel lines into two similar sub-pictures and then they are merged together before encoding. At the decoder, the high correlation of two sub-pictures is employed to facilitate error concealment. For an intra frame, the lost pixel lines in a sub-picture can be spatial concealed by interpolation between spatial neighbor correct pixel lines in the other sub-picture in a short distance. For an inter frame, a corrupt macroblock can be temporal concealed by utilizing motion vectors of its co-located macroblock in the other sub-picture. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve both subjective and objective quality of the reconstructed picture.

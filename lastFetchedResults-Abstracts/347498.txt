Objective: The maturation of the visual system has been studied with pattern electroretinograms (PERG) and pattern visual evoked potentials (PVEP) mostly in children under the age of 6 years. To address the question of maturation of the visual system in childhood and adolescence we investigated age-dependent PERG and PVEP changes in children aged 7–18 years.
Methods: PERG were recorded with skin electrodes attached to the lower eyelid, and PVEP were recorded with 5 electrodes. Visual stimuli, consisting of pattern-reversal 50′ checks to full-field and to half-field stimulation, were applied to obtain macular (N70, P100, N145) and paramacular waves (P80, N105, N135).
Results: We found an age-dependent decrease (linear regression P<0.05) of PERG P50 amplitude and full-field PVEP P100 latency to monocular right and left eye stimulation, indicating central retinal and postretinal changes. In addition, waveform changes were found in responses to half-field stimulation. The paramacular wave N105 was typically enhanced in younger schoolchildren and diminished with age. The age-dependent decrease (linear regression P<0.01) of paramacular N105 amplitude indicated the increasing predominance of the macular structures of the visual system.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that central retinal and postretinal electrophysiological maturation persists throughout childhood. Age-dependent PVEP changes seem to correlate with the morphological and metabolic findings that maturation of the visual cortex continues until puberty and even later.

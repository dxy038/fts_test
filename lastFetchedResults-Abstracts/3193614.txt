The AC electromagnetic localization method is often used to locate the position of the objective such as the moving robot or vehicle. This technique must extract the coupling magnetic signals between the source and the receiving magnetic coils, because the localization algorithm determines objectiveÂ´s position and orientation by the intensities or the phases of the coupling signals. This extraction must be accurate to ensure the localization precision. However, these couplings voltage signals are very week and easily affected by interferences, so high efficient and robust extraction method is essential. In this paper, we present rapid particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to accurately extract this coupling signal. Through the simulation and serious comparisons, we found that PSO algorithm has higher accuracy and faster speed than the least square (LS) method, especially in cases with high noises. We show the simulation results that are satisfactory to extract the coupling voltage signals.

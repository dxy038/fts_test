This paper takes into account travel time consumption of vehicles on a city single road section, and establishes the time consumption model based on Beijing road systems. Using MATLAB to carry on the three-dimension relations of the model parameters and the objective function with the road section actual control situation, it has grasped the operation gradation of effects and the operation tendency of each parameter to the objective function, especially the zebra number of pedestriansÂ´ crossing and waiting-crossing. Finally, the number of Pedestrian Crossing Zebra (PCZ) proper design can make the vehicle road section time consumption much shorter, especially the main street in downtown area. This result is important for adjusting traffic flows in the rush hour. Giving the number of PCZ of trunk highway and a reasonable signal scenario for decreasing the vehicle passing time in the segment, it can provide reference in the micro-simulation of traffic system in cities.

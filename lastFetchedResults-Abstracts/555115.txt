The objective of this study was to obtain a factorial structure for the Auckland Individualism- Collectivism Scale (AICS), among Iranian students. A correlation method was employed with a sample of graduate students. Participants were 274 graduate students of Isfahanuniversity, who were selected through convenience sampling. They answered the 26-item version of the AICS. Data was analyzed through explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis and the Cronbach alpha of internal consistency. The explanatory factor analysis of 26 items yielded 5 clear factors and the examination of the 5 factor model by confirmatory factor analysis showed the best fit with the data, the Cronbach alpha as 0.81-0.93 of AICS factors was estimated and it was acceptable. The Auckland Individualism- Collectivism Scale could be used as a valid and reliable instrument in later Iranian psychological & psycho-sociological research.

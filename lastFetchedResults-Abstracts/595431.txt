Objective: To identify the anatomical position of the appendix in patients presenting at the emergency surgical ward, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar. Material and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in surgical 'A' Unit, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from January to June 2008. Patients coming to emergency surgical ward were examined after detailed history and investigation; and then operated. Position of appendix along with other findings was noted. Results: 100 patients were admitted and examined. 68% were male and 32% were female. During surgery retrocaecal position was the most common (78%) followed by pelvic position in 16% of patients. Perforated appendix was observed in 06% (all retrocaecal appendixes). Conclusion: Retrocaecal appendix was the commonest in patients presenting to emergency with acute appendicitis. Less symptoms/signs lead to delay in diagnosis and complications.

Medium density fibreboard (MDF) is an engineering wood product. This material is appropriate for many common and industrial applications. The aim of this article is to study of the cutting parameters (cutting speed and feed rate) on delamination in MDF drilling. A plan of two MDF panels drilling experiments was performed drilling with prefixed cutting parameters. The objective was to establish correlation between cutting speed and feed rate with the delamination around the MDF hole. The delamination factor decreases with the increase of cutting speed and increases with the feed rate for both materials. The drill tests showed the different scheme of delamination for each material of coating layer (wood or melamine).

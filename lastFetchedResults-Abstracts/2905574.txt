In order to overcome the disadvantages in traditional &#8220;EE&#8221; shape coupled inductors that the distributions of the air gaps are too concentrated, the distributions of the magnetic pressure and flux are not uniform, the air gaps are too nearly to the windings, this paper proposes a new structure of coupled inductors. It is proved with simulation and experiment that in the new structure, a parallel connection air gap magnetic circuit is increased to make the distributions of the magnetic pressure and flux more uniform, the inductance and strength of coupling larger, the air gaps are far away from the windings to reduce the air gaps´ diffusion flux and bypass flux, the windings are wound around the central poles which has smaller length-width ratio to reduce the wingding´s length. When the new coupled inductors are used to interleaving bidirectional DC/DC converter, the ripple wave of the output voltage is smaller, the wave form of the inductor current is smoother, and the peak current is smaller.

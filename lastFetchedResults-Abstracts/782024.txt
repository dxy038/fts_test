The spider lamb syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive condition of sheep, characterized
by severe bone lesions. The disease is caused by a mutation at codon 700 of the gene
fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), resulting in a valine (V) to glutamate (E) substitution,
and leading to an abnormal bone growth. Congenital diseases as SLSmay have an
important impact on animal production. The objective of this work was to detect the frequency
of E allele on Suffolk and H. Down breeds in three flocks from the southern region of
Brazil. A total of 256 samples, 146 fromtwo Suffolk flocks and 110 fromone H. Down flocks
were evaluated. The genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was PCR amplified and
cleaved with XhoI restriction enzyme. Allele E frequency varied among the different herds:
Suffolk, 6% in one flock and 3% in the other, and H. Down 6%, corresponding to 6â€“12% of
heterozygotes for the condition. These results emphasize the need for preventive measures
to minimize the birth of affected lambs. Also, the culling of animals, mainly rams, carrying
the E allele will bring more efficiency to the sheep industry. These data are important also
for sheep breeders, as the genotyping of the breed stock will afford more security to breeding
programs and stop the spread of this undesirable allele, reducing economic losses. It is
important to note that, in Brazil, the DNA test for SLS is not a routine procedure.

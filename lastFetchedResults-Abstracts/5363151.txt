A principle of reducing indeterminacy during management decision making, due to usage of additional objective information, which can be found using special diversified corporation evolution forecast economic mathematical model (EMM) is suggested. For this purpose a new EMMs parameters identification method, which uses of discrete orthogonal functions and mostly objective data, which characterize corporation economical activity has been developed. The major advantage of suggested method is strong (steady) identification process convergence, which guarantees propriety of decision obtained.

A new heat-resistant Fe-based cast alloy has been designed making the best use of the CALPHAD method. The objective was to replace the material for precision cast products made from Ni-based superalloys with improved Fe-based alloys originally developed for lower temperature applications.

The key to the design is to balance the amount of strengthening γ′- Ni3(Ti,Al) precipitates and brittle σ phase, and to simultaneously decrease as-cast microsegregation. Contours of the equal phase fraction were calculated over the isothermal diagrams of the Fe–Ni–Cr–Ti–Al–Nb system, and provided useful guidelines for compositional modifications. The microsegregation was also evaluated by Scheil-type simulation in order to reduce micropores caused by oxidation of the solidifying front.

The developed cast Fe-based alloy showed desirable strength at the envisioned service temperatures and filled the open range of heat resistance between Ni-based superalloys and the original alloy.

The paper presents and explains the results obtained from the theoretical study on mobility management with QoS in the enhanced UMTS-WLAN environment of the WINE GLASS (Wireless Ip NEtwork as a Generic platform for Location Aware Service Support) project, included into IST (Information Society Technologies) research program of the European Community. Proposing this solution for authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA) and QoS mobility management issues, this study aims to contribute to the technical innovation of the 3G systems by exploiting the potential of IP-based wireless mobile multimedia networking in evolution towards 4G systems. The main WINE GLASS objective is in fact to exploit and enhance new IP-based techniques to support terminal mobility and soft-guaranteed QoS in a wireless Internet architecture. The proposed framework incorporates both UMTS and WLANs access technologies, enhancing the UMTS backbone in order to fully support an all-IP solution.

Background: The ultrastructural analysis of cultured follicles could direct us to
understand subcellular changes during in vitro culture.
Objective: This study was done to verify the ultrastructural characteristics of in vitro
cultured mouse isolated preantral follicles in co-culture system in the presence and
absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
Materials and Methods: Mechanically isolated preantral follicles were divided into
four groups: control without LIF, control with LIF, co-cultured group with LIF, cocultured
group without LIF. In co-culture groups the follicles were cultured with
cumulus cells. After 4 days the follicles were processed and sectioned for transmission
electron microscopic examination.
Results: The oocytes of cultured preantral follicles in all studied groups demonstrated a
homogeneous cytoplasm and they had the round or ovoid shaped mitochondria with
light matrix and cristae. Their endoplasmic reticulum cisternae were in association with
mitochondria and Golgi complex. The cortical granules and the aggregation of
mitochondria around the germinal vesicle were prominent in both co-cultured groups.
The organelle distribution in granulosa cells was normal in all groups of study and no
sign of cell death was observed. In both co-cultured systems the granulosa cells
contained mitochondria with tubular cristae, a well developed smooth endoplasmic
reticulum and several large lipid droplets, characteristics of steroid synthesis cells.
Conclusion: The oocyte and granulosa cells in co-cultured system showed more
remarkable maturation features than that of control.

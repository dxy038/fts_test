The main objective of this work is the determination of the relationship between wind speed and optimum speed. In this paper we determine the mechanical energy captured from the wind turbine (WT) and transformed into electricity by permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to WT. We can determine, through simulation, the mechanical angular speed (MAS), &#969;<sub>OPTIM</sub> and optimum load resistance (R<sub>OPTIM</sub>) for the PMSG where the energy is high, considering the wind speed variable over time.

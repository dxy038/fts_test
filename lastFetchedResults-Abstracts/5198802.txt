In this paper, we demonstrate a packaging method for component of light emitting diode (LED) by silicon bulk micromachining technologies and using a silicon substrate with Cu/M/Cu foil to dissipate heat and match thermal expansion coefficient (CTE). The objective is to develop an LED package that can overcome high brightness LED life, high operating current and the ability to drive the devices at higher power and higher brightness. In our experiment, the optical and thermal characterization of the novel package structure was measured. Research results have shown that the sub-mount with Cu/M/Cu foil can enhance heat removal for safe junction temperature operation and minimize thermal stress caused by mismatch of CTE. Moreover, this kind of packaging can be used for packaging MEMS and conventional optoelectric semiconductor devices

This paper mainly focuses on the hazard materials optimal management problem, which involves the questions such as following: where to open treatment centers and with which technologies, where to open disposal centers, how to route different types of hazardous materials to the treatment centers which have compatible treatment technologies at the treatment center, how to route residues to disposal centers and how to route recycle matters to the recycling centers. A new bi-objective location-routing model is proposed, with some practical constraints which are not considered previously. Finally an experiment result is also reported.

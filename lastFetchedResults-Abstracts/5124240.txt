The objective of this study is to develop a method for mobile robot motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles. The concept of traversability vectors is used to analyze the spatial relationship between the robot and moving obstacles. Given a predefined path, the occupancy of the path by moving obstacles can be detected and registered on the constraint map. Obstacles on this map represent time constraints on the robot motion along the path. A search algorithm is then developed to coordinate the robot motion. Simulation results for this approach are discussed

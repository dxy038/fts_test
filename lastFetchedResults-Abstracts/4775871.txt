Spectrum sensing is the key enabling technology for cognitive radio networks. The main objective of the spectrum sensing is to provide more spectrum access opportunities to cognitive radio (CR) users without interfering with the licensed users. In this paper, we propose a half-voting based twice-cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed sensing method can achieve a much better performance.

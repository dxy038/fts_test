Obesity is a major health care problem in the United States. The body mass index (BMI) is the standard measure of obesity. A BMI >25 kg/m2 is defined as overweight and obesity as a BMI >30 kg/m2. Recent surveys indicate that 54% of adults, or roughly 97 million people, are overweight.[1 and 2] Given the incidence of obesity in the general population, it is likely that EM physicians will be involved in the emergency care of critically ill or injured obese patients. The objective of this article is to present the clinical problems associated with the resuscitation of the critically ill or injured obese patient and their potential solutions.

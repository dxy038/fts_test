The paper compares the performance of 4 x 4 block based discrete cosine transforms(DCT) with conventional 8 x 8 DCT .The small size DCT is suitable for mobile applications using low power devices as fast computation speed is required for real time applications. The comparison is done on the basis of computation time and objective quality, based on PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio).

The objective of this paper is to determine the power loss to the finite conductivity of the metal in a waveguide slot array. The method of analysis is based on the introduction of a waveguide slot module. Attention is focused on a single module in which the slot voltage <img src="/images/tex/13637.gif" alt="V_{s}"/> and complex mode amplitudes A<inf>10</inf>and D<inf>10</inf>(henceforth the 10 subscript is implied for A and D) are assumed to be known values. The losses for the module are computed from the loss-free magnetic field solution. The fields in the interior of the guide are formulated in terms of Green\Â´s functions for rectangular waveguide. Explicit expressions for the dominant TE<inf>10</inf>and scattered higher order modes are derived. In the exterior plane of the module, the near field of the slot is formulated in terms of the exact field solution for a magnetic dipole. The exterior losses are computed numerically. Numerical results for a two-by-four array are presented.

Objective
To prospectively evaluate the effects of compressive vests on the pulmonary function of infants with thoracic burn scars.
Methods
Between April 2000 and October 2005, all infants aged 2 years or less and all those aged between 2 and 3 years if they had concomitant pulmonary pathology, who were in need of a compressive vest for the treatment of burn scars to the thorax, underwent comparative pulmonary function testing under sedation with the vest closed and then opened.
Results
Of the 23 infants who met the inclusion criteria, 19 had complete data. There were significant differences in oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, tidal volume/kg body weight, respiratory compliance and peak tidal expiratory flow /tidal volume, with or without vest compression.
Conclusions
Compressive vests used at our centre to treat thoracic burn scars of infants aged 2 years or less, and those aged between 2 and 3 years with concomitant pulmonary pathology, did have a statistically significant effect on their pulmonary function, but this did not translate into clinically significant differences. However, the differences observed might become clinically significant in the presence of pulmonary comorbidity or severe burns. Routine pulmonary function testing before the use of vest compression might thus benefit these infants.

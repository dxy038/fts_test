In this paper, new genetic algorithm (GA) by Fuzzy-based and voltage control in a realistic distribution system that is a part of the North Delta Electricity Distribution Company network in Egypt. This system includes tap-changed main transformer, substation switched capacitors and feeders switched capacitors whose operation is to be coordinated. The unprecise linguistic expressions associated to practical operation are treated via fuzzy sets. First, the objective function and constraints are formulated in terms of fuzzy sets. Then, a genetic algorithm technique is adopted to solve the problem to determine the optimal dispatching schedule of the main transformer tap position and capacitors on/off status. Extensive results are discussed while comparing the proposed voltage control strategy versus two others.

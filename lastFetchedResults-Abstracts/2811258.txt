Optimization problems are solvable if it is possible to define a solution space and an objective function. Unfortunately there exist many application scenarios where it is impossible to define a objective function due to incomplete information. Therefore, the application of standard techniques to find an adequate solution is unfeasible. One of this application scenarios is reducing the energy consumption e of a user u carrying out a task or activity a by using a set of tools t in a determined state s and following a certain workflow w.

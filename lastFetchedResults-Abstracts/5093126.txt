Enterprises and industrial companies strive to improve their functional performance by identification of core competencies in order to utilize human resources and optimise the knowledge integration processes of the company. In addition, maintenance operations are one of the most important sections in industrial companies which consist of key personnel and also explicit and implicit knowledge resources that have direct effects on product quality and return on investment. In the context of implicit knowledge resources, the principal objective is firstly to identify knowledge holders who are mainly domain experts (e.g. Chief Maintenance Officer-CMO) and maintenance practitioners (e.g. engineers, technicians, etc.), and secondly to measure their domain expertise. This paper presents the concept and implementation results of an interdisciplinary research which aims at improving the knowledge measuring of maintenance practitioners. In this way, the companies are enabled to deduce rate of human failures in maintenance operations by allocating the right professionals in the right positions using competency profiling of employees. The implementation results in developing a competence profiling tool as an add-on for Computerized Maintenance Management Information Systems (CMMIS), which is previously developed in the Institute of Knowledge Based Systems and Knowledge Management (KBS&amp;KM).

Background and Objective: Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial infections during pregnancy and has also been implicated as a risk factor for adverse maternal and prenatal   outcomes. The aim of our study was to determine the relation between maternal urinary tract infection and adverse maternal, prenatal outcomes in  pregnant women of Ardabil, Iran.
Material and Methods:  This retrospective-case-control study was conducted on  prenatal file records of pregnant women in Ardabil (2011).   The pregnant women  who had a positive urine  culture  in  their prenatal  files  (N= 211)  were considered  as a case  group and  232  ones without urinary tract  infection as a control. Using a research- made questionnaire, the data related to present pregnancy and prenatal information was collected and analyzed by KrusKal Wallis, Chi- Square and Fisher statistical tests. 
Results : Maternal age  of under 25 (%61.6 vs. 56.5), body mass index  of more than 30 (%18.3 vs. 15.6), primigravida  (%55 vs. 48.8), hypertension (%2.4 vs. 1.3), hyperemesis Gravidarum (%14.8 vs. 12.6), frequency  and dysuria (%1.9 vs. 0.9), low birth weight (%95.4 vs. 93.2), congenital malformation (%3.5 vs. 1.8), artificial milk feeding (%6.5 vs. 2.7), neonatal death (%0.9 vs. 0.0) are higher in urinary infection group, however  the  differences are not statistically  significant. Other maternal and prenatal adverse outcomes such as   diabetes, pre-eclampsia, hemoglobin level, prematurity, abortion and stillbirth have not significant relation with urinary infection.
Conclusion: Because of low level of  adverse maternal or prenatal outcomes reported in our study, we conclude that screening and treatment of urinary tract infection in Ardabil health service is  appropriate; therefore,  no change is needed for present  screening  or treatment processes.

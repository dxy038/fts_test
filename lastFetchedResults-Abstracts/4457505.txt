In this paper we are interested in ground penetrating radar (GPR) modelling applied to horizontal and vertical resolution of buried objects using the finite difference in time domain (FDTD). Our objective was to assess the vertical and the horizontal resolution of three tablecloths of pipes like metallic, empty PVC and PVC filled with water in three depths as the model of &#8220;site test of laboratoire central des ponts et chausse&#769;es (LCPC renamed actually as IFSTAR) of Nantes-France&#8221;, when the soil was attenuating low dispersive. When using the effect of frequency excitation source and depth, results thus found, after having to determine all the parameters which influenced resolution, it was necessary to also see the nature of the targets, this is why, this resolution differs from one target to another. For vertical resolution, metallic targets or which presented a very high permittivity, it was necessary to have a distance from a little high separation because it could mask the targets behind and what appeared at the time of the study of this resolution and that in end the &#916;<sub>V</sub> would be smaller for the case of the empty plastic. Experimental and numerical results were made and showed a great agreement by using a processing as migration what was not obligatorily the case of horizontal resolution which in is made based on a direct visibility..

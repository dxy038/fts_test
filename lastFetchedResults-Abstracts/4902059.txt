A bidirectional ZVT buck and boost converter with coupled inductors is proposed in this paper. In this converter a coupled inductor is used to reset the auxiliary circuit current to zero, in order to ensure soft switching of the auxiliary switches at turn off. All switches in the proposed converter are soft switched and thus high efficiency is achieved. The principle of operation is explained and analyzed. The simulation results justify the converter analysis.

In this paper, we study the sleep-mode operation for power management of an MS in the IEEE802.16e wireless metropolitan access network. For the analysis we use the M/GI/1/ K queueing system with multiple vacations, exhaustive services and setup times, and derive the power consumption per unit time and blocking probability as performance measures. To get the optimized system parameters which result in the lowest power consumption, we propose a new performance measure, called the power consumption per unit time per effective arrival, which considers the packet blocking probability as well as the power consumption per unit time simultaneously. Based on our new performance measure, we provide a detailed procedure on how to get the optimized system parameters. Numerical studies are also provided to investigate the system performance and to show how to achieve our objective.

This paper introduces optimisation modules of a process planning system called OPPS-PRI (Optimised Process Planning System for PRIsmatic parts) which has been developed together with its interfaces to provide a complete CAD/CAM integration. Primary objective of this work is to develop an intelligent and integrated CAD/CAM system for shop-floor use that can be used by an average operator and to produce globally optimised results (process plans and part programs). For this purpose, in this work, an attempt has been made to include the impact and potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in process planning applications and to optimise all events in an integrated CAD/CAM environment. GAs were extensively used in the development of process planning facilities and in the optimisation issues, in order to include profits of AI techniques into the system.

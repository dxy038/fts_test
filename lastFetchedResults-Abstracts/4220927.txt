A two-step resource precalculated and shared restoration mechanism is put forward in this paper. This mechanism separates calculation of link resource to reserve for newly created lightpath from restore path routing. The target of resource reservation is to minimize the resources for restoration under the condition that a restore path had been routed, and the restore path routing is base on various strategies. A different algorithm with minimal resource reservation can be seen as a different resource shared restoration scheme, which aims at a different objective for networking. Meanwhile a second shortest path and resource shared restoration scheme is given as an example.

The objective of this study was to evaluate all congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum samples. Concentrations of all PCB congeners in the serum of 87 volunteers were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The participants consisted of 47 males and 40 females, including 25 men working at municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs). The mean concentrations of total PCBs and dioxin-like PCBs were 242.77 ng/g lipid (median: 180.17 ng/g lipid) and 18.57 ng/g lipid (median: 15.34 ng/g lipid), respectively. Penta-, hexa-, and heptachlorinated biphenyls contributed more than 80% of the total PCBs detected in human serum. Congener-specific analysis indicated that PCB153, PCB138, PCB180, PCB187, and PCB118 contributed 57.3% of the total PCBs detected in human serum samples. A statistical analysis was performed to determine whether there were significant correlations between PCB concentrations and specific variables such as age, gender, smoking habits, occupation, and body mass index (BMI). However, serum PCB concentrations correlated only with age. In addition, we found that total PCBs and dioxin-like PCBs highly correlated with PCB153 (correlation coefficient r = 0.93, p < 0.01) and PCB118 (correlation coefficient r = 0.98, p < 0.01), respectively. Thus these two congeners could be satisfactory indicators for total PCBs and dioxin-like PCBs in human serum.

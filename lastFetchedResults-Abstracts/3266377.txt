To cope with the ever increasing demand for bandwidth and increasing number of users, future wireless networks will be designed with the radio resource allocation techniques able to get good performance with low complexity and feedback. In this paper we study an allocation problem for OFDMA networks formulated with the objective of minimizing the load of each cell in the system or maximizing the number of accessing users subject to the constraint that each user meets its target rate. We formulate the two problem as one framework of finding the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) in graph theory. In addition, we propose a minimal weighted-degree greedy (MWDG) algorithm. The control information requested to perform the allocation is limited and the computational burden is shared between the base station and the user equipments. Simulations have been carried out under constant bit rate traffic model and the results show MWDG has excellent performance and outperforms all other techniques.

The objective of this paper is to develop a technique for transcoding from MPEG-2 main profile to H.264 main profile and compare its performance with other transcoding architectures. The proposed transcoder reuses information from the MPEG-2 bit stream taking into account the improved approaches such as multiple block size motion estimation, in loop deblocking filter, intra directional prediction etc. adopted in H.264. The proposed method achieves low complexity, comparable quality and reduced bit rate in the transcoding process

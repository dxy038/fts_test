The premise of today´s drug development is that the mechanism of a disease is highly dependent upon underlying signaling and cellular pathways. Such pathways are often composed of complexes of physically interacting genes, proteins, or biochemical activities coordinated by metabolic intermediates, ions, and other small solutes and are investigated with molecular biology approaches in genomics, proteomics, and metabonomics. Nevertheless, the recent declines in the pharmaceutical industry´s revenues indicate such approaches alone may not be adequate in creating successful new drugs. Our observation is that combining methods of genomics, proteomics, and metabonomics with techniques of bioimaging will systematically provide powerful means to decode or better understand molecular interactions and pathways that lead to disease and potentially generate new insights and indications for drug targets. The former methods provide the profiles of genes, proteins, and metabolites, whereas the latter techniques generate objective, quantitative phenotypes correlating to the molecular profiles and interactions. In this paper, we describe pathway reconstruction and target validation based on the proposed systems biologic approach and show selected application examples for pathway analysis and drug screening.

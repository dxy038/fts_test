Relay Stations (RSs) can be deployed in a wireless network to extend its coverage and improve its capacity. Smart (directional) antennas can enhance the functionalities of RSs by forming the beam only towards intended receiving Subscriber Stations (SSs). In this paper, we study a joint problem of selecting a beam width and direction for the smart antenna at each RS and determining the RS assignment for SSs in each scheduling period. The objective is to maximize a utility function that can lead to a stable and high-throughput system. We define this as the Beam Scheduling and Relay Assignment Problem (BS-RAP). We show that BS-RAP is NP-hard, present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to provide optimal solutions and present two polynomial-time greedy algorithms, one of which is shown to have a constant factor approximation ratio.

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is the main method to process judgment without fixed structure, but there are two problems in the application. Consistency calculation of judging matrixes is complex and evaluation information from the experts is not objective. This paper proposes a new synthetic evaluation method based on Grey Analytic Hierarchy Model (GAHM) to solve above problems. Indexes weight vectors is obtained by the process of judging relative weight between any two of indexes using Analytic Hierarchy Model method(AHM), then the grey weight matrixes can be obtained referring the index evaluation information from experts using grey evaluation method. The final evaluation result is obtained by mapping synthesizing result of relative property weight vectors and grey weight matrixes to scoring range. The proposed method is effective by testing and verifying practical example. The main priorities are that evaluation process become more objective and calculating process is quicker. There is much application value to use the method.

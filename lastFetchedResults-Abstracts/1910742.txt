Objective
ess the influence of glutathione S-transferases M1 and T1 (GSTM1 and T1) genotype on the risk of bladder cancer in patients with urinary bilharziasis.
als and methods
tudy was designed as a case-control study that involved 60 individuals who were enrolled into 3 equal groups. The first one included patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, the second one had those with nonmalignant urinary bilharziasis, and the last one was the control group. All of the participants were adult males, nonsmokers, and with matched ages. All of them underwent an assessment of the serum level of the total GST concentration and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for determination of the GSTM1 and T1 genotypes.
s
wer most GST enzyme concentration was reported in patients with bilharzial bladder cancer (26 ± 4.4 ng/ml) with significant difference between it and that of the second group (36.8 ± 4.1 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05) and that of the controls (40.4 ± 4 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.005). The PCR results have demonstrated that the frequency of combined GSTM1 and T1 genes deletion (M1–ve T1–ve) was significantly higher in cases of bladder cancer (40%) than those of the controls (5%, P &lt; 0.005) and those of the second group (10%, P &lt; 0.05). The unconditional logistic regression test revealed that patients with urinary bilharziasis and combined GSTM1 and T1 genes deletion are at a significant risk for malignant transformation (OR = 6.3, P &lt; 0.05).
sions
ts with urinary bilharziasis and GSTM1–ve and T1–ve genes might be at increased risk of bladder cancer. However, larger studies are needed for confirmation of these results.

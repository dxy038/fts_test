According to the characteristics of Job-shop and ASP (application service provider), one of mixed algorithms, bidirectional sequencing algorithm for solving job-shop scheduling problem with due dates is used in machine shop. In the algorithm, an algorithm based on rules, in priority of adjustable coefficient, is used to obtain a good initial solution, which is arranged in reverse sequence. A heuristic algorithm is used to adjust the initial solution afterwards so that the final solution is obtained. The results of simulation experiment indicates that the algorithm has low computational complexity and satisfactory optimization effect. Based on the idea of the algorithm, a job-shop scheduling system in ASP (application service provider) is finished to solve scheduling problem in machine shop of cooperating production on net.

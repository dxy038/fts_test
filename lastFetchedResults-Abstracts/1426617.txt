Objective
mine whether euthymic bipolar patients engage similar or contrasting brain regions as healthy subjects when responding to implicit affect induction.
s
udy examined 10 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects engaged in a modified word-based memory task designed to implicitly evoke negative, positive or no affective change. The activation paradigm involved nominating whether a target word was contained within a previously presented word list using specified response keys.
s
RI task produced significantly greater activation in healthy subjects as compared to patients in response to both negative and positive affect in the anterior and posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, middle frontal and right parahippocampal gyri. Only negative affect produced significantly greater activation in the postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, thalamus and putamen and only positive affect achieved the same in the precentral, superior temporal and lingual gyri, precuneus, cuneus, caudate, pons, midbrain and cerebellum. There were no brain regions in which responses were greater in patients as compared to healthy subjects. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to speed or accuracy.
sions
shed prefrontal, cingulate, limbic and subcortical neural activity in euthymic bipolar patients as compared to healthy subjects is suggestive of emotional compromise that is independent of cognitive and executive functioning. This finding is of clinical importance and has implications both for the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder. Future studies should aim to replicate these findings and examine the development of bipolar disorder, investigating in particular the effects of medication.

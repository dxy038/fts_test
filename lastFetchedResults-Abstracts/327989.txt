Association of the G72/G30 locus with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has now been reported in several studies. The G72/G30 locus may be one of several that account for the evidence of linkage that spans a broad region of chromosome 13q. However, the story of G72/G30 is complex. Our meta-analysis of published association studies shows highly significant evidence of association between nucleotide variations in the G72/G30 region and schizophrenia, along with compelling evidence of association with bipolar disorder. But the associated alleles and haplotypes are not identical across studies, and some strongly associated variants are located  50 kb telomeric of G72. Interestingly, G72 and G30 are transcribed in opposite directions; hence, their transcripts could cross-regulate translation. A functional native protein and functional motifs for G72 or G30 remain to be demonstrated. The interaction of G72 with d-amino acid oxidase, itself of interest as a modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors through regulation of d-serine levels, has been reported in one study and could be a key functional link that deserves further investigation. The association findings in the G72/G30 region, among the most compelling in psychiatry, may expose an important molecular pathway involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

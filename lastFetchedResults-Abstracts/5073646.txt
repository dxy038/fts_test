This study is part of the ExternE programme of the European Commission on the external costs of the photovoltaic (PV) fuel cycle. The objective of this paper is the quantitative evaluation of the main environmental impacts of two selected PV power systems-a ground-based 1 MWp system in Toledo, Spain and a 40 kWp building integrated facade in Newcastle upon Tyne, NE England-using the methodology of life cycle analysis (LCA). Both systems use silicon wafer technology at present, but the Newcastle facade was also studied with the incorporation CdTe modules. The results of the LCA show that atmospheric emissions are the priority impacts with respect to the assessed PV power systems. Comparing Si wafer systems, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 88 t/GWh for the Toledo PV plant and 143 t/GWh for the BIPV facade. If the facade had used electrodeposited CdTe, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would fall to about 50 t/GWh

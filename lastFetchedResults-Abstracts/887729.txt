The main objective of this study is to investigate the problem of marginalization in city of Ahwaz and to propose empowering strategies within the liberal framework. The staggering growth of Ahwaz population as the regional center in the Southwest of Iran, the seventh metropolis of Iran and the second largest city in terms of marginalization have given rise to a plethora of problems such as filthy marginalized communities, illegal housing, etc. One of these marginalized communities is Ghale Chanan District. It has been infused with numerous problems in the last few decades to the extent that it poses health, safety and welfare threats to the city. Empowerment is based on the poverty alleviation and its advancement depends on the cooperation of the citizens and urban management. It aims at provoking the sense of belonging in the area and eliciting the proper response as to the share of the state and people. What is central to this strategy is a special emphasis on increasing household incomes and poverty alleviation. The research method is descriptive - analytic and a sample size of 266 households was randomly selected using Cochrane method. The data obtained by means of the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS software based on Pearson Chi-Square method. This area is characterized with physical and social features such as relatively stable and homogenous social context, disinclination to cooperate with state-run offices, lack of awareness of the urban management planning among the local people, the low quality of the housing and a combination of all these factors.  The results, however, show that the citizens with a longer history of residency in the area enjoy better amenities and services. There is a positive (parallel) relationship between the history of residence and the desire to contribute, and the citizens with higher awareness of urban management planning are more likely to cooperate.

The increase of RF power on board of telecommunication satellites (in terms of power per carrier and number of carriers) requires power handling improvement on RF equipment, in particular with respect to the multipactor phenomenon. From the design step, it is necessary to accurately predict the power threshold to avoid over-designed components. At validation test step, realistic margins definition is needed to prevent performing tests at too high power levels but without taking any risks. Currently, studies are in progress to provide better understanding of this effect. The EVEREST project, funded by ESA with CNES acting as prime contractor, brings together all the major European players in the field around these issues. The main objective is to collaborate on several topics: prediction software, test procedures, cross-validation between measurement and simulation results, etc ... The ultimate goal is to propose relevant updates of the multipactor ECSS document. Thales Alenia Space France is involved in the EVEREST project and has participated in various stages especially in design, manufacturing and measurement of different multipactor samples. This paper presents the development and the results obtained in the frame of this study, and compares predictions and measurements on some samples.

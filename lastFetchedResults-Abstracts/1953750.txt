The paper deals with the energy analysis and optimization of a complete biomass-to-electricity energy pathway, starting from raw biomass towards the production of renewable electricity.

rst step (biomass-to-biogas) is based on a real pilot plant located in Environment Park S.p.A. (Torino, Italy) with three main steps ((1) impregnation; (2) steam explosion; (3) enzymatic hydrolysis), completed by a two-step anaerobic fermentation.

 second step (biogas-to-electricity), the paper considers two technologies: internal combustion engines and a stack of solid oxide fuel cells.

 the complete pathway has been modeled and validated through experimental data. After, the model has been used for an analysis and optimization of the complete thermo-chemical and biological process, with the objective function of maximization of the energy balance at minimum consumption.

mparison between ICE and SOFC shows the better performance of the integrated plants based on SOFC.

Oxides of cesium play a key role in ameliorating the photoelectron emission of various opto-electronic devices. However, due to their extreme reactivity, their electronic and optical properties have hardly been touched upon. With the objective of better understanding the electronic and optical properties of Cs2O in relationship to its structure, an experimental and theoretical study of this compound was undertaken. First-principles density functional theory calculations were performed. The preferred structural motif for this compound was found to be anti-CdCl2. Here three Cs–O–Cs molecular layers are stacked together through relatively weak van-der-Waals forces. The energy bands were also calculated. The lowest transition at 1.45 eV, was found to be between the K point in the valence band to the Γ point in the conduction band. A direct transition at 2 eV was found in the center (Γ) of the Brillouin zone. X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction were used to analyze the synthesized material. These measurements showed good agreement with the calculated structure of this compound. Absorption measurements at 4.2 K indicated two optical transitions with somewhat higher energy (indirect one at 1.65 and a direct transition at 2.2 eV, respectively). Photoluminescence measurements also showed similar transitions, suggesting that the lower indirect transition is enhanced by three nearby minima at 1.5 eV in the Brillouin zone.

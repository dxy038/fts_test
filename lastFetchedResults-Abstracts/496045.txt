Introduction & Objective: Around 22% of pregnancies reach to 40 weeks or more. Investigations have shown that PG is effective in improving cervical ripe and shortening the labor. Stripping also is one of the effective approach for reducing post date pregnancies. This study was undertaken to compare vaginal Misoprostol (PG El) and membrane stripping to improve Bishop Score and shortening of labor in post date pregnancies.

Materials & Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 60 post date pregnant women (gestational age > 40w), primigravida and gravida 2 enrolled in two study groups. Group A was stripping and group B was PG E2 (Misoprostol) tablet. The mean of labor time and Bishop Score changes compared by t-student test.

Results: Mean of labor time in the group B and A was 11.6±8.8 and 11.9±6.8 hours respectively. Mean of Bishop Score change in group A was 4 ± 0.81 and in group B was 3.7 ± 1.86. Conclusion: Efficacy of each method in improvement of Bishop Score and reduction of labor time was equal and statistically had no significant difference.

Objective: Our purpose was to describe the techniques we have developed to remove nonpalpable subcutaneous and intramuscular Norplant capsules with the patient under local anesthesia and with use of real-time ultrasonographic guidance in an office setting. Study Design: This was a noncomparative, descriptive study of our experiences with 27 women with 64 deep Norplant capsules. Results: Twenty-four women had all their nonpalpable and intramuscular implants removed under real-time ultrasonographic guidance with no complications. One woman was not a candidate, one was lost to follow-up, and another elected to retain her last implant. Conclusion: Real-time ultrasonographically guided procedures can be performed with the patient under local anesthesia in an office setting and can reduce the number of operative procedures necessary to remove nonpalpable and intramuscular Norplant capsules.

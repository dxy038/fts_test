The objective of this study was to evaluate the developmental toxic potential of diallyl phthalate (DAP) in rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given DAP at doses of 0 (olive oil), 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/kg/day, by gavage (5 ml/kg), on Gestational Days (GD) 6 through 20. Gross examination at necropsy revealed liver lesions in dams given 150 mg/kg/day or higher doses. In addition, maternal weight gain and food consumption were significantly reduced at 200 and 250 mg/kg/day. There was no significant increase in the incidence of resorptions, or malformations, at any dose. Fetal body weight was significantly reduced at 200 and 250 mg/kg/day. There was a significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with skeletal variations at 250 mg/kg/day. Retarded ossification of certain bones (i.e. forelimb and hindlimb phalanges, metatarsals, and caudal vertebrae) was also observed. There was no sign of developmental toxicity at 100 and 150 mg/kg/day.

DAP caused fetal toxicity at doses which also produced maternal effects, but no embryolethality or teratogenicity.

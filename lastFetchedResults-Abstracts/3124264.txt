In this paper, the problem of the optimal allocation and sizing of capacitors in unbalanced distribution systems is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. This problem is solved by means of the e-constrained technique. Besides, some methods for determining a reduced feasible region and a micro genetic algorithm are used. The solving method proposed is tested on the IEEE 34-node unbalanced distribution system in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in terms of reduced computational efforts and accuracy of the results.

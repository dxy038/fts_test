Considering evaluation of multisource image fusion performance, various methods of subjective &amp; quantitative and objective &amp; qualitative assessments of multisource image fusion are discussed in this paper. Based on the relationship and individual characteristics of these measures, the synthetic evaluation system and criterions of multisource image fusion are formed. Using these evaluation criteria, the fusion performance of multisource image fusion based on the features and interrelations of these methods is analyzed. The experimental and calculation results show that the fusion evaluation criteria are effective. Conclusions made may provide guidance to choose appropriate fusion methods in practice.

Background: Despite anecdotal evidence linking socioeconomic status and choices on surgical management in breast cancer patients in China, no scientific evaluations have ever been conducted. The objective of this study was to evaluate patient factors that influence patients’ treatment options between breast cancer patients receiving breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Methods: A total of 268 stage I–II breast cancer patients treated with BCT in Tianjin Cancer Hospital, from January 2005 to January 2007, were compared with 200 randomly selected breast cancer patients (controls) treated with MRM. A personal health questionnaire (PHQ) was used to assess the factors that may affect the surgical decision making. Chi-squared test and multiple logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with BCT. Results: BCT patients who were younger and were more likely to live in urban areas had medical insurance, higher levels of education and family income. Patients with medical insurance coverage were approximately six times more likely to receive BCT than patients without medical insurance after controlling for other potentially confounding factors. Similar results were also observed for family income. The observed differences cannot be explained by clinical aspects of their disease, such as tumor stage, estrogen receptor, and lymph node involvement. Conclusion: Breast cancer patients’ socioeconomic status, rather than their clinical condition, is the predominant factor in determining whether a breast cancer patient receives BCT or not. These results provide a snapshot on how socioeconomic status influences cancer care provision in China. Future efforts should be made towards reducing discrepancies in treatment options for cancer patients caused by social class and socioeconomic status.

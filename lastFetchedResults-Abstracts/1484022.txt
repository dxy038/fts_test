The purpose of this study was to develop an objective method for measuring fresh pork loin firmness. A total of 42 fresh boneless pork loins were collected from a range of subjective firmness scores based on the whole boneless loin to create a population suitable for creating a prediction equation. Loins were subjectively scored by panelists prior to objectively being measured with a Texture Analyzer. An R2 value of 0.54 was achieved for the prediction equation that was generated. A second trial was performed to test the equation resulting in an R2 value of 0.30 concerning subjective and objective values. The results from these studies indicate that it is possible to create a standardized protocol in order to determine objective firmness that would be useful for future studies and for the development of hand held or online firmness measuring devices.

This paper has as an objective the evaluation of the maximum simultaneous transfer capability using probabilistic methods to include uncertainties associated with load fluctuations and equipment availability. The scenarios resulting from these uncertainties are generated using Monte-Carlo simulation. The maximum simultaneous transfer capability of each generated state is evaluated using linear optimisation based on primal-dual interior-point method. The sample of system states is used to obtain the probability distribution and expected value of the maximum simultaneous transfer capability. Case studies with IEEE RTS-96 system are presented and discussed

This paper develops cross-layer adaptive modulation and coding as an efficient method for bit interleaved coded OFDM packet transmission. As objective function, we adopt the goodput, or the number of data bits delivered without error per unit of time. After the formalization of the optimization problem through an accurate modeling on the link performance, an iterative solution is derived based on the framework of greedy algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves upon the performance of static transmission and uniform bit allocation by 2-4 dB.

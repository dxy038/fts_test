Objective
m of this study was to label human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with poly-l-lysine (PLL)-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide particles and to obtain magnetic resonance (MR) images of the labeled MSCs' suspension at 1.5 T.
al and Methods
s conjugated with iron oxide to form superparamagnetic particles called Fe2O3-PLL. Human umbilical cord blood MSCs were isolated, purified, expanded and incubated with Fe2O3-PLL. Prussian blue stain was performed to show intracellular iron; spectrometry was used to quantify iron uptake within cells. Tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay was applied to evaluate toxicity and proliferation of MSCs labeled with various concentrations of Fe2O3-PLL. The cell apoptosis rate was determined by annexin V/propichium iodide (PI) double staining method. Vials containing cells underwent MR imaging (MRI) with T1, T2 and T2* weighted MRI.
s
ontaining intracytoplasmatic vesicles could be observed clearly with Prussian blue staining in all samples except the unlabeled control. The iron content per cell determined by spectrometry was 64.51±10.32 pg. Among MSCs with and without labeling of various concentrations of Fe2O3-PLL, MTT values of light absorption had no statistically significant difference (Kruskal–Wallis test, χ2=10.35, P=.17). A concentration at 20 μg/ml of iron appeared most suitable for incubating cells. Of labeled and unlabeled MSCs, the early [annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-positive/PI-negative] and late (annexin V-FITC-positive/PI-positive) apoptotic cells were 10.34±0.43%/11.36±1.30% and 4.01±1.76%/2.98±1.37%, respectively, and there were no significant differences between them (P&gt;.05). T2 weighted image (WI) and T2*WI demonstrated significant decrease of signal intensity (SI) in vials containing 1×106 (1 day), 1×106 (8 days) and 5×105 labeled cells, in comparison with unlabeled cells (P&lt;.05). The percentage change of SI (ΔSI) was significantly higher in 106 labeled cells after 1-day culture than that in the same number of labeled cells after 8-day culture and that in 5×105 labeled cells, particularly on T2*WI (P&lt;.05). Among pulse sequences, T2*WI demonstrated the highest ΔSI (P&lt;.05).
sion
man umbilical cord blood MSCs can be labeled with Fe2O3-PLL without significant change in viability and apoptosis. The suspension of labeled MSCs can be imaged with standard 1.5-T MR equipment.

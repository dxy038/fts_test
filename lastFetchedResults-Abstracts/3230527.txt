Voltage Stability has become an important issue in both planning and opearation of power systems. Contingencies such as unexpected line outages may often result in voltage instability which may lead to voltage collapse. This work presents the application of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) technique to find the optimal location of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device with the objective of minimizing operating cost of the system , installation of FACTS device and to improve the voltage stability of the system. The location and sizing of FACTS controllers for voltage stability enhancement is an important consideration for practical power systems. The placement methodology considers simulataneously the cost of generated active and reactive powers and cost of selected FACTS for a range of operating conditions. FACTS devices -Static VAR Compensator (SVC) is considered. The optimizations are performed on the parameters namely the location of FACTS devices are done by modal analysis and sizing and installation cost of FACTS devices are determined by the proposed algorithm. The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and NSGA-II based optimization procedure are employed to solve the allocation task. Simulations are performed on IEEE-30 bus test system.

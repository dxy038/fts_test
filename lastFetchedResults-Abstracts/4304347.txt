Automotive manufacturers are increasingly looking to hybrid vehicle designs to meet customer demands for more efficient vehicles. The increased efficiency of the hybrid architectures comes at the expense of increased system complexity. The field of automotive diagnostics for conventional vehicles is now well developed but diagnosing complex problems of system interactions is a new challenge for hybrid vehicle designers. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a motion control detection algorithm and explore the appropriate vehicle responses to the detected condition.

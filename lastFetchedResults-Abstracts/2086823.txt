Several process-based models for simulating the growth of perennial grasses have been developed but few include the simulation of regrowth. The model CATIMO simulates the primary growth of timothy (Phleum pratense L.), an important perennial forage grass species in northern regions of Europe and North America. Our objective was to further develop the model CATIMO to simulate timothy regrowth using the concept of reserve-dependent growth. The performance of this modified CATIMO model in simulating leaf area index (LAI), biomass dry matter (DM) yield, and N uptake of regrowth was assessed with data from four independent field experiments in Norway, Finland, and western and eastern Canada using an approach that combines graphical comparison and statistical analysis. Biomass DM yield and N uptake of regrowth were predicted at the same accuracy as primary growth with linear regression coefficients of determination between measured and simulated values greater than 0.79, model simulation efficiencies greater than 0.78, and normalized root mean square errors (14–30% for biomass and 24–34% for N uptake) comparable with the coefficients of variation of measured data (1–21% for biomass and 1–25% for N uptake). The model satisfactorily simulated the regrowth LAI but only up to a value of about 4.0. The modified CATIMO model with its capacity to simulate regrowth provides a framework to simulate perennial grasses with multiple harvests, and to explore management options for sustainable grass production under different environmental conditions.

Facility location problems are important and applied topic in decision making problems with different effective factors are useful in their analysis. Costs and efficiency of system are the most important criteria in decision making. Considering these criteria in facility location models simultaneously, help decision makers to obtain more insight in analysis of the problem and finding results which cannot be achieved by other methods. In this study, the concept of efficiency using data envelopment analysis is utilized simultaneously with uncapacitated single-source multi-product facility location problem and a bi-objective mixed binary linear program is proposed for it. Then an LP-metric approach is used to solve it. Optimal solution of the model gives the optimum and efficient location-allocation pattern. Finally, a numerical example is presented to describe the impact of the new modeling.

Along with the development and utilization of wireless applications, multi-channel mobile work is becoming more and more common in the business world. Based on the dynamically changing context of mobile workers, they can choose different channels to interact with relevant information systems. Thus, the mobile workers have huge demands for better multi-channel support model on a variety of mobile computing devices. This paper presents a multi-channel support framework for supporting mobile workers in mobile working settings. The primary characteristic of this framework is that the user can interact with the server during execution. The core component, the multi-channel decision maker, in the framework can be conceived as a medium to understand the relevant input parameters with the objective of generating best output solution on the computing device of mobile workers. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the applicability of the multi-channel support framework, we use an exemplar case in the field of scientific conference management.

This paper presents the development of a hybrid optimization model to minimize active losses in distribution systems through capacitor placement and sizing. The proposed model uses relaxed objective values obtained by a continuous non-linear optimization of the discrete variables as a base of comparison to the Ant Colony optimization model. The objective is to evaluate the model ability to present good solutions with a reduced number of individuals in the search process. A brief result is presented, demonstrating the gain of the proposed methodology when compared to other studies.

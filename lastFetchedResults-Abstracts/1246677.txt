The use of mole drainage techniques for the improvement of clay soil sports surfaces has been limited by concerns over drainage-channel longevity and surface disruption. A review of the engineering of agricultural mole drainage machinery and practice was conducted with the objective of identifying key design and operation factors to maximise drain lifespan and performance, whilst minimising surface disturbance in the mole drainage of sports surfaces. An outline design for a reduced draught force, floating beam, grade-controlled, sports surface mole plough was proposed. Key operating parameters included soil suitability, operation timing, working depth, drain spacing and post-installation management.

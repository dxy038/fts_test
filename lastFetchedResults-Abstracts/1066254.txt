Background and objective: nickel is one of the most important pollutants resulting from various industries such as electroplating and battery-making that its presence in the environment is risky. The study is focused on the removal of nickel using advanced oxidation in the presence of the nanoparticles of the Zirconia, silica and hydrogen peroxide from the aqueous solutions. 
Material & Methods: After the construction of the pilot, effectiveness of processes of UV/H2O2/UV/H2O2 and ZrO2/SiO2 in removal of the nickel from the aqueous environments was studied. The variables such as the radiation time, the pH, a concentration of the nickel, and the dosage of hydrogen peroxide nanoparticles were studied. After determining optimum conditions, tests also were followed on the real waste.
Results: with increasing contact time and the amount of nanoparticles, efficiency of processes was increased. Adding hydrogen peroxide up to the amount of value of 0.6 ml improved the efficiency of the UV/H2O2/UV/H2O2 and ZrO2/SiO2 processes in the removal nickel, respectively 72.2% and 90.8%; it decreased values in excess of the foregoing process efficiency to 0.6 ml, respectively 41% and 55%. The optimum pH value was determined for both processes as 8. The maximum amount of efficiency of Nickel removal from the actual sewage by processes of UV/H2O2/UV/H2O2 and ZrO2/SiO2 was 69% and 60.6, respectively.
Conclusions: the results showed that the UV/H2O2/UV/H2O2 and ZrO2/SiO2 process can be effectively used to remove the nickel from the aqueous environments.

An Expert algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique with adaptive PSO parameters has been developed for power flow analysis under critical conditions and multiple power flow solutions. Depending on the objective functions of the current and best solutions in the present generation, unique and innovative formulas are designed for two sets of PSO parameters, inertia weight and learning factors. For faster, sure convergence and overcome the limitations of conventional methods, PSO parameters are so designed that they are highly adaptive. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report of applying Adaptive PSO (APSO) to solve power flow problems. Multiple power flow solutions which are used for voltage stability analysis can be obtained if proposed method is used with local search as accelerating technique. The proposed algorithm proves its robustness providing reliable and better convergence under high R/X ratios and maximum loadability limits. The effectiveness and efficiency has been established showing results for standard and ill-conditioned test systems.

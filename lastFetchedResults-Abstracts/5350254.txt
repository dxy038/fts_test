In this paper, we analyze bidirectional Downstream and Upstream amplification for gain transient mitigation in Remote Erbium Doped Fibre Amplifiers. Amplifying a Continuous Downstream and a burst mode Upstream data traffic in the same remotely pumped Erbium Doped Fibre Amplifier, a reduction of the overshoot and BER penalty have been experimentally measured for different packet lengths. In addition, gain transient time constants have been measured.

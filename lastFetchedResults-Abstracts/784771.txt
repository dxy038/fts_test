Objective: The aim was to study the effect of individualised meals on nutritional status among
older people living in municipal residential homes and to compare the results with a control group. An
additional aim was to estimate direct health care costs for both groups. Setting: Six different municipal
residential homes in the south-east of Sweden. Participants: Older people living in three residential homes
constituted the intervention group n=42 and the rest constituted the control group n=67. Intervention: A
multifaceted intervention design was used. Based on an interview with staff a tailored education programme
about nutritional care, including both theoretical and practical issues, was carried through to staff in the
intervention group. Nutritional status among the elderly was measured by Mini Nutritional Assessment
(MNA), individualised meals were offered to the residents based on the results of the MNA. Staff in the
control group only received education on how to measure MNA and the residents followed the usual meal
routines. Measurements: Nutritional status was measured by MNA at baseline and after 3 months. Cost data
on health care visits during 2007 were collected from the Cost Per Patient database. Results: Nutritional
status improved and body weight increased after 3 months in the intervention group. Thus, primary health
care costs constituted about 80% of the total median cost in the intervention group and about 55% in the
control group. Conclusion: With improved knowledge the staff could offer the elderly more individualised
meals. One of their future challenges is to recognise and assess nutritional status among this group. If
malnutrition could be prevented health care costs should be reduced.

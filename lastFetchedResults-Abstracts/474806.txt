Background
Our objective was to assess time to achieve blood-pressure (BP) goal with incremental doses of valsartan alone, and together with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.
Methods
This analysis pooled patient-level data from nine randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trials (N = 4278) of once-daily valsartan 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg, and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 80/12.5 mg, 160/12.5 mg, 160/25 mg, 320/12.5 mg, and 320/25 mg. Kaplan-Meier methods estimated the cumulative proportion of patients achieving BP <140/90 mm Hg over 8 weeks and the median time to BP goal. The HCTZ 12.5-mg and 25-mg doses were pooled for the time-to-goal analysis in patients receiving combinations with valsartan 160 mg or 320 mg.
Results
Overall, the median time-to-goal was 8.1 weeks with valsartan 160 mg, 6.1 weeks with valsartan 320 mg, 2.6 weeks with valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ, and 2.1 weeks with valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ. In patients with stage 2 hypertension, the median time-to-goal was 4.3 weeks with valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ and 2.4 weeks with valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ. Goal rates by Week 4 for valsartan/HCTZ exceeded rates by Week 8 with the same doses of valsartan alone. Overall, the proportion that achieved BP goal by Week 8 was 32.6% with valsartan 80 mg, 48.4% with valsartan 160 mg, 54.2% with valsartan 320 mg, 74.6% with valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ, and 84.8% with valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ, versus 24.2% with placebo. With valsartan 320 mg/HCTZ, 75.8% of stage 2 patients and 94% of stage 1 patients reached BP goal by Week 8. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were generally low across doses.
Conclusions
In both stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension, BP control is achieved more frequently and promptly when patients receive higher doses of valsartan monotherapy or valsartan combination therapy, with a favorable benefit-risk profile.

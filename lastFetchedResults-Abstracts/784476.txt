Objective: Since the number of older people is rising worldwide, there is an increasing need for a
structured and integrated approach for the participation of the older person in clinical research. The introduction
of a ‘Geriatric Minimum Data Set’ (GMDS) will allow a standardized description of the older person
participating in clinical research. ICF, a universal tool for the comprehensive description of human functioning,
developed by the World Health Organisation, can make a substantial contribution to the development of a
GMDS. It can serve as a ‘framework’, including all the functional characteristics needed in research in
Gerontology and Geriatrics. The objective was to integrate ICF terminology in a recently proposed GMDS-25.
Design: ICF is explored to determine the most relevant ICF-categories for GMDS-25. Results and conclusion:
Several items of the GMDS-25 can be described in terms of ICF. This description contributes to the optimal
standardization of the GMDS-25.

There is warning of a coming epidemic of older people with psychiatric problems. However, there are already too few specialist nurses to ensure that all older people receive care concordant with accepted professional standards. This problem is an obstacle to the World Health Organization health for all by 2000 objective. The Stratified Population at Risk (SPAR) model is a proactive paradigm for planning psychogeriatric nursing services that includes mental health promotion.

The model includes an innovative role for psychogeriatric nurse specialists.

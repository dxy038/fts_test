Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is an integrated business approach to the collaborative creation, management and dissemination of engineering information throughout the extended enterprise. Concretely, PLM enables a supply chain to become much more competitive by an effective collaboration among customers, developers, suppliers and manufacturers at various lifecycle stages of a product. Indeed, integrating logistic constraints in the early stages of product development will avoid additional costs and wasted time caused by a product unsuitable for its supply chain. Our objective is to show the role of PLM in supply chain optimization. This paper proposes a methodology of simultaneous design of the product and its related supply chain based on PLM approach and optimization mathematical models.

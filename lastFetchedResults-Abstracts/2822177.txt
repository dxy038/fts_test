The matrix converter (MC) is direct AC-AC power converter without an intermediate DC link which can offer a number of advantages, including unity input power factor, bidirectional power flow, an improved input current harmonic issue, capable of compact design and high power density without energy storage elements. Above advantages make the matrix converter suitable for aircraft, AC power supply unit and compact motor drives applications. When topology extending to multi-level, the number of redundant switching status and the complexity of switching selection increase greatly. In this paper, a switching calculation &amp; selection methods of multilevel technologies (mainly 5-level) on MC is firstly presented, which can be a theoretical basis to enhance the application of MC family, this paper concentrates on using simulation software to filtrate and classify switching status and developing the concepts of space vector modulation division based on 3-level &amp; 5-level matrix converter. Simulation using Matlab/Simulink is given to demonstrate the theoretical works and the experimental results from a small scale 3-level experimental prototype are presented to validate the theoretical findings.

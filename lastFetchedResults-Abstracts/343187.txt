The objective of this study is to investigate if 8-methoxy-psoralen (8-MOP) plus ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation (PUVA) induces oxidative DNA damage. When calf thymus DNA was incubated with 8-MOP and irradiated with UVA (335–400 nm), the level of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was substantially increased by approximately 6-fold. Formation of 8-OHdG proportionally correlated with both UVA fluence and 8-MOP concentrations. Human epidermoid carcinoma cells were incubated with 10 μg 8-MOP per milliliter, followed by irradiation of 25 kJ/m2 UVA. The level of 8-OHdG increased by nearly 3-fold in PUVA-treated cells compared to 8-MOP and UVA controls. The formation of 8-OHdG correlated with DNA fragmentation as determined by spectrofluorometry. To investigate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in PUVA-induced oxidative DNA damage, less or more specific ROS quenchers were added to DNA solution prior to PUVA treatment. The results showed that only sodium azide and genistein significantly quenched PUVA-induced 8-OHdG, whereas catalase, superoxide dismutase, and mannitol exhibited no effect. The quencher study with cultured cells indicated that N-acetyl-cysteine and genistein protected oxidative DNA damage as well as DNA fragmentation by PUVA treatment. Our studies show that PUVA treatment is able to induce the formation of 8-OHdG in purified DNA and cultured cells and suggest that singlet oxygen is the principle reactive oxygen species involved in oxidative DNA damage by PUVA treatment.

Abstract- This work studies the prefilter bandwidth effects on the symbol synchronizer based on clock sampling.The prefilter bandwidth B is changed between three values, namely B1=&#8226; (infinite), B2=2.tx and B3=1.tx, where tx is the transmission rate.We use also the sequential symbol synchronizer based on clock sampling, with the variant discrete and continuous. Each variant has two versions which are the manual and the automatic.The objective is to study the prefilter bandwidth with the four symbol synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).

Indoor environment is the main concerns of the occupants of a building. A good working environment will help to provide the user with a good sense of well-being, inspiration and comfort. Therefore, accurate mathematic model of indoor environment analysis is important for predicting, evaluating the degree of indoor environment. In order to make an accurate and objective assessment for indoor environment, a new evaluation index system by analyzing factors of indoor environment (thermal environment, light environment, sound environment and air quality) has been set up in this paper. Meantime, the evaluation matter-element model of indoor environment by introducing extensional theory and develops extensional evaluation method with relative functions has been established. The evaluation result was validated by the results of subjective feeling experiment and grey theory method. The analyzing result can provide references for improving indoor environment.

During bacterial-mediated diseases, neutrophils (PMNs) play a critical role in defending the host against invading pathogens. PMN production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to the bactericidal capabilities of these cells. ROS are produced intracellularly and can be released extracellularly. The aberrant extracellular release of ROS, however, has been reported to induce injury to host tissues during mastitis and other inflammatory-mediated diseases of cattle. The acute phase response, which occurs shortly after infection or tissue injury, is characterized by the induction of a large number of plasma proteins referred to as acute phase proteins (APP). Î±1-Acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an APP that increases in response to infection or injury in cattle and humans. The precise function of AGP is unknown, but it has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of bovine AGP on PMN pro-inflammatory responses, including respiratory burst activity and cytokine production. Bovine AGP dose-dependently inhibited zymosan-induced PMN extracellular release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide without affecting the capacity of PMN to engulf and kill Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, AGP exerted its effect on ROS production regardless of whether PMNs were exposed to AGP prior to or after activation. In contrast to respiratory burst activity, AGP enhanced PMN production of IL-8. The precise mechanism by which AGP regulates PMN functions remains unknown, but data presented in this study suggest that AGP may have a complex role by differentially regulating PMN pro-inflammatory activities.

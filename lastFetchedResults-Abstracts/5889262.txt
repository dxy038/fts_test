In this paper, problems related to the design of observer based fault detection systems for the purpose of detecting multiplicative faults in linear uncertain systems are studied. The design objective is formulated as minimizing the missed detection rate for a given false alarm rate. It is shown that the main design problems consist in establishing an adaptive threshold and maximizing the set of detectable faults. With the aid of different optimization techniques, an approach is proposed to solve these problems.

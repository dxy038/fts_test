The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a lateral meniscus allograft on the articular contact area and pressures across the glenohumeral joint under compressive loads of 220 N and 440 N. Eight fresh-frozen shoulders were used, and contact areas and pressures were determined with a Tekscan flexible tactile force sensor. Testing conditions included a normal glenohumeral joint and one interposed with a lateral meniscus allograft. Using the Tekscan sensing equipment, we evaluated the total force (in Newtons), contact area (in square millimeters), mean contact pressure (in kilograms per square centimeter), peak force (in Newtons), and peak contact pressure (in kilograms per square centimeter). The interposed lateral meniscus allograft group showed a statistically significant decrease in total force at both 220 N and 440 N, as well as a decrease in contact area for the 220-N testing condition. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in contact area at 440 N or in peak forces or peak contact areas for either 220-N or 440-N testing condition. Biomechanically biologic resurfacing with a lateral meniscus allograft of the glenohumeral joint is supported by decreased forces on the glenoid surface.

AbstractObjective
in aim of this article was to develop different visual criteria allowing for an objective definition of hypercementosis (cementum hyperplasia). This preliminary study must notably show how to better understand at a later stage the significance of its frequency as well as its aetiologies, especially in past populations.
als and methods
 up a study protocol (macroscopic and photographic observations) on material consisting of 2 medieval samples from France (1) Sains-en-Gohelle sample-SG (AD 7th–17th century; 407 individuals; 5756 teeth observed, 319 with hypercementosis) which was used to develop the different criteria for defining hypercementosis (2) Jau-Dignac-et-Loirac sample-JDL (AD 7th-8th century; 55 individuals; 709 teeth observed, 24 with hypercementosis) which was used to test the reproducibility of the criteria.
s
ur observations we formulated different inclusion criteria with which to define hypercementosis objectively (k intraobserver ≥ 0.96; k interobserver ≥ 0.63). We were able to distinguish moderate (1m) and marked (1M) forms of diffuse hypercementosis, focal hypercementosis in the form of small knots (2m) or large nodules (2M), or excrescences in the form of ridges (3m) or spurs (3M). Different exclusion criteria were also determined.
sion
finition that we propose in this study are based on various statistically validated inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is hoped that this will improve the significance of hypercementosis. More generally, this would also give a better understanding of the dynamics of cementum apposition.

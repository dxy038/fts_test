In this paper, we propose a cell design model with the objective of maximizing the total parts flow within cells considering the data of process plans for parts, production volume, and cell size. A relationship between machines is calculated on the basis of the process plans for parts obtained from process plan sheets. Then the machines are classified into machine cells using the relationship. The model is formulated as a 0â€“1 integer programming and a genetic algorithm approach is developed to solve the model. The proposed approach is tested and proved using actual industrial data. The approach provide a best solution constantly, also its procedure is extremely efficient and flexible for solving large problems for cell design.

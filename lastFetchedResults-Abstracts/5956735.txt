But some poorly- or non-biodegradable organic compounds cannot be degraded through these traditional treatment methods. The objective of this study is to investigate the chemical oxygen demand (COD) degradation kinetics of the paper mill effluent when the effluent was treated by single ozonation and catalytic ozonation with activated carbon (AC), TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Results show that COD<sub>cr</sub> degradation process of the paper mill effluent studied in this paper with single ozonation and catalytic ozonation should follow apparent second-order kinetics, and catalytic ozonation with AC, TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> effectively enhances the reaction rate constant of COD<sub>cr</sub> degradation of the effluent, compared with single ozonation. The COD<sub>cr</sub>. removal rate and reaction rate constant by single ozonation are 34% and 1.21698&#215;10<sup>-4</sup> (mg/L)<sup>-1</sup>&#183;min<sup>-1</sup> and COD<sub>cr</sub> removal rates and reaction rate constants increase to 35-55% and 1.27775-2.64412&#215;10<sup>-4</sup> (mg/L)<sup>-1</sup>&#183;min<sup>-1</sup> by catalytic ozonation with AC, TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> respect- vely. It is also found that the content of TiO<sub>2</sub> loaded on AC or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has important effect on the enhancement of COD<sub>cr</sub> removal rate and reaction rate constant of the paper mill effluent investigated in this study in the process of ozonation and catalytic ozonation.

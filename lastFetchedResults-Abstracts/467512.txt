Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of written educational material about patient satisfaction and decision-making regarding postpartum contraception. Study Design: Baseline patient satisfaction and effectiveness of contraceptive counseling on a postpartum unit was evaluated with the use of a self-administered questionnaire. Data were compared with patients who received additional comprehensive written educational material during their postpartum hospitalization. Results: A total of 109 women participated in the study (control subjects, 53; intervention group, 56). Demographics and patient satisfaction with contraceptive counseling were similar between groups. Thirty-four percent of the control subjects reported having received some sort of written information; all women in the intervention group received a standardized comprehensive booklet of information during their postpartum stay (P< .01). Among the women who received written information, the intervention group was more likely to state that written material contributed to their ultimate choice in birth control (P< .01). Conclusion: The postpartum distribution of written material about contraceptive options increases a woman's ability to make an informed decision regarding birth control.

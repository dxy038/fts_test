This study aims to solve one of the difficult problems about Six Sigma critical techniques - that is how to design tolerance based on life cycle six sigma (LCSS) and concurrent quality engineering. The objective is to improve design quality and reduce cost in the up-front phase of the development cycle. Robust and optimizing methods on the basis of LCSS Methodology are used as the technical foundation of six sigma tolerance design. In this paper, concurrent parameter and tolerance design models are integrated into LCSS methodology to realize the objectives of product robust design and process robust design within life cycle process, in terms of high quality and lower life cycle total cost.

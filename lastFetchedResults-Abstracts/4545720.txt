Super Resolution (SR) image reconstruction is the process of producing a high resolution (HR) image from many low resolution (LR) images. SR image reconstruction can be considered as the second generation restoration technique. In this paper we propose SR image reconstruction from clean, noisy and blurred images using binary plane technique (BPT) encoding and Integer wavelet Transform (IWT). Integer wavelet transform maps an integer data set into another integer data set. Objective and subjective analysis of the reconstructed image has a better super resolution factor and a higher qualitative metrics.

This paper proposes UbiMDR, a MDR (metadata registry)-based framework for supporting semantic consistency in ubiquitous computing environments. The chief objective of the UbiMDR is to let ubiquitous applications consistently and independently use information of sensors in a variety of sensor fields. Currently, applications depend on their sensor field. In other word, an application can utilize just information from a specific sensor field. To overcome this restriction, many issues from a hardware or software view must be resolved. This paper focuses on the consistent semantic management to provide the semantic interoperability between ubiquitous applications under ubiquitous environment consisting of various and different sensor fields. The UbiMDR provides infrastructure support for semantic consistency, sensor field-independent information utilization, and context-rich application development

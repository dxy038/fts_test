This paper presents an optimization model for the problem of expansion planning of distribution electrical energy system: more specifically, for defining the route of feeders. The distribution system is represented by a graph in which the nodes represent demands and sources of energy; the branches represent the possible paths for supply. The model can be used to consider the insertion, removal and/or substitution of power lines of different gauge, with the objective of minimizing network installation and maintenance costs, subject to the limits to capacity of power lines and energy substations, and the maximum and minimum voltage limits specified by the problem. The validity and efficiency of the proposed model are demonstrated by means of two examples of medium-voltage distribution systems.

The objective of this work is to investigate a new approach for object segmentation in videos. While some amount of user interaction is still necessary for most algorithms in this field, these can be reducedmaking use of certain properties of graph-based image segmentation algorithms. Based on one of these algorithms a framework is proposed, that tracks individual foreground objects through arbitrary video sequences and partly automates the necessary corrections required from the user. Experimental results suggest, that the proposed algorithm performs well on both low- and high-resolution video sequences and can even cope with motion blur.

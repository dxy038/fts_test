One of the essential operations in geographic studies of cities is urban growth analysis using spatial-temporal data. Regarding this, the development and horizontal expansion of cities can be measured by the use of statistical indicators. The main objective of this paper is to monitor the urban development for nine districts in Shiraz, between 2006 and 2012, as well as to quantify the degree of freedom of urban development, the degree of excessive horizontal expansion of cities, and the degree of well-being of urban growth. For this purpose, the K-Score Pearson test was used to check the degree of freedom of the city and Shannon Entropy was also used to determine the degree of urban sprawl, and finally the degree of well-being of urban development was investigated. The results showed that the degree of freedom of urban development for the whole city was high. During the period 2009-2012, the observed construction development was less than the expected construction growth. In District 1, the observed growth in urban construction is equal to the expected growth. Considering the whole city, the general Shannon Entropy also shows urban concentration. Finally, the analysis indicates that the development of Shiraz during this period was satisfactory in all regions.

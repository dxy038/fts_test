So, for achieving this purpose, it is necessary that most significant characteristics of asymmetric fighting scene and also prominent capabilities as well as characteristics of U.A.Vs be identified. Given such characteristics and capabilities, the role and important position of U.A.Vs in asymmetric fighting scene would b e shown.
For this end, the theoretical fundamentals with regard to U.A.Vs and features of asymmetric fighting scene have been identified and gathered through documented studies and field survey. Also both variables have been screened at two stages with designing questionnaire and analysing concluded data and mutual impact of them on one another has been analysed by using the views of experts through perceived statistics and concluded results have been introduced.

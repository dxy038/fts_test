The objective of head-disk designers has been-and will continue to be-to increase areal density, volumetric density and ruggedness and to provide improved performance and reliability of hard disk drives. One of the keys to this effort is the substrate which significantly affects flyability and reliability characteristics of the disk and greatly impacts the performance of the magnetic films. This paper explores the substrate properties which most affect performance and compares various substrates in terms of these properties

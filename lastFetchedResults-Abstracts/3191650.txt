Propose a solution containing distributed power distribution network reconfiguration method, the method with the minimum network loss as objective, the capacity to determine the optimum islanding system, and the remaining network reconstruction, to achieve minimum power load and less power loss. According to the reconstruction of the switch impact factor, correction of islanding scheme, thereby obtaining the network optimization. The calculation results show that the method of multiple distributed power distribution network fault recovery correctness.

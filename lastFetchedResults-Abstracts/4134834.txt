A rational model for making engineering tradeoff decisions is presented. The model is a hybrid from the fields of social welfare economics, communications, and operations research. A solution methodology (vector optimization decision convergence algorithm or VODCA) based on the economic model is developed conceptually and mathematically. The objective for developing VODCA was to improve the process for extracting relative value information about the objectives from the appropriate decision makers. This objective was accomplished by employing data filtering to increase the consistency of the relative value information and decrease the amount of information required. VODCA is applied to a simplified hypothetical tradeoff decision problem. Possible uses of multiple objective analysis concepts and the VODCA methodology in product-line development and market research are discussed.

In real world transportation planning decision problems, input data or related parameters are frequently fuzzy owing to incomplete or unobtainable information. This work presents a fuzzy multi-objective linear programming model for solving transportation planning decision problems with multiple fuzzy objectives. This model attempts to minimize simultaneously the total production and transportation costs and the total delivery time with reference to available capacities at each source and forecast demand at each destination. Over all, the proposed model is practically applicable for solving transportation planning decision problems.

Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced endocarditis is a rare entity and should be kept in mind for patients with pneumococal bacterimia. It has a poor prognosis and may lead to surgical interventions in one third of patients. We have presented a case of pneumococcal endocarditis who had pulmonary tuberculosis, as well.
Results: A 27-year old Afghanis patient had referred with the presentation of fever, nausea and vomiting. He had a history of cough and expectoration for one year, exacerbating before hospitalization. Physical exam revealed reduced sound and a coarse crackle on right lower lung. He was hospitalized with the diagnosis of pneumonia. He had developed heart murmur for which he had received therapy. Having performed sputum culture, he was treated for TB, too.
Conclusion: Pneumococcal endocarditis is a rare disease with a poor prognosis, during which heart valves, especially aortic valve, are involved. Complications such as heart failure or aortic insufficiency are common. To achieve treatment, penicillin and a third generation cephalosporine is indicated.

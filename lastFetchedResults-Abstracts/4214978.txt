The objective of this paper was to validate the feasibility of auto-tuning WCDMA cell uplink load level targets based on quality of service. The uplink cell load level was measured with received wideband total power. The quality indicators used were called blocking probability, packet queuing probability and degraded block error ratio probability. The objective was to improve performance and operability of the network with control software aiming for a specific quality of service. The load level targets in each cell were regularly adjusted with a control method in order to improve performance. The approach was validated using a dynamic WCDMA system simulator. The conducted simulations support the assumption that the uplink performance can be managed and improved by the proposed cell-based automated optimization.

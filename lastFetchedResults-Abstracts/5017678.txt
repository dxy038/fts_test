This paper presents the overall goals and strategies of the EXaMINE project funded by the European Union (IST 2000 26116). The general objective of the project is to design, prototype and test novel monitoring systems supporting the control centers of the European power system in order to adapt and enhance their security control functions, thus allowing them to collectively meet the challenges of operating the European grid in a safe and reliable fashion, under increased interregional power transfers. The project considers security control in terms of its two complementary modes, namely preventive control and emergency control. Both aspects are tackled by using the latest developments in information technology in order to improve the quality of the information used for security monitoring and control. Field tests will be done with the cooperation of the System Operators that support the project. The EXaMINE project started in early 2001 and is scheduled to complete in August 2003.

The objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of TBP on the system D2EHPA/kerosense/M2+ with respect to the extraction of some transitional metals. Although the presence of M2EHPA as an impurity in D2EHPA shifts the extraction curves to lower pH, empirical results show that the extraction curves shift to the right due to the addition of TBP and the counterbalance effect of M2EHPA. The results indicate that the equivalent concentration of D2EHPA decreases as a function of concentration of TBP because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between TBP and D2EHPA. Based on this finding, the D2EHPA equivalent concentration was determined by using a modifying factor for TBP during the extraction of Zn, Cd, Mn, Cu, Co and Ni. To study the effect of TBP on the effective reduction of D2EHPA concentration, the values of this factor were estimated by applying a curve-fitting method.

WDM-PON with enormous bandwidth and low energy consumption has been considered to construct green optical access network. In this paper, we introduce the architecture of green WDM-PON and present its operation principles and performance characteristics. The architecture of bidirectional high speed green WDM-PON based on circulator and MUX/DEMUX is proposed. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of a 2 &#215; 10 Gb/s bidirectional green WDM-PON applying the proposed architecture. Moreover, the effect of four-wave mixing on the performance of green WDM-PON is investigated.

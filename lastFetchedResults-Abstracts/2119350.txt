Background : Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Conditions of oxidative stress and antioxidant imbalance plays a major role in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as an index of lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)  after consumption of atorvastatin in coronary artery stenosis patients.
Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 75 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery stenosis. The patients with coronary artery stenosis were divided into the following 3 groups according to consumption duration of atorvastatin: 25 patients were classified statins consume less than 6 days, 27 patients taking statins for 6 to 90 days, and 23 patients taking statins for more than 90 days. The levels of  serum MDA and  TAC were measured by thiobarbituric acid and Benzie methods, respectively.
Results: The serum TAC concentrations of  patients taking statins for more than 90 days(0.83 ± 0.101 mmol/l) were significantly increased (p=0.001) compared with patients that  atorvastatin consume less than 6 days (0. 686 ± 0.076 mmol/l) while the levels of MDA decreased significantly (p < 0.029), 0.472 ± 0.112 µmol/l and 0.73 ± 0.43 µmol/l, respectively.
Conclusion: In conclusion, results indicate that a significant reduction of plasma MDA levels as well as a significant  enhancement of TAC  in   coronary artery stenosis patients with long time  receiving atorvastatin contribute to the lowering  oxidative stress in this patients.

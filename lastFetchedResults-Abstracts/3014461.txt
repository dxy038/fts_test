This paper studies the posture control problem of a 2-link free flying acrobot with nonzero initial angular momentum. The control objective is to design the control law in consideration of the dynamics of the robot such that the robot can pass through a desired posture at a given time. To this end, first, this paper constructs a system in strict feedback form by applying a coordinate transformation, and formulates the posture control problem as that of designing a control law such that the states of the system can be driven to the origin at the given time. Next, this paper proposes a control scheme which globally stabilizes the origin of the system. Since the states of the system can be driven near to origin at the given time, the control objective is approximately achieved. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to validate the proposed theoretical results.

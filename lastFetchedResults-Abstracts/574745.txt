Introduction & Objective: Determination of free silica for calculate threshold limit value is necessary . The purpose of this research is study of free silica in particulate emission in ambient air of stone crushing workshops  in Azandarian area.
Materials & Methods: 40 samples of respirable dust of workplace air were obtained in breating zone of workers in different job stations. Samples were taken with personal samples pumps attach to cyclones and analysed by a gravitmetric methods and X â€“Ray Diffraction.  
Results: The results were showed that mean concentration of respirable dust and quartz  in  workshops (type 2) is equal 1.17-1.24  mg/m3 and 0.94-1.03 mg/m3 respectively And also in workshops (type 1) is equal 0.81-1.07mg/m3 and  0.79-1.05 mg/m3 respectively. Free silica rate in ambient air of workshops type1 and type2 is  97.5% and 81.3% respectively . Difference of free silica rate in two type of workshops is statistically significant (Pvalue=0.0001). 
Conclusion: The comparison of time weighted average of respirable dust concentration with threshold limit value were showed concentration of respirable particles is less than threshold limit value.

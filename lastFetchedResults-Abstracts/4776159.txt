This paper describes several control strategies to utilise a modern battery energy storage system (BESS) to provide simultaneous control of both its MW and MVAr outputs to improve power system operation and control with the following objective in mind: ability to absorb harmonics, provide load leveling, provide damping of inter-area oscillations, help in damping transient stability, provide effective and fast control power flow along a transmission line corridor, in many ways acting like flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices, provide back-up electricity supply on loss of AC supply very similar to UPS applications and provide active power filtering to meet power quality standards. This work shows that BESS offers an important resource for improving power system control

The present study was designed to examine construct validity of two identity status measures, the Ego Identity Process Questionnaire (EIPQ; J. Adolescence 18 (1995) 179) and the Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status II (EOM-EIS-II; J. Adolescent Res. 1 (1986) 183). Construct validity was operationalized in terms of how identity status classifications generated by the EIPQ and EOM-EIS related to a measure of psychological agency, the Multi-Measure Agentic Personality Scale (MAPS; J. Adolescence 20 (1997) 421). Results indicated that, for the most part, the agentic personality scales differentiated the EIPQ diffused and moratorium statuses from the foreclosed and achieved statuses, whereas the agentic personality scales differentiated the EOM-EIS-II achieved status from the other three statuses. The EIPQ is recommended as the preferred instrument for making contrasts between or among identity statuses, whereas the EOM-EIS-II is recommended when the objective is to consider continuous measures of the identity statuses.

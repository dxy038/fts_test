In this paper, hybrid tabu search and simulated annealing (TSSA) with search space managing methods are proposed to determine the optimal number and allocation of unified power flow controller (UPFC) to enhance power transfer capability of power transactions between generators and loads in power systems. Particular optimal allocation includes optimal locations and parameter settings. The objective function is formulated as maximizing total transfer capability (TTC). Power transfer capability determinations are calculated based on the optimal power flow (OPF) technique. Split and non-split search space managing methods are used to improve the solution searching capability. Test results on IEEE 118-bus system show that the proposed hybrid TSSA with optimal number of UPFC criteria and the split search space managing method give higher than those from non-split search space method.

Background
Early tracheostomy has been shown to be beneficial after trauma; however, there are few objective data to identify early in the recovery period which patients will ultimately require tracheostomy after blunt head trauma.
Methods

The charts of all patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit intubated at a level 1 urban trauma center, over a 5-year period with a primary admission diagnosis of blunt head trauma were retrospectively reviewed.
Results

Sixty-four patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: those extubated and those that required tracheostomy. By day 3 the Glasgow Coma Scores for the two groups were significantly different and on day 4 the Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) Scores were significantly different.
Conclusions

Calculating objective scores such as GCS and SAPS can aid in identifying those patients who will ultimately require a tracheostomy for prolonged airway protection after blunt head trauma with high positive predictive value.

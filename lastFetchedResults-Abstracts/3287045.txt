Active Voltage Control (AVC) is an implementation of classic Proportional-Derivative (PD) control and multi-loop feedback control to force IGBT to follow a pre-set switching trajectory. The initial objective of AVC was mainly to synchronise the switching of IGBTs connected in series so as to realise voltage balancing between devices. For a single IGBT switching, the AVC reference needs further optimisation. Thus, a predictive manner of AVC reference generation is required to cope with the nonlinear IGBT switching parameters while performing low loss switching. In this paper, an improved AVC structure is adopted along with a revised reference which accommodates the IGBT nonlinearity during switching and is predictive based on current being switched. Experimental and simulation results show that close control of a single IGBT switching is realised. It is concluded that good performance can be obtained, but the proposed method needs careful stability analysis for parameter choice.

This paper presents a new methodology for maintenance scheduling that takes into account inter-area transfer limitations and stochastic reliability constraints. The optimization model is based on the Benders decomposition technique. The objective of this model is to determine a minimum cost maintenance schedule, subject to technological and system reliability constraints. The model may also be used to assess the adequacy of existing transmission limits under a given set of planned outages of generating units. Case studies with a realistic three-area power system are presented and discussed

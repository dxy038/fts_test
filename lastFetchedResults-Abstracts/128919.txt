Background: Studies have shown that G6PD deficiency results in indirect hyperbilirubinemia in newborns.
Objective: Determining the relationship between G6PD deficiency and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
Methods: Through a case-control study, 200 neonates with indirect hyperbilirubinemia were equally divided into two case and control groups and examined for G6PD deficiency using a commercial G6PD kit and a fluorometric analysis. The data were further analyzed statistically. Findings: Results showed that out of 200 neonates, 24 had G6PD deficiency (l0 in case group and 14 in control group). There was no statistically significant difference between two groups. Conclusion: Since the prevalence of G6PD deficiency among nonicteric group (control group) was higher than the icteric group (case group), it seems that the performance of a screening test to measure the G6PD activity in all neonates to be useful.

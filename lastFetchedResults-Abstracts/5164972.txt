Hence the sequence of activities occurring according to a preplanned schedule is of utmost importance. Since there is a very big tendency of IT project failure, it is important to identify and follow the main success factors of projects, and concentrate on these with the vision of completing the project in a timely, cost effective manner which meets the stakeholder expectations. Hence the main objective of this paper is to identify and rate the main project success and failure factors, which in turn would be a list of guide lines for project managers to follow in future IT related projects.

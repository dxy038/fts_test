We observed spatial addressing of light by bidirectional spatial emission of beams at a quadratically nonlinear interface in periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides. The interface consisted of the boundary between two quasi-phase-matched regions with different poling period. We show the intensity and phase-mismatch (temperature or wavelength) dependence of the phenomena.

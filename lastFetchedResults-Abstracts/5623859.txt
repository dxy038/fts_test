It is introduced that chlorogenic acid is extracted from the rattan of honeysuckle by using 57 KHz ultrasonic energy to ldquobreak up the cell wallrdquo and 20 KHz ultrasonic energy to produce ldquocavitationrdquo. And the development of the device, which is called double frequency ultrasonic and bidirectional turbulent extracting device, is introduced in the paper. It is indicated that the ultrasonic technique is three times as fast as the hot reflux method, which makes the ultrasonic technique to be of actual significance for extraction from root and stem of plant medicine.

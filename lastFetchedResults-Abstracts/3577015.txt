Measurements are presented of the frequency dependence of Rayleigh scattering in a bidirectional optical system at 0.83 and 1.3 &#194;&#191;m. The results are compared with a theoretical model. The functional forms of the frequency dependencies at both wavelengths are in good agreement with theory; however, the absolute magnitudes of the Rayleigh back-scattered light levels are lower than predicted.

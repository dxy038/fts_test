The objective of this research work is to develop an electrochemical process to deposit polycrystalline copper iron oxide (CuFe2O4) films on different conducting substrates at room temperature (27Â°C). Cathodic Electrodeposition of CuFe2 was carried out on various conducting substrates in galvanostatic mode. The composition of alloy was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) technique. The electrodeposited CuFe2 alloy films were electrochemically oxidized (anodized) in aqueous KOH electrolyte at room temperature. The structural studies of oxide films were carried out using X-ray diffraction and IR absorption techniques. For surface morphological studies, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were used.

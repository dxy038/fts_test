Image segmentation plays a preliminary and indispensable step in medical image processing. Image segmentation plays a crucial role in many medical imaging applications. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called image Filtering spatial Kernel Fuzzy C-Means(FKFCM) for fuzzy segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)data. The algorithm is realized by modifying the objective function in the conventional Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm using a kernel-induced distance metric, a spatial penalty on the membership functions and then using the image filtering method to correct the image. The algorithm results are compared with standard FCM, Kerneled Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) and Spatial Fuzzy C-Means(SFCM). The performance of the proposed segmentation algorithm FKFCM provides satisfactory results compared with other algorithms.

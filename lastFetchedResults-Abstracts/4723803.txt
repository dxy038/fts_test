Aside the e-learning tools, softwareÂ´s, platforms or frameworks, educational organizations provide to their students and staff a variety of digital services through their web portals or cyber infrastructure. Measuring its global usage would be firstly a benefit for policy makers to make decision on objective data, but would provide also useful information to guide on web services tools customization, maintenance or development strategy. We present a non-intrusive, open-source and extensible technical solution that can provide usage indicators on a majority of web digital service environment. The tool can be settled up recursively up in order to provide local, regional or national usage indicators. We will show how the system opens the way to targeted behavioral studies in the context of a performative quality approach of digital services provided by educational organizations and can be mapped to e-learning performance analysis. The examples of indicators creation will be taken from real situations, that is to say in the context of higher education in France.

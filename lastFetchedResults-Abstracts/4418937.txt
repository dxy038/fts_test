Infrared remote sensing image has poor contrast and lower SNR so that real-time and robustness are not superior in image registration. In order to solve it, a novel registration based on Multi-scale feature extraction is proposed in this paper. This algorithm is designed in two aspects. Firstly, Gaussian convolution template size adjusts adaptively with the increasing of scale factors. Then the Multi-space is reconstructed. Secondly, feature points bidirectional matching based on the City-block distance is introduced into image registration. So the real-time performance and robustness are enhanced further. Finally, the experimental results showed that by this improved algorithm the infrared remote sensing images are registered more quickly and accurately than by traditional SIFT algorithm.

The objective of this study was to investigate antioxidant activities and anthocyanin profiles in the fruits of Liriope platyphylla, where these are considered functional substances in Korea. The acidic methanol extract of this species exhibited potent antioxidant activities, showing 83.9% DPPH scavenging activity and 92.5% ABTS scavenging activity at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Moreover, anthocyanins were identified by reversed-phase C18 column chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, and HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS analysis. Seven anthocyanins were characterised, including delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (1), delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside (2), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (3), petunidin-3-O-glucoside (4), petunidin-3-O-rutinoside (5), malvidin-3-O-glucoside (6), and malvidin-3-O-rutinoside (7). Among these, petunidin-3-O-rutinoside (5) (7302.2 μg/g) and malvidin-3-O-rutinoside (7) (5776.1 μg/g) were the predominant anthocyanins, whereas the least prevalent anthocyanin was found to be cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (3) (64.9 μg/g). Therefore, our results suggest that strong antioxidant activities of the acidic methanol extract of L. platyphylla fruits are correlated with high anthocyanin contents, particularly the petunidin-3-O-rutinoside (5) and malvidin-3-O-rutinoside (7).

A new global optimization algorithm is proposed that solves a class of fractional problems management (P). In order to generate a tighter linear relaxations for each subproblem and to ensure convergence to a global optimum. The proposed global optimization algorithm which connects the branch and bound method with the cutting-plane method successfully is convergent to the global minimum through the successive refinement of the linear relaxation of the feasible region of the objective function and the solutions of a series of linear relaxation problems management. Actually our result is slightly more general.

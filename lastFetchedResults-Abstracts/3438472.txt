The objective of this paper is to propose a simple digital current mode control technique for dc-dc converters. In the proposed current-mode control method, the inductor current is sampled only once in a switching period. A compensating ramp is used in the modulator to determine the switching instant. The slope of the compensating ramp is determined analytically from the steady-state stability condition. The proposed digital current-mode control is not predictive, therefore the trajectory of the inductor current during the switching period is not estimated in this method, and as a result the computational burden on the digital controller is significantly reduced. It therefore effectively increases the maximum switching frequency of the converter when a particular digital signal processor is used to implement the control algorithm. It is shown that the proposed digital method is versatile enough to implement any one of the average, peak, and valley current mode controls by adjustment of the sampling instant of the inductor current with respect to the turn-on instant of the switch. The proposed digital current-mode control algorithm is tested on a 12-V input and 1.5-V, 7-A output buck converter switched at 100kHz and experimental results are presented

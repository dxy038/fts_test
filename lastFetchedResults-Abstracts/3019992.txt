This paper proposes a new approach for computing perceptual distortion for visual signal in order to provide an objective measure for perceptual quality at low bit rate MPEG-4 and H.26L coding in typically mobile multimedia communications. The regions with three major perceptually disturbing artefacts, namely, damaged edge, blockiness and ringing, are detected as the basis of assessment. The correlation of the metric with human perception has been demonstrated with low bit rate (24&#8764;384 Kbps) CIF and QCIF test data.

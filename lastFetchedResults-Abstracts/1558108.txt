This paper explores scheduling a realistic variant of open shops with parallel machines per working stage. Since real production floors seldom employ a single machine for each operation, the regular open shop problem is very often in practice extended with a set of parallel machines at each stage. The purpose of duplicating machines in parallel is to either eliminate or to reduce the impact of bottleneck stages on the overall shop efficiency. The objective is to find the sequence which minimizes total completion times of jobs. We first formulate the problem as an effective mixed integer linear programming model, and then we employ memetic algorithms to solve the problem. We employ Taguchi method to evaluate the effects of different operators and parameters on the performance of memetic algorithm. To further enhance the memetic algorithm, we hybridize it with a simple form of simulated annealing as its local search engine. To assess the performance of the model and algorithms, we establish two computational experiments. The first one is small-sized instances by which the model and general performance of the algorithms are evaluated. The second one consists of large-sized instances by which we further evaluate the algorithms.

There are often situations when the measurements made by an user are disputed, this underlining violating some standards. Infringing standards have always punishing consequences, therefore many disputes. To avoid or reduce these situations, a mobile platform has been developed, capable to associate basic measurements with some other parameters to better certify the objective character of the findings. In this way, the measurements of electric or non electric parameters are associated with the possibility of strengthening the measurement with a time and location reference. Moreover, itÂ´s possible to print the measurement certificate, giving the measurement an authenticity plus.. The solution was to build a mobile platform, uniting the flexibility of a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) - which is the core of the platform - with the connectivity offered by a microprocessor (sensors: microphone, gas, alcohol and a portable printer). Problems were met connecting the sensors to the microprocessor (in order to cover a reasonable dynamic range) and connecting the printer to the platform. Moreover, some problems involve managing the battery properly, powering this entire platform with the best efficiency.

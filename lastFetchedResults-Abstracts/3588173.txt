The conventional layered-protocol architecture does not provide optimal performance for wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The method of optimization decomposition of the protocol stack can achieve optimal network performance. This method usually results in a clean-slate protocol architecture that is different from the protocol architecture of WMNs. Such a difference actually demonstrates the need for a cross-layer design. Specific features pertaining to WMNs also show the need for cross-layer optimization across different protocol layers. In this paper, motivations for cross-layer design in WMNs are stated first. Moreover, cross-layer optimization schemes and algorithms between different protocol layers are investigated with an objective of shedding light on open research problems and new approaches. Guidelines for carrying out cross-layer design in WMNs are also provided in this paper.

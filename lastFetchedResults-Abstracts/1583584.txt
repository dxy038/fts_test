The objective of this study is to improve the pricing efficiency of wholesale fish markets by applying the framework of the price decision support system (PDSS). The Pu-Shin wholesale fish market, in Taiwan, is a case used to illustrate this procedure. We first established a simulation model for the operation of the Pu-Shin wholesale fish market, including all possible factors that may affect the auction time. Secondly, we setup a regression model for auction pricing and auction time of each section from the results of the model. Using this information, we established a PDSS for the Pu-Shin wholesale fish market to help decision-makers improve pricing functions.

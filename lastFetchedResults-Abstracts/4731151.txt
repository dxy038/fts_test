As evidenced by industrial surveys, stator related failures account for a large percentage of faults in induction machines. The objective of this paper is to provide a survey of existing techniques for detection of stator related faults, which include stator winding turn faults, stator core faults, temperature monitoring and thermal protection, and stator winding insulation testing. The root causes of fault inception, available techniques for detection and recommendations for further research are presented. Although the primary focus is on-line, sensorless methods that use machine voltages and currents to extract fault signatures, off-line techniques such as partial discharge detection are also examined.

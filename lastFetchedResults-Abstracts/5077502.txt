There is an underlying shift in philosophy away from map based controls towards more widespread use of models to represent elements of the engine system. Models have the dual advantage of supporting both control and diagnosis activity in the engine management system. This paper is based on work we have done to build an accurate control development capability using a full phenomenological model of the engine. The result will allow the control development process to proceed significantly further in simulation than if conventional modelling techniques were employed. The consequence is an early reduction in development risk. The CPower environment is developed, which is a combination of the GTPower engine modelling code and the Simulink 2 control simulation package. Our objective in bringing these tools together is to allow controls development to be set in the context of an accurate engine model

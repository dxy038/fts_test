Objective
ans, stimulation of nerves in or around teeth can evoke inhibitory jaw reflexes. Previous studies had suggested that there may be subtle differences in the timings of the responses. The aim of the present study was to investigate this by comparing reflexes evoked by electrical stimulation of a tooth and of the adjacent tissues in individual subjects.

ments were performed on 9 volunteers (3 male, 6 female). EMG recordings were made from the masseter muscle ipsilateral to the stimuli, whilst the subjects maintained a steady level of activity in the muscle. Reflexes were evoked by applying stimuli to an incisor tooth (pulpal stimuli) or across the adjacent alveolar process (transalveolar stimuli), using bipolar electrodes.
s
hibitory responses were evoked in most (8/9) subjects. The first occurred at a shorter latency after transalveolar than after pulpal stimulation (12.3 ± 0.5 ms vs 19.4 ± 1.5 ms; P = 0.0014, paired t-test). For technical reasons, it was not possible to make such comparisons for the second inhibitory responses in all the subjects. In 5 subjects where such a comparison was possible, the mean latency of the transalveolar-evoked response was again shorter than that of the pulpal-evoked response (56.4 ± 2.8 ms and 58.8 ± 5.3 ms, respectively), but this difference was not significant (P = 0.5).
sions
ears that inhibitory jaw reflexes evoked from around the teeth are faster than those from the dental pulp. This observation could be due to differences between the peripheral afferent and/or the central pathways mediating the reflexes.

In mutually-inversistic logic, T denotes truth, F denotes falsity, n denotes "need not determine whether it is true or false". In this paper, the truth values of mutually-inversistic logic are augmented in order to deal with uncertainty. Real numbers in the closed interval [0, 1] are used to represent the degrees of truth of propositions, 1 represents absolute truth, 0 absolute falsity, 0.5 "need not determine whether it is true or false". So, mutually-inversistic logic is a special case of mutually-inversistic logic with uncertainty. The diagram of equi_strength_ofsupport line is used to establish the truth value of fuzzy mutually inverse implicational propositions. In fuzzy logic, is defined as min, v as max, they are insensitive to the changes in parameters. Mutually-inversistic logic with uncertainty is sensitive to the changes in parameters. Fuzzy logic deals with vagueness with subjective method, mutually-inversistic logic with uncertainty deals with vagueness with objective method.

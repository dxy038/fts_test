In this paper a new longitudinal guidance scheme for transportation aircraft has been proposed. The main objective here has been to improve the tracking accuracy performance of the guidance along a desired longitudinal trajectory referenced in a spatial frame. This has led to the development of a new representation of longitudinal flight dynamics where the independent variable is ground distance to a reference point.

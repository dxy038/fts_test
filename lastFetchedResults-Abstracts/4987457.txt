Previous studies have established the significant relationships between knowledge management practices (KMPs) and firm capabilities development (FCD). These relationships, however, could possibly be moderated by knowledge expropriation hazard (KEH) arising from the opportunism of human beings. Based on knowledge management and strategic alliance research, the main objective of this paper is to empirically examine this moderating effect in a supply chain context. The results revealed that KEH significantly affected the relationship between mutual-codification practices (which is a component of KMPs) and FCD, but it did not moderate the relationship between high-interaction practices (which is another component of KMPs) and FCD.

Background and objective: In typical cases, the patient's history and clinical examination make it possible to diagnose ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). But, in many cases a clear clinical picture is not present and OMG diagnosis is very difficult because gold diagnostic standard tests are not available. The diagnostic tests for OMG are usually unable to display a good sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. In this paper, we studied 86 cases submitted for suspected OMG.
Methods: The patients were studied clinically and with various other tests used in OMG diagnosis (SFEMG, repetitive nerve stimulation, Ab anti AChR titration, tensilon test).
Results and conclusion: SFEMG showed the highest sensitivity (100%) while Ab anti AChR showed the highest specificity (100%). To our knowledge this is the largest population of suspected OMG studied using most of the diagnostic parameters, reported in the literature.

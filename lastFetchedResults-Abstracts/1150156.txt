This paper presents hybrid genetic algorithms to optimize the structure of the main parts of hydroelectric sets based on the finite element method. Firstly, the optimal model of the main parts of hydroelectric sets is established including an objective function and some constraint conditions. Afterwards, the stochastic direction method (SDM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) method are applied to solve the optimal model. Comparing the computational results of the two methods, some features of the methods are pointed out. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the above two methods, a new method, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), is presented, and is used to optimize the structure of the main parts of hydroelectric sets. The computational results show the new method can obtain a global solution with a high search speed compared to the other two methods.

Objective The aim of the study was to
test the homogeneity of the association between adverse
parenting and anxiety disorders within these
disorders as well as among six European countries.
Method Based on data from 8,232 respondents (part
II sample) originating from the European study of the
epidemiology of mental disorders (ESEMeD), we
examined the association between three dimensions
of parental rearing (care, overprotection, authoritarianism)
measured by a short form of the parental
bonding instrument (PBI) and anxiety disorders by
computing one logistic regression model per disorder.
Results A similar pattern of recalled parenting
behaviour across the four anxiety disorders assessed
was found, with care and overprotection having the
strongest associations. There were only minor country-
specific variations of this pattern. Conclusion Our
results suggest an association between adverse parenting
and the risk of anxiety disorders in particular
as well as psychiatric disorders in general that is rather
non-disorder specific

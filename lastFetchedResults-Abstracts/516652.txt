Echinacea spp. have been used in traditional medicine for many years.
Recently, many investigations have been done on this plant and they showed that the plant is
an immunostimulant agent. The plant contains different components such as flavonoids,
phenolic compounds and isobutylamides. Phenolicsare one of the most important agents in
immunostimulant effects of the plant; therefore, determination of a method for the best
extraction of these compounds from the plant is important.
Objective: In this research, the effects of solvent, extraction procedure, plant particle size
and plant:solvent ratio on extraction of phenolic compounds of Echinacea purpurea (L.)
Moench have been investigated.
Methods: Different polar and non-polar solvents from hexane to acidic water were used in
order to determine the best solvent for phenolics extraction. Moreoverthe methods of
maceration, sonification, perculation, digestion and continuous extraction (by use of soxhelet
apparatus), different particle sizes of the plant powder and various plant:solvent ratios were
examined as well.
Results: The results showed that the best method for extraction of phenolics is
methanol:water 80:20 as solvent, method of digestion (2h, 50 °C), particle size of 300300 μm for
the plant powder and plant: solvent ratio of 1:200.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that in order to efficient extraction of phenolic compounds
from Echinacea purpurea aerial parts, special condition should be considered.

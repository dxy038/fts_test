Objective
Neurodevelopmental treatments are an advanced therapeutic approach
practiced by experienced occupational therapists for the rehabilitation
of children with cerebral palsy. The primary challenge in children with
cerebral palsy is gross motor dysfunction. We studied the effects of
neurodevelopmental therapy on gross motor function in children with
cerebral palsy.
Materials & Methods
In a quasi-experimental design, 28 children with cerebral palsy were randomly
divided into two groups. Neurodevelopmental therapy was given to a first
group (n=15) with a mean age of 4.9 years; and a second group with a mean
age 4.4 years (n=13) who were the control group. All children were evaluated
with the Gross Motor Function Measure. Treatments were scheduled for three
- one-hour sessions per week for 3 months.
Results
We obtained statistically significant differences in the values between the
baseline and post treatment in two groups. The groups were significantly
different in laying and rolling (P=0.000), sitting (0.002), crawling and kneeling
(0.004), and standing abilities (P=0.005). However, there were no significant
differences in walking, running, and jumping abilities between the two groups
(0.090).
Conclusion
We concluded that the neurodevelopmental treatment improved gross motor
function in children with cerebral palsy in four dimensions (laying and rolling,
sitting, crawling and kneeling, and standing). However, walking, running, and
jumping did not improve significantly.

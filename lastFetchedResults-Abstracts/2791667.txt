This article deals with performance evaluation of the Opus audio codec in a particular implementation. Different packet loss settings are investigated in means of the decoded signal objective quality measures. Packet loss can occur either on the congested wired or on the less reliable radio frequency data connections. Waveform based, spectrum based, as well as perceptual based and composite measures are computed and analyzed. Test results indicated that the packet loss concealment algorithm implemented into the codec behaves differently than expected at certain predicted packet loss values.

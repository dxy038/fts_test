A method for the design of two-channel low-delay QMF banks with equiripple complex reconstruction error is proposed. A weighted objective function in which the reconstruction error is defined in terms of the difference between the frequency response of the filter bank and that of an ideal allpass channel is constructed. Based on this objective function an iterative algorithm is developed which forces the magnitude of the complex reconstruction error to become equiripple. The paper concludes with design examples which illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm and the performance of the filter banks designed

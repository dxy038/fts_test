In this paper, the problem of predicting the quality of MPEG video streams received over a best effort network is studied. The objective of the study is to develop and validate methods to accurately predict the video quality from network level quality of service (QoS) measurements to the application layer QoS. This involves QoS mapping between the various protocol layers as well as accounting for the frame dependencies in the MPEG video compression scheme. The validation is conducted using simulation with real video traces.

Background and Objective: Free radicals cause many diseases in human and their neutralizing by antioxidants reduces risk of cancers. Salvia Officinalis from Lamiaceae family is one of the valuable plants in traditional medicine. The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidative and cytotoxic properties of ethanolic extract of the aerial parts of this plant on human prostate and cervical cancer cells.
Methodology: In this study, in order to evaluate the antioxidative property, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test was used and to investigate the cytotoxic property, PC3 prostate and Hela cervical cancer cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% bovine serum. The extract of Salvia Officinalis leaf powder was obtained through soaking method with 80% alcohol. The toxicity of different concentrations of extracts (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000) on the cultured cells was measured using MTT assay at three times at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Findings: In this investigation, the antioxidative property was inversely related to IC50. The results of MTT test indicated that ethanolic extracts of Salvia Officinalis show highly significant differences at different days. Results: Ethanolic extract of the plant in DPPH method had a very good and the best antioxidative activity, while its cytotoxic property was very poor.

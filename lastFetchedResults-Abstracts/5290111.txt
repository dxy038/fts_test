A system that can accurately point electronic countermeasures (ECM) analysis receivers at an aircraft with a high degree of accuracy, detect and identify noise and deceptive ECM in real-time, control the transmission response of threat simulators to the ECM based on physical and doctrinal rules, and record and document decision events for post mission analysis and replay is described. The RECCE system incorporates these characteristics in a system which can be interfaced to existing range simulators. It is composed of low-cost, yet powerful, technologies such as an uncomplicated high-accuracy tracker/pointer system for analysis receivers, artificial neural systems for real-time ECM analysis, a knowledge-based expert system for tactics control and scenario recording, and a microcomputer-based debriefing system. The RECCE system can lead to objective, measurable, and affordable range ECM training and evaluation using commercial, off-the-shelf technology and previously developed software

In this paper a genetic algorithm based wide area power system stabilizer (PSS) in a multi machine power system for damping of low frequency inter-area oscillations has been presented. The wide area PSS is composed of two stages, the input of one stage is a local signal and the input of other is a global signal. Geometric measure of controllability and observability is used to select the most effective stabilizing signals and location of controller. Tie line active power flow deviation is found to be the most effective input signal. Time domain based objective function is minimized, in which the deviation in the oscillatory rotor speed of generator is involved so that the stability performance of the system is improved. In this work, two area - four machine systems are used as a test system.

The stability of bentonite is of particular interest for containment barriers in nuclear waste disposal facilities. However, very little is known about the stability of montmorillonite (the major component of bentonite) under high-pressure (HP) conditions. The objective of this work is to investigate the stability of montmorillonite under HP conditions, using a sample of bentonite in which the major component is a dioctahedral calcium montmorillonite. This montmorillonite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), specific surface area (SA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). HP experiments up to 7.7 GPa at room temperature (RT) were performed using toroidal chambers (TC). The samples were characterized by XRD after the HP processing. In-situ FTIR analyses were performed in the samples inside a diamond anvil cell (DAC) up to 8 GPa (dispersed in KBr) and up to 13 GPa (pure bentonite). In-situ FTIR measurements inside the DAC showed that montmorillonite was stable despite a reversible deformation in the Siâ€“O bond and did not lose water up to 13 GPa. XRD analysis of the samples processed at 8 GPa at RT inside the TC showed no marked modification in the (001) reflections and b-parameter (060) reflections of montmorillonite induced by high pressure. The obtained results indicated that montmorillonite remained stable under high pressure conditions.

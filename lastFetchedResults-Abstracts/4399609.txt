A study on central processing unit (CPU) was conducted to analyze the thermal performance of heat sink. The purpose is to have the optimal design for heat sink to reduce the thermal problem on CPU. This study explores the used of heat transfer model and particle swarm optimization for heat sink design. The objective function is to maximize heat dissipation of optimal heat sink design. Based on the heat sink application, thickness and the length of fins for plate fin heat sink are considered for optimization. Results on the convergence and optimum value of the fitness function for the optimal heat sink are presented.

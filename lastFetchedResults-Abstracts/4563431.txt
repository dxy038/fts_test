In this paper our purpose is to present the result of a design effort to improve the integrated flight/thrust control system (IFTCS). This was accomplished using LMI-based H<sub>infin</sub> synthesis whereby the typical single input/single output specifications are translated into the weighting functions of an H<sub>infin</sub> output-feedback synthesis problem. Only longitudinal equations of motions are considered. The objective of this design is to maintain the actual angle of attack alpha<sub>d</sub> as the airplane is passing through the ramp where the tracking radar does not work and the guidance signal is terminated. Next, the dynamic tracking and wind attenuation abilities of the system is analyzed. Last, for engineering application, an order-reduction method of the H<sub>infin</sub> controller is also proposed. Simulation results indicate that the system satisfies the design requirements quite well

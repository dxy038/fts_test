The multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) has been applied to optimize the radiation characteristics of a tri-layer rfid microstrip patch antenna in terms of return-loss, input-impedance, bandwidth and the gain. In addition, the MOGA also optimize the size of the each layer substrate. In order to reduce the size of antenna, the Ferrite substrate has been used and the objective is to achieve high permeability and permittivity for antenna miniaturization and impedance matching to free-space. Ultimately, an antenna has been optimized for -38.63 dB of return-loss, and 3.46 dBi of gain, the size of the antenna is 40*30*3.5(mm).

This paper describes the design of joint motion control of humanoid biped robot, based on quantitative feedback theory and multi-objective optimization control. From the practical engineering viewpoint, an improved QFT method is presented and used in the controller design. An application example is described; simulation results of the joint motion control show stability, robustness, and the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

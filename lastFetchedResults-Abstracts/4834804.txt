Urban flood control layout, based on which urban flood control engineering projects are constructed, will be synthetically evaluated taking into consideration the social, political, economic, environmental and technical factors involved in different levels. Furthermore, a hierarchical structure model for urban flood control layout is presented in this paper. Then a grey-AHP model is proposed based on the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and the Grey system theory, by which the layout of multiple-objective programming problem can be simplified into a single-objective problem system. Results from an example demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, which can be widely used in engineering practice of water resources systems.

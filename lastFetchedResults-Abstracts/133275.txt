Objective: Comparison of the protective elicits of ranitidine with sucralfate against aspirin induced gastric mucosal lesions in dog. Design: Experimental study.
Animals: eighteen healthy mongrel dogs.
Procedure: Eighteen dogs were divided into our groups: group1 )aspirin 25 mg: kg even 12 hours- Group 2)aspirin with the above dose and ranitidine 150 mg/dog, every 12 flours. Group3) aspirin with the above dose and sucralfatc 101)0 mg/dog every I 2 (tours. Group 4) no medication. Weekly endoscopic examination was performed on all of the dogs and observed gastric lesions were graded. At the end of Kr' week, the animals were both sacrifificed and their stomachs and duodenums were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically.
Statistical analysis: Kruskall Wallis, manrvitlney and sign tests. Results: Group 2 had lesser mean gastric lesion scores compared with group l in the first and third wecks.Group 2 had milder lessons with group 3 meaningfully only in the first week of study. Conclusion: Ranitidine is effective as a protective measure against gastric lesions induced by short term use of aspirin - But sucralfatc is not effective neither in short term, nor in Fong term following use of aspirin.

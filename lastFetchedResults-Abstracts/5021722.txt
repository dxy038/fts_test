Cloud computing delivers computing as a utility to users worldwide. A consequence of this model is that cloud data centres have high deployment and operational costs, as well as significant carbon footprints for the environment. We need to develop Green Cloud Computing (GCC) solutions that reduce these deployment and operational costs and thus save energy and reduce adverse environmental impacts. In order to achieve this objective, a thorough understanding of the energy consumption patterns in complex Cloud environments is needed. We present a new energy consumption model and associated analysis tool for Cloud computing environments. We measure energy consumption in Cloud environments based on different runtime tasks. Empirical analysis of the correlation of energy consumption and Cloud data and computational tasks, as well as system performance, will be investigated based on our energy consumption model and analysis tool. Our research results can be integrated into Cloud systems to monitor energy consumption and support static or dynamic system-level optimisation.

Receiver sensitivity degradation caused by Rayleigh backscattering and coupler reflections is investigated for bidirectional digital transmission systems. Experimental values for APD receiver sensitivity degradation in a system operating at a bit rate of 10 Mbits/s and at a wavelength of 830 nm were found to be within 2 to 3 dB (optical) of the values predicted by a simple theoretical model.

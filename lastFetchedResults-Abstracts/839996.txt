In this study we consider buckling of columns with variable stiffness, under axially distributed loading varying polynomially. The objective is to obtain closed – form solutions for the buckling load. The problem is posed in inverse setting: determine the column’s stiffness, so that it has the given, polynomial, buckling mode. Four sets of boundary conditions are investigated. Some perplexing results are obtained, namely, that irrespective of boundary conditions, the critical load of the column is the same; this occurs in conjunction with the fact that the obtained distribution for stiffness is different for each set of boundary conditions.

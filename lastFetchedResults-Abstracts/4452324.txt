To meet customerÂ´s continuously increasing expectations with regards to quality, safety and comfort, the complexity of embedded software for automotive electronic control units is growing rapidly. Automotive manufacturers are facing the challenge of shortening the development cycles to bring new models into market faster in order to remain competitive. The main objective of this work is to develop a closed loop system using a vision system for efficient embedded software validation. This paper attempts to show the experiences with and capabilities of these hardware-in-the-loop systems.

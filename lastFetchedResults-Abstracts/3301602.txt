In this paper, performance comparison of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such as modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and improved asynchronous particle swarm optimization (IAPSO) is considered. EAs simulations are carried with minimization of IAE and peak overshoot as objective using one type of stopping criteria, namely, maximum number of iterations. Simulations reveal that all the two algorithms considered are suitable for off-line tuning of PID controller. Simulations also reveal that IAPSO is able to get global optimum faster than traditional PSO.

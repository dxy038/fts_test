The recent advances in the modeling of degradations in stratified composites have led to improved models on all scales. In particular, today, micromechanics derived in a generic framework enables one to define a reference virtual material which integrates most of the knowledge of a material. Thus, a model using damage mechanics on the mesoscale and usable for structural analysis can be built as a homogenized version of this reference model through previously-developed bridges. The objective is to derive a refined model worthy of micromechanics confidence, but transposable into a commercial code (here, ABAQUS/Standard).

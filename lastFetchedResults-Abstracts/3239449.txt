Image pre-processing techniques are used to improve the quality of an image before processing into an application. This uses a small neighborhood of a pixel in an input image to get a new brightness value in the output image. These preprocessing techniques are also called as filtration and resolution enhancement. The medical image quality parameters are mainly noise and resolution. The main objective of this paper is to improve the image quality by denoising and resolution enhancement. Most of the imaging techniques are degraded by noise. In order to preserve the edges and contour information of the medical images, the efficient denoising and an improved enhancement technique is required. This paper concentrates the average, median and wiener filtering for image denoising and an interpolation based Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique for resolution enhancement. The performance of these techniques is evaluated using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). From the results, it reveals that the efficient denoising and resolution enhancement technique is essential for image pre-processing.

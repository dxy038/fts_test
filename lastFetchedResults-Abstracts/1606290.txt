BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces proliferation of endothelial cells, stimulates angiogenesis, and increases vascular permeability and it is an important factor in inflammation and wound healing. The aim of this study was to compare the VEGF level of human gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in periodontal health and disease. 
METHODS: In this case-control study, forty-five subjects from periodontics department of Babol dental school were evaluated in three groups; periodontitis (group 1; n=15), gingivitis (group 2; n=15), without periodontal disease (group 3; n=15). Periodontal status was evaluated by measuring probing depth, clinical attachment loss, plaque and bleeding on probing. Samples obtained from GCF of patients after isolation by paper cone. VEGF was assessed by using an ELISA and compared. 
FINDINGS: In periodontitis patients, the mean and standard deviation of VEGF collected from diseased sites were 61.38±90.63 pg/ml, in gingivitis patients, concentration of VEGF was 31.53±63.64 pg/ml and also concentration of VEGF in healthy patients was 14.50±6.17 pg/ml. There was no statistical difference between the mean concentrations of VEGF in studied groups. 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that there is no correlation between concentration of VEGF and periodontal situation.

This paper presents an alternative approach for dynamic reconfiguration (DR) that enables a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to reconfigure itself dynamically through a parallel memory without using an internal configuration access port (ICAP). This approach aims to save two configurations of two fixed designed schemes of control by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in Intel Strata Flash Parallel NOR PROM, available on target in order to show capabilities of the FPGAs slices for making DR applied to the control and simulation of power electronics systems in real time (RT). The methodology followed to achieve the objective of this work was Multi-boot. It has been implemented on a Spartan-3E XC3S500E Starter Board FPGA from Xilinx, but it can also be extrapolate for any other FPGAs architectures devices, such as Virtex Xilinx families, with ICAPs.

Objective.  To describe three-dimensional tibial and femoral movements in vivo and examine the effect of a brace on knee kinematics during moderate to intense activity.

Design. Skeletal kinematics of anterior cruciate ligament deficient knees was measured with and without braces during moderate to intense activity.

Background. Invasive markers implanted into the tibia and femur are the most accurate means to directly measure skeletal motion and may provide a more sensitive measure of the differences between brace conditions.

Methods. Steinmann traction pins were implanted into the femur and tibia of four subjects having a partial or complete anterior cruciate ligament rupture. Non-braced and braced conditions were randomly assigned and subjects jumped for maximal horizontal distance to sufficiently stress the anterior cruciate ligament.

Results. Intra-subject peak vertical force and posterior shear force were generally consistent between conditions. Intra-subject kinematics was repeatable but linear displacements between brace conditions were small. Differences in angular and linear skeletal motion were observed across subjects. Bracing the anterior cruciate ligament deficient knee resulted in only minor kinematic changes in tibiofemoral joint motion.

Conclusion. In this study, no consistent reductions in anterior tibial translations were observed as a function of the knee brace tested.

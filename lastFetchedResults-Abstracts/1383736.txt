The objective of the present study was to determine the presence of recognised abortifacient viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV), Aujeszkyâ€™s disease virus (ADV), porcine parvovirus (PPV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), in tissues from aborted fetuses and stillborn neonates in cases of late reproductive failure in swine. A total of 293 specimens (fetuses aborted in the last third of gestation and stillborn piglets) from 100 different cases of late-term abortions and premature farrowing from 15 different Spanish provinces were studied. PRRSV was detected in 9/100 cases by RT-PCR. Only 1/100 cases analysed (corresponding to a late-term aborted fetus with a negative PRRSV RT-PCR result) was positive for PCV2 by PCR. Neither ADV (monitored by viral isolation plus antigen detection) nor PPV (monitored by ELISA antigen capture test) infection was identified. The results suggest that PRRSV is one of the most important infectious agents, if not the most relevant one, associated with fetal infection leading to abortion or premature farrowing in Spain. Moreover, other viral pathogens such as ADV, PPV and PCV2 seem to have a minor impact on reproductive disease.

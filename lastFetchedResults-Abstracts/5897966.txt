On the basis of the previous related work of hazardous materials road transportation and considered the real problem of hazardous materials management, this paper propose a model based on multi-objective optimization. Transportation risk, route and freight are weighted to get a similar generalized cost expression which makes the function of influencing factors more flexibility and applicability. Global optimization algorithm is simple and easy to be calculated which will provide a more operable model for the optimization problem of hazardous material road transportation. Finally, the feasibility of the method is proved by the given example.

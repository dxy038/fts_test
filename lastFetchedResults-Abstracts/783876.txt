Objective To determine the prevalence and characteristics
of psychosexual problems in people with schizophrenia,
and to compare the subjects’ and researcher’s perceptions of
the presence of these problems.
Methods Cross-sectional survey of 137 people with
established schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, aged
18–65 in one geographical area of southeast England, using
a semi-structured interview format.
Results A total of 74% of men and 82% of women reported
at least one ICD-10 defined sexual problem. Arousal problems
were associated with physical health problemsinmen.Orgasm
problems were more common in people in relationships. The
researcherwas about three times more likely to record a sexual
problem than the respondents were to report one.
Conclusions People with schizophrenia report sexual
dysfunction that is similar in nature but which occurs at a
higher rate than is reported in the general population. There
are gender differences and differences in the perception of
psychosexual problems between those with schizophrenia
and the researcher

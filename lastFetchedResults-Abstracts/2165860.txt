The objective of this study was to develop a method combining nanoparticle-based immunomagnetic separation (IMS) with real-time PCR for a rapid and quantitative detection of Listeria monocytogenes. Carboxyl modified magnetic nanoparticles were covalently bound with rabbit anti-L. monocytogenes via the amine groups. Several factors, such as the amount of immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs), reaction and collection times, and washing step, were optimized, and the nanoparticle-based IMS in combination with real-time PCR was further evaluated for detecting L. monocytogenes from artificially contaminated milk. The cell numbers calculated from the means of threshold cycles (CT) of PCR amplification curves were compared to those from plate counts in order to determine the correspondence degree of quantitative data. The capture efficiency (CE) by plating from IMNP-based IMS was 1.4 to 26 times higher than those of Dynabeads®-based IMS depending on the initial cell concentrations inoculated into milk samples. When combined with real-time PCR, L. monocytogenes DNA was detected in milk samples with L. monocytogenes ≥ 102 CFU/0.5 ml. In the range of 103 to 107 L. monocytogenes CFU/0.5 ml, cell numbers calculated from CT values were 1.5 to 7 times higher than those derived from plate counts. Our results demonstrated that both the use of nanoparticles and the choice of anti-L. monocytogenes in our IMNP-based IMS in combination with real-time PCR has improved the sensitivity of L. monocytogenes detection from both nutrient broth and milk samples.

This paper studies a class networked control systems where an approximate plant model is used in the controller side of a bidirectional communication network in order to reduce the data rates. Stability conditions are presented for the overall system, even in the case of inaccurate plant identification. When the plant model differs from the actual plant, the stability analysis is done using interval matrices techniques. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the tradeoff between admissible identification errors and their effect on the minimum data rate required to stabilize the system.

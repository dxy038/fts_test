The estimation of psychological properties of relationships (e.g., popularity, influence, or trust) only from objective data in online social networks (OSNs) is a rather vague approach. A subjective assessment produces more accurate results, but it requires very complex and cumbersome surveys. The key contribution of this paper is a framework for personalized surveys on relationships in OSNs which follows a gamification approach. A game was developed and integrated into Facebook as an app, which makes it possible to obtain subjective ratings of usersÂ´ relationships and objective data about the users, their interactions, and their social network. The combination of both subjective and objective data facilitates a deeper understanding of the psychological properties of relationships in OSNs, and lays the foundations for future research of subjective aspects within OSNs.

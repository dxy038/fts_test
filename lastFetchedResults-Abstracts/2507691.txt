Objective: The out-of-field/non-target effect is one of the most important phenomena of
ionizing radiation that leads to molecular and cellular damage to distant non-irradiated tissues.
The most important concern about this phenomenon is carcinogenesis many years
after radiation treatment. In vivo mechanisms and consequences of this phenomenon are
not known completely. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the oxidative damages to
out-of-field lung tissues 24 and 72 hours after pelvic irradiation in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental- interventional study, Sprague-Dawleymale
rats (n=49) were divided into seven groups (n=7/each group), including two groups of pelvisexposed
rats (out-of-field groups), two groups of whole body- exposed rats (scatter groups),
two groups of lung-exposed rats (direct irradiation groups), and one control sham group. Outof-
field groups were irradiated at a 2Ã—2 cm area in the pelvis region with 3 Gy using 1.25 MeV
cobalt-60 gamma-ray source, and subsequently, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione
(GSH) levels as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in out-of-field lung tissues were
measured. Results were compared to direct irradiation, control and scatter groups at 24 and
72 hours after exposure. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test.
Results: SOD activity decreased in out-of-field lung tissue 24 and 72 hours after irradiation
as compared with the controls and scatter groups. GSH level decreased 24
hours after exposure and increased 72 hours after exposure in the out-of-field groups
as compared with the scatter groups. MDA level in out-of-field groups only increased 24
hours after irradiation.
Conclusion: Pelvis irradiation induced oxidative damage in distant lung tissue that
led to a dramatic decrease in SOD activity. This oxidative stress was remarkable, but
it was less durable as compared to direct irradiation.

The total amount of generated information were 545180 units with total cost of $82000 .Information generation cost was 15.6%of total operational costs in the system.

Conclusion: Regarding the cost of information generation in this healthcare system, the need for using and screening information for evidence-based on decision making is obvious. Hence, more efforts have to done by managers and policymakers in healthcare system for implementation of a standard HMIS and to train personnel in order to generate optimum information by minimum costs.

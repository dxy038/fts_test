Basic model construction of HIV/AIDS disease, parameters estimation of this model and drug therapy effect is important and effective to prevent HIV progression. This paper evaluates presentation and analysis of an AIDS disease model and the objective function definition for disease control, therapy expense and drug side effect. In this model observation and evaluation was used to estimate parameters. Drug effect on viral load was considered after identification of presented model. This consideration can perform using control models that in this research were used from the two-dimensional control model. As a result, therapy control problems will be optimal control.

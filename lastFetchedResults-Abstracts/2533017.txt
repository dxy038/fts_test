Background and Objective: Doxorubicin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents against solid tumors. Doxorubicin causes cardiotoxicity via production of free radicals and depletion of antioxidants. However, the use of antioxidants can decrease doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity. Apium graveolens (celery) contains antioxidant compounds. Hence, this study was an attempt to figure out if it can protect heart cells against oxidative stress of doxorubicin.

Materials and Methods: The cells were incubated with different concentrations of Apium graveolens (celery) extract for 4 hours which continued in the presence of 5micro M doxorubicin for 24 hours. Cell viability and the apoptotic induction were determined using 3(4,5dimethylthiazol2yl)2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) and propidium iodide (PI) staining assays, respectively.

Results: Celery extract increased toxicity of doxorubicin at a concentration of 125500 micro g/ml. Also apoptosis was induced in the presence of doxorubicin at a concentration of 250 and 500micro g/ml.

Conclusion: Results showed that celery has no toxicity effect on heart cells alone. However, this extract could not protect cells against doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity. A number of mechanisms may instigate this effect such as augmentation of free radicals, increased drug delivery into the cells and expression of apoptotic proteins. Further research is needed to decide upon accuracy mechanism.

Period of October–November 2003 provides a wide range of geomagnetic conditions. This paper looks at three intervals: a moderate magnetic disturbance (13–16.10.2003) and two intense magnetic storms (29–31.10 and 20–21.11). One purpose of this paper is to define the behavior of the two parameters of the ionosphere, foF2 (or NmF2) and TEC, in this period. Data of foF2 of European ionosondes and TEC values of global maps for the corresponding coordinates are used. The emphasis is on the study of the synchrony of these parameters, which determine the behavior of the proportionality factor τ(obs) between the TEC and NmF2. The second objective is to compare two methods of determining foF2 during the disturbances, using: (i) the STORM-factor of the IRI model, (ii) the median equivalent slab thickness τ(med), together with the global TEC maps. It is shown that synchrony of variations of TEC and NmF2 does not always exist, which leads to unpredictable behavior of τ(obs). Acceptable option of the calculation of foF2 from TEC is to use τ(med), ensuring compliance with the experimental data better than 0.5 MHz in the case of synchrony, and 1.5 MHz when it does not exist. The relationship between τ(obs) and the plasmaspheric part of the TEC of the IRI-Plas model is considered. A comprehensive investigation of this relationship in cases where no synchrony may contribute to the development of model of τ(obs) during the disturbances.

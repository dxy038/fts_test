Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of body mass index and body composition on endometrial thickness and bone mass. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study that included 531 healthy postmenopausal women aged 48 to 65 years. Endometrial thickness was measured as double-layer thickness. Body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, which divides the body into fat mass, lean mass, and bone mass, both for the total body and regional body compartments. An abdominal region was inserted manually. Statistics were Pearson correlations and analysis of variance. Results: Endometrial thickness and total body bone mass were correlated, respectively, to body mass index (r= 0.14, P< .01; r= 0.35, P< .001), total body fat mass (r= 0.14, P< .01; r= 0.38, P< .001), abdominal fat mass (r= 0.16, P< .001; r= 0.33, P< .001), peripheral fat mass (r= 0.10, P< .05; r= 0.41, P< .001), and abdominal/peripheral fat mass (r= 0.12, P< .01; r= 0.11, P< .01). Conclusion: High body mass index and abdominal fat distribution correlate with increased endometrial thickness and bone mass. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:349-53.)

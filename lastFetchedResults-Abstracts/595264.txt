Objective: To assess the response of elderly patients with stable COPD to beta-2 agonist.Material and Methods: This inter ventional study was conducted in Pulmonology unit, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar Patients were recruited after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. A detailed history and clinical examination performed. On first day, baseline pulmonary function test (P.F.T) (F.E.V1, F.VC, F.E.V1/F.VC, P.E.F.R) was taken. Then 3 ml normal saline (placebo) was administered via cho-neb nebulizer. P.F.T measurements were repeated after 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. The best ofthree readings was recorded. On next day, the same protocol was applied except that placebo was replaced by nebulized salbutamol 5 mg (1 ml) plus 2 ml normal saline was administered via nebulizer.Results: Out of40patients fulfilling entry criteria 30 completed the study. Age range was from 60-80 years. The mean baseline for F.E.V1 and F.VC were 0.52 and 0.76 respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean baseline values on two days. The results expressed as mean and peak percentage changes about the baseline are shown in tabular and graphical form 60 % patients responded to salbutamol and 25 % to normal saline. Analysis of variance comparing change in F.E.V1 between salbutamol and normal saline revealed highly significant drug effect (P<0.01). The drug effect comparing changes in F.VC was statistically not significant (P>0.05).Conclusion: Salbutamol can produce useful bronchodilatation in elderly patients with stable COPD which can be readily assessed using spirometry.

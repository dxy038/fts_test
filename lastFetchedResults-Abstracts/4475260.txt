The issues of cost, size, and weight of neural controllers have received minimal attention by neural and control researchers. In this paper, we discuss methods to improve the characteristics of control sensors using compact and low-cost analog circuitry. Our objective is to extend the linear region of operation of a nonlinear sensor using artificial neural networks. Our method is applied to the design of a discrete-component phase-locked loop

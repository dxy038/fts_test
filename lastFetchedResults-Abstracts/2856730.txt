The quality of experience (QoE) on consumer video services must be maintained at a sufficient level. In order to realize automatic quality monitoring with a low burden, a no-reference (NR) objective video-quality-model by using a bitstream is promising because it can estimate a perceptual picture quality by referring to only parameters in the bitstream. High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is expected as the next-generation representative codec. Although parametric NR methods for AVC have been studied, such methods for HEVC are an emerging task in this research field. We propose an objective perceptual video-quality-measurement for HEVC that conforms to the parametric NR scheme.

Objective: Sinusitis is frequently associated with cleft lip and palate. The present study was performed in an attempt to investigate maxillary sinus development in relation to the occurrence of sinusitis in cleft patients. Methods: Forty-seven consecutive patients with cleft lip and alveolus with or without cleft palate underwent computed tomographic scans of the maxilla. The cross-sectional area of the maxillary sinus at the level of the zygomatic arch was measured, and the soft tissue density shadow of the sinus was scored on a 4-point scale. Results: The cross-sectional area of the sinus was significantly smaller in the child group (10 years or less) than in the adolescent group (11–20 years, P<0.001) and the adult group (over 20 years, P<0.02). The cross-sectional area significantly increased with age in the child group (r=0.552, P<0.001). The growth rate became slower in the adolescent group. The cross-sectional area then gradually decreased with age in the adult group (r=−0.64, P<0.05). Sinusitis was observed in 15 patients (32%) and in 20 sinuses (21%). Severe sinusitis was more common in the child group than in the patients over 10 years of age (P<0.05). Conclusion: These results indicate that maxillary sinusitis associated with cleft lip and palate occurs preferably in the developing sinuses of children.

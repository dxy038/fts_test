Penetration of renewable energies into the power systems, especially Wind Farms due to the numerous advantages is rapidly increasing. The importance of considering the effects of these farms into the Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) studies is inevitable as a one of the most important parts of power systems planning. In this paper, the multi objective optimization technique with DC load flow for solving the TEP problem has been proposed. In this suggested method, the productions of wind farms uncertainties and network loads have been modeled as a probabilistic subject, and the objective functions, consist of investment costs and maintenance costs, have been considered. The multi objective proposed method using Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) has been examined and tested on modified IEEE-RTS 24-bus and obtained results of suggested algorithm have been compared with obtained results of Genetic Algorithm (GA) in term on evolution and testing.

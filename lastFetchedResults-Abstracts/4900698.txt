The paper presents a new technique for synthesizing the radiation pattern of an active linear phased array. The approach taken in the paper is to integrate the power response of the array over a spatial region of interest and force it to less than or equal to the desirable value. The closed form equation of the objective function is derived such that a numerical technique based on gradient search can be used to optimize the far-field patterns in a fast and efficient manner

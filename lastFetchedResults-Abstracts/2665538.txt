Secular ethics – which is known as the de-religionized, human, or conventional ethics – contrasts the religious and divine ethics. Its roots are in humanistic thought that adapts itself to the needs and the direction of the society. Therefore, the contraction and dilation of secular ethics will be unstable, gradual, and accidental. Moreover, it is not possible to expect this thought system to present mysteriousness, divine worldview, and generality.
In the discussion about the two foregoing thoughts, the objective is to criticize the foundations of the secular thought through the Muslim open-minded thinkers’ ideas in a case study and particular affirmative proposition manner  based on  our society’s present day ethical harms, and then, to present the epistemic principles of the religious ethics.
In the direct discussion between these two approaches, first the secular ethics arguments will be presented through the Iranian open-minded scholars’ words in some theme-based categories, and then, they will be criticized briefly in a case study manner. Next, a more general confrontation regarding the principles and factors of the secular ethics will be provided.

The objective of this paper is to restore images corrupted with areas or strips replaced with white pixels. Images are said to have suffered a group or correlated loss. Motion picture images which have been torn or heavily scratched can suffer this type of loss. Different image filters and techniques were investigated to achieve the best restoration method. The performance of rank filters, successive over relaxation filters and a seed morphological filter was evaluated and results were tabulated and pictures before and after restoration are shown.

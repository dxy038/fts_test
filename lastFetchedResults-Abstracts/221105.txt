Gradient-based iterative methods often converge
slowly for tomographic image reconstruction and image restoration
problems, but can be accelerated by suitable preconditioners.
Diagonal preconditioners offer some improvement in convergence
rate, but do not incorporate the structure of the Hessian
matrices in imaging problems. Circulant preconditioners can
provide remarkable acceleration for inverse problems that are
approximately shift-invariant, i.e., for those with approximately
block-Toeplitz or block-circulant Hessians. However, in applications
with nonuniform noise variance, such as arises from Poisson
statistics in emission tomography and in quantum-limited optical
imaging, the Hessian of the weighted least-squares objective function
is quite shift-variant, and circulant preconditioners perform
poorly. Additional shift-variance is caused by edge-preserving
regularization methods based on nonquadratic penalty functions.
This paper describes new preconditioners that approximate more
accurately the Hessian matrices of shift-variant imaging problems.
Compared to diagonal or circulant preconditioning, the
new preconditioners lead to significantly faster convergence rates
for the unconstrained conjugate-gradient (CG) iteration. We also
propose a new efficient method for the line-search step required
by CG methods. Applications to positron emission tomography
(PET) illustrate the method.

A genetic algorithm (GA) was adopted to optimise the response of a composite laminate subject to impact. Two different impact scenarios are presented: low-velocity impact of a slender laminated strip and high-velocity impact of a rectangular plate by a spherical impactor. In these cases, the GA's objective was to, respectively, minimise the peak deflection and minimise penetration by varying the ply angles.

The GA was coupled to a commercial finite-element (FE) package LS DYNA to perform the impact analyses. A comparison with a commercial optimisation package, LS OPT, was also made. The results showed that the GA was a robust, capable optimisation tool that produced near optimal designs, and performed well with respect to LS OPT for the more complex high-velocity impact scenario tested.

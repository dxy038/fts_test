In this paper the experimental modeling of the transfer function of an DC voltage three-phase brushless synchronous electric motor (Brushless DC Electric Motor) for a hybrid system is presented, the bench system consists of an architecture in parallel using devices for power division called electromagnetic clutches, that consist in a double canal pulley, a coil and a drag plate, these clutches were connected to the motorÂ´s arrow in this hybrid system, allowing an individual control of both. The identified transfer function is used to design and to simulate a control of angular speed being used the Root-Locus technique and Fuzzy Logic to autotune the proportional integral gains. The primary objective is to synchronize the engine speeds to make efficient the fuel use in the combustion motor. The simulation of the control system in closed loop is made in the Simulink tool and is designed with Siso tool from the mathematical software Matlab. The system identification is conducted through the System Identification Toolbox of Matlab with data acquisition of angular speed, voltage and sampling time.

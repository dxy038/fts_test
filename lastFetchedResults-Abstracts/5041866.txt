The changes registered worldwide with respect to the ambient quality determined people to consider, a primal objective, the protection and improvement of environmental conditions. The 2002/49/EC Directive, adopted by the European Parliament and European Union Council on 29 June 2002, settles the defining objectives of environment protection against phonic pollution. One of directivepsilas objectives is monitoring environmental problems by soliciting member states competent authorities to create strategic mapping of noise for roads, railways, airports, and important urban settlements, using harmonized noise indicators. As part of this thematic the informational and communication technologies brought an important advantage. This paper presents an informational system, which gives a simple but powerful tool to develop strategic mapping of noise produced by road traffic, accordingly with the European directives and regulations. There are described some methods for evaluation of used indicators in order to develop noise strategic maps, system architecture, functionality and distributed data acquisition subsystems.

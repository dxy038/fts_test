Objective
  Diabetes  mellitus  (DM)  as  a  metabolic  disorder  is 
becoming  a  serious  threat of  health.  In recent  year
s,  there  has been 
renewed  interest  in  the  treatment  against  different
  diseases  using 
medicinal  plants.  The  present  randomized  clinical  t
rial  was  carried 
out to evaluate the efficacy of Ziziphus in improvi
ng glucose control 
in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  
Materials and Methods:
 Women were randomized to treatment 
with  Ziziphus  (30  gr/day)  or  control  group  (age  mat
ch).  This  trial 
was  done  during  three  months.  Fasting  blood  sugar  (
FBS),  2-hour 
postprandial   blood   glucose   (2hpp)   and   glycated   hemo
globin 
(HbA1c) were measured before and after the interven
tion. 
Results
  Ziziphus  consumption  was  associated  with  significa
nt 
reductions in  serum levels of 2hpp glucose and HbA1
c (
P
 < 0.05) in 
women  with  T2DM.  As  well  as  marginally  significant 
effect  was 
observed  from  Ziziphus  of  serum  levels  of  FBS  (
P
=0.06)  after  the 
intervention. 
Conclusion: 
Consumption  of  Ziziphus  for  3  months  has  anti-
diabetic  effects  on  women  with  T2DM.  These  findings
  suggest 
Ziziphus as a beneficial supplement for diabetic wo
men.

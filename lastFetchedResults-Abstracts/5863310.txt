This paper presents an approach for compression and synthesis of BTF (bidirectional texture function), and using it BTF can be mapped on arbitrary surfaces. BTF is a kind of multidimensional texture data, which can perfectly shows the self-shadow, self-occlusion and inter-reflection reflectance of object surfaces under varying light directions. However, it is difficult to use BTF on object surfaces because of its enormous data and small size. Our method uses PCA algorithm to compress enormous BTF data, and we propose a synthesis algorithm to solve its size problem and insure multidimensional consistency, while we also propose an algorithm of error calculation for Wang tilesÂ´ construction. Using the method we proposed this paper we can rendering BTF on arbitrary object surfaces efficiently and quickly.

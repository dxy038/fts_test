In this paper the design and implementation of Distributed Real-Time DEVS/CORBA is discussed as an extension of previously developed DEVS-based modeling and simulation frameworks. The major objective in developing Distributed Real-Time DEVS/CORBA is to establish a framework in which the distributed real-time systems can be designed through DEVS-based modeling and simulation studies, and then migrated with minimal additional effort to be executed in the real-time distributed environment. This environment will provide generic support for developing models of distributed embedded software systems, evaluating their performance and timing behavior through simulation and easing the transition from simulation to actual executions In this paper we describe detailed design and implementation aspects of the environment which was implemented over Visibroier CORBA middleware and ACE/TAO real-time CORBA services

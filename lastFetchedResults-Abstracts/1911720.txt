
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tanacetum parthenium has been introduced as an analgesic agent in traditional medicine and it is widely used to relieve neuropathic pain and headache. The present study was conducted to investigate the analgesic effect of Tanacetum parthenium extract using formalin test. 
METHODS: In an experimental study the analgesic effect of Tanacetum parthenium was evaluated by formalin test in 10 groups of 100 adult meal mice, as follows: group distilled water, groups received 10, 20, 30, 40 and 80mg/kg of alcoholic extract, respectively, group received 100 mg/kg ibuprofen, group received 0.5 mg/kg morphine, respectively, group received 0.5 mg/kg naloxon and group received naloxon and extract. Fifteen minutes before formalin injection in foot floor of mice, different doses of extract, ibuprofen, morphine and naloxone injected intraperitoneally in mice. The analgesic effects with observed animal movements and compared in different groups in 30-minute intervals and recorded in two acute and chronic phases.
FINDINGS: Among the different doses of extract, 10mg/kg has more analgesic effect in both acute and chronic phases (110.7±19.58), (61±1.15) and showed significant difference with groups ibuprofen and distilled water (p < 0.05). The results indicate that the analgesic effect of Tanacetum parthenium is dose dependent and analgesic effect of the extract was inhibited by naloxon (193.6±17.35), (111.5±6.43).
CONCLUSION: Results in this study showed a dose-dependent analgesic effect of Tanacetum parthenium in both acute and chronic phases and the decrease in the analgesic effect of naloxone group is probably caused by activation of opioid system.

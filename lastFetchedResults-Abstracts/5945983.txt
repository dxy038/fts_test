In this contribution we compare different realizations of the polyphase networks employed in Offset QAM based Filter Bank Multicarrier (OQAM-FBMC). Our objective is to evaluate the structuresÂ´ computational cost and robustness for very low complexity implementations of the prototype filter coefficients. We compare a direct form, a classical lattice realization, where in both the Canonical Signed Digit (CSD) representation of the coefficients is applied, and a Coordinate Rotation by Digital Computer (CORDIC)-based lattice structure. We evaluate the cost after coefficient quantization in terms of number of additions and shifts. By considering the multicarrier application, we show the effects of coefficient quantization on the subcarrier filters spectrum and on the multicarrier transmit signal Power Spectral Density (PSD).

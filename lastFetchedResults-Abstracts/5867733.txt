In order to operate as efficiently as possible, appropriate on-demand routing protocols have to be incorporated in the ad hoc networks. Most common routing protocols, simply assume that all network links are bidirectional, and thus may need additional protocol actions to remove unidirectional links from route computations. The proposed algorithm makes use of selective unidirectional links so that the overhead is minimized and connectivity is improved which in turn improves the packet delivery ratio in mobile networks. The proposed protocol also efficiently minimizes the flooding traffic during route discovery and speeds up this process by clustering.

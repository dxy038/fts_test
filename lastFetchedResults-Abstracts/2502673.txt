Objective (s): This study aimed to translate and validate a Persian version of the CASP-19, in Iran.
Methods: The existing CASP-19 (English version) was translated into Persian version according to the World Health Organization protocol for translation and adaptation of instruments. The operational measure (CASP-19) consists of 19 Likert-scaled items that cover four theoretical domains: control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure. Data were collected from 100 older people. Reliability (internal consistency, test- retest reliability) face validity, content validity, known groups comparisons and criterion validity of the CASP-19 and the SF-36, were examined.
Results: The mean age of the participants was 69.6 (standard deviation± 7.32) years, and more than half (54%) were female. We observed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s a 0.70–0.88) for the subscales. Test-retest reliability (ICC) of the questionnaire with two weeks interval was 0.96(p  <  0.001). The result of known- groups comparisons showed that the questionnaire discriminated subgroups of elderly people who differed in neglect. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing SF-36 and CASP-19 (Persian version). Relationship between translated scale and the SF-36 subscales showed significant correlation in most dimensions.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that the CASP-10 is a valid measure for assessing quality of life in elderly populations in different settings.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of material compositions on the mechanical properties of wood–plastic composites (WPCs) manufactured by injection molding. Using a ratio of wood flour/plastic matrix/MAPP (maleic anhydride polypropylene)/zinc stearate of 47:47:3:3, the tensile strength and modulus of rupture (MOR) of WPCs manufactured with LDPE (low-density polyethylene) and PP (polypropylene) were found to be larger than those of LDPE and PP themselves. However, contrasting findings were obtained when the polymer matrix was ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene). In comparison to the mechanical properties of RPP (recycled polypropylene) itself, the MOR increased and the tensile strength decreased for WPCs manufactured with RPP.

The tensile strength, MOR, and storage modulus of WPCs made from PP mixed with 47% wood flours (<180 μm) and 3–4.5% MAPP were larger than those of the other WPCs manufactured in this study. However, the polymer damping peaks showed a contrary result.

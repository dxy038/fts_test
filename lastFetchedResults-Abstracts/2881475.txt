Topical evolution in technologies has offered a lot of lavatories in information transmission, reproduction and manipulation. Hence the information security system plays a vital role. The biometric information security is one of the information security mechanisms. Person recognition through Biometric Security is the unique and commanding articles to defense it. The biometric system is at danger from the hackers. The attack programs are establishing the procedure to bypass the security. Together with the steganography mechanism, the risk reduces drastically in biometric systems from the hackers. The objective of steganography is to hide information inside a cover medium like text, image, audio, video etc. through which it is not possible to detect the presence of the secret information. Here in this paper a new security concept has been established by making the system more secure with the help of steganography along with biometric security. Here the biometric information i.e. the face geometry parameters has been embedded to the DWT domain of an image.

The purpose of this study was to compare the use of medical services over a period of one year by members of ethnic groups and native Quebecers in Canada, while controlling for a number of confounding factors. The objective was to determine whether the two groups made the same number of medical visits to the same sites (private offices, outpatient clinic and emergency room and hospital inpatient care) and the same types of physicians (general practitioners, specialists). Two sources of data were used. The first was the Quebec Health Survey conducted in 1987 on a representative sample of 31,995 noninstitutionalized persons. Through personal interviews and self-administered questionnaires, data were collected on the demographic characteristics and health status of the respondents. The second source of data was the Quebec physician claims database, which contains a complete registry of services paid to physicians on a fee for service basis in the 12 months prior to the survey. The two databases were linked at the individual level (success rate is 88%). Members of ethnic groups aged 15 years and older were then individually matched to native Quebecers having the same six characteristics (age, gender, household income, access to health care facilities, perceived health and overall health). Final sample size was 1182 (divided equally into the two study groups). Results showed that neither the average number of medical services used over a year by the two groups nor the number of users differed. However, ethnic groups made more visits to specialists in private offices. Although not definite, possible explanations of these results are discussed. It is concluded that health care professionals should be sensitive to the particular needs of ethnic groups in order to provide them with accessible and appropriate services.

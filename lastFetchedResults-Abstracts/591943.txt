The objective of the present study was to identify teachers’ problems at work.
The research followed a descriptive method. The research sample were chosen
among guidance school teachers in Iran, using a multi-stratified cluster
sampling method. At first, provinces were classified into groups. Then, one
province was selected randomly from each group. A questionnaire was administered
to gather the data needed after approving its content validity. Moreover,
the reliability of the instrument was estimated based on Cronbach Alpha
procedure. The results showed that teachers’ problems from the most to least
faced ones were as follows: use of instructional aids and materials, application
of different methods and approaches, teacher-student interaction, familiarity
with school and work affairs, assessment and evaluation of students’ academic
achievement, repair and improvement of learning situation and classroom
management. Hence, the problem which most of the teachers faced, was the
use of instructional aids and materials, but the least-faced problem was classroom
management. So, the policy makers of education system should have
particular emphasis on designation and development of pre-service, and inservice
teacher training of those issues that teachers had the most problem
with them.

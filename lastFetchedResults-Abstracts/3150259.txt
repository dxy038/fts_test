We have proposed and demonstrated a novel fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing interrogation method using bidirectional modulation of a Mach-Zehnder electro-optical modulator (MZ-EOM). The results show that the time delay and the wavelength variation have a good linear relationship with a gradient of 12.9 ps/0.2 nm, which can be usefully applied to FBG temperature or strain sensors and other multiplexed sensor applications.

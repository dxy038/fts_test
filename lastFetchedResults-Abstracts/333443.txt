Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic advantages of high in-plane resolution contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast in comparison to standard CE-MRI. Methods: Forty-one patients with 51 hypervascularized lesions were selected prospectively after undergoing bilateral standard CE MRI (slice thickness 4 mm, in-plane resolution 1.52×1.25 mm2, temporal resolution 81 s). Patients underwent high in-plane resolution CE MRI, either (n=21) a two-dimensional fast-low-angle-shot sequence (slice thickness 4 mm, in-plane resolution 0.76×0.63 mm2, temporal resolution 96 s) or (n=20) a SE sequence being used (slice thickness 4 mm, in-plane resolution 0.8×0.63 mm2, temporal resolution 115 s). Results: Histopathology revealed 33 malignant and 18 benign lesions (0.2–2.2 cm). Morphologic characteristics were much better visualized with high in-plane resolution. Additional diagnostic information, however, resulted only in one patient with fibroadenoma due to a better visualization of smooth contours. Conclusions: High in-plane resolution provides better visualization of morphologic patterns in comparison to standard dynamic MRI. However, a diagnostic advantage is only rare.

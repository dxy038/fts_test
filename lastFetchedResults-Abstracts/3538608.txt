The switching behavior of an 80.99-GHz p-i-n diode modulator for the 40-110-GHz waveguide transmission system is studied. Detailed knowledge of the type of transient is required to establish rise-time and timing-error specifications compatible with the system performance objective. A test set displaying the transients at 300 Mbit/s in polar coordinates with a convenient time readout is described. The technique is suitable for the study of multiphase modulators in ultra-high-speed digital radio or satellite transmission systems.

Systolic time intervals (STI) are a type of nondestructive method to detect the ejection function of the left ventricle. Electrocardiogram (ECG) phonocardiogram (PCG) and carotid arteriogram (CAP) signals are obtained synchronously to detect the STI parameters in order to provide various objective bases for clinical examination. This paper discusses an algorithm, which, according to the each signalÂ´s features, takes the ILOT algorithm, experimental parameters and the wavelet transform to locate each ECG, CAP and PCG accurately, so that the doctor could have the exact STI physiology parameters for reference

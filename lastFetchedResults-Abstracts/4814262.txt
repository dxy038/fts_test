The auto-docking system design for the fuel loading robot used in hazardous environment is presented. The mechanical structure and the sensing algorithm of this system are introduced in details. The sensor system adopts two accurate CCDs as the automatic visual positioning device to measure the position and the posture between the manipulator of the robot and the objective in case of the good visual condition, besides, as a compensation for the shortage of the vision system, the tactile sensor system which likes the probe of an insect is also employed. The precision of proposed vision and tactile sensory system is analyzed. The result of experiment and the simulation indicate that this auto-docking system features rapid reaction speed and high measurement precision, which can be used to implement the auto-docking task for the fuel loading robot in hazard environment.

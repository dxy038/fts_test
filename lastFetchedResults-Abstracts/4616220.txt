Quality of service guarantees in wireless sensor networks is difficult and more challenging due to the fact that the available resources of sensors and the various applications running over these networks have different constraints in their nature and requirements. In this paper we present a novel heuristic neighbor selection mechanism in WSNs that uses the geographic routing mechanism combined with the QoS requirements to provide multi-objective QoS routing (MQoSR) for different application requirements. The problem of providing QoS routing is formulated as a link and path-based metrics. The link QoS metrics are partitioned in terms of reliability, delay, distance to sink and energy, and the path QoS metrics are presented in terms of end-to-end delay, reliability of data transmission and network lifetime. The simulation results demonstrate that MQoSR protocol is able to achieve the delay requirements and due to optimum path selection process, the achieved data delivery ratio is always above the required one. MQoSR protocol outperforms the existing model in the literature remarkably in terms of reliable data transmission, on time data delivery and underlines the importance of energy efficient solution to enhance network lifetime.

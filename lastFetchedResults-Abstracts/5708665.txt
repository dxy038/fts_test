This paper re-introduces the concept of service provider choice within hierarchical wireless networks of the future. The service provider does not have to be a PCS, cellular, or satellite carrier. The service provider might have agreements with multiple PCS, cellular, or satellite carriers to provide wireless services to its subscribers. The concepts of location billing and third generation networks have been studied in the past, but the concept of enabling users to switch between service providers based on their location is certainly novel. The objective is to present a generic service description of this concept and to propose a basic architecture that may foster future study. This paper is not a feasibility study, although it identifies the issues that may need to be considered to determine the viability of service provider choice based on a subscriberÂ´s location

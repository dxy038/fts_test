This paper deals with model predictive control (MPC) of chemical exothermic semi-batch reactor. A first order chemical reaction is considered to be running in the reactor. The reaction is strongly exothermic so the in-reactor temperature is rising very fast due to reaction component dosing. Thus, the temperature control is necessary. The simulation model of the plant was developed in the MATLAB/Simulink. The system is nonlinear because of chemical reaction kinetics, so its control is difficult by classical methods. The classical MPC objective function was modified in order to improve the control. The MPC controller uses an artificial neural network as a predictor.

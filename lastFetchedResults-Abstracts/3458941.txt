The synchronous inductor motors studied in this paper have a construction identical to that of PM-type stepping motors, and they feature excellent start/stop characteristics and high torque with small input power. This type of synchronous motor is used mainly in recorders, printers, copying machines etc. to drive papers. Further, they are used in various controllers which need bidirectional rotation. The steady-state operating characteristics (alternating torque characteristics as well as starting characteristics), of asymmetrical synchronous inductor motors are studied mainly in comparison with symmetrical motors. Further, in consideration of the applications that need bidirectional rotation, the difference of characteristics in a different direction of rotation caused by mechanical asymmetry is also studied.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

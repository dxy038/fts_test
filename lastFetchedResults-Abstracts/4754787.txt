The proposed algorithm selects the path under reliability constraint with minimum total power consumption and maximum nodes&#194;&#191; residual battery (RCEB) to balance energy and maximize the network lifetime. An evaluation function of objective optimization degree is formatted. A new heuristic algorithm with pseudo polynomial-time complexity is proposed to simplify the solution of this nonlinear programming problem. Finally simulation results confirm that compared with the traditional routing algorithms, this algorithm proposed is the best approach on performances of the network lifetime, the power consumption and the balanced distribution of residual battery.

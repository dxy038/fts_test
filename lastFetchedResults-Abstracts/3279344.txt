A fast algorithm of calculating LRCS of a complex target is presented and computational unified device architecture (CUDA) is used for accelerating the color-flagged Graphical Electromagnetic Computing (GRECO) method. Based on the five parameters bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, one target´s LRCS can be divided into millions of pixels´ computation which are processed on a great many of threads running in GPU. The obtained comparison of CPU calculation and CUDA parallel calculation of one aircraft shows that the speed of CUDA parallel calculation improves several times. With the help of CUDA and GRECO method, electromagnetic simulation of LRCS can be processed much more efficiently.

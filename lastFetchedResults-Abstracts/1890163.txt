Objective: Because of the therapeutic application of stem cells (SCs), isolation and characterization
of different types of SCs, especially mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have
gained considerable attention in recent studies. Adipose tissue is an abundant and accessible
source of MSCs which can be used for tissue engineering and in particular for treatment
of musculoskeletal disorders. This study was aimed to isolate and culture equine
adipose-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) from little amounts of fat tissue samples and determine
some of their biological characteristics.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, only 3-5 grams of fat tissue were collected
from three crossbred mares. Immediately, cells were isolated by mechanical means
and enzymatic digestion and were cultured in optimized conditions until passage 3 (P3).
The cells at P3 were evaluated for proliferative capacities, expression of specific markers,
and osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation potentials.
Results: Results showed that the isolated cells were plastic adherent with a fibroblast-like
phenotype. AT-MSCs exhibited expression of mesenchymal cluster of differentiation (CD)
markers (CD29, CD44 and CD90) and not major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II)
and CD34 (hematopoietic marker). Cellular differentiation assays demonstrated the chondrogenic,
adipogenic and osteogenic potential of the isolated cells.
Conclusion: Taken together, our findings reveal that equine MSCs can be obtained easily
from little amounts of fat tissue which can be used in the future for regenerative purposes
in veterinary medicine.

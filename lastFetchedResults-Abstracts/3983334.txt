We report interval-polarization-independent wavelength conversion at 2.5 Gb/s using four-wave mixing in a single semiconductor optical amplifier. These results have been obtained with a dual-pump configuration in a bidirectional geometry. Bit-error-rate (BER) curves are reported for a conversion shifts of -1 and +1 THz. The signal polarization was automatically scrambled during the BER measurement. The penalty with respect to the back-to-back line is 2.4 and 1.6 dB, respectively.

Background: One of the main challenges of hospital managers is to decide the number of existing beds in each department of the hospital. While,
more beds results in an increase in the current cost of the hospital,
decreasing the number of beds might cause disorder in patients flow. The main
objective of this paper is minimizing the total cost as well as maximizing the
patients flow in the network, considering the practical limitations of the
hospital. 

Materials & Methods: this study is aimed to
investigate following subjects: identify the current limitations in changing of
department capacity, thorough interview with hospital managers and other personnel
in Modares Hospital, cardiac patient flow analysis, simulation of current flow,
determining applicable scenarios and choosing the best scenarios by
mathematical modeling in order to minimize total cost and maximize patient
flow. 

Results: through lots of existing scenarios, 31 applicable
scenarios have been determined by limitations analysis. Finally, 8 best
scenarios were found. Generally, results show that decreasing the number of
beds in CCU and increasing the number of beds in Post-CCU can improve patients
flow, considering cost constrains.      

Conclusion: The
Proposed approach in this study can be a general guide for capacity planning of
hospital departments with considering practical limitations. Since some health
administrators oppose the creation of post-CCU, it is possible to compare patients
flow status in the presence or absence of this department by proposed approach
in this paper.

Introduction: Long-term outcome of small abdominal aortic aneurysms is not well known in Guilan province. Objective: The aim of this study was to follow up of small abdominal aortic aneurysms for seven years. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine patients with small and asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (27-41 mm) were chosen from Poursina and a private hospital in Rasht and they were followed son graphically from 1377-1384.
Results: Mean follow up time was 4.5 years. There was 1.5 mm aneurismal dilatation per year. (0-9.5mm). Two patients referred with abdominal pain and sign and symptom of aortic dissection (5.1%) whom have been operated as an emergency case. Sixteen cases needed elective aortic reconstruction (40.8%). Two of them (5.1%) died postoperatively. Their health status after seven year was 57%. Mean time necessary for aortic rupture was 5.2 years. (1.9-7 years), and mean time for aortic reconstruction was 3.5 years (1.7-7 years).
Conclusion: The fate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms depends on the rate of growth and its size, which occasionally causes death due to rupture. Observations indicate the important of controlling these patients in prevention of side effects.

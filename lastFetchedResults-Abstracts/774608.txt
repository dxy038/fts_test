In this article, we consider a two-dimensional stochastic Navier–Stokes equation (SNSE) on a smooth
bounded domain, driven by affine-linear multiplicative white noise and with random initial conditions and
Dirichlet boundary conditions. The random initial condition is allowed to anticipate the forcing noise. Our
main objective is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the SNSE under sufficient Malliavin
regularity of the initial condition. To this end we employ anticipating calculus ideas.

A format for work specification is developed. It is a format to specify and annotate activity performed by people. Through this format, people may specify the target, objective, and intended results of an activity. The format improves the completeness of specification by using a predefined set of elements. In addition, it improves understanding through efficient access to required knowledge. Moreover, it improves correctness of specification by consistency and dependency checking. In this paper, we introduce the definition of the work, contents of the format, description method of the contents and candidate icons of language to specify it. In addition, to demonstrate and evaluate the format, an example specification of agriculture work is presented.

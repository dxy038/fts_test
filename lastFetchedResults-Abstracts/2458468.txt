Landslide analysis is increasingly based on the combination of multiple information sources at different spatial and temporal resolutions, spatial coverage, accuracy and acquired using various airborne and terrestrial platforms and geomorphological, geophysical, and geotechnical methods. Morphological mapping and morpho-structure characterization are preliminary steps to analyze the observed and future landslide distributions. The objective of this work is to propose a morpho-structural model of an active landslide complex on the Normandy coast (north-west France) by combining different data sources. The methodology associates field investigation with interpretation of high-resolution topographic and geophysical images. The proposed morpho-structural model highlights the division of the landslide into several morphological features. This division may explain the spatial variability and temporal variability of the slope dynamics.

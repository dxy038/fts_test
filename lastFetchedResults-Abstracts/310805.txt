Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate load transmission in the cancellous bone of the tibia under static and impact load.

Background. Abnormal transmission of loads may result in osteoarthritis and fractures. However, the role of the cancellous bone in these processes is not well understood.

Methods. The compressive stresses in the subchondral bone, epiphysis and diaphysis of the tibia of porcine knees were measured under static and impact load using mini-pressure transducers. The tests were performed using a drop-tower type testing machine in neutral, varus and valgus alignments. Tests were repeated after meniscectomy and again after removing the articular cartilage.

Results. In the intact knee in all alignments, the highest stress on the medial side was found in the epiphysis, and in the subchondral bone on the lateral side. After meniscectomy, a significant increase was observed in the stress in the subchondral bone on both sides. After the articular cartilage was also removed, the stress in the subchondral bone increased again, but slightly.

Conclusion. The importance of the meniscus in load transmission is supported by this study. The contribution of the articular cartilage to load transmission is less than that of the meniscus.

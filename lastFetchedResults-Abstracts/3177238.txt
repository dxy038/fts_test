In this work we propose a new modelling of the transient electromagnetic field radiated by grounding systems in semi-infinite dissipative medium. Classically, for the same objective, the rigorous numerical approaches are used and consist in solving the integral equation of electromagnetic field by moment method or the Maxwell equations by the Finite Element Method FEM. Our proposition is based on using the dipole concept and the asymptotic expansion of a single dipole, are expressed in terms of the solutions of the two basic integrals V<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>1</sub>.

The authors demonstrated three configurations of passive optical networks (PONs) based on a distributed Raman amplification scheme in conjunction with low cost and low power consumption transmitters. Single wavelength Raman pumps were located only at the central office (CO). Results show transmission penalties of &lt;1.5 dB for bidirectional transmissions. With a 6.75 dB Raman gain, scalability investigations indicate the potential of high split and long reach of these networks without the need for FEC, specialized fiber or additional Raman pumps in the fiber plant.

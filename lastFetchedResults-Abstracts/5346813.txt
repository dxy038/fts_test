Using different approaches, modeling for different HEVs has been studied. Generally, considering the different combinations of components, each architecture has its own modeling. The modeling and control design of different HEVs could be achieved in a general way, despite the fact that HEVs can be very different from each other in terms of structure. If the modeling and control design of different HEVs is obtained using a general approach, the time required for control design can be reduced. A common simulation program has been established for different HEVs. By setting different values for certain parameters, this single simulation program can be used for series-parallel, series, and parallel HEVs. The objective of this paper is to validate this common model in the case of the Toyota Prius II. The simulation validation is conducted by comparing it with VEHLIB (Hybrid Electric Vehicle Library), a simulation software program, which has already been validated by a real Toyota Prius II.

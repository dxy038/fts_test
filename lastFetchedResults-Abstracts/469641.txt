Objective
We sought to determine whether midtrimester amniotic fluid levels of matrix metalloproteinase-8 were associated with subsequent preterm premature rupture of membranes.
Study design
We conducted a case-control study examining 57 asymptomatic women who underwent genetic amniocentesis from 14 to 21 weeks' gestation and subsequently had preterm premature rupture of membranes (<35 wk) and 58 women with subsequent term delivery. Measurement of total matrix metalloproteinase-8 level in amniotic fluid was conducted using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and association with preterm birth due to preterm premature rupture of membranes was assessed.
Results
The overall distribution of matrix metalloproteinase-8 concentrations was similar in women who had preterm premature rupture of membranes and term controls (median 2.39 ng/mL, 25th to 75th percentile 1.1-10.1 vs 2.37 ng/mL, 25th to 75th percentile 1.5-4.7, P = .94). However, 26% of women who had preterm premature rupture of membranes had a matrix metalloproteinase-8 concentration above the 90th percentile (8.7 ng/mL), compared with only 10% of term controls (odds ratio 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.7; P = .03). Elevated matrix metalloproteinase-8 remained associated with preterm premature rupture of membranes after adjustment for maternal age, race, parity, gestational age, and year of amniocentesis (odds ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.9; P = .03).
Conclusions
The overall distribution of midtrimester amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase-8 levels did not differ between women who had preterm premature rupture of membranes and those delivered at term. However, marked elevations of midtrimester amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase-8 were highly associated with subsequent preterm premature rupture of membranes, suggesting that the pathophysiologic processes that contribute to preterm premature rupture of membranes may begin in early pregnancy.

The author describes the design of a control system around a digital signal processing (DSP) chip such as the TMS32010. The objective was to design a stand-alone multi-process control system capable of high-speed operation. The system was designed with a high degree of local intelligence to eliminate the need for a complicated host computer program. All system hardware is accessed through function codes and system-level software which maintains the integrity of the process within tables in the system memory. Of equal importance was the development of an analog interface that allowed the analog system boards to be designed around the process, which is controlled without being restricted by the system hardware

The combinatorial problem of the economic load dispatch is solved to find the generation levels that minimize the cost or minimize the emission level while satisfying the power balance equation. The environmental emission levels are also taken as the constraints in cost optimization problem. The solutions to the above problems is attempted using modified Hopfield neural network (MHNN), which has the flexibility of handling objective function and the constraints separately and works on the principal of minimizing the energy function and therefore ensure convergence. The study is carried out for cost optimization, NO<sub>x</sub> emission optimization, SO<sub>x</sub> emission optimization and cost optimization with SO<sub>x</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions as constraint. The simulation results are presented for standard 3-generator data while considering the losses and neglecting them.

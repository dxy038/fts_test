The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in birth weight and gestation length between Japanese Black calves obtained from transfer of bovine embryos produced in vitro (IVP) and those developed in vivo (IVD). An additional objective was to clarify the sire effect on birth weight and gestation length and to examine the birth rate of heavier calves. Two Japanese Black bulls breed at our experimental station were used as a semen source for production of IVP and IVD embryos. Thirty-eight Japanese Black heifers and cows of various genetic backgrounds were used as embryo donors for IVD embryos. Ovaries for IVP embryos were collected at random at a local slaughterhouse from Japanese Black cattle of various genetic backgrounds. IVP embryos were produced using co-culturing with cumulus cells in 5% CS+TCM 199. Both the IVD and IVP embryos were transferred non-surgically to Holstein recipients on day 7±1 of estrous cycle. In this study, the birth weights and gestation lengths of half-sib single calves for bull A and B were analyzed.

mbers of single calves born by transfer of IVP and IVD embryos for bull A and B were 133 and 121, 243 and 465, respectively. The birth weight of the IVP calves was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than that of the IVD (bull A: 31.0±0.4 kg versus 27.2±0.4 kg and bull B: 29.9±0.6 kg versus 26.6±0.2 kg). Gestation length of the IVP calves for bull A was significantly longer (P&lt;0.01) than that of the IVD (291.9±0.9 days versus 283.6±0.5 days). However, for bull B, there were no differences in gestation length between the IVP and IVD calves (285.9±0.7 days versus 286.2±0.3 days). These results clearly indicated that IVP calves had heavier birth weights than IVD calves but that the average gestation length of IVP calves was not always longer than that of IVD calves. Furthermore, the birth rate of heavier calves and the incidence of stillbirth and perinatal mortality up to 48 h post partum in IVP calves (bull A: 11.3%, bull B: 7.8%) were greater (P&lt;0.05) than those in IVD calves from both bulls (bull A: 4.1%, bull B: 3.7%).

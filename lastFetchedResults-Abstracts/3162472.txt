The use of video camera surveillance systems has dramatically increased over recent years. This is due in no small part to the reduction in costs and increased reliability afforded by CCD camera technology. However the capability of designers and installers has not kept pace with the hardware development. With end users demanding ever reducing costs many systems are designed and installed by electrical engineers who have no training in broadband signal communications. This has led to systems being installed with less than adequate performance or where performance has degraded a year or so down the line. The objective of VIDEQUAL is to provide a fully quantitative measurement of system performance. This is achieved by placing or defining targets in the camera field of view and/or injecting test signals at the camera. Measurements are then made either after the viewing monitor or directly from the output of the video switcher. It is intended that the measuring equipment employs standard PC architecture using a commercial video signal capture board to acquire an image for processing. Dependant on the application this image could be stored for future reference or audit purposes. The measurements are chosen to best reflect the system performance and should be simple to make and be easy to understand. The output from the equipment is in the form of either a screen display or a printed report. Where the equipment is undertaking an automatic comparison an audible/digital alarm would be provided

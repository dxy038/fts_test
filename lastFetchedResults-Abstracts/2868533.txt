This paper presents performance evaluation of a single - phase grid connected squirrel cage induction generator for variable speed wind energy applications. The existing delta connected three-phase induction generator can operate as a single-phase induction generator by connecting an external suitable capacitor across terminals. For the front end converter, a single-phase full bridge IGBT converter offers bidirectional power flow for the machine operates as a motor and generator modes. For the machine end converter, half bridge IGBT converter offers excitation of the generator. The performance evaluation like electromagnetic torque, speed, power factor etc. for variable speed of a prime mover is given. The correctness of the proposed system is verified by simulation using MATLAB/Simulink.

It is always a research hot spot of resource constraints project scheduling. However, with development of economy, project scheduling environment is also changing, some uncertain factors influences project scheduling seriously. It is resource constraints fuzzy project scheduling. This paper studies the problem of resource constraints project scheduling, and it also researches more exec-mode pattern project scheduling which is more realistic. In this paper, it designs a new optimization algorithm that is GLS (a new optimization algorithm &#8212; GLS is proposed in this paper). Based on linear weighted utility function, GLS combines the multi-objective combinatorial problems into single objective combinatorial optimization problem, then generates target weight coefficient vector to solving minimization problem. At last the authors prove certain advantages of this proposed method comparing with contrast validation methods.

In this work fuzzy control was used to control the temperature of an aqueous solution of caustic soda. The main objective was to develop and implement a controller based on fuzzy logic theory as an alternative for process control in the brewing industry. The efficiency of this novel control strategy was then established given the actual results obtained. These results demonstrated the utility and efficiency of fuzzy control to control an industrial process with long range and fast changing characteristic variables. The fuzzy logic controller thus designed and used, showed a great adaptability through a change in the knowledge base

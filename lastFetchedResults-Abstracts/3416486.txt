This paper presents a timing optimization technique based on gate duplication. The relationship between gate duplication and delay reduction is first examined, and then the notion of duplication gain for selecting good candidate gates to be duplicated is introduced. The objective is to obtain maximum circuit delay reduction with the minimum number of duplications. Experiments on benchmark circuits show that this technique leads to a significant delay improvement.

This paper presents an objective evaluation of the effects of stimulus type and eye tracking specifications on the accuracy of biometric verification based on complex eye movement patterns (CEM). Five stimulus types (simple, complex, cognitive, random, textual), six spatial accuracy tiers (0.5&#176;, 1.0&#176;, 1.5&#176;, 2.0&#176;, 2.5&#176;, 3.0&#176;), and six temporal resolution tiers (1000 Hz, 500 Hz, 250 Hz, 120 Hz, 75 Hz, 30 Hz) are evaluated to identify their effects. The results suggest the use of eye tracking equipment capable of 0.5&#176; spatial accuracy and 250 Hz temporal resolution for biometric purposes, though biometric accuracy remains achievable for systems capable of at least 1.0&#176; spatial accuracy and 30 Hz temporal resolution. While not conclusive, the complex and textual pattern stimuli provided the greatest accuracy, with little difference between the remaining stimuli.

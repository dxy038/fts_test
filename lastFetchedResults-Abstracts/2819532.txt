Internet has evolved and grown tremendously during the last years. WeÂ´re living the rise of the &#8220;self-made&#8221; Web Services. On the one hand, this conception reduces the limitations for the creation of new Web Services capable of operating on top of the large Internet technological foundation, while on the other it has some drawbacks such as: slow creation process, long time-to-market, deep knowledge of many Internet Technologies, no standardization, no interoperability and no quality control. All the aforementioned characteristics lead to a strong fragmentation of technology and Web Services. The Future Internet initiative instantiation by European Commission in form of Private-Public Partnership (PPP) Program has the objective to populate Internet with common conceptual components (Generic Enablers or GE) to enable a faster and interoperable service creation. FI-WARE is the technological core foundation project of the PPP program that provides specifications and reference implementations of the most common generic enablers and deploys them on its test-bed for public and evaluation usage. The Publish/Subscribe and the Semantic Annotation GEs that the project has provided and installed in the FI-WARE test-bed are demonstrated in this paper.

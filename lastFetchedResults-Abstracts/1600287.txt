In the present paper, an approach is proposed for structural topology optimization based on
combination of Radial Basis Function (RBF) Level Set Method (LSM) with Isogeometric
Analysis (IGA). The corresponding combined algorithm is detailed. First, in this approach, the
discrete problem is formulated in Isogeometric Analysis framework. The objective function
based on compliance of particular locations of materials in the structure is used and find the
optimal distribution of material in the domain to minimize the compliance of the system under
a volume constraint. The refinement is employed for construction of the physical mesh to be
consistent with the mesh is used for level set function. Then a parameterized level set method
with radial basis functions (RBFs) is used for structural topology optimization. Finally, several
numerical examples are provided to confirm the validity of the method.

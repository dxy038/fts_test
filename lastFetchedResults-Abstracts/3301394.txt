Object: to analyze the relationship between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patterns and biochemical parameters in chronic kidney disease (CKD) population; and to discuss the practicality and application of the Informations Sharing System. Method: clinical informations and laboratory tests results of CKD population were input into the system. Diagnosis of TCM patterns and laboratory tests results of eligible cases were output via the system by ETL tool. Selected data were analyzed using SPSS. Results: 1) all CKD patients were diagnosed as deficiency-excess complex pattern. In the component of deficiency pattern, 80.2% (267 cases) was spleen-kidney qi deficiency, 7.5% (25 cases) was spleen-kidney yang deficiency and 12.3% (41 cases) was dual deficiency of qi and yin. As to the component of excess pattern, 51.4% (171 cases) was dampness-heat with blood stasis, 45% (150 cases) was dampness turbidity with blood stasis and 3.6% (12 cases) was blood stasis; 2) in comparison between different types of deficiency patterns, there were significant differences in biochemical results, including PT, APTT, ALB, Ca and GLU. Laboratory results of PT, APTT, ALB, HGB, HCT also showed statistic differences among various excess patterns. Conclusion: The TCM patterns correlated with western pathology in CKD population, which provided objective references of TCM patterns diagnosis. This study revealed the integrated function of clinic and research in the Information Sharing System and showed the design method for similar medical data system.

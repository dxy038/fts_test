Objective: The dichotic auditory-verbal memory test (DAVMT) is one of the tests available to assess the function of auditory-verbal memory. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of gender on the results of the Farsi version of this test. Method: In this cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, the Farsi version of DAVMT was administered to 110 (55 female and 55 male) right-handed young individuals with the mean age of 21.3±1.7 years (ranging from eighteen to twenty-five), and the scores of the two groups were compared in independent samples using t-test. In addition, the ability to recall words as a function of their position in the list was compared between males and females using multivariate ANOVA.  Results: The mean score of "DAVMT" was 6.73±1.0 in females and 6.30±0.98 in males. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the scores of the two groups in DAVMT (P=0.025). Analysis of serial effect showed no significant difference between males and females in the recall of words from the primacy and recency regions of the list (primacy, p=0.188; recency, p=0.551). However, the ability to recall words from the middle portion of the list was significantly different between the two groups (p=0.005). Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, the Persian version of "DAVMT" indicates difference in memory function between the two genders, which is in line with the findings of most studies on this type of memory.

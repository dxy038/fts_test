Job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is very important and has a lot of applications in industrial and service sectors. With good job-shop scheduling, facilities can save time and money. Real-life JSSP is a very big challenge to researchers because of its high complexity. Standard JSSP is a typical NP-hard problem in the strong sense without considering any additional factors. In the real-life JSSP, we need to consider one or more of some factors like transportation times, parallel processing, setup times, and so many factors according to the problem nature. In this paper, we presented a simulation model by Arena simulation software to solve an example from the OR-Library with some modifications considering some factors from the real-life JSSP to show the capability of the proposed approach as shown in section 4. The objective function is to minimize the makespan.

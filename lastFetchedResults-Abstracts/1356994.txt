In the present work, a multi-response optimization method is used to optimize the machining parameters in turning of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites. Parameters like spindle speed (N), feed rate (f) and depth of cut (d) are taken to obtain the responses such as surface roughness (Ra) and material removal rate (MRR). Taguchiâ€™s L9 orthogonal array has been used for machining the work-piece. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been carried out to check the significant process parameter in a single objective performance characteristic. The multiple performance characteristics have been analysed using Grey relational analysis and an appreciable result has been reported with this approach.

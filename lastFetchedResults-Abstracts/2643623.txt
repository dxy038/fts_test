Introduction: Restless legs syndrome is a sensory-motor disorder that causes sleep disorder. The syndrome in patients undergoing hemodialysis has to do with depression, sleep deprivation, performance disorder, day fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, stress and anxiety, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this systematic meta-analysis study was to estimate prevalence of restless legs syndrome in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Methods: Twenty-six articles published between 2000 and 2015 indexed in Iranian (MagIran and IranMedex) and international databases (SID, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Pre Quest, and Scopus) were selected. Data analysis was carried out through meta-analysis (random effect model) and heterogeneity of the studies was determined using I2 index. The obtained data were analyzed in STAT (11.2).

Results: Prevalence of the syndrome according to the articles found and was 50% (95% CI: 38-61) in Iranian and 30% (95%CI: 23-37) in international databases. There was an ascending trend of prevalence of the syndrome corresponding to the publication year of the articles (P = 0.419), while the trend based on age of the patients was descending (P = 0.604); however, the variations were not significant. &nbsp;

Discussion: Given the high prevalence and considerable effects of restless legs syndrome on patients undergoing hemodialysis, it is recommended that the patients be screened for the syndrome.&nbsp;

This paper presents a novel zero-voltage switching (ZVS) approach to a grid-connected single-stage flyback inverter. The soft-switching of the primary switch is achieved by allowing negative current from the grid side through bidirectional switches placed on the secondary side of the transformer. Basically, the negative current discharges the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistorÂ´s output capacitor, thereby allowing turn on of the primary switch under zero voltage. To optimize the amount of reactive current required to achieve ZVS, a variable-frequency control scheme is implemented over the line cycle. In addition, the bidirectional switches on the secondary side of the transformer have ZVS during the turn- on times. Therefore, the switching losses of the bidirectional switches are negligible. A 250-W prototype has been implemented to validate the proposed scheme. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and superior performance of the converter compared with the conventional flyback inverter.

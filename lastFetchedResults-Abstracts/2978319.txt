The anisotropic reflectance behavior of Earth surfaces presents an important problem for the interpretation of remotely sensed data. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adequately describes the properties of most surfaces. It specifies the behavior of surface scattering as a function of illumination and viewing angles at a particular wavelength. The knowledge is crucial for accurate interpretation and maximum use of wide angle or off-nadir data from spaceborne and aircraft sensors. A new technique to obtain the BRDF of natural surfaces under natural conditions in a short time is introduced using the very high resolution wide angle CCD line camera WAAC (Wide Angle Airborne Camera) on a rotating device

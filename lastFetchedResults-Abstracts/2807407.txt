This paper presents a custom-made model of photovoltaic (PV) generator and a simple procedure for estimating the optimum allocation of PV generation units in distribution systems. The approach is based on a single-target model in which the objective is loss minimization. This work explores the application of a Monte Carlo method for loss minimization in a three-phase distribution system when considering the time varying shape of the node loads and that only solar generation is connected to the system. The procedure has been implemented in an open software platform in which OpenDSS is driven from MATLAB and uses a multicore distributed computing environment.

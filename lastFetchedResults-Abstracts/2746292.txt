The synthesis-based sparse representation model for signals has drawn considerable interest in the past decade. Such a model assumes that the signal of interest can be decomposed as a linear combination of a few atoms from a given dictionary. In this paper we concentrate on an alternative, analysis-based model, where an analysis operator-hereafter referred to as the analysis dictionary-multiplies the signal, leading to a sparse outcome. Our goal is to learn the analysis dictionary from a set of examples. The approach taken is parallel and similar to the one adopted by the K-SVD algorithm that serves the corresponding problem in the synthesis model. We present the development of the algorithm steps: This includes tailored pursuit algorithms-the Backward Greedy and the Optimized Backward Greedy algorithms, and a penalty function that defines the objective for the dictionary update stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dictionary learning in several experiments, treating synthetic data and real images, and showing a successful and meaningful recovery of the analysis dictionary.

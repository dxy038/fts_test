Process selection for repair of mechanical components due to wear and corrosion, e.g. damage of aluminum casting housings of fuel injection systems, is based on cost and response time factors, provided that the mechanical performance is maintained within acceptable limits. One of the promising and emerging repair technologies is Cold Gas-Dynamic Spray (CGDS) coating, where a high-pressure gas propels fine powder particles to very high velocities to produce surface coating. It is essential to identify the optimum process conditions and powder composition to produce repaired surfaces with tribological properties close to those of the originally manufactured part (without coating). The objective of this work is to compare the dynamic friction and fretting wear properties of the repaired surfaces using various types of coating composition and spraying techniques. Eight types of CGDS coatings, applied to AMS 4260 aluminum specimens, were fretted against 440C stainless steel specimens at low and high nominal loads to assess their fretting wear resistance, dynamic friction properties and damping capacity. The optimum coating composition and process conditions were identified. In comparison to the uncoated specimen, this optimum coating offered tribological characteristics close to the uncoated material and even better dynamic friction properties.

This paper presents ontology based cloud service discovery mechanism that aims to provide cloud users to find desired cloud services over the internet. The main objective is to construct cloud ontology on the basis of services and attributes, that helps to rearrange the query and to discover the cloud services for userÂ´s requirement. Cloud ontology brings various CSPS services under same name convention which makes identity and management of services easier. It uses cloud ontology to analyze and process the query. Cloud services are stored as individuals under the cloud ontology and properties are defined for each individual. The results about the services are fetched from the cloud ontology of each and every CSP by using the processed query. The various parameters such as SLAs: cost, software Licenses, security etc., are taken into consideration to sort the cloud services. The search engine is implemented using owlapi, sparqldl, and Jena packages with the java environment to retrieve services from cloud ontology directory.

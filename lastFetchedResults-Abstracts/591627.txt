There are varieties of QFD combination forms available that can help management to choose
the right model for his/her types of problem. The proposed MOCC-QFD-FMEA model is a right
model to include variety of objectives as well as the risk factors into the model of the problem. Due to
the fact that the model also takes into consideration the concept of Fuzzy set, it further allows
management the flexibility in his/her modeling as well as decision making. The mathematical models
presented in this article demonstrate the process of development of the equivalent deterministic form
of chance constrained programming for the QFD and FMEA combined systems. The final model
presented is a linear multi-objective goal programming problem that can be solved by a linear goal
programming program.

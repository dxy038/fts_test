Experience has shown that austenitic piping is susceptible to IGSCC in the weld root area under BWR service conditions. Besides non-optimized materials, the residual stresses which are an inherent result of conventional welding processes are also responsible for this susceptibility. In the past, mechanical, thermal and welding post-treatment processes were developed and used with the objective of reducing tensile stresses in the root area. This paper discusses past experience and more recent developments, in particular the latest results with pipe welds treated by means of welding processes (last pass heat sink welding). These measures are suitable for producing compressive stresses in the medium-swept ID-HAZ of austenitic welds, or to at least significantly reduce the tensile stresses and thus practically eliminate the risk of IGSCC.

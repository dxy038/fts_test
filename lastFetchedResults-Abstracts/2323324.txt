Objective(s):Cytochrome P-450 1A1 is an important enzyme in the first phase of the metabolism of some carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as estrogen. The present study evaluates the existence of CYP1A1 polymorphism in a number of breast cancer samples.
Materials and Methods: One hundred breast cancer patients and the same number of healthy controls were analyzed for the A2455G polymorphism of cytochrome P-450 1A1 by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique.
Results: Frequency of heterozygote genotype (A/G) indicated significant increase in case group (17%) compared to control group (7%) (OR=2.7; 95% CI=1.07-6.89; P-value=0.03). The related result of (A/A) genotype showed significantly decreased risk of breast cancer (OR=0.34;                  P-value=0.01). Higher frequency of heterozygotes was mainly observed among premenopausal breast cancer patients.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the CYP1A1polymorphism may be useful for predicting breast cancer risk in our study population.

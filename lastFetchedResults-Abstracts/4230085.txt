A simple transformation of the quadratic objective which recaptures the linear nature of the original minimum-wirelength objective is proposed for module placement operations. Computational results for a wide range of standard benchmarks show that this refinement gives very significant savings in both total wirelength and channel width for linear placement: these values are respectively reduced by an average of 7% and 18% over results obtained with the previous standard approach

The authors describe the development and operational characteristics of a prototype bidirectional AC-DC power converter based on a novel topology, suitable for feeding the DC link of voltage-fed inverter drives. The circuit uses fewer components than proposed alternatives and exhibits significantly less supply current distortion than the conventional capacitively smoothed rectifier circuit. Experimental results showing operation in the monitoring mode, in the regenerating mode and during mode changeover are given, confirming the feasibility of the proposed circuit

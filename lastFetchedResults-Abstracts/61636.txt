Hybrid electrical vehicles and electrical vehicles are being actively developed. A hybrid electric vehicle motor design requires high efficiency, high power/weight ratio, and reliability from low rotor speed to high rotor speed. The permanent-magnet synchronous motor is used in order to fulfill these requirements. The purpose of this paper is to develop a permanent-magnet synchronous motor control method for all rotor speeds. This method increases the torque and the efficiency at high speed when compared to the ordinary current error feedback method. A method composed of two compensators is proposed to achieve this objective. One of the compensators controls the torque using the voltage phases. The other one is the ordinary current error feedback. Several correcting methods for the voltage phase compensator have been proposed for the compensator for many control demands. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed using simulation and experimental evaluations.

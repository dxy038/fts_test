Background: The objective of the current study was to assess the effects of royal jelly supple-mentation on body weight, total daily energy and macronutrients intakes in type2 diabetic fe-males.
Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, fifty female volunteers with type2 diabetes were as-signed into the supplemented (n=25) and placebo (n=25) groups, given a daily dose of 1000 mg royal jelly soft gel or placebo, for 8 weeks, respectively. Before and after the intervention, body weight and height of subjects were measured and body mass index was calculated. Dietary intake of patients was assessed using 24-hour food recall questionnaire for three non consecutive days (including 1 weekend day) and analyzed with Nutritionist IV software. The normally distributed data were compared using paired and independent t-tests, where appropriate.
Results: Royal jelly supplementation significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the mean body weight
(72.45±4.42 vs. 71.00±6.44 kg) while it increased insignificantly in placebo group (73.02±6.44 vs
73.52±6.80 kg). Royal jelly supplementation resulted in significant decrease of mean daily total
energy (P < 0.01) and carbohydrate (P < 0.01) intakes, while in placebo group the mean daily total
energy and fat intakes were increased significantly (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Supplementation with royal jelly may be beneficial in weight management of di-abetic patients.

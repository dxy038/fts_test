A technique for providing error protection without the additional overhead required for channel coding is presented. The authors start from the premise that, during source coder design, for the sake of simplicity or due to imperfect knowledge, assumptions have to be made about the source which are often incorrect. This results in residual redundancy at the output of the source coder. The residual redundancy can then be used to provide error protection in much the same way as the insertion of redundancy in convolutional coding provides error protection. The authors develop an approach for utilizing this redundancy. To show the validity of this approach, the authors apply it to image coding using differential pulse code modulation (DPCM), and obtain substantial performance gains, both in terms of objective and subjective measures

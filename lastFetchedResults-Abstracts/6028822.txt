The beampattern of MIMO (Multiple-input Multiple-output) radar is the product of transmitter and receiver beam pattern. Exploiting uniform linear array, the beampattern has no grating lode when a certain relation between the space of transmitter element and receiver element is met. Moreover, this kind of collocation takes on maximum virtual array aperture. Exploiting non-uniform linear array, the beampattern will have better performance. Giving the restriction of array aperture and the number of element and constructing objective function based on minimum side lobe, we make use of GA (generic algorithm) to optimize the element position and then get the non-uniform linear array collocation scheme. Simulations verify the validity of the proposed method.

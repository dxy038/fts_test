Objective For the purpose of service
planning, an instrument was developed for the systematic
assessment of interventions needed by the
caregivers of schizophrenia patients. Method The
development of this instrument was based on indepth
interviews and focus groups. It consists of 18
areas describing common problems of schizophrenia
caregivers. For each of these problem areas several
possible interventions are offered. Concurrent validity,
inter-rater and retest reliability were tested among
50 caregivers. Results The kappa values for the interrater
reliability are predominantly excellent (kappa >
0.75). The values for the retest reliability show a wide
range between excellent (kappa > 0.75) and fair
agreement (kappa 0.40â€“0.60). The significant correlations
found between summary scores of this new
instrument and several sub-scales of the Family
Problem Questionnaire support the assumption that
the concurrent validity is satisfactory. Conclusion
These results suggest that this instrument is both
valid and reliable.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides a flexible architecture for service composition. Service composition can be integrated by atomic Web services developed independently by their providers. With increasing number of alternative services that implement similar functionality but provide different non-functional (QoS) characteristics, service composition becomes a service selection problem. This paper proposes an efficient service selection approach to facilitate the selection of QoS-based services. The objective of this approach is to obtain a feasible solution with less time. Moreover our approach supports different aggregation structures. The results of experimental evaluation show that our approach can achieve a near-optimal solution very efficiently.

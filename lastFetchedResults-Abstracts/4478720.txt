Wafer-level test during burn-in (WLTBI) has recently emerged as a promising technique to reduce test and burn-in costs in semiconductor manufacturing. However, test during burn-in can lead to significant power variations in the die. This variation adversely affects the accuracy of predictions of junction temperatures and the time required for burn-in. We present a test-pattern manipulation technique for WLTBI, where the objective is to minimize the variation in power consumption during test application. Test-pattern manipulation is carried out by carefully filling the don´t-care bits in test cubes. The X-fill problem is formulated and solved using an efficient polynomial-time algorithm. Simulation results are presented for the ISCAS´89 and the IWLS´05 benchmark circuits, and the proposed technique is compared with three baseline methods that carry out pattern manipulation to minimize peak-power consumption.

Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of task type on fundamental frequency (F0) and the short-term repeatability of average airflow values in preschool/kindergarten-age children. Study Design Prospective, experimental. Methods Thirty healthy children (age 4.0â€“5.11 years) were included in this study. Participants completed three tasks (sustained vowel, counting, and storytelling) used to elicit measurements of F0. With a 10-minute interval, participants also completed two trials of sustained /a/ at a comfortable pitch and loudness level for the measurement of average airflow rate. F0 and intensity of the vowel production were recorded for both trials. Results A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect for task type elicitation on F0 values (Pآ =آ 0.0003). A significant difference between elicitation tasks for F0 was observed in the comparison of the counting and storytelling task (Pآ <آ 0.0001). A paired t test revealed no significant difference in average airflow rate across two trials (Pآ =آ 0.872). The change in F0 and intensity was measured across the trials, and separate analyses of covariance revealed that these changes did not significantly influence average airflow values, (Pآ =آ 0.809) and (Pآ =آ 0.365), respectively. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrated that F0 may be influenced by task type in young children. Average airflow values appear to be stable over a short time period. This information is important in determining methods of evaluation and the reliability of instrumental measures in young children with voice disorders.

Business Applications Performance Corporation (BAPCo) was founded in May 1991 to create objective performance benchmarks that are representative of the typical business personal computer environment. These benchmarks are intended to provide an accurate means of comparing the performance of industry standard architecture hardware systems while executing commercially available applications. BAPCo benchmarks are designed to measure overall system performance. Three initial workloads are planned: standalone, multitasking and network. The standalone workload will use DOS and Windows applications and will be BAPCoÂ´s first product. BAPCo will also publish a newsletter periodically with current benchmark data. Since the standalone workload will produce a single number to characterize performance for each category, users may compare system performance in each category, if desired. BAPCo workloads will help users make informed hardware platform performance comparisons that will relate to their normal business environment.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

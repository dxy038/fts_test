The objective of seismic signal deconvolution is to extract from the signal information
concerning the rockmass or the signal in the source of the shock. In the case of blind deconvolution, we
have to extract information regarding both quantities. Many methods of deconvolution made use of in
prospective seismology were found to be of minor utility when applied to shock-induced signals recorded
in the mines of the Lubin Copper District. The lack of effectiveness should be attributed to the inadequacy
of the model on which the methods are based, with respect to the propagation conditions for that type of
signal. Each of the blind deconvolution methods involves a number of assumptions; hence, only if these
assumptions are fulfilled, we may expect reliable results.
Consequently, we had to formulate a different model for the signals recorded in the copper mines of the
Lubin District. The model is based on the following assumptions: (1) The signal emitted by the shock
source is a short-term signal. (2) The signal transmitting system (rockmass) constitutes a parallel
connection of elementary systems. (3) The elementary systems are of resonant type. Such a model seems to
be justified by the geological structure as well as by the positions of the shock foci and seismometers. The
results of time-frequency transformation also support the dominance of resonant-type propagation.
Making use of the model, a new method for the blind deconvolution of seismic signals has been
proposed. The adequacy of the new model, as well as the efficiency of the proposed method, has been
confirmed by the results of blind deconvolution. The slight approximation errors obtained with a small
number of approximating elements additionally corroborate the adequacy of the model.

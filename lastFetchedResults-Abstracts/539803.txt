The objective of this research was to study the effects that the extract of rhizome and root of Helleborus odorus W. et K. (Ranunculaceae) can have on modifications in the parameter values of white blood cells count and degree of phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes in Wistar rats. The trial was conducted on 28 rats divided into 4 groups with 7 animals in each group. To the control group of rats sterile physiological solution in the quantity of 0.25 mL/100 g BW was applied intramuscularly. For the purpose of monitoring the effect of the extract of rhizome and root of hellebore (HE) during a time period, the HE was applied intramuscularly to rats in a dose of 10 mg/100 g BW, while the blood samples for analysis were taken after 24h, 48h and 72h. The consequence of intramuscular application of HE was an increased count of total leukocytes in all trial groups, the most expressed leukocytosis being registered 24h after application of HE. Statistically significant higher value in the count and percent of neutrophil granulocytes in the blood was recorded 24h after treatment in relation to the control and two other trial groups (p<0.001), among which a statistical significance was not established. The extract of hellebore rhizome and root has led to lymphopenia, resulting in the increase of the neutrophil/limphocyte index in the trial groups 24h and 48h after treatment. The application of HE had no significant effect on the count of monocytes in treated animals. The applied extract has caused a significant increase in the degree of phagocytosis by residing peritoneal macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes in blood.

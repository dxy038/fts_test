Firms world-wide are actively engaged to achieve internationally accepted quality levels to ensure their position in the emerging international market especially those from developing economies. Unfortunately the construction industry, generally, has lagged behind other industries in implementing Total Quality Management (TQM) which provides excellence in customer satisfaction through continuous improvements of products, processes or services. The main reason for construction lagging has been the perception that TQM is for manufacturing and service sectors rather than the construction sector. The objective of this research is to study the implementation of quality management of construction projects in West Bank, Palestine. Construction sector is considered as a vital sector in todayÂ´s economy, due to the development in construction which is taking place in the world in general and the West Bank. A survey of 300 contracting companies registered with the Palestinian Contracting Union (PCU) was conducted to establish the current quality management practices and managers perception of factors required for a successful implementation of TQM.

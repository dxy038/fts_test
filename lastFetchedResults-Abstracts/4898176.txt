The paper presents a novel discrete optimization approach to optimally solve the sizing problem of capacitor for the voltage stability enhancement in radial distribution networks using Discrete Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO technique. The novel optimization approach using Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO is implemented to tackle a number of conflicting goals that define the complex optimality problem. The equivalent generic single-line system model (EGSLM) is applied. Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO is then carried out to find the optimal capacitor bank sizes that minimizes several conflicting objective functions.

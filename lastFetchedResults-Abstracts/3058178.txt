This work presents a bidirectional positioning system (BPS) that provides a physical location bidirectionally between mobile stations for ubiquitous computing. BPS uses a trilateration computation by the time-of-flight of an ultrasonic signal and shares the physical location of mobile stations through a main server. The performance of BPS is confirmed through benchmarking of positioning systems.

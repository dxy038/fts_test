The objective of this study was to assess the effect of sage, at levels of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.15% (w/w), on the oxidative stability of Chinese-style sausage stored at 4 Â°C for 21 days. The results showed that inclusion of sage in sausages resulted in lower L* values (P &lt; 0.05) and higher a* values (P &lt; 0.05) compared to the control. During refrigerated storage, sausages containing sage showed significantly retarded increases in TBARS values, and in the formation of protein carbonyls (P &lt; 0.05), but showed accelerated losses of thiol groups (P &lt; 0.05). Addition of sage to the sausages at levels of 0.1% and 0.15% reduced textural deterioration during refrigerated storage (P &lt; 0.05). Sage used in this study had no negative effects on the sensory properties of sausages.

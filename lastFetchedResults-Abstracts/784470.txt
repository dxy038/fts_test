Objective: To examine whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration were
associated with low muscle strength while taking into account the effects of potential confounders among a
cohort of community-dwelling women aged 75 years and older. Design: Cross-sectional study corresponding to
the baseline assessment of the EPIDOS study. Setting: Five French cities including Amiens, Lyon, Montpellier,
Paris and Toulouse. Participants: Randomized sample of 440 women included in the EPIDOS study.
Measurement: Maximal isometric voluntary contraction strength of the lower limb and hand with computerized
dynamometers, serum 25OHD and parathyroid hormone concentration. Age at baseline evaluation, number of
chronic diseases, body mass index (BMI), use of calcium drug, practice of a regular physical activity, serum
calcium concentration and clearance of creatinine were used as covariables. Subjects were separated into 3
groups based on serum 25 OHD levels with the following cut-off values: < 15 ng/ml, 15-30 ng/ml and > 30
ng/ml. Results: More than 90% of women had a serum 25OHD insufficiency (i.e. < 30ng/ml) and 40.2% had a
related secondary hyperparathyroidism. The mean value of muscle strength was not different among the 3 groups
of women (174.9±53.2 for serum 25OHD < 15 ng/ml versus 175.9±52.6 for serum 25OHD 15-30 ng/ml versus
173.4±53.1 for serum 25OHD > 30 ng/ml with P=0.946 for quadriceps, and 56.1±13.2 for serum 25OHD < 15
ng/ml versus 57.1±13.5 for serum 25OHD 15-30 ng/ml versus 61.1±12.7 for serum 25OHD > 30 ng/ml with P=
0.064 for handgrip). There was no significant association between serum 25OHD concentration and quadriceps
strength (crude   = 0.03 with P = 0.891 and adjusted   = -0.04 with P = 0.837). Univariate linear regression
showed a significant association between serum 25OHD concentration and handgrip strength (crude   = 0.16
with P = 0.049) but not while using an adjusted model (adjusted   = 0.13 with P = 0.106). Conclusions: The
findings of this study do not support the hypothesis of a relationship between low serum 25OHD concentration
and low muscle strength. Further research is needed to corroborate and explain this finding

Survivability against link failures in WDM optical networks with dynamic traffic, i.e. requirements that change in time, has become very important because it is a more realistic approach than static traffic. This work evaluates the efficiency of the protection method based on p-cycles or pre-configured protection cycles, with a multi-objective approach, optimizing simultaneously network resources as well as the amount of needed reconfigurations in the nodes when working capacity changes. With this purpose we have developed a new multi-objective genetic algorithm which calculates both objectives. We also show experimental results, analyzing the effects of the small-batch size of requirements in each network reconfiguration, and the stability of p-cycles, i.e. the variation of these parameters in each time period.

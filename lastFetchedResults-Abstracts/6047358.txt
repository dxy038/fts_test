A methodology for analysis of human supervision in industrials processes is presented. The main issue is the modelling and creation of guide lines for human behaviour, through the study of different decision sequences in front of several dynamic processes. Processes are developed with a software generator of dynamic systems, for carrying out tests and data extraction. On the other hand, since industrial programmable logic controllers are very common, this study is complemented with the development of an artificial agent based on sequential control with the final objective of the comparison between the agent and the human behaviour in order to obtain a classification of different conducts

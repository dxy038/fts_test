Objective
To investigate how the mode of delivery affects the level oxidative stress in newborns.
Design and methods
15-F2t-isoprostane, as index of oxidative stress, was measured in umbilical cord plasma samples from 37 infants born after vaginal delivery or caesarian section, using specific immuno-affinity extraction and immunoassay.
Results
15-F2t-isoprostane levels were higher in infants born after vaginal delivery (n = 18) compared to those delivered by elective caesarian section (n = 19).
Conclusions
15-F2t-isoprostane is a sensitive biomarker of fetal oxidative stress during labor.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of muscle stretching on meat quality and ultrastructure of biceps femoris (BF) from beef. After slaughter, the right side of the carcasses were suspended from the Achilles tendon (AS; n = 10), while the left sides were re-hanged from the pelvic bone (PS; n = 10). Meat quality was evaluated by water holding capacity (WHC), cooking loss (CL), color, shear force (SF) and sarcomere length (SL). As a result, PS had no impact on WHC, CL and color parameters. PS significantly decreased SF values by 7.5% only at 2 days postmortem. At pelvic suspended sides, SL was increased by 0.13 μm, 0.14 μm and 0.12 μm at 2, 7 and 10 days postmortem, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Electron microscopy showed that the ultrastructure of BF have longer sarcomeres and smaller fiber diameter after PS. In conclusion, PS is a useful method for improving tenderness by stretching muscles.

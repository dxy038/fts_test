<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the status of serum zinc in pregnant women in different gestational ages and correlation with socio-demographic and anthropometric factors in Iranian women referring to prenatal care public health clinics<br />.<strong>Materials and methods: </strong>We analyzed the zinc concentrations in plasma samples obtained at different gestational ages from 961 women and recorded BMI at the first trimester in pregnant women who were screened for a trial designed to evaluate the zinc concentration. Subjects were from different socio economical backgrounds and attended public health clinics for their prenatal care. All analyses were performed by SPSS (version 16). P values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.<strong><br />Results: </strong>The results showed that after plasma zinc concentrations were adjusted with Parity, weight (early pregnancy), BMI (at early pregnancy), age and educational statues. Plasma zinc deficiency declined as gestational age progressed, however it was not significant. There was no significant correlation between zinc concentration, anthropometric, method of contraception and socio factors. However, there were significant relation between parity (p = 0.007) and weight at early pregnancy (p= 0.039) with serum zinc levels.<strong><br />Conclusion: </strong>We conclude that plasma zinc concentrations decreased during the late first trimester to the early third trimester and with parity. These findings may indicate that the deficient levels of zinc in the latter third of pregnancy suggest a tendency for insufficient maternal nutrition. However larger studies are required to support this finding.</p>

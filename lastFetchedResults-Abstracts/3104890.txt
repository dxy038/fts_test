A simplified predictive current controller for the three-phase bidirectional voltage source PWM rectifier is proposed. Firstly, the mathematic model in synchronous d-q coordinate is founded in the discrete-time domain. Then the simplified predictive current controller with state feedback decoupling is designed and analyzed. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional predictive current controller and improve the control system dynamics, the effect of the control time delay is considered. Furthermore, by selecting the current error vector and the output voltage error vector as the additional state variables, a linear state feedback loop is added to the control system to achieve the feature of deadbeat. The steady state performance and dynamic response are investigated. Simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed predictive current controller.

The objective of this work is to develop a quick and simple method for the in situ monitoring of sugars in biological cultures. A new technology based on Attenuated Total Reflectanceâ€“Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR/ATR) spectroscopy in combination with an external light guiding fiber probe was tested, first to build predictive models from solutions of pure sugars, and secondly to use those models to monitor the sugars in the complex culture medium of mixotrophic microalgae. Quantification results from the univariate model were correlated with the total dissolved solids content (R2 = 0.74). A vector normalized multivariate model was used to proportionally quantify the different sugars present in the complex culture medium and showed a predictive accuracy of &gt;90% for sugars representing &gt;20% of the total. This method offers an alternative to conventional sugar monitoring assays and could be used at-line or on-line in commercial scale production systems.

Non-oil exports are among important variables that are influenced by exchange rate fluctuations. Since exchange rate fluctuating during last three decades in Iran, the effect of exchange rate volatility on non-oil exports was studied. To achieve this objective, exchange rate uncertainty estimated by generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (GARCH). Then, for estimating the relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and exports for 1980-2010 period, vector error correction model (VECM) and vector regression (VAR) were used. The results showed that exchange rate uncertainty had a significant negative effect on non-oil exports both in short and long terms with coefficients of 1.06 and 7.29 respectively.

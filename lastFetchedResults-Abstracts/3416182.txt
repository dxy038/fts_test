This paper is concerned with the mathematical modeling and analysis of a radio communication system design problem that seeks an optimal location of a single transmitter, or that of multiple transmitters, in order to serve a specified distribution of receivers. The problem is modeled by discretizing the radio coverage region into a grid of receiver locations and by specifying a function that estimates the path-loss or signal attenuation for each receiver location, given a particular location for a transmitter that communicates with it. The resulting model is a nonlinear programming problem having an implicitly defined objective function of minimizing a measure of weighted path-losses. Specializations of three nonlinear optimization algorithms, namely, the Hooke and JeevesÂ´ method, the quasi-Newton, and conjugate gradient search procedures are investigated for solving this problem. The technique described here is intended to interact with various propagation prediction models and may be used in a CAD system for radio communication system design

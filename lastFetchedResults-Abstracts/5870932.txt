This paper advocates curtailing system real power losses of the existing power system. To attain the objective a technical, maintenance and commercial based optimization methodology has been proposed to evaluate the optimal losses to be allocated at the appropriate locations along the feeders decided by loss sensitivity analysis. The method is tested on 11KV, medium voltage and Low tension power system networks, proving that the technique is effective. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

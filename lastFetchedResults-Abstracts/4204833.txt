A useful algorithm for minimizing harmonic voltage distortion levels with multiple APLCs in a power system is presented. The algorithm provides a practical method to decide where the APLCs should be located in a network and what sizes of APLCs are best. The effectiveness of this algorithm is illustrated by a distribution system example. Simulation results show that the algorithm is simple and efficient, and can be easily extended to other harmonic-related network objective functions.

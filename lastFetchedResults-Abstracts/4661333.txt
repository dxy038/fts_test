In this paper, man-machine-environment reliability model of aircraft electromechanical system was established by introducing the reliability of man and environment into the system reliability analysis, during which, man, machine and environment factors should be regarded as a large series system and taken into consideration. The objective of the this model was to quantify the influence degree of human error and complex environment on the system reliability. In addition, the system reliability simulation platform was built according to Monte Carlo simulation method, which could facilitate the parameters setting and obtain the system reliability under different initial conditions. The electromechanical system failure was analyzed and the value of man, machine and environment reliability in the system was obtained. When the system reliability was available, man, machine and environment reliability could be determined by employing this value, which contributed to the qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation of the electromechanical system.

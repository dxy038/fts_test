Introduction: Vocal cord nodule is one of the most prevalent disorders of laryngeal mucosa which is commonly caused by the overuse of laryngeal vocal function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of speech therapy on laryngeal stroboscopic features of patients with vocal cord nodules.

Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, five women with vocal cord nodules aged between 14 and 45 years participated in a speech therapy program. Their laryngeal stroboscopic features were assessed in the first and ninth sessions of therapy.

Results: After speech therapy, glottal closure in 3 subjects reached to complete closure or near to it. Symmetry of phases in 3 cases reached to symmetrical condition and periodicity of phases in 1 patient reached to periodical state. After speech therapy, right mucosal wave in 4 subjects reached to normal condition. The left mucosal wave in 1 subject reached to normal and in 1 patient approached to normal form.

Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that speech therapy has a gradual influence on treatment of vocal cord nodule which can be evaluated by subjective methods such as therapist's assessment of patient's voice or objective methods such as stroboscopy.

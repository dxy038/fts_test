Exploration of various features and different structures of data dependent random forests in screening for laryngeal disorders through analysis of sustained phonation recorded by acoustic and contact microphones is the main objective of this study. To obtain a versatile characterization of voice samples, 14 different sets of features were extracted and used to build an accurate classifier to distinguish between normal and pathological cases. We proposed a new, data dependent random forest-based, way to combine information available from the different feature sets. An approach to exploring data and decisions made by a random forest was also presented. Experimental investigations using a mixed gender database of 273 subjects have shown that the Perceptual linear predictive cepstral coefficients (PLPCC) was the best feature set for both microphones. However, the LP-coefficients and LPCT-coefficients feature sets exhibited good performance in the acoustic microphone case only. Models designed using the acoustic microphone data significantly outperformed the ones built using data recorded by the contact microphone. The contact microphone did not bring any additional information useful for classification. The proposed data dependent random forest significantly outperformed traditional designs.

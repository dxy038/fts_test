This paper proposes a transcutaneous bidirectional telemetry solution using resonant electromagnetic coupling and pulse interval modulation for low power loss and high performance in neuro-stimulator. The resonant electromagnetic coupling model is established on the base of resonance electromagnetism theory, and relationships between coupling coefficient, displacement tolerance, resonance frequency and telemetry distance are studied experimentally. One air-core coil is used as a time-shared transmitter and receiver antenna for controller, and one ferrite-core coil is used as the counter part for implantable device, which decreases the volume of the implantable part. Experiments verified that the average power consumption was about 33 uW for implantable part in this device under the testing condition of over 10 cm telemetry distance between the implantable part in titanium container and controller. Simultaneously, telemetry device is with good displacement tolerance.

Power transformer is a strategically important component of power system due to its location and size. Sudden failure of power transformer has both technical and economical impacts. Studies indicate that inter turn fault is one of the major cause of transformer failure. Detection of presence of such fault at an early stage is important to avoid further damage. Objective of this paper is to analyse the characteristics of current during inter turn fault using Park´s vector and symmetrical components approach. Comparative assessment of Park´s vectors and symmetrical components is also discussed. Use of percentage deviation of vectors from healthy condition is proposed for identification of existence of such fault.

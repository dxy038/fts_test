The main objective of the project was to implement a portable hardware-independent DVB-T/H software receiver, providing a complete tool of signal analysis and measurement. As a computer-based program, this receiver could run either embedded inside a vector signal analyzer, or separately on a PC remotely connected to it. Thanks to its modular architecture, the receiver can be updated to demodulate any other digital standard with relatively little effort. The result is a complete software-based tool of digital signal analysis, which could also be designed as programmable logic (PFGA) to improve the general performance of the system.

Cereal products (flour and semolina) are of great importance in the Tunisian diet. Over one million tons of cereal (soft and hard wheat) are consumed a year. Bread, pasta and couscous are the main forms of cereal consumption providing more than 70% of dietary proteins. The SMID, a wheat grinding company has implemented the ISO 22000 system involving essentially the prerequisite programs (PRPs) and the HACCP principals. The objective of this study is to determine food safety practices and procedures related to the food safety management system (ISO 22000). The PRPs were identified to prepare for the HACCP.

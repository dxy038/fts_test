The paper proposes a novel neighborhood search operation of particle swarm in the numerical objective space (eg.R<sup>n</sup>), and employs the clonal selection strategy which leads the particle swarm to find the optima of the objective space using the neighborhood search operation. So, a novel particle swarm algorithm based on the clonel selection strategy (NPSA/CS) is proposed. In the test experiment, 6 unconstrained benchmark functions are used to demonstrate the performance of NPSA/CS, and compared with CPSO, PSO, GA, DE. The results show that NPSA/CS can find the optimal or close-to-optimal solutions of those benchmark functions efficiently.


Populus euramericana is one of the most important species for agroforestry in Iran. Nowadays, several non-native clones of the species have been imported to the country. But their individual differences are unknown and important to us. The objective of this research was to determine the differences among five clones of the species based on two important enzymes, peroxidase and catalase as environmental bio-indicator from late summer to early spring. Therefore, quantitative activities of the enzymes were studied by spectrophotometry method on asexually propagated seedlings of the clones. Results indicated that the majority of the differences for peroxidase and catalase were observed during March and January respectively. Generally the results showed that peroxidase activity of clone 45/51 during the beginning and the end of growing season and also both enzymes activities of clones 561/41 and I214 had the highest differences with other clones during the cold months of the year.

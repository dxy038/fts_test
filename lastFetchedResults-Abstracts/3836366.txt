Microfluxgate sensors have been developed to measure very low magnetic fields, of about some nanotesla. This paper describes a recent integrated solution coupled with the basic microfluxgate component. The objective is to decrease the noise level of the sensor down to a few nanotesla per square root of hertz. The technological solution consists of adding coils or single layers, thanks to which the required ac transverse magnetic field can be applied. A large enhancement of the sensor sensitivity is put in evidence on output signal figures with and without stabilization signal. The specifications of the sensor connected with its electronics are also presented.

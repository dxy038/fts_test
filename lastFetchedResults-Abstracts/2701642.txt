In this paper, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate a bidirectional Terabit+ ultradense wavelength-division multiplexing (UDWDM) coherent passive optical network with Nyquist shaped 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, offering up to 10 Gb/s service capabilities per user/wavelength in a total spectrum of 12.8 nm over 40 km of standard single-mode fiber. This paper first demonstrates the capability of Nyquist pulse shaping to mitigate crosstalk arising from back-reflections and nonlinear effects in UDWDM networks with coherent transceivers. The latter part of the paper experimentally investigates the bidirectional transmission in terms of receiver sensitivity and nonlinear tolerance under different network transmission capacity conditions, e.g., number of users and bit rate per users.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for measuring perfusion and blood volume, especially cerebral blood volume (CBV). In case of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, the conventional techniques only partially determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of contrast medium (CM) exchange between different compartments. Here a modified pharmacokinetic model is applied, which is based on the bidirectional CM exchange between blood and two interstitial compartments in terms of the fractional volumes of the compartments and the vessel permeabilities between them. The evaluation technique using this model allows one to quantify the fractional volumes of the different compartments (blood, cells, slowly and fast enhancing interstitium) as well as the vessel permeabilities and cerebral blood flow (CBF) with a single T1-weighted dynamic MRI measurement. The method has been successfully applied in 25 glioma patients for generating maps of all of these parameters. The fractional volume maps allow for the differentiation of glioma vascularization types. The maps show a good correlation with the histological grading of these tumors. Furthermore, regions with enhanced interstitial volumes are found in high-grade gliomas. Differences in permeability maps of Gd-DTPA apart from BBB disruption do not exist between different tissue types. CBF measured in high-grade glioma is less pronounced than it would be expected from their blood volume. Therefore pharmacokinetic imaging provides an additional tool for glioma characterization.

Tuberculosis is still a health problem throughout the world. Both genetic and environmental factors may contribute the susceptibility to tuberculosis. Toll-like receptors play a critical role in the recognition of mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between TLR8 rs3764880 and TLR9 rs148805533 polymorphisms and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a sample of Iranian population. In this study, blood samples of 320 subjects including 160 PTB patients and 160 healthy subjects were collected. DNA was extracted and TLR8 rs3764880 polymorphism was analyzed by Tetra Amplification Refractory Mutation System-Polymerase Chain Reaction (TARMS-PCR) and TLR9 rs148805533 polymorphisms was analyzed by allele specific PCR. The allelic and genotypic frequencies of the TLR8 rs3764880 did not differ significantly between PTB and the controls. No significant difference was found between the groups regarding TLR9 rs148805533 polymorphism. TLR8 rs3764880 and TLR9 rs148805533 polymorphisms may not be risk factors for susceptibility to tuberculosis in a sample of Iranian population. Larger studies are required to validate our findings.

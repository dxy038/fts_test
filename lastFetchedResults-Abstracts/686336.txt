The objective of this article is to investigate the validity of a modeling system developed for forecasting atmospheric dispersion, the POLYPHEMUS platform, with a special focus on radionuclides. The platform is briefly described and model-to-data comparisons are reported for three cases: the ETEX campaign, the Chernobyl accident and the Algeciras release. The results are similar to those usually given in the literature by state-of-the-art models. Some preliminary sensitivity analysis indicates the main sources for uncertainties.

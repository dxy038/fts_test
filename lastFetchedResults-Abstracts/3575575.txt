This investigation presents a novel 50-GHz interleaved bidirectional transmission system with eight wavelengths that uses four-port interleavers in a bidirectional recirculating loop. This bidirectional configuration shares optical components in the fiber network and an interleaver is utilized to enable unidirectional amplification in an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to block noise associated with Rayleigh backscattering. After bidirectional transmission through 500-km LEAF fibers in the recirculating loop, power penalties of less than 2.5 dB were achieved at 10 Gb/s for all channels

Objective
Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (RIC) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are increasingly used for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-BMT). RIC has been shown to allow engraftment with minimal early transplant-related mortality (TRM). However, in the context of RIC, the use of bone marrow (BM) as stem cell source is still little evaluated.
Patients and Methods

In this report, we analyzed the outcome of 32 high-risk patients with hematological malignancies who received an HLA-identical sibling allo-BMT after RIC including fludarabine, busulfan, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).
Results

Sustained neutrophil and platelet recovery occurred at a median of 13 days (range, 10–19) and 17 days (range, 0–45) respectively. Early and durable full donor chimerism could be established as soon as the first month after allo-BMT. Also, a sustained and early CD8+ T-cell recovery was observed, but the CD4+ T-cell compartment remained profoundly low. The cumulative incidences of grade II–IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 26% (95% CI, 11–41%) and 31% (95% CI, 15–47%) respectively. The overall cumulative incidence of TRM was 28% (95% CI, 12–44%) occurring mainly in patients aged over 50. In this setting, GVHD showed a protective effect on disease progression or relapse with better progression-free survival for patients with GVHD as compared to patients without GVHD (p = 0.03).
Conclusions

Collectively, these results confirm that the use of BM grafts for RIC is feasible with durable donor engraftment and no detrimental GVHD.

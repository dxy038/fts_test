A three-node optical time-division multiplexing (OTDM) network is demonstrated that utilizes electroabsorption (EA) modulators as the core elements. Each node is self contained and performs its own clock recovery and synchronization. "Drop and insert" functionality is demonstrated for the first time with an EA modulator by completely removing a 10-Gb/s channel from a 40-Gb/s OTDM data stream. A different 10-Gb/s channel was subsequently inserted into the vacant time slot. Clock recovery is achieved by using an EA modulator in a novel bidirectional configuration. Bit-error-rate (BER) measurements are presented for each of the 10-Gb/s OTDM channels.

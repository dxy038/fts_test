According to the Holy Qur'an, human life is intermingled with trials, having a mutual relationship with man's perfection and elevation. As objective models of Divine trials, prophets are chosen and reported intelligently in the Qur'an. The central issue in this research is to draw a revealed pattern of the trial of prophets and analyze its components, emphasizing on the story of Abraham (a) in the Qur'an. The main axes of the research are as follow: clarifying what trial as well as its components is; analyzing the main trials of Abraham; and comparing them to the components of the Qur'anic trials. As a result, this research represents a model for a research on trial as a method for prophets` trials, as come in the Quran, to be well understood.

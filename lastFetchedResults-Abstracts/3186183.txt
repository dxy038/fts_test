This paper describes the R&amp;D Project FlexZell. FlexZell is an industrial automation showcase including hardware and software as well as mechanical components. The objective of the project is on the one hand the implementation of a flexible, fully automated production line with special emphasis on quality aspects, on the other hand the possibility of sharing this knowledge with pupils, students and SMC (small- and medium-sized companies). It combines various disciplines of industrial automation, like robotics, image processing and analysis, and CNC-based manufacturing. The FlexZell is organized into different process modules, which can be used independently or integrated into an automated industrial manufacturing process. The first process step determines the kind and orientation of the raw material. It communicates the results via PROFIBUS to the KUKA industrial robot module of FlexZell. The industrial robot will handle the part into the CNC-based milling-machine, which is mechanically coupled to the FlexZell. After the milling process is complete, the robot will handle the part into an optical inspection system module. There, the serial number as well as the dimensions of the part will be measured and transmitted into a database system. Finally, the robot will sort the part into the corresponding output tray of FlexZell, according to the quality results. The collected measurement data, together with different process related data is used as the basis for Quality Management and Statistical Process Control. The FlexZell can be used stand-alone in the class-room as well as together with the CNC milling machine in the lab. Students will be able to test the influence of different setups on the resulting quality of the parts manufactured.

Generally, the environment and enterprises´ condition are not stable, in order to promote the enterprises´ competitive power, managers must continuously improve the business processes´ performance. Based on the simulation method and multi-objective optimization theory, the thesis builds a dynamic multi-objective optimization model for business process optimization. Firstly the framework of optimization model is introduced, the framework include logic of the simulation process and parameters´ selection. Secondly, a business process´s performance review model is given for evaluation, and also point out that there is a balanced point among time, cost and quality, and the point can help us to find the optimal design of business process. Finally, the thesis provide a experiment to verify the validity of the model put forward by the thesis, and the result prove that the model is effective in optimization of business process.

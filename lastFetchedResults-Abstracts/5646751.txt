Embedded digital signal processors and general purpose processors will use barrel shifters to manipulate data. This paper will present the design and implementation of the barrel shifter that performs logical shift right, arithmetic shift right, rotate right, logical shift left, arithmetic shift left, and rotate left operations. The main objective of the upcoming designs is to increase the performance without proportional increase in power consumption. In this regard reversible logic has become most popular technology in the field of low power computing, optical computing, quantum computing and other computing technologies. Device scaling is limited by the power dissipation; and demands better power optimizations methods. Techniques like Energy recovery, Reversible Logic are becoming more and more prominent special optimization techniques in Low Power VLSI designs. Rotating and data shifting are required in many operations such as logical and arithmetic operations, indexing and address decoding etc. The feynman gate will remove the fanout. By comparing the quantum cost, number of ancilla bits and number of garbage outputs the design is evaluated. The performance characteristics of the proposed design are evaluated, and the transistor cost, Garbage outputs and Quantum Cost are also calculated. The performance characteristics analysis is carried out in Xilinx environment.

In this paper focusing on the Information and Communication Technology sector (ICT sector) in Iranian Input-Output table and a method of policy evaluation is designed which gives a deeper insight of interaction between policy objective (output) and policy control(final demand). The method used is based on a specific matrix decomposition that allows for the quantification of an aggregated scale effect, called Macro Multiplier. Therefore, this study, applying Macro Multiplier methodologies based on Iran's 1999 Input -Output table. The application results show the policy 1 is dominating policy .Using the structure 0.9vl+0.1v3 ,we can observe a high growth on output of the ICT industry in Iran.

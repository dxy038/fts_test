Objective To identify patients’ and carers’
perceptions of need in inpatient and community
settings and investigate the relationship between need
and caregiver burden. Method The study was conducted
across a metropolitan mental health service in
Sydney, Australia. Patients (n=407) and carers (n=50)
completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short
Appraisal Schedule. Carers also completed a shortened
version of the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire
to assess caregiver burden. Results When completing
the assessment tools, patients and carers in hospital
settings were asked to consider the 4 weeks preceding
hospitalisation; in the community, patients and carers
were asked to consider the previous 4 weeks. These
data show a high percentage of patients in hospital and
community settings have unmet needs for company,
daytime activities and intimate relationships. Inpatients
had more unmet needs than community based
patients. Agreement between patients’ and carers ratings’
of need ranged from ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’. There
was a strong relationship between unmet need and
burden from the carer’s perspective. Patients with and
without carers had similar numbers of needs. Carers of
patients recently admitted to hospital reported a significantly
higher burden. Conclusions Carers of inpatients
experienced significantly more burden than
carers of outpatients. Opportunities to access support,
information and education should be readily available
and not contingent upon demonstrating a close familial
relationship to the patient. We found that unmet need
was significantly related to burden, suggesting that
meeting patient needs could reduce carer burden

The method of analysis developed for the planar-array case is extended to the problem of a conformal array arranged on a parabolic cylindrical surface with the objective of computing the scattering properties of the curved array. The results obtained can be used for the design of curved frequency selective reflectors and radomes. Although the discussion is based on a parabolic cylindrical surface, the technique can be extended to deal with other surface geometries as well. The surface current on each patch is assumed to be the same as the current induced on the center patch of a planar array which is tangential to the parabolic cylindrical surface at the patch. The planar array problem is solved by the spectral GalerkinÂ´s method. The scattered pattern from each of these patches is computed from the current induced on the patch. The superposition principle is the invoked to obtain the scattering from the conformal array.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

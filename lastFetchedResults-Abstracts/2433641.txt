Objective (s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based educational intervention for increasing exercise to prevent osteoporosis in pre-menopausal women.
Methods: This study used a randomized controlled design to evaluate an 8-week exercise education intervention program based on the Health Belief Model and Self Regulation construct to prevent osteoporosis in 140 pre-menopausal women.
Results: The results of post intervention and 3 months follow up revealed that individuals in the experimental group had a positive and significant progress, whereas no progression occurred in the control group. After the intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in physical activity, muscle strength and feasibility, with no significant changes in the control group.
Conclusion: These results support the applicability of the integrated model for a physical activity intervention in order to prevent osteoporosis in women.

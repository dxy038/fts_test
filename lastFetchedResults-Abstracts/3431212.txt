A burst-by-burst (BbB) adaptive speech transceiver is proposed, which can drop its source coding rate and speech quality under transceiver control in order to invoke a more error resilient modem mode among less favorable channel conditions. The adaptive multirate (AMR) speech codec is operated at bit rates of 4.75 and 10.2 kb/s and combined with source sensitivity-matched redundant residue number system (RRNS) based channel codes. BbB adaptive joint detection aided code division multiple access is used for supporting the dual rate speech codec. Both the objective and subjective speech quality assessments favored the proposed BbB adaptive transceiver.

In the construction of new socialist countryside of China, exploring the way of regional agricultural development, based on the comparative regional advantages of different regions has been the theme of study in the aspect of government´s countryside policy. On the basis of regional comparison of the agricultural development of China, , we analyzed the regional comparative advantages of the main agricultural produce in China with the method of the grey decision-making of the multi-objective situation. The results show that there are regionality in the production of agricultural produce and regional differences in farmers´ income levels and the trade of agricultural products. With the gray decision-making analysis, we clarified the relative advantages of the region of the 31 provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions). For example, the advantages of Beijing are maize, wheat, fruits, edible oil and legume. The order of 12 kinds of corps compared by province is also determined.

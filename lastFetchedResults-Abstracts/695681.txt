Aims: Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that is caused by pyogenic bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungus. This study has performed to determine the best experimental antibiotic treatment of chronic osteomyelitis that caused due to Staphylococcus aureus infection .
Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted, on 145 war veterans with osteomyelitis from 2007 to 2011.T test method was used to find the sensitivity and antibiotic resistance in patients with Staphylococcus aureus.
Results: Study results classified into 3 categories: sensitive, resistant and moderately susceptible. The most effective antibiotic on S. aureus was vancomycin that wasnâ€™t resistance in none of the cultures, 36% of the cultures were sensitive to vancomycin. On the second category there was Ticoplanin with 5.0% resistance. The most ineffective antibiotic was  cotrimoxazole that 73% of cultures were resistant to it. In 54.8 percent of cultures Estafiloc was reported resistance to meticilin. In 107 % of Staphylococcus aureus resistant cases were sensitive to cotrimoxazole. 
Discussion: According to the fact that taking the culture results is different at least from 24 hours to 15 days, cases prepared in smear were observed from positive cocci wound. Vancomycin or Tykvplanyn can be used to the time of preparation of culture results.TO decide to select each of these antibiotics factors such as Cost, availability of medicines, discharge, and medication side effects are important.

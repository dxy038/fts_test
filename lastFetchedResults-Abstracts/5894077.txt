This paper describes a new modelling and simulation approach in order to observe the system behaviour and eventual faults. It is based on hardware-software co-modelling with multi-level of granularity to get multi-level of simulation speed. Our modelling approach let integrate the hardware specifications to the functional model in order to establish also hardware supervision models after HW/SW co-modelling and simulation.To reach this objective we have to have a relationship between the desired accuracy of the supervision and the level of granularity of the hardware-software model, for every ECU (Electronic Computing Units) that belongs to an automotive embedded architecture.

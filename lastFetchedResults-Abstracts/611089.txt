In this paper, we consider the fuzzy open shop scheduling problem
with parallel machines in each working stage where processing times
are vague and are represented by fuzzy numbers. An open shop
scheduling problem with parallel machines in each working stage
under this condition is close to the real production scheduling
conditions. A mixed-integer fuzzy programming (MIFP) model is
presented to formulate this problem with the objective of minimizing
makespan. To solve small-sized instances, an interactive fuzzy
satisfying solution procedure is applied. Since this problem is known
as a class of NP-hard, a novel discrete electromagnetism-like (DEM)
is proposed to solve medium to large size examples. The DEM
algorithm employs a completely difference approach. It makes use the
crossover operators to calculate force and move particle is used. We
employ Taguchi method to evaluate the effects of different operators
and parameters on the performance of DEM algorithm. Finally to
assess the performance of the algorithm, the results are compared with
an existing EM algorithm from the literature and benchmark
problems. The result exhibited the ability of the proposed DEM
algorithm to converge to the efficient solutions.

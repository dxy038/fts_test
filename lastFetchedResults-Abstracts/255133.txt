In this paper the installation and long-term operation of a system for continuous monitoring of
fumarolic gases is described. Several physicochemical and gas-geochemical parameters such as the
concentration of CO2, H2S and CO in the fumarolic emissions, as well as the temperatures of the hydrothermal
steam and soil in close vicinity of the fumarole and steam pressure are measured in short-time intervals
(typically 15 seconds). Data are logged on-site and in parallel transferred to a remote station by digital
telemetry. Specially developed software enables the real-time observation of the local conditions in the crater
and full bidirectional control of the monitoring system. Fluctuations in the monitored parameters are also
reported. From the data presented it can be concluded that environmental conditions (direction and strength of
wind, precipitation) will interact with some of the parameters monitored. These influences can only be revealed
by continuously operated monitoring systems.

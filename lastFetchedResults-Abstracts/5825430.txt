The objective of the present paper is to give a summary of the theory of the bifrequency analysis for the class of linear time-varying (LTV) systems. The emphasis is on the frequency characterization of dynamic systems using the classical two-dimensional Laplace transform (2DLT). The merit of this powerful technique, which has not sufficiently been explored, is illustrated by examples.

The author considers the problems of filtering and smoothing for LG (linear Gaussian) hybrid-state regime-shift signal processing systems where a totally observed state process is generated by a linear stochastic differential equation whose parameters are functions of a random jump process called the regime. The objective is to compute the conditional probability distribution of the regime variable at each instant of time, given the data set relevant to filtering or smoothing. The pertinent continuous-time equations are given as well as results of a computer simulation for a power system application

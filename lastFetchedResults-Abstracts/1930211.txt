The current work has as main objective the systematic investigation of sperm morphometric characteristics of fertile Bos taurus and Bos indicus bulls living in Brazil by using several traditional as well as more modern and advanced computer vision concepts and methodologies. Ten smears of B. taurus semen and ten smears of B. indicus semen have been evaluated. Sperm morphology was quantified in terms of the following morphological features: head area, perimeter, width, length, width:length ratio, ellipticity, shape factor, width of sperm basis, the three first Fourier values, symmetry and hydrodynamics. Morphometric differences have been observed between the sperm cell of B. taurus and B. indicus bulls. The sperm cells of Zebu bulls tend to be smaller and less elliptic, however without modifying hydrodynamic, side symmetry and width of sperm head base. These differences clearly indicate that the geometrical characterization of bull sperm cells should take into account morphological peculiarities that are specific to each subspecies. Another important contribution is the identification that morphological differences implied by bulls of different fertility, as characterized by other authors, were found to be less as compared with those obtained in the current study where highly fertile animals from the two subspecies were studied.

The best utilization order of multi-water resources is the key point of water resources allocation. The considered assessment indexes include not only the quantitative elements, but also the qualitative elements which are difficult to be quantized. Based on the semi-structured and multi-objective fuzzy optimization theory, this paper sets up a model which evaluates synthetically the proper order of utilizing water resources.

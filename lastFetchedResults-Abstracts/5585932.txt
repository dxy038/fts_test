SITS(shipping intelligent transportation system) operation is complex problem for decision making, which plays an important role in our countryÂ´s society and economy as well as in our multi-modal transportation system. Based on the analysis of network planning optimization method for SITS operation, this paper establishes the quality - duration - the cost optimization model with the characteristics of network planning for SITS operation. Then it proposes the multi-objective optimization method based on NSGA-II. The method is GA that using non-dominated sort about crowding distance and elitism strategy. Through chromosome coding based on process, it optimizes the search space of solution. With the roulette wheel selection, arithmetic crossover and mutation operation, this paper gets the Pareto optimal solution collection that can allow decision-makers to choose. At last, an example confirms that the optimization method can solve the Pareto optimal solution collection from establishing the optimization model, using MATLAB7.0 simulation program.

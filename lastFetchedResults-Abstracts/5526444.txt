In this paper, two fuzzy classification functions of fuzzy c-means for data with tolerance are proposed. First, two clustering algorithms for data with tolerance are introduced. One is based on the standard method and the other is on the entropy-based one. Second, the fuzzy classification function for fuzzy c-means without tolerance is discussed as the solution of a certain optimization problem. Third, two optimization problems are shown so that the solutions are the fuzzy classification function values for fuzzy c-means algorithms with respect to data with tolerance, respectively. Fourth, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of two objective functions are considered, and two iterative algorithms are proposed for the optimization problems, respectively. Through some numerical examples, the proposed algorithms are discussed.

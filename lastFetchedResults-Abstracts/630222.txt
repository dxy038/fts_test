The objective of this study was to investigate the binding efficiency of AFCF and clinoptilolite, mixed to the feed and administered orally using gastric tube to chronically 137Cs alimentary contaminated broiler chicks. Seventy-five male Hybro broiler chicks, between 35 and 47 days of age were divided into five groups (15 birds per group) reared in cages (five birds in a cage) and fed a standard diet. Every day during 13 days of the experimental period all chicks received orally 1 ml CsCl water solution with activity of 1310 Bq ml−1 137Cs (gastric tube). Group 1 was the control group and received no binders. The experimental groups received the binders. Group 2 received 0.2 g of AFCF in the form of water solution (gastric tube); group 3 received 0.2% AFCF in the feed; group 4 received 2 g clinoptilolite in the form of water suspension (gastric tube) and group 5 received 2% clinoptilolite in the feed. Five chicks from each group were sacrificed on days 4, 10 and 13 of the experimental period. Using gamma spectrometric methods specific activity of 137Cs was determined in the samples of breast meat, liver and gizzard.
The results obtained showed that administering binders to the chronically contaminated broiler chicks significantly (p < 0.01) reduced 137Cs transfer and deposition in breast meat, liver and gizzard. Decreasing deposition of 137Cs in breast meat and internal organs increased with time of contamination and binders' administration. With AFCF as a cesium binder, on day 13 of measuring the 137Cs activity in breast meat was 80–83% lower than that in the control group, 89% in liver and 83–84% in gizzard. Natural clinoptilolite demonstrated lower binding efficiency. On day 13 of measuring the 137Cs activity in breast meat was 53–69% lower than that in the control group, 67–60% in liver and 59–71% in gizzard.

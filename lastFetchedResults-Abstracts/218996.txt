Background/Objective: Risser's sign, a measure of excursion in the iliac crest apophysis, has been used to evaluate the remaining skeletal growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the value of Risser's sign in estimation of chronological age in a number of university-affiliated referral hospitals in Tehran, Iran.
Patients and Methods: Our study group consisted of 206 patients aged between 10 and 25 years with a stable hemodynamic condition who were referred due to trauma in regions other than the head and neck. All cases underwent AP spine and proximal pelvis radiographies. All radiographies were graded by Risser's scoring system.
Results: Among our patients, 121 (58.6%) were male and 85 (41.3%) were female. Risser's score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were seen in 13 (6.3%), 7 (3.4%), 24 (11.7%), 48 (23.3%), 35 (17%), and 79 (38.3%) of the patients, respectively. Risser's score was determined for all age groups. All cases aged over 18 years had a Risser's score >=3.
Conclusion: Risser's score is useful for the estimation of age in adults especially for legal purposes, though further multicenter studies are required for more comprehensive and precise data of the normal Iranian population.

Context-aware services are one of the key applications in the ubiquitous computing environment where physical and virtual information are seamlessly integrated across the network. However, so far we have found few discussions on architectural styles for such integration of wireless sensor networks and other networks services and objects. Conventional context aware services have been built in an ad-hoc manner, making it difficult to build new applications or evolve existing ones. The objective of this paper is to discuss the architectural requirements from several points of view such as entry barrier, extensibility, interoperability, and scalability. Then we show a service coordination framework based on REST architectural style.

The engineering quality problems in construction projects in China are investigated. It can be known that the main problems could be divided into 9 categories and 24 subcategories. There are 11 factors that resulted in the problems, which are engineering design, management methods, organizing rules, materials, instruments, technologies, project personnel, environment, objective factors, funds and schedule. By analyzing the relationships among the 11 factors according to the evidenced-management method, it is found that there exist individual effects of each factor and polyploidy effect of related factors. The polyploidy is classified and the effect degree is determined according to the judgments of 29 project management specialists. The result proves that the method of evidenced-management can be used in identifying the reason of engineering quality problem efficiently.

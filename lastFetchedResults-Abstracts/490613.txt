Objective: Several chronic illnesses are associated with obesity, such as hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of aerobic swimming and aerobic running on lipid-lipoproteins profiles in obese adolescents.
Subjects and Methods: Study participants consisted of 45 young boys (15 control, 15 swimming, and 15 running) overweight (BMI between 27.3 to 33.2 kg-m ) adolescents, aged 15 to 18 yr, studied before and after an 8-wk swimming and running. LDL-C, HDL-C, triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) were assessed via blood samples drawn from an antecubital vein.
Results: There were significant differences in the experimental group for HDL-C compared with the control group (P<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between running and swimming group in HDL-c (P>0.05). There were significant differences between experimental groups and control for TG (P<0.05). There were no differences between experimental groups and control for TC (P>0.05). There were significant differences between experimental groups and control for LDL-C (P<0.05), but no significant differences were recoded in the swimming and running group in LDL-c.
Conclusion: The results from this study suggest that in order to get suitable ballanc in lipid- lipoproteins, obese adolescents must participate in aerobic exercise such as running and swimming.

In the most applications of elasticity theory in reservoir geophysics, the elastic medium is assumed to be isotropic. But  most  of  the  crustal  rocks  
are  found experimentally  to  be  anisotropic. Old experiments showed that one of principle reasons for well deviation is laye r sequence in rocks. 
In some fields shale layers are reasons behind well deviation in undesired trajectory. This phenomenon is a costly problem in drilling th at we need 
some reform functions and use of costly directional drilling systems. The formation anisotropy modifies the rock-bit and the bit-string interactions. 
So, anisotropy determination is necessary. There are different methods for determination of anisotropy. The best of that is sei smic data. In this paper, 
determination of anisotropy parameters with using phase slowness method is the main objective.

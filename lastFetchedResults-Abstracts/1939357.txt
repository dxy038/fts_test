Inroduction & Objective: Silver nanoparticles   are very promising engineered which play an important role in the world biomedical, healthcare and in general nanotechnology applications. In this study, the necrotic effects of short and long term administrations of nanosilver on rat hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning, was investigated.
Materials and Methods : 56 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups of short term and long term injections which were treated for 5 and 10 consecutive days, respectively. Each group was divided into four subgroups of control, 100, 200 and 400 ppm nanosilver administration. The control subgroup received saline and the treatment subgroups received intraperitoneal injections of silver nanoparticles at doses of 100, 200 and 400ppm. Ten days after the last injection, the hippocampal tissue sections were prepared and the extent of necrosis was evaluated stained with Nissl.
Results: In short term (5-day injection) group, the percentage of necrotic cells between control and 100(p < 0.01), 200 and 400 ppm were significant (p < 0.001), showing statistically significant difference between control and treatment subgroups. In long term (10-day injection) group, the percentage of necrotic cells between control and  200 and 400 ppm subgroups were significant (p < 0.001), respectively, again representing statistically significant difference between control and treatment subgroups.
Conclusion: Silver nanoparticles induce necrosis in rat hippocampal cells. For the administration regime considered in this study, this apoptotic effect increases at higher doses but is independent of the duration of exposure.

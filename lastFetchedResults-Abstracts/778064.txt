In recent years, the doubly fed induction
generators (DFIGs) are used in modern wind power
plants. These generators have a large impact on the
stability of power system. In this paper, we examine the
stability of DFIG wind turbines with static synchronous
compensator (STATCOM). Optimal tuning of
STATCOM control Parameters is very important in order
to proper Performance of STATCOM as a stabilizer. To
select the best value for STATCOM parameter, ITAE
criterion as objective function is introduced then
optimization process is done by genetic algorithm with
the purpose of minimizing the DFIG rotor speed
oscillations and with the presence of a three phase short
circuit fault. After this process, the stability of DFIG is
tested with analyzing the DFIG rotor speed, DFIG active
power, and DFIG voltage. Ultimately, static VAR
compensator (SVC) as another common compensator is
introduced to compare with STATCOM in order to
minimize oscillations. Then by doing all the steps of
optimization on SVC control system the better
performance of STATCOM will be shown. All
simulation steps are executed by Matlab software.

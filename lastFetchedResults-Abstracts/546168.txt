The hub location problem is widely used in the real world, such as communications, postal services, transportation, and airline systems. This problem is applied on a network with high flow between nodes. The goal of the hub-location problem is locating some hub facilities on the nodes and allocation of other nodes to hub facilities, in order to minimize the total cost of service. The hub facilities may face a queue of service from demand nodes, due to limited service capacity and, hence, considering the queue in the model, improves the performance of the system. We consider the waiting time to receive the service, as well as the total cost of networks, as the objectives of the problem, and formulate a multi objective mathematical model under a fuzzy environment. We assume the flow rate between nodes and the service rate at hub facilities to be fuzzy numbers. To solve the derived model, we develop a hybrid intelligent algorithm by embedding fuzzy simulation into a simulated annealing method. Computational results, as well as future research potentials, were also presented.

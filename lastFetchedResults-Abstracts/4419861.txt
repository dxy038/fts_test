This paper reports on a study investigating the current state of requirements engineering problems and practice amongst small and medium software companies in Thailand. The main objective of the study was to determine areas to improve in requirements engineering processes. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with eleven small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Results show that software firms in Thailand encounter common problems such as clarity, correctness, completeness, change management, and customer communication. The result also shows the development needs in SMEs such as software process improvement, RE knowledge, requirements management tools, training, and knowledge transfer.

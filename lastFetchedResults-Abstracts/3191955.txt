The objective of this study is to investigate the different technology strategies for companies in the solar and wind industries given the dynamics of the renewable energy industry in general. We will investigate how these companies are creating value, capturing value, and delivering value. We looked at the internal and external factors that drove the competitiveness of the solar and wind companies. Literature review was conducted on the technology strategies as well as solar and wind renewable industries around the globe. Five case studies including solar and wind companies from around the world were carried out in order to understand their technologies strategies. Based on this, effective technology strategies to create, capture, and deliver value in the solar and wind renewable industries are identified.

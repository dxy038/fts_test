Objective: Phonological process es are the changes which
children make in pronunciat ion while uttering words.The present
study aimed at investigat ing phonological processe s of2-4 years
old Farsi-speaking children .
Materials & Methods: Th e subjects of this cross-sect ional and
descriptive-analyt ical study included 128 24-48 month s old
Fars i-speaking boys and girls without any auditory, visual, phy sical,
mental, sp eech, language, emotional, structural and functional
articulation disorders. They wer e selected by simple random sel ection
method from nurseries of different areas of Tehran.
The research tool was an experimental and researcher made test of
phonological processe s which were designed for this study, and
comp osed of 43 one-to-four syllable words including all Fars i phonemes
by whi ch the cat egories of syllable stru cture, consonant substitution,
vowel substitution, complete assimilation, replacement and other
processes were gathered and assessed. The data were analyzed by
Independent T-test, Man- Whitney, One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis .
Results: Findings showed no significant difference at phonological
processe s between boys and g irls (P>0.05) . Phonological processes
showed a decrease trend by increasin g age. Diffe rent age groups revealed
significant difference in syllable structure (P <O.OO I), consonant
substitution (P<O.OOI), vowel substitution (P=0.003) and complete
assimilation (P=O.003).
Conclusion: The findings of the present research reveal that gender has
no effec t on phonological processe s, but by increasing age , the se
processes decrease which may reflect greater mastery of older children
on phonological perception and pronunciation .

This paper is devoted to the study of the pseudo-Lipschitz property of the efficient (Pareto) solution map for the perturbed convex semi-infinite vector optimization problem (CSVO). We establish sufficient conditions for the pseudo-Lipschitz property of the efficient solution map of (CSVO) under continuous perturbations of the right-hand side of the constraints and functional perturbations of the objective function. Examples are given to illustrate the obtained results.

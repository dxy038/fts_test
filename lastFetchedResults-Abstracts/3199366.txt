As an important part of a modern construction project, the electromechanical equipment integrating project needs to face internal and external environment changing and different continually happening emergency. It is more and more important to carry on emergency management to achieve the given objective of the project. This paper puts the project as the main body, based on the description and analysis of the emergency of the electromechanical equipment integrating project, proposes the electromechanical equipment project emergency management program, and establishes its completed system, which provides an important reference for the design of the emergency management system, and offers a new idea of project emergency management research.

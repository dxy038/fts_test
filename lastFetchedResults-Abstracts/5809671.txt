Today, safari camps are fully powered using diesel generators due to their remote locations; however, operators are having hard time meeting with demand due to generator´s high operating cost. Concerns from government and activists are rising due to pollution and vibrations from diesel generators, which are affecting the desert´s demography. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide camp operators with viable hybrid-system (renewable/variable speed diesel generator) alternatives rather than stand-alone constant speed diesel generator. HOMER software has been utilized to simulate the proposed alternatives.

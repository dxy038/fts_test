This paper proposes an image retrieval interface based on the analytic hierarchy process. The users only need to perform a pairwise comparison between the image contents and the objective image, which is easy to conduct and can reduce the casual of userspsila decision, escaping the confliction of the userspsila thoughts. Experimental results have proven it is user-friendly and can release the userspsila burden in the retrieval greatly. Furthermore, because the retrieval results are easy to communicate, users can accumulate retrieval experience using this interface.

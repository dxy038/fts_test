Objective
To investigate the distribution characteristics of serum CETP levels in childhood.
Design and methods
CETP was measured in 912 healthy children and 40 cord blood with an ELISA.
Results
CETP was skewed in children with a median of 2.48 (2.5–97.5 percentiles: 0.56–6.96) mg/L. CETP in cords was much lower than in children, and was lower in younger children (< 1 year) than in elder children.
Conclusions
CETP is lowest at birth and sharply rises to maximum levels in infancy.

Superplastic fonning is a viable method for shaping supperallosis including
titanium based materials which are otherwise awkward to shape. Further
effort is, however, required to commercialize this process and introduce it
to metal forming enterprises. Special facilities capable of providing controllable
forming environment are needed for implementing this process. A hot
isostatic/isothermal pressing machine possessing such a characteristic is an
effective candidate for this purpose. Hot isostatic pressing has vastly been employed
for diffusion bonding, powder metallurgy and investment casting, while
its application to bulk- and sheet-metal forming needs far more investigation.
Careful selection of processing parameters such as gas pressure, strain rate,
temperature and process time is vitally important for superplastic forming of
titanium based uiorkpieces. In an attempt to advance the superplasiic forming
technology towards achieving a feasible process, the authors developed a low
price hot isothermal pressing device with the aid of which numerous forming
experiments were carried out. An additional objective pursued by the authors
was to elaborate on the analytical method superplasiic forming of lens-shaped
components which have considerable industrial applications and to illustrate the
close relation between the analytical results and the experimental achievements.

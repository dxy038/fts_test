This paper is primarily intended for students who take the courses on computer engineering. It may be useful as a reference text for practicing engineers and scientists who want to acquire some of the concepts required for computer engineering in programming languages. The main objective of this paper is to make the readers prepared for studying the subjects on computer engineering and computer languages. The features of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1. It introduces the basic classification of programming languages and explain the declarative programming languages. 2. It gives a structure of C-Program with a simple example. 3. It covers the logical and functional programming languages, Common LISP, Standard Meta Languages, and Functional programming with Haskell. 4. Each declarative programming language is illustrated by key concept, and examples with any applications so that the students can appreciate what the examples should be studied for.

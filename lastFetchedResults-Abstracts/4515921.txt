In this digest paper, we propose a speeding detection system (SDS) based on RFID Systems on Roads (RSR), which consist of RFID tags deployed on road surfaces and RFID readers installed on vehicles. The objective of SDS is to achieve full-road and all-time speeding detection. The proposed SDS incudes both the speed detection method and the RFID tag deployment method, which is critical to support speeding detection. According to the analytical and the experimental results obtained so far, SDS can successfully detect speeding even if the aggressive drivers are extremely alert.

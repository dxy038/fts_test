The objective of the study was to determine if additional dietary protein improves the lean tissue deposition and carcass merit of pigs supplemented creatine monohydrate in combination with a high glycemic carbohydrate (dextrose). Forty-eight crossbred barrows and gilts (91 ± 0.18 kg) were blocked by sex assigned to 1 of 12 pens (4 pigs/pen, 16 pigs/treatment). Treatments included: control (CON; basal diet consisting of a ground corn–soybean base), combination diet (COMBO; basal diet supplemented with 0.92% creatine monohydrate and 2.75% dextrose), and a combination high protein diet (COMBOHP; COMBO formulated to contain a minimum of 16% crude protein). Barrows on the COMBOHP gained the least 10th rib fat and expressed the highest percentage fat-free carcass lean (P &lt; 0.01) after 28 days on test. No significant treatment differences were noted in the fat and lean tissue accretion of gilts. Treatments had no affect the meat quality parameters of barrow and gilt carcasses.

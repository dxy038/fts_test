Background: Excessive hemorrhage during cesarean section increases mothers' morbidity & even mortality if they are not given transfusion timely.
Objective: To assess the incidence of blood transfusion in cesarean section and to determine whether it is necessary to reserve two units of cross- matched blood for cesarean section. Methods: This prospective study was implemented at Qazvin kosar hospital (October 2000 to October 2001). The researchers recorded the name and specifications of the patients who had received blood during surgery or recovey or 3 days after operation , afterwards through a restrospective study the accuracy of recorded statistics were verified through comparing laboratory notebook with bloods delivered to operating room and surgical ward and reviewing the notebook of operating room and patient's files.
Findings: Transfusion incidence at Qazvin Kosar hospital until 72 hours after operation was recorded 0.86% & 0.41% in the operating room. The hemoglobin average of both pre-operation & post- operation (8 hours after transfusion) were 10.9 & 8.61 respectively. Conclusion: Regarding the low incidence of blood transfusion in CS, reserving 2 units of cross- matched blood does not seem necessary and reserving the blood in the form of type & screen and having a ready and orderly laboratory with experienced personnel seems adequate.

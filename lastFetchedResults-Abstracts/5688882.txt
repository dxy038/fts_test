This paper studies the MAC layer performance in demanding wireless sensor networks. The requirements for wireless MAC are discussed based on a prominent CSMA-based MAC protocol evaluation varying critical network parameters. The objective is to investigate the current radio access technologies suitability for wireless sensor networked applications. The channel access mechanisms are analyzed in more detail, important performance parameters are derived and their behavior in different traffic scenarios is investigated through simulation based analysis.

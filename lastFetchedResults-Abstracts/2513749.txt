The objective of the study was to determine the effect of the process of natural bioremediation,
and bioremediation supported by ZB-01 microbiological preparation on the occurrence of Collembola
andAraneaein conditions of soil contaminated by petroleum-derived substances. The studies were conducted
in 2010-2012, in the area of the Experiment Station of the University of Agriculture, near Krak?w. In June
2010, the soil surface was contaminated with petrol, diesel fuel and engine oil with amount of 6 000 mg per kg
of dry mass of soil. The studies were conducted in two series. The first employed microbiological bioremediation
using ZB-01 biopreparation, and the second â€“ without applying this process. The catching of invertebrates
was done by usingpitfall traps. The results of the experiment show thatthe representatives of the
EntomobryidaeandIsotomidae families are suitable for assessing the rate of bioremediation. Epigeic spiders do
not react negatively to soil contamination.Biopreparationcaused the acceleration of the recolonisation of the
soil by representatives of the Isotomidae and Hypogastruidae families. With regard to the spiders, the
application of biopreparation eliminated the aforementioned effect of increasing the numbers of the Lycosidae
family in the object contaminated with engine oil.

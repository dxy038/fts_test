The attempt to combine image structure and color information together for improving objective image quality assessment performance is introduced in this paper. Through analyzing the respective limitation of both SSIM, which focus on image structure, and CD-PSNR, which is based on S-CIELAB and works with image color only, the additive model (SAC) and the multiplicative model (SMC)are defined respectively. Our experimental results show that the proposed combined models all perform better than single method, and we could have different choices considering different purpose and the tradeoff between complexity and efficiency.

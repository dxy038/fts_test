The objective of this study was to utilize Ca2+ and Zn2+ treatments of meat to critically explore the possible role of calpain 3 in meat tenderisation. Calpains 1 and 2 were also examined for comparative purpose. Control animals plus animals infused with CaCl2, ZnCl2 or H2O were used (six lambs per treatment) to determine the temporal changes in muscle calpain 3 protein in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) during post-mortem storage. Concurrently, the temporal changes of; (1) shear force, (2) sarcomere length, (3) proteolysis of titin and nebulin and (4) calpains 1 and 2 proteins were also determined. Infusing LTL with Ca2+ or Zn2+ caused significant up- and down-regulation of LTL tenderisation, respectively, compared to water infusion and the control animals. Furthermore, the rate of breakdown of calpain 3, the rate of proteolysis of titin and nebulin and the rate of meat tenderisation during post-mortem storage of LTL in the various treatments were highly correlated. These studies suggest that calpain 3, like calpain 1, may be involved in the tenderisation of meat through limited proteolysis of specific muscle structural proteins such as titin and nebulin.

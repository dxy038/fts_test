This paper proposes a methodology for the design of automatic load shedding against voltage instability. In a first step, the authors describe a method allowing to find the minimal shedding required in a given unstable scenario. In a second step, they describe the structure of various controllers and identify the parameters to be optimized. Next, they present an optimization approach to find the controller parameters which optimize an overall performance objective. Results are presented on the Hydro-Quebec system, in which load shedding is presently planned.

This paper describes the Defense Electronics Supply CenterÂ´s field failure evaluation program and the results achieved. The primary objective of the program is to take positive corrective action steps to assure that quality electronics parts are used in DoD weapon systems. The corrective action steps start with the validation of field failures through lab testing. Lab testing is vital in developing quantitative data and determining whether a failure is user induced or supplier related. This can be accomplished with a full compliment of testing capabilities which include electrical, physical and environmental analysis. The process flow of field failures is described from their inception to final corrective action. To illustrate this, four case studies are presented in which Lab testing and coordination with the supplier has resulted in positive corrective action thus improving the quality and reliability of the electronic components in DoD Weapon Systems

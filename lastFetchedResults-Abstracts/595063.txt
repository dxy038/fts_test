Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the results and effectiveness of caudal anesthesia used for conventional open haemorrhoidectomy and compare the results with open haemorrhoidectomy done by general anesthesia.Material and Methods: This prospective study was carried out at the department of surgery, Saidu group of teaching hospitals, Swat and surgical department, Tehsil Headquarter hospital, Matta, Swat over a period of 18 months (April 2000-Sep 2001). Pre and postoperative data of 100 patients was studied to establish the effectiveness of caudal anesthesia. Group 1 included 50 patients operated under caudal anesthesia and group 2 included 50 patients operated under general anesthesia. Age range was between 30 and 70 years.Results: Postoperative bleeding, pain and constipation was less in patients who underwent haemorrhoidectomy with caudal anesthesia as compared with those who underwent general anesthesia.Conclusion: Caudal anesthesia is as effective as general anesthesia for haemorrhoidectomy. This does not have the hazards of general and spinal anesthesia and patients tolerate it very well.

The expression of two components of the glucose-6-phosphatase system, the catalytic subunit (G6PaseC) and the glucose-6-phosphate transporter, was analyzed in the clear cell type of human renal cell carcinoma. The expression of G6PaseC was decreased in tumours compared with non-tumourous tissue of the same patient. The expression of G6PaseT varied with no general trend between tumours and control tissue. The expression of protein kinase B (PKB) was unchanged in the tumours, suggesting that the down-regulation of G6PaseC in clear cells and the maintenance of the transformed phenotype are not predominantly caused by an overexpression of PKB.

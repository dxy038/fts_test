This paper presents a survey of recent approaches which addresses solutions for current harmonic reduction in three phase three wire systems. The analyzed works are the most representative solutions focused in to obtain unity power factor in the mains or to fulfil the regulations that are applied, the main comparison is done between shunt active power filters and PWM rectifiers. The revised solutions are varied and a classification according to their operating principle, input currents and output power is done. The main objective is to identify the areas of application of each solution in particular.

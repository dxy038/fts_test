The optimization of heat exchanger design is investigated by applying the entransy dissipation theory and genetic algorithm. It is found that the role played by the fluid friction is not fully taken into account when the working fluid of heat exchanger is liquid in single-objective optimization approach. In order to circumvent this problem, a multi-objective optimization approach to heat exchanger design is established.

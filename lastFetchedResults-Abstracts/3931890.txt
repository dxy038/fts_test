For a PWM (pulse-width modulated) AC-to-DC power converter, a predicted current-control strategy with fixed switching frequency (PCFF control) is proposed. Its principle and implementation are described, and experimental results are provided showing that the converter under PCFF control has bidirectional power-transmission ability with high dynamic performance. The line currents are close to sinusoidal with unity power factor

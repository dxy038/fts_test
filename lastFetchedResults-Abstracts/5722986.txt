This paper proposes a new robust adaptive beamformer applicable to microphone arrays. The proposed beamformer is a Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) with a single-channel noise reduction stage. The single-channel stage can be either Optimally Modified Log-Spectral Amplitude (OMLSA) estimator or Adaptive Minimum Mean-Square (AMMSE) spectral amplitude estimator. These hybrid structures, named GSC-OMLSA/ GSC-AMMSE, improve noise reduction of the GSC beamformer in highly additive noisy environments where GSC alone fails to work properly. The proposed algorithms are evaluated through both subjective and objective measures like segmental SNR and log-likelihood ratio distance. The results demonstrate that GSC-OMLSA and GSC-AMMSE algorithm performs significantly better compare to GSC.

A new quantitative method of incorporating system reliability constraints in transmission expansion planning is discussed. The objective of the new algorithm is to achieve a prescribed system reliability index, the system expected demand not served (EDNS) by suitably changing network element capacities. The sensitivity of the reliability index to the respective transmission element capacities is calculated. Incremental transmission capacity is applied to the element with the greatest ability to change the EDNS, and the process is repeated in an iterative manner until the prescribed value of the reliability index is reached.

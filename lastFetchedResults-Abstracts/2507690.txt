Objective: The label and detection of cells injected into target tissues is an area of focus
for researchers. Iron oxide nanoparticles can be used to label cells as they have special
characteristics. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of iron oxide nanoparticles
on human-derived amniotic membrane stem cell (hAMCs) survival and to investigate
the magnetic properties of these nanoparticles with increased contrast in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we initially isolated mesenchymal
stem cells from amniotic membranes and analyzed them by flow cytometry. In addition,
we synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and characterized
them by various methods. The SPIONs were incubated with hAMCs at concentrations of
25-800 ?g/mL. The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on hAMCs was measured by the MTT assay.
Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of the magnetic nanoparticles as MRI contrast
agents. Solutions of SPION were prepared in water at different iron concentrations for
relaxivity measurements by a 1.5 Tesla clinical MRI instrument.
Results: The isolated cells showed an adherent spindle shaped morphology. Polyethylene
glycol (PEG)-coated SPIONs exhibited a spherical morphology. The average particle
size was 20 nm and magnetic saturation was 60 emu/g. Data analysis showed no
significant reduction in the percentage of viable cells (97.86 Â± 0.41%) after 72 hours at
the 125 ?g/ml concentration compared with the control. The relaxometry results of this
SPION showed a transverse relaxivity of 6.966 (?g/ml.s)-1
Conclusion: SPIONs coated with PEG used in this study at suitable concentrations
had excellent labeling efficiency and biocompatibility for hAMCs.

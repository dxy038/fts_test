We demonstrate a varistor-type bidirectional switch (VBS) with excellent selection property for future 3D bipolar resistive memory array. A highly non-linear VBS showed superior performances including high current density (&gt;;3&#215;10<sup>7</sup>A/cm<sup>2</sup>) and high selectivity (~10<sup>4</sup>). The non-linear I-V characteristics can be explained by varistor-type multi-layer tunnel barriers, which were formed by Ta incorporation into thin TiO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the 1S1R device showed excellent suppression of leakage current (&gt;;10<sup>4</sup> reduction) at 1/2V<sub>READ</sub>, which is promising for ultra-high density resistive memory applications.

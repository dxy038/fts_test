The purpose of this research is to develop a system for supporting dance. We have developed a database system for fundamental steps of classical ballet to manage and to utilize 3-dimensional motion data. First, we archived 543 fundamental steps obtained by motion capture systems, then constructed a 3-dimensional motion database for them. A user can search for a fundamental step and preview its motion by 3-dimensional CG. In order to retrieve motions, two approaches are applied; the first one is based on the classification of fundamental ballet motions, and the second one is based on the characteristics of 3-dimensional motion data, which are evaluated by calculating the sum of each position or rotation data along the axis. As a result of an evaluation, we confirmed that the approach using the characteristics of 3-dimensional data is valid for objective retrieval of motions.

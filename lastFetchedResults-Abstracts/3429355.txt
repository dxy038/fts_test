The <e1>L</e1><sub>1</sub> optimal control problem with rational controllers for continuous-time systems is considered in which it is shown that the optimal <e1>L</e1><sub>1</sub> performance index with rational controllers is equal to that of irrational controllers. A sequence of rational controllers that approximates the optimal index is constructed. Convergence properties of such a sequence are studied. That the corresponding sequence of objective transfer functions is shown to converge in weak-* topology in <e1>BV</e1>(<e1>R</e1><sub>+</sub>) in the time domain and uniformly in a wider sense in the frequency domain

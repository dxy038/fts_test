Objective: In patients with acoustic neuroma, the site and severity of hearing impairment are important in discussing surgical approaches. Since the effectiveness of conventional auditory psychological testing is limited, we studied objectively hearing impairment of the cochlea and the cochlear nerve due to the tumor. Methods: Electrocochleography (ECochG) was carried out in 21 patients with acoustic neuroma. Cochlear microphonic potential (CM) and action potential (AP) in ECochG evoked with clicks and short tone bursts were recorded through a transtympanic needle electrode technique. Cochlear function was studied using the detection thresholds of CM, and cochlear nerve involvement was analyzed by differences between AP and CM detection thresholds. Results: The 1 kHz CM detection threshold was elevated in 17 (81.0%) of 21 patients indicating cochlear impairment. Of seven patients with normal hearing or mild sensorineural hearing loss in pure tone audiometry, three had a slightly elevated CM detection threshold. Of five patients with pronounced pure tone levels, four showed a CM response and were thought to have mild cochlear dysfunction. Cochlear nerve impairment was confirmed in three of four patients with well-developed CM based on elevated AP detection thresholds. Three patients had CM response but no AP response, suggesting severe cochlear nerve impairment. Conclusion: Disorders of the cochlea and the cochlear nerve can be evaluated with ECochG AP and CM measurement. The findings of ECochG are thought to be important information to judge hearing prognosis, thereby enhancing its clinical utility.

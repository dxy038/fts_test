In this study, by the finite element method, the constant pressure free forming of superplastic materials is analysed. The objective of this work is to verify the approximation of the results that can be obtained, comparing the different options possible both in terms of element type and number. The numerical model, which requires lower computational resources, has been validated through a set of experimental tests using a tinâ€“lead alloy.

We will study the effects of the analog and digital previous pulse on the synchronizer jitter.We consider two previous pulse (analog or digital) with filter followed of the synchronizer. The synchronizer is one of four carrier PLL (phase lock loop) namely the analog, the hybrid, the combinational and the sequential.The main objective is to observe for the various carrier PLL, their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Squared) versus input SNR (signal to noise ratio).

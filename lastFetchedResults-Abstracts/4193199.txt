In this paper, we propose two novel approaches for the error concealment used in H.264 codec. The first one is a direction-oriented candidate set, which decides a proper candidate set of motion vectors by using the trend of collocated motion vector. The second is a predicted boundary matching criterion, which uses one-order prediction of pixel value on boundary to reduce the incurred error of traditional boundary matching criterion. Compared with the bidirectional motion vector refinement (BMVR), the proposed approaches can elevate about 0.75 dB of peak-signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value and perform well especially for the video sequences with moderate and fast motion.

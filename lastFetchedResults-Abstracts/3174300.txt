An event ontology is a shared, objective, and formal specification of an event class system model. We put forward a method of event ontology reasoning based on ´AND-OR´ relations. First, the related concepts are defined in reasoning process. Then, the convergency of reasoning algorithm is proved, and finally, an instance of reasoning is introduced. The proposed method has a certain significance for analyzing event scenarios and pre-warning disasters.

The objective was to assess the effects of trans fatty acids and oxidised lipids, present in dietary fat by-products used in feeds, on cholesterol and oxycholesterols in meat, liver and plasma of rabbits. A palm fatty acid distillate, before and after hydrogenation (trans fatty acid trial), and a sunflower–olive oil blend (70/30, v/v), before and after use in a commercial frying process (oxidised lipid trial), were used in experimental feeds (at 3%, w/w). High trans fatty acid and oxidised lipid diets caused significantly higher cholesterol and oxycholesterol levels in all tissues of rabbit (0.01 &lt; p ⩽ 0.05). The content of oxycholesterols in rabbit meat, liver and plasma obtained from trans fatty acid experiments varied from 9 to 34 μg/100 g, 24 to 61 μg/100 g and 60 to 138 μg/dl, respectively, from low to high levels. In the oxidised lipid experiments, content of oxycholesterols varied from 16 to 52 μg/100 g, 14 to 108 μg/100 g and 52 to 269 μg/dl in meat, liver and plasma, respectively. As a consequence, meat products from rabbits fed a diet containing higher levels of trans fatty acids or oxidised lipids may result in higher intakes of cholesterol and oxycholesterols by humans.

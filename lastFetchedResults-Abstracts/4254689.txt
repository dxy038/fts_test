This work presents a methodology for solving optimum allocation of power quality monitors in transmission power systems. The problem is modeled as a multi-objective problem to acquire the lowest cost solution with the highest data redundancy. The appropriate constraints are deduced by the electrical circuit topology independent of the load parameters. Extended compact genetic algorithm is used to solve the formulated problem. The proposed methodology is applied to different IEEE test systems for validation, showing the advantages of this new methodology.

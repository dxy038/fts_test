Nowadays, fiber to the home (FTTH) is considered to be the access network technology that can offer the highest speed compared to others. Certainly, the FTTH service providers aim to create the largest profit but the problem is the negligence of development strategies that will achieve the optimum objective values. To obtain the best strategies, the optimization model is proposed. This paper performed techno-economic analysis by using our proposed model in order to optimizes the tactics. Results from simulations show that operator k could make more profits than rivals when the strategies obtained from our modeling are used.

The objective of this paper is to provide a state of the art review on BICMOS technologies, their tradeoffs with respect to cost vs. performance and to outline the prospects of this technology. For this purpose, the fundamental properties of MOS and BIPOLAR are summarized, the basic technology items are discussed and the trade-off of cost vs. performance is done. Recent results are highlighted and future trends are sketched.

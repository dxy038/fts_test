Soil is known as a suitable reservoir for carbon sequestration. The objective of this study was
to investigate the capability of haloxylon on sequestration of carbon in sand dunes of Yahya
Abad, Sabzevar, in northeastern Iran. Eighty soil samples were taken from two depths of 0-5
and 5-10 cm under and between haloxylon trees. Eight soil profiles under and between
haloxylon trees were described and sampled to explore subsurface variations of soil organic
carbon (SOC). The results showed that SOC in 0-5 cm has increased from 0.18% in between
trees to 0.79% under trees and similarly, in 5-10 cm has increased from 0.11 to 0.29%. SOC has
decreased exponentially with increasing depth. A strong correlation was found between soil
organic carbon and electrical conductivity in 0-10 cm depth due to accumulation of salts in
haloxylon litters that has increased both SOC and electrical conductivity of surface layer.
The SOC storage under and between haloxylon trees at 0-100 cm depth were estimated 27718
kg ha-1 and 14915 kg ha-1 respectively, Differences of these values represents carbon
sequestration. The amount of carbon sequestration to depth of 10 and 40 cm was 5367 and
10155 kg ha-1 that is 36 and 68% of total carbon sequestration. The results of this study
confirmed the importance of haloxylon in carbon sequestration in desert environments.

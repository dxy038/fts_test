Many firms have proceeded to the adoption of Enterprise Resources Planning ERP solutions to maintain competitiveness. ERP is a packaged software system that enables enterprises to integrate operations, business processes and functions through common database. However, the majority of ERP systems do not support Preventive Maintenance (PM) scheduling process. The objective of PM is to minimize equipment downtime using the limited resources of an organization. Therefore, prioritizing PM activities for equipment is essential. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based system for PM scheduling is proposed to interpret the linguistic variables extracted from expertÂ´s knowledge for determining equipment priorities, which could be incorporated as a custom module in ERP systems. The system was tested and proved to be reliable in solving PM scheduling problem.

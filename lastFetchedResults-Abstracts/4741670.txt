In this paper, the load balance optimization problem in electronic surface mounting technology (SMT) line is considered from the aspects of the sequence of printed circuit broads (PCBs) and the assignment of component types. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time of mounting the components on PCBs in order to raise the production efficiency of the SMT line. The problem has features of both flow shop and general assignment problem. An integer programming model is established for the problem, in which the transport characteristics between each two mounting machines in the line and the mounting constraints on component types processed by one single machine are considered. By variable replacement method, the model is lineared and then the small scale instances for the problem could be solved to optimal by linear programming solver.

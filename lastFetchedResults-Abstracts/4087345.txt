The speed control of a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor drive that is fed by a current hysteresis-controlled voltage-source inverter is investigated. The objective is to study the feasibility of implementing a microprocessor-based controller that may achieve complete software control of motor speed. A mathematical model and a digital control principle for controlling the PM synchronous motor are described. The sampling period and the controller parameters are determined analytically according to a linearized model. A systematic simulation procedure is proposed for verifying the feasibility of theoretical modeling and controller design. An experimental prototype system is constructed for correlating with the theoretical results. The experimental results closely follow theoretical predictions, thus validating the proposed control method

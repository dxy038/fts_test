The objective of this paper is to present a low-power realization of a Chaotic Communication (CC) system. We propose a CC scheme that represents an efficient solution in terms of complexity, power consumption, information transmission security, and performance. the newly proposed system is realized by cascading two circuits, namely a nonlinear third order IIR filter and a modified Colpitts oscillator. It is shown that the latter circuit behaves chaotically and the synchronization mechanism can be used to build a complete communication system. The experimental results show that, in terms of power dissipation, the scheme that we propose performs much better (about 2.5 times) compared to other implementations proposed so far for CC. Directions to further decrease the power consumption are suggested

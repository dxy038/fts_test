Distributed generation (DG) and its planning are increasingly becoming more important in the power system for its advantages. This paper presents a distributed generation planning strategy based on multi-objective optimization approach. The main goal of this paper is to generate Pareto set of location and size of new DG units by minimizing different cost functions and considering the technical aspects as constraints. This Pareto set will help planners of the distribution system to make a better decision. The objectives of proposed method are cost of investment and operation, cost of energy purchased, cost of energy losses and cost of energy not supplied which are considered in this paper. Several case studies are presented in this paper to assess the ability of the proposed method for generating Pareto set. A trade off analysis is also occurred between different parameters to assess the sensitivity of planning result into varying of parameters.

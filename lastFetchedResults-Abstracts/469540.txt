Objective
The primary objective of this study was to identify specific educational goals for obstetrics and gynecology residents in the ambulatory setting.
Study design
A cross-sectional study of current practice patterns in primary care, benign gynecology, and office procedures was performed with mailings to local private practice obstetrician-gynecologists. Questions for the anonymous written survey were generated using the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology educational objectives. Telephone interviews with staff from billing offices confirmed practitioner responses.
Results
Of 88 practitioners, 43 (49%) responded. Diagnoses made in the office correlated well with the topics considered important for resident knowledge. Most important primary care diagnoses were depression and abdominal pain; important gynecologic diagnoses were abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, contraception, and vulvovaginal infection.
Conclusion
This study offers a valid, practical foundation for developing a focused ambulatory resident education program based on current outpatient obstetrics-gynecology practice patterns.

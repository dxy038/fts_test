BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity and affects approximately six to seven percent of births in developed countries. The aim of this study was to compare the tocolytic effects of nifedipine and magnesium sulfate in arresting preterm labor.
METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on 60 women with singleton pregnancies at 23-36 weeks in preterm labor (regular uterine contractions<10 min and cervical dilatation apart despite bed rest, 50 mg pethidine and 500 cc bolus ringer lactate serum). They received either oral nifedipine or interavenous magnesium sulfate.
FINDINGS: Both drugs had similar tocolytic effect. Also they had similar side effects, but in the first hour, mother pulse rate increased significantly in nifedipine group (103.3±6.65 beats per minutes and 78.9±1.99 beats per minutes) (p=0.02). Nifedipine has significantly shown faster effects than magnesium sulfate (0.63±0.24 hrs versus 4.88±3.44 hrs) (p<0.025).
CONCLUSION: Oral nifedipine with the same efficacy and faster effect could be a suitable and convenient alternative option to intravenous magnesium sulfate in arresting preterm labor.

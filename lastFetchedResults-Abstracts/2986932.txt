Flexible Assembly Systems (FASs), which are different automatic assembly product types, are finding increasing use in todayÂ´s industry. In this article, an ordered-entry array of unit stations of Generalized CSPSs, as a simple Flexible Assembly System is designed and studied. The problem will be addressed as follows: given an objective cost function, design a simple FAS to meet (as closely as possible) the given specifications. The design variables are divided into input/output variables and buffer variables. A methodology of two-stage method is introduced and proposed in order to design the system. After some considerations in the first stage of the design method, the objective function has been minimized, using the independently-computed minimum cost of each workstation (WS) by a complex-type method, at the second stage. In addition, the proposed method is compared to the GA optimization method. Based on the results from an optimization standpoint, the two-stage method seems to produce reasonable engineering results and is superior to the GA, in computational time

In our day to day life, the usage of cell phones has increased enormously. So at present, silence and security are the need of hour in many places. This can be done by using cell phone jammers which blocks all the signals. This paper describes the design of an enhanced technique for jamming the cell phone signals. Our main objective is to concentrate on a specific band of frequency, which makes the communication possible, by jamming this frequency we effectively blocks out the signals that are responsible for making calls. This method enables the jammer to be more precise and effective, so precise that it can focus on individual network and specific area. The major advancement will be that emergency services can be availed which is very crucial in case of any calamity and also it has a lesser power consumption than existing models. This technique has infinite potentials and sure can this be modified to match all our imaginations.

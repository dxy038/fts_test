Background: CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells are key controllers of peripheral immunological self-tolerance and suppress various autoimmune diseases in animal models, but few studies have been done to define their roles in myasthenia gravis (MG) so far. Objective: To investigate frequencies and dynamic changes of blood CD4+CD25+ T cells from MG patients. Methods: The peripheral blood CD4+CD25+ T cells of 29 MG patients and 23 healthy controls were detected by three-color flow cytometry. Results: Myasthenic patients with symptomatically uncontrollable disease showed slightly lower percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells (mean = 3.79 ± 1.40%; P = 0.12), whereas MG patients with clinically stable disease had significantly increased CD4+CD25+ T cells (mean = 8.45 ± 1.96%, P = 0.0001), as compared with healthy controls (mean = 4.53 ± 0.96%). In addition, thymectomized MG patients had significantly higher percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells (mean = 8.44 ± 2.39%), as compared with both non-thymectomized MG patients (mean = 5.88 ± 2.89%, P = 0.038) and healthy controls (P = 0.003). Conclusions: Our observations indicate that increased percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells in MG patients may be related to disease stability and that thymectomy in patients with MG resulted in augmented CD4+CD25+ T cells.

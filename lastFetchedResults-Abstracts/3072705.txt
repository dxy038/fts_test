This paper presents a novel solution of bidirectional high speed communications for IP traffic transport over WDM networks. Based on the observation of the bidirectional nature of traffic in the Internet bidirectional light-trails are proposed as an extension of the natively unidirectional light-trail concept. Specification of a synchronous protocol enables fairness in medium access and data delivery improving reliability of communications and enabling QoS support in WDM networks

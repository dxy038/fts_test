Transmission of visual data over communication channels introduces serious fidelity problems. The paper proposes an efficient error concealment algorithm for the image transmitted as encoded bitstreams. The proposed method introduces a multiscale Markov random field (MMRF) to model the original image. The established MMRF model is consequently employed to interpolate the missing blocks in the observing data via maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation. Compared with the conventional spatial interpolation scheme, this algorithm offers significant improvements on both subjective and objective qualities of the recovered image

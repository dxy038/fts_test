Objective: This study was conducted to compare the personal well-being among the wives of Iranian veterans living in the city of Qom. Method: A sample of 300 was randomly selected from a database containing the addresses of veteran’s families at Iran’s Veterans Foundation in Qom (Bonyad-e-Shahid va Omoore Isargaran). The veterans' wives were divided into three groups: wives of martyrs (killed veterans), wives of prisoners of war, and wives of disabled veterans. The Persian translation of Personal Well-being Index and Stress Symptoms Checklist (SSC) were administered for data collection. Four women chose not to respond to Personal Well-being Index. Data were then analyzed using linear multivariate regression (stepwise method), analysis of variance, and by computing the correlation between variables. Results: Results showed a negative correlation between well-being and stress symptoms. However, each group demonstrated different levels of stress symptoms. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression in the 3 groups showed that overall satisfaction of life and personal well-being (total score and its domains) could be predicted by different symptoms. Conclusion: Each group experienced different challenges and thus different stress symptoms. Therefore, although they all need help, each group needs to be helped in a different way.

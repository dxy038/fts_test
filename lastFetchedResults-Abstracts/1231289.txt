Three small deformation plasticity models taking into account isotropic damage effects are presented and discussed. The models are formulated in the context of irreversible thermody-namics and the internal state variable theory. They exhibit nonlinear isotropic and nonlinear kinematic hardening. The aim of the paper is first to give a comparative study of the three models with reference to homogeneous and inhomogeneous deformations by using a general damage law. Secondly, and this is the main objective of the paper, we generalize the constitutive models to finite deformations by applying a thermodynamical framework based on the Mandel stress tensor. The responses of the obtained finite deformation models are then discussed for loading processes with homogeneous deformations.

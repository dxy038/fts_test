This paper investigates the influence of backreflection on the upstream signal in the 10 Gbps bidirectional WDM PON system running on a single fiber. High backreflection light may be produced by Rayleigh backscattering, Fresnel and Brillouin backscattering and ultimately causing poor bit error rate. However the utilization of SOA that provides gain helps to overcome the network losses and should be maintained at an appropriate level to avoid further deterioration.

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is the predominant multiple access technology for future generation wireless systems. The performance of CDMA based wireless systems is largely based on the characteristics of user specific spreading codes. The objective of this paper is to highlight the various factors affecting the choice of these spreading codes and present a comparative evaluation of correlation properties of Orthogonal Gold codes, Orthogonal Golay complementary sequences and Walsh-Hadamard codes for application to next generation CDMA based wireless mobile systems.

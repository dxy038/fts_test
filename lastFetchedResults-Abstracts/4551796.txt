This paper demonstrates the development process of an atmospheric analyser and data acquisition system for unmanned aerial vehicles. In co-operation with the on-board autopilot system the application is capable of collecting, analysing and visualising atmospheric and environmental data. The objective of the data collection is to monitor the current state of the environment. The three dimensional visualisation and data analysis can be used to locate pollutants and show changes in concentrations. From meteorological point of view, temperature, pressure, humidity, dust and atmospheric gas concentrations and UV-radiation data are the most studied environmental characteristics. Our data acquisition board has dimensions of 80 &#215; 200 mm. The basic configuration contains several standard sensors such as: temperature, humidity, dust, UVA-UVB radiation, gamma detector, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> gas sensors. Additional external sensors or detectors can be connected to the board via expansion connectors and interfaces.

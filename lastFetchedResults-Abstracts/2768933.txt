This study investigates the optimal power flow (OPF) problem for distribution networks with the integration of distributed generation (DG). By considering the objectives of minimal line loss, minimal voltage deviation and maximum DG active power output, the proposed OPF formulation is a multi-object optimisation problem. Through normalisation of each objective function, the multi-objective optimisation is transformed to single-objective optimisation. To solve such a non-convex problem, the trust-region sequential quadratic programming (TRSQP) method is proposed, which iteratively approximates the OPF by a quadratic programming with the trust-region guidance. The TRSQP utilises the sensitivity analysis to approximate all the constraints with linear ones, which will reduce the optimisation scale. Active set method is utilised in TRSQP to solve quadratic programming sub-problem. Numerical tests on IEEE 33-, PG&amp;E 69- and actual 292-, 588-, 1180-bus systems show the applicability of the proposed method, and comparisons with the primal-dual interior point method and sequential linear programming method are provided. The initialisation and convergence condition of the proposed method are also discussed. The computational result indicates that the proposed algorithm for DG control optimisation in distribution system is feasible and effective.

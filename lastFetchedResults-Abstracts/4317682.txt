Second order necessary conditions are presented for an abstract nonsmooth control problem with mixed state-control equality and inequality constraints as well as a constraint of the form G(x, u)&#8712; &#915;, where &#915; is a closed convex set of a Banach space with nonempty interior. The inequality constraints g(s, x, u)&#10877;0 depend on a parameter s belonging to a compact metric space S. The equality constraints are split into two sets of equations K(x, u)=0 and H(x, u)=0, where the first equation is an abstract control equation, and H is assumed to have a full rank property in u. The objective function is max <sub>t&#8712;T</sub>f(t, x, u) where T is a compact metric space, f is upper semicontinuous in t and Lipschitz in (x, u). The results are in terms of a function &#963; that disappears when the parameter spaces T and S are discrete. We apply these results to control problems governed by ordinary differential equations and having pure state inequality constraints and control state equality and inequality constraints. Thus we obtain a generalization and extension of the existing results on this problem

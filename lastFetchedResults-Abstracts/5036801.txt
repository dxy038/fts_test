A lot of access points (APs) in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are battery powered. In order to minimize their energy consumption, the APs can adaptively adjust their transmission power and time based on various network conditions. In this paper, the problem of minimizing the AP energy consumption is formulated as an optimization problem with the constraint to satisfy the throughput requirements of associated mobile stations (MSs). Balancing the energy consumption of the APs can be important to prolong the network lifetime, particularly in a network with high and random user mobility, which can easily result in unbalanced traffic load and energy consumption among the APs. Two distributed handoff schemes are proposed for a WMN with adaptive transmission power and rate. One scheme attempts to achieve balanced energy consumption among the APs during each scheduling interval, and the other scheme balances the AP energy consumption over a longer term. Numerical results show that both schemes achieve much longer network lifetime than the traditional distance-based handoff scheme, while the long-term based handoff scheme can achieve the objective with approximately the same number of handoffs as the distance-based handoff.

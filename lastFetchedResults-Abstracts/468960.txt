Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the sublingual and vaginal administration of misoprostol for cervical priming before surgical termination of pregnancy.
Study design
In a randomized controlled trial, 74 primigravid women who were undergoing surgical abortion were assigned randomly to receive misoprostol (400 Î¼g) sublingually or vaginally.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference in the cumulative force that was required to dilate the cervix to 9 mm, for baseline cervical dilatation, for priming to abortion interval, for operating time, or for intraoperative blood loss between the two groups. Women in the sublingual group had more nausea (P = .008), vomiting (P = .01), diarrhea (P = .01), and unpleasant mouth taste (P = .0001) compared with the women in the vaginal group. In the sublingual group, 65% of women were satisfied with the route of misoprostol administration compared with 78% in the vaginal group (P = .11). Most of the staff members (84%) said that they would recommend the sublingual administration of misoprostol (P = .0001).
Conclusion
The sublingual administration of misoprostol is an effective alternative to vaginal administration for cervical priming before surgical abortion; despite a higher incidence of side effects, there was high patient and staff acceptability.

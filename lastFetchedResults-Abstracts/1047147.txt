This paper describes work in progress towards the elaboration of a Product Line practices model that combines concepts proposed by various authors. The strengths of existing Product Line frameworks and models are summarized and a new model is proposed in the form of 31 Product Line practice areas, grouped in five categories. An important objective of this Product Line practices model is that it should be easily incorporated into existing development methodologies, while remaining aligned with existing systems engineering standards.

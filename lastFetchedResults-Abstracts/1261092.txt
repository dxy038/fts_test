 This article will attempt to review the historical and scientific literature pertaining to the life and work of Felix Semon (1849â€“1921). Sir Felix Semon was one of the most distinguished figures in the early development of laryngology. He was an astute researcher of laryngeal pathophysiology and an active participant in laryngological scientific societies. Felix Semon was a talented doctor and was one of the most esteemed laryngologists in London for 35 years (1875â€“1910). Primarily, his scientific interests included complications after thyroid surgery, laryngeal cancer, tuberculosis and motor innervation of the larynx, and movement disorders of the larynx. Semon formulated the law regarding the sequence of occurrence of the laryngeal muscle paralysisâ€”abduction before adduction. The 132 articles he had published over the years have had a significant impact on contemporary medical knowledge. At the 160th anniversary of Semonâ€™s birth, we attempt to summarize his invaluable contribution to laryngology.

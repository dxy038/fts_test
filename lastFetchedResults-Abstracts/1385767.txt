The objective of the present work is to evaluate the integrated reliability of multistoried space frame subjected to random earthquake. The stochastic ground motion is described by fully non-stationary sigma-oscillatory model. The stochastic dynamic analysis is performed in the frequency domain to obtain the power spectral density function of random response. Finally, the reliability formulations are developed based on computed random response through the solution of first passage problem. A building frame idealized as a space frame in finite element modelling is considered for reliability analysis. Simple modal analysis is also performed for comparison of results.

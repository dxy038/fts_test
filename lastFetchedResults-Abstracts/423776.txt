In rural populations in Mexico, the system of ideas in relation to the reproductive cycle is built on a mestizo base, with pre-Colombian and Western elements. The objective of the study was the analysis of concepts and resources related to human reproduction in Morelos, in order to design a primary reproductive health care program. The use of ethnographic methods helped identify bio-cultural constructs on which the communities base their reproductive patterns. Our main research results reveal that these populations attribute great value to the extension of the family through descendants. Women's sexuality is directly linked to reproduction and blood is the supremely feminine substance. Great importance is consistently attributed to menstruation about which well-defined concepts exist in the community, where as pre-menarche changes are perceived as a state of bio-psychosocial maturity. Menarche beyond 14 years of age is considered abnormal and is attributed to an ‘excess of cold’ in the body, therapy is usually administered by traditional birth attendants. In the mythical explanations given for bleeding, the moon plays a fundamental role, as the first rupture of the hymen is attributed to it. A general lack of knowledge about ovulation and its relation to reproduction was observed, resulting in incorrect contraceptive practices.

A hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including battery energy storage system (BESS) and super-capacitors energy storage system (SCESS), is adopted to smooth the fluctuation of wind power, with the aim of making it satisfy the certain power quality demands at two different time scales. Based on the predictive output power of wind farm (WF), particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to determine the optimal desired power schedule for WF, which can reduce the capacity demand of HESS since the desired power schedule is closer to the wind output power while satisfying the desirable smoothing requirements. In the control strategy of BESS, the reduction of state transition of BESS is considered in the objective function, which can help to extend the lifetime of BESS. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed HESS scheduling strategy.

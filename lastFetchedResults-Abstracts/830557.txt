The main objective of this paper is to show a way of utilizing the virtual experiment technique in tribological education with reference to metal cutting. Refresh computer graphics is used to animate and display cutting tool wear process and to visualize the changes in tool wear and tool life when alter the cutting conditions and tool geometry. The built-in stochastic generator simulates the real process when machining specimens with different mechanical properties. This approach allows to study the virtual cutting process changing process variables and witnessing their effect on the wear process. A compilation of analytical and empirical models for the mechanics of cutting and for wear mechanisms serves as a foundation of the computer model. As an example of application, the model was used to emulate wear of a carbide cutting tool when machining 0.45% carbon steel. The comparison between the model and real experimental results was encouraging, thus indicating that the virtual experiment would be very useful in tribological education and for acquiring initial notions for the relationships in such a complicated process as cutting tool wear.

An irregular lattice model is used to simulate mode I fracture in softening materials, such as concrete. Lattice geometry is based on a three-dimensional Voronoi discretization of the material domain. The Voronoi diagram provides scaling rules for the elemental stiffness relations, leading to an elastically uniform representation of the material for simple modes of straining. Fracture is represented using a crack band approach, in which the dimensions of the crack band are also scaled according to the Voronoi diagram. The material is viewed as homogeneous and the energy dissipation mechanisms active at finer scales are lumped into a cohesive crack relation. This energy conserving crack band approach is objective with respect to the irregular geometry of the lattice. Model accuracy and performance are demonstrated through simulated fracture testing of concrete specimens under uniaxial tension and flexural loadings. Basic qualities of the simulation approach, demonstrated here for homogeneous models of concrete, are applicable toward simulating fracture in multi-phase systems where material features are explicitly modeled.

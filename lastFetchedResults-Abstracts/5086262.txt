The problem of fault detection and diagnosis in the class of nonlinear Lipschitz systems is considered. An observer-based approach offering extra degrees of freedom over classical Lipschitz observers is introduced. This freedom is used for the sensor faults diagnosis problem with the objective to make the residual converge to the faults vector achieving detection and estimation at the same time. The use of appropriate weightings to solve this problem in a standard convex optimization framework is also demonstrated. A LMI design procedure solvable using commercially available software is presented

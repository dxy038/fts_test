This work presents a new vectorial underwater image quality metric, dubbed the CQ, that integrates the power spectrum. Unlike existing objective underwater image quality metrics, the proposed metric consists of a discriminator C based on the slope of the log-contrast power spectrum that is able to distinguish between marine habitats when a large number of images of different environments are to be processed, and a patch-based metric Q to predict the objective quality of underwater images. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CQ metric is able to recognize underwater images with similar sharpness and correlates better with enhancement results compared to other methods, and also meet real-time requirements.

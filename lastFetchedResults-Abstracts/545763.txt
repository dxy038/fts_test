Objective 
Sleep disorders are common in children; they also have a significant impact 
on the whole family, the parents in particular. Few studies in this field have 
been performed in Iran; hence the present study was carried out in order to 
determine sleep patterns and the prevalence of sleep disorders in school aged 
children in Qazvin. 
Material and Methods 
This cross sectional study was done on 300 students (150 males and 150 females) 
of elementary schools in Qazvin, selected from cluster random samples. The 
duration of the study was from November 2006 to February 2007, and data was 
acquired by means of a standard pediatric sleep questionnaire.
Results
The prevalence of sleep disorder among subjects was 44.3% (47.3% in males, 
and 41.3% in females), and the disorder was severe in 21% of the studied 
children. Sleep patterns during the school days differed significantly from what 
was observed on Fridays (p=0.000). In addition, there was a significant difference 
between males and females in terms of duration of sleep on Fridays (p=0.014). 
Conclusion
Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders in children, their harmful 
impact on the development of the nervous system and the childâ€™s learning and 
psychological health as well as on parental competency, and again bearing in 
mind the low level of awareness among the general population about sleep 
hygiene, we strongly recommend educational programs via public media and 
via meetings with the parents in schools.

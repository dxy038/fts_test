Matrices and graph-based representations are commonly used visual models of system structures. Depending on the objective of the observer, both representations offer different opportunities and advantages. A standardized graph-based modeling language is SysML, while the design structure matrix (DSM) and the multiple domain matrix (MDM) are typical matrices used during the development of complex systems. Although both modeling techniques are wide spread, up to now they are hardly used conjointly. In order to utilize the advantages of both approaches and thus, enhance the entire development process this contribution examines the transformation of SysML diagrams to their matrix representation as a DSM or MDM, in order to analyze the models further. The approach is verified on a use case of a product-service system.

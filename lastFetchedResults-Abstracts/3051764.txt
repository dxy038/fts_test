The paper deals with a variant of the two-dimensional cutting stock, in which, we have an infinite number of identical rectangular sheets of raw material having width W and height H. The objective is to cut off a set of rectangular items while minimizing the number of used sheets. Two additional constraints are to be considered: rotation of items is not allowed and only guillotine patterns are considered. Using the concept of available rectangles, we present in this paper a modified version of the SHF algorithm to pack items on the sheets in a guillotine way. Numerical results are carried out to show the effectiveness of the modified version of the SHF algorithm.

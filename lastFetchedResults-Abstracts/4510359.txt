In this paper, the issue of shuffling loads in automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS) is addressed. The objective of the shuffling is to pre-sort the loads into any specified locations in order to minimize the response time of retrievals. In order to achieve the shuffling efficiently, a new design of AS/RS has been presented. In the new AS/RS, each column has an associated vertical platform and each row has its own horizontal platform. 1D and 2D shuffling algorithms are described in detail. The response time of retrieval, the lower bound and upper bound of energy consumption are also derived. Results of the analysis and numerical experiments show that the shuffling algorithms are quite efficient.

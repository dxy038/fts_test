Based on multi-objective optimization control, fuzzy state feedback control and Set Point tracking control strategy, A novel scheme for the coordinated control of power units is presented. Firstly, a fuzzy state space model of boiler-turbine system is built. Then, based on the model and pole placement design, a state feedback controller with asymptotic tracking performance is proposed. Because the system has nonlinear, strong coupling, variable condition, parameter time-varying characteristics, which led to the optimum parameters of pole placement are difficult to determine. In order to guarantee dynamic performance, stability and control variable constraints of the system, a multi-objective optimization method for pole placement based on particle swarm optimization is exploited. This control system has good tracking property with zero steady-state error and can reject input disturbances, the controller works well even if some parameters change. Simulation results show that the system designed by the proposed method gives satisfactory regulation quality within wide operating range.

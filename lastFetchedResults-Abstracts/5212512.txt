Many aircraft owners and operators have asked, &#194;&#191;Why canÂ´t avionics systems on my aircraft subscribe to the innovative design principles of my cell phone?&#194;&#191; This common revelation is driven by the fact that cell phones are typically characterized as cheap, yet powerful electronic devices that drive the leading edge of technology. In contrast Avionics are typically characterized as the polar opposite: expensive electronic devices that are based on old, previous-generation technology. This paper explores the cell phone product model and compares it to the avionics product model. The objective is to highlight concepts that can drive avionics innovation as well as to highlight the fundamental differences between avionics and consumer electronics products. The most notable product in the cell phone market today is the Apple iPhone<sup>1</sup>. The iPhone is a successful, transformational cell phone product that has changed the cell phone market. It provides a good case study since there is a lot of data available for this product. The question is to identify how that technological success can be applied to an avionics product. To this end, the iPhone is compared to Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), which has also been a game changer. Both products provide a general processing platform that has redefined their respective industries. This comparison aims to highlight lessons learned from the iPhone success that can drive IMA product success. In addition, the comparison aims to highlight the differences between the products to explain why an avionics system is more expensive and larger in size than a consumer electronics product such as a cell phone.

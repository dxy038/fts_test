According to 2K-V-type cycloid-pin reducerÂ´s structure and work principle, the optimization design of 2K-V-type cycloid-pin reducer is set up, which puts the minimum quality as the objective function. The complex method is put forwards into application in this paper. The calculation of example is carried out. By comparing, the quality of 2K-V-type cycloid-pin reducer is reduced by 14.17%. According to the result, the mathematical model of optimization design can reflect the design problems really. The new method obtains for the optimal design and manufacture of 2K-V-type cycloid-pin reducer.

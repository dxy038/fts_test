Objective: The aim of this research was to segment older people in subgroups with similar social
engagement activity patterns in order to better target public health interventions. Design: Cross-sectional data,
collected in 2005 by Dutch community health services (response 79%), from 22026 independently living elderly
aged 65 or older were used. Cluster analysis was performed to derive subgroups with common social engagement
activity patterns, which were compared for their self-perceived health, mental health, physical health, and
loneliness. Results: Among the independently living older people, five subgroups were identified with different
patterns of social engagement activities: less social engaged elderly, less social engaged caregivers, social
engaged caregivers, leisure engaged elderly, and productive engaged elderly. The subgroups differed
significantly in social engagement activities, socio-demographics, and health (p<0.001). The groups with the
highest relative numbers of older people who were frequently engaged in leisure and productive-related activities,
also included relatively more elderly with a good self-perceived health (85.8% versus 58.8%), mental health
(91.3% versus 74.6%), physical health (97.7% versus 73.0%), and elderly who were not lonely (70.0% versus
52.0%) when compared to the least healthy subgroup. Conclusion: Older people could be segmented in
subgroups based on similar social engagement patterns. Groups with elderly who were less socially engaged
demonstrate to be possible target groups for public health interventions, given the relatively high shares of
unhealthy older people among them.

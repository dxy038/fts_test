This paper outlines the development of a Decision Support System for Water Supply Management (WSMDSS) in city A to emulate and enhance the ability of water planning experts in the decision making process of water distribution networks expansion with new water sources. The main objective of water supply system management is to provide the reliable supply under varied availability conditions. WSMDSS in city A includes two aspects, one is energy-saving operation for new and old drinking water treatment plants and the other is comparison analysis of system hydraulics for pre- and post-connection to new water sources which both are based on water distribution networks modeling.

The effect of speed control when used as a single action to resolve aircraft conflicts is not well known in the ATM scientific world. Therefore, the objective of this study is to get some initial figures to evaluate its potential. This paper introduces the use of speed control manoeuvres with a specific focus on automation. The reorganised ATC mathematical simulator that served as a tool is described and especially the modifications for its resolution rules, the aircraft performance and uncertainty model. Then the simulation setup and the seven scenarios are analysed in more detail concerning traffic and conflict density. Next, the results from the simulations are shown with analysis of resolution rates, speed rates, encounter angles, and closest points of approach. Last, the results are discussed and further studies suggested.

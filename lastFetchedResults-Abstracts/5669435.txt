The continuation of an investigation in which high-resolution optimal estimation, techniques are applied to the radar imaging problem area is described. A primary objective of the authorÂ´s previous study (see IEEE National Radar Conference Digest, p.48, 1989) was to show that one could obtain either higher-resolution images from the same data samples or equal-quality images from significantly fewer data samples. The investigation is extended into the range domain and the Doppler domain, and three-dimensional superresolution images in both range and Doppler have been processed from simulation model radar data. The achievement of superresolution in the range domain is the primary subject addressed

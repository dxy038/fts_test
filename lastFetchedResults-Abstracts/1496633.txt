This paper presents mean pressures obtained in wind tunnel tests on planar canopy roof models. The objective of these experiments was to find the best modelling conditions at the UNNE wind tunnel to study mean pressures on this type of structure. Values of mean pressures from a full-scale duo-pitch canopy roof studied in Great Britain by Robertson et al. were taken as a reference to check the model results. Internal and external mean pressure coefficients were tested on two 1:150 and 1:100 scale models with two boundary layer simulations, corresponding to open land and suburban areas. The prevailing influence of the absolute size of the model over Reynolds number and turbulence intensity was observed.

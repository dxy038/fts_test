Background and purpose: Decreasing of motion is one of the characteristics of aging that
caused the decrease of quality of life and generative problems of others. The objective of this study was to
compare the effect of an exercise program on kinematic analysis of gait of elderly men and women who
are residents in a sanatorium.
Material & methods: From the sanatorium elderly residents, 15 men and 15 women between 65
to 80 years old were studied. Berg questionnaire was used to evaluate falling risk, cadence (the number of
steps in one minute) and a digital camera (Sony DCR-HC54) was used to measure kinematic variables of
gait (speed and joints angles (ankle, knee and hip)). All measurements were repeated after a 24-session
physical training program including walking, strength training, balance and endurance training.
Independent and paired sample t-test were used for the statistical analysis (P < 0.05).
Results: The falling risk was reduced about 20% in elderly women and 12% in elderly men
(P=0.000) and cadence was improved about 20% and 10% in elderly women and men, respectively
(P=0.01). Walking speed was increased about 19% (P=0.000) in elderly men and 45% (P=0.002) in
elderly women after exercise. The exercise program has improved the joint angles (ankle and knee)
approximately 2 degrees that was not significant (P=0.01) but it has improved the hip angle
approximately 3 degrees (P=0.01).
Conclusion: Exercise (walking with weight) will improve their gait performance and reduce the
risk of fall more specially in women. The exercise program in this research is performed in elderly
sanatorium simplicity that it can improve walking speed. We suggest that in future studies, the effect of
exercise programs investigate on kinetic variables of gait of old people.

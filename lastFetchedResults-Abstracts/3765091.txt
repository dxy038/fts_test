To evaluate the efficacy of modern therapeutic procedures in the catheterization laboratory, the effects of vasoactive drugs, as well as the effects of short and long term interventions on the regression or progression of coronary artery disease, an objective and reproducible technique for the assessment of coronary artery dimensions was developed. This paper describes the methodology of such a computer-assisted analysis system, as well as the results from a validation study on the accuracy and precision. A region in a 35 mm cineframe encompassing a selected arterial segment is optically magnified and converted into video format by means of a specially constructed cinevideo converter and digitized for subsequent analysis by computer. Contours of the arterial segment are detected automatically on the basis of first and second derivative functions. Contour data are corrected for pincushion distortion; arterial dimensions are presented in mm, where the calibration factor is derived from a computer-processed segment of the contrast catheter. The accuracy and precision of the edge detection procedure as assessed from cinefilms of perspex models (%-D stenosis &#10877;70 percent) filled with contrast agent were -30 and 90 &#956;m, respectively. The variablity of the analysis procedure by itself in terms of absolute arterial dimensions was less than 0.12 mm, and in terms of percentage arterial narrowing for coronary obstructions less than 2.74 percent. It is concluded that this system allows the measurement of coronary arterial dimensions in an objective and highly reproducible way.

The two-stage direct power converter has the following characteristics; bidirectional power flows, controllable input power factor, lower input harmonic current, no bulky DC-link circuit, requirements of many switches, and complexity of switching algorithm. SVPWM control scheme is not easier to be optimized because of control complexity. This paper proposes the optimized switching commutation SVPWM control algorithm which switching loss and THD of input/output powers are taken into consideration. The proposed algorithm can largely reduce switching loss and improve input/output power qualities by rearranging the space vector applied times. The effectiveness is verified through simulation analysis.

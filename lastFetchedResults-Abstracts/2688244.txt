In this paper, we propose a robust real-time wind power dispatch framework for coordinating wind farms, automatic generation control (AGC) units, and nonAGC units, which enables wind farms to operate flexibly using maximum power-point tracking strategies. Robust real-time dispatch is formulated as an adjustable robust optimization model incorporating an affinely adjustable controlling strategy compatible with AGC systems. The proposed model can be equivalently transformed to a nonlinear programming problem with linear constraints via duality. The proposed model can also be approximately reduced to a quadratic programming with the objective function simplified. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed method against the conventional real-time dispatch scheme. The results show the proposed scheme is robust and reliable.

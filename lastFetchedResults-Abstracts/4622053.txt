The paper describes a new family member of the modular multilevel cascade converter (MMCC), with the given name, triple-star bridge-cells (TSBC). It is a direct ac-to-ac power converter with the capability of bidirectional power flow with three-phase sinusoidal input and output currents. Therefore, it is suitable to a medium-voltage motor drive requiring regenerative braking. This paper has an intensive discussion on a general control of the TSBC intended for the motor drive. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation confirm the effectiveness and viability of the TSBC.

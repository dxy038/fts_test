Focuses on Garment cooperative design based on ontology and describes in detail the key technologies of cooperation design , the computer expression coherence and devisers comprehension coherence in design elements. Ontology is the description of objective existence. The objective existence of garment design can be considered the elements and process which is involved in the design process. Using computer, the elements and process in the garment design process can be expressed by ontology, and which can be applied in the process of cooperation design. The keystone of this paper is the description of definition of ontology and computer formalized expression. Also, the paper gives many kinds of definition methods of ontology and analyzes the architecture, at the same time it states the dividing of function model and realizing methods of the garment cooperative design based on ontology, and all kinds of garment knowledge and interconnect arithmetic implementation which is defined in the garment ontology. In the end the paper gives the evaluating methods for results of cooperative design and its interactive interface.

Although peer-to-peer (P2P) and programmable networks have their particularities, both work with distributed systems. In this article, a new concept looks for the integration among P2P and programmable networks. The originality of this work lives in the total convergence of networks P2P and programmable networks, with the objective of rendering service providers the ability to quickly create and provide new and customized services in response to market demand. Programmable networks as infrastructure for P2P traffic identification and optimization are considered and examples like file push and the management of joining/leaving peers highlight the usefulness of this proposal in the solution of traffic challenges.

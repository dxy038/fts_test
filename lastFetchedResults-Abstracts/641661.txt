OBJECTIVE: We measured the serum levels of four trace elements (Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb) and Mg in surgical patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The clinical implications and the results are discussed.

METHODS: Two groups of patients were studied: the first group (n = 40) was our study group and the second (n = 40) was the control group. Four measurements of each trace element (TE) in blood serum were carried out: one before initiating TPN, one 24 h after, one 3 d later, and the last one immediately after discontinuing TPN. Each measurement was repeated twice. The Perkin-Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model 2380) with furnace graphite HGA-300 was used to measure the TE levels and an acetylene flame was used to measure the Mg levels.

RESULTS: Levels of all the TEs, except Pb, were lower before the administration of TPN compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The levels of TEs during and immediately after TPN were generally lower in comparison with the initial measurement before the administration of TPN.

CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that it may be necessary to 1) add Cu, Zn, Mn, and Mg to the parenteral nutritional solution and 2) follow the fluctuations in serum levels during the administration of TPN.

Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the impact of interactive, computer-based versus conventional, paper-based format in student, resident, and fellow learning and retention of anatomy knowledge.
Study design
Randomized longitudinal cohort design with scores repeated as pre-, post-, and follow-up tests. Subjects were randomly assigned to an anatomy module in computer-based (CD-ROM) format and 1 in paper-based format. A follow-up examination was administered 3 weeks after the posttest to evaluate retention of knowledge. Tests results were analyzed by using Student t tests and analysis of variance.
Results
Thirty-nine subjects completed all testing. Regardless of instructional method, pretest to posttest scores improved (P< .01), and posttest to follow-up test scores decreased among all levels of training (P< .01). Student satisfaction was highest with CD-ROM format.
Conclusion
Improvement and retention of anatomy knowledge was not significantly different when comparing a new CD-ROM interactive approach with a traditional paper-based method.

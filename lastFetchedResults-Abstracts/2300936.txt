The main objective of the present work is experimental investigation of induction time for double gas hydrate formation in the presence or absence of kinetic inhibitors in a mini flow loop apparatus. For this purpose, a laboratory mini flow loop apparatus is designed and built up to measure the induction time for binary mixtures during gas hydrate formation when a gaseous mixture (such as 70% C1–30% C3, 30% C1–70% C3, 70% C1–30% i-C4 and 30% C1–70% i-C4) is contacted with water in the absence or presence of dissolved inhibitor, such as poly vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and l-tyrosine under suitable temperature and pressure conditions. In each experiment, water blend saturated with gas mixture is circulated up to a required pressure. Pressure is maintained at a constant value during experimental runs by means of the required gas mixture make-up. In this work, induction time is investigated for of double gas hydrate formation in vitro in the presence of the PVP and l-Tyrosine alone and their simultaneous presence as kinetic inhibitors in a mini flow loop apparatus at various concentrations. The results show that the simultaneous addition of PVP and l-tyrosine increases the induction time of gas hydrate formation several times more than that without using the inhibitor. Indeed, the addition of the small value of l-tyrosine to PVP, the induction time being longer than when PVP is as a kinetic inhibitor only, because the l-tyrosine is stronger than the PVP as an inhibitor.

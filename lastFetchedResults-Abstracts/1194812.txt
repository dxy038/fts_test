At present, ceiling-mounted diffusers are very popular for indoor air distribution, particularly in offices, owing to greater efficiency in the distribution of the air supply and a more comfortable indoor environment. The objective of this study is to construct an effective model to design the indoor airflow of an attached plane jet after its impingement with the corner in a room. In this study, a full-scale test facility was set up to obtain detailed experimental data. One commercial CFD tool, CFX 11.0, was used to simulate the air velocity distribution of an attached plane air jet bounded by the ceiling and an insulated wall. One semi-empirical model was also constructed to predict the impingement jet velocity. The results show that bout the semi-empirical model and CFX 11.0 were able to predict the maximum velocity of an impinging jet at low Reynolds numbers, 1000 and 2000, with an inaccuracy of Â±11%. However, the semi-empirical model could be more conveniently used to predict the maximum jet velocity decay after its impingement the corner in a room than CFD simulation in terms of accuracy and the time required to design the indoor airflow pattern.

Background. The efficacy of bronchial telescope anastomosis was evaluated retrospectively in patients undergoing sleeve resections with high-caliber mismatch.

Methods. The hospital charts of patients undergoing upper and lower sleeve bilobectomy and lower lobe lobectomy with replantation of the middle lobe or upper lobe into the mainstem bronchus were retrospectively reviewed. Age, sex, side, TNM stage, preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 [%]), preoperative risk factors, postoperative course, survival (months), and causes of death were recorded.

Results. Fifteen patients suffering from bronchial carcinoma were operated on. In 6 cases FEV1 was less than 2 L (FEV1 49% to 80%, mean 64.3, median 61). Three patients were 70 years and older. There were 7 high-risk cases presenting with coronary heart disease (n = 3), chronic alcoholism (n = 3), cerebrovascular disease (n = 1), and active tuberculosis (n = 1). Local radicality was achieved in all patients but 1, in whom pneumonectomy was contraindicated. There was no postoperative mortality. Early complications consisted of 1 anastomotic dehiscence successfully closed with an intercostal flap and 1 patient with bilateral pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation for 5 days. One parenchymal fistula led to prolonged drainage; in 1 patient pneumothorax after removal of the chest tube required redrainage. There were no late complications, and no anastomotic stenosis developed. Survival ranged from 12 to 56 months (median 29.8, mean 30, SD 15.7). Seven patients died between 3.9 and 14 months postoperatively (mean 8.5, median 6.9) of intrabronchial local recurrence (n = 1), distant recurrence (n = 3), intrathoracic recurrence (n = 1), and nontumor-related causes (n = 2).

Conclusions. Telescope anastomosis is a safe and efficient technique of bronchial sleeve resection.

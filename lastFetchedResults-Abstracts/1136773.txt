Todayâ€™s with increasing the competition in commercial markets and shortening the product life cycles; the variety of customer demands has been arisen; hence, these demands are confronted to uncertainty. This uncertainty has more importance with respect to the quantity and quality of the returned goods. A risk-pooling strategy is a suitable way to consider uncertainty in demands. This paper presents new multi-objective mathematical modeling for a closed-loop supply chain network with uncertain demands using risk-pooling, in which the forward chain is consisting of suppliers, distribution centers and customers and the reverse chain encompass collection centers, recycling and recovery centers and material customers. This is a bi-objectives nonlinear integer programming model that is solved using GAMS software.

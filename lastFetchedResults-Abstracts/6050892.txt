When designing robust controllers, H-infinity synthesis is a common tool to use. The controllers that result from these algorithms are typically of very high order, which complicates implementation. However, if a constraint on the maximum order of the controller is set, that is lower than the order of the (augmented) system, the problem becomes nonconvex and it is relatively hard to solve. These problems become very complex, even when the order of the system is low. The approach used in this work is based on formulating the constraint on the maximum order of the controller as a polynomial (or rational) equation. This equality constraint is added to the optimization problem of minimizing an upper bound on the H-infinity norm of the closed loop system subject to linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. The problem is then solved by reformulating it as a partially augmented Lagrangian problem where the equality constraint is put into the objective function, but where the LMIs are kept as constraints. The proposed method is evaluated together with two well known methods from the literature. The results indicate that the proposed method has comparable performance in most cases.

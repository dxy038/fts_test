According to the real-time detecting information, this paper studied the electronic reconnaissance satellite(ERS) area census on-line scheduling problem. Based on the radiant points´ unknown position and working mode, the uncertain factors´ quantitive description methods of the ERS on-line scheduling problem were proposed. A target working mode and existing probability forecasting technique based on Bayesian decision-making was put forward, and a multi-objective constrained programming model is established, which aimed to optimize the objectives of the information detecting reward and the front interception reward. A multi-satellite cooperate area census on-line scheduling multi-objective evolution algorithm(MSCACOS-MOEA) was put forward to improve the pareto optimal solutions, which could prevent from converging too slowly. The simulation instances proved that the technique could effectively deal with the ERS area census on-line scheduling problem and the performance was well.

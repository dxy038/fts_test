Introduction: Beta-thalassemia major patients require regular blood transfusion. These patients may suffer diabetes, heart or liver disease due to this treatment. As a result they need regular medical examination and care. Unfortunately oral and dental problems in these patients receive little attention. Available information in references on the prevalence of gingivitis is scant and this study was designed to investigate the frequency of gingivitis in these patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of gingivitis through the Gingival Index in beta-thalassemia major in comparison with healthy controls.
Materials and Methods: This is a cross sectional study with a control group. The sample included 58 patients and 58 healthy controls (from referrals to the college and healthy partners of patients) and the Gingival Index was used for all the samples. The two groups were matched regarding to age, sex, socio-economic condition and oral hygiene.
Results: Thirty-nine of patients had mild and 19 patients had moderate gingivitis. In control group 55 healthy controls showed mild and three controls moderate gingivitis. None of the samples had severe gingivitis. There was significant difference in GI scores between the two groups (P<0.01). The mean serum ferritin level in patients was 1758.67 ng/ml and 39 patients had been splenectomized. biopsy of spleen. There was no correlation between serum ferreting level, splenectomy and GI in thalassemia patients.
Conclusion: Increased gingivitis is shown in thalassemic patients and they need special dental attention (especially the condition of gums).

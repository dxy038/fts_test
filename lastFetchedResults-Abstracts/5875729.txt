Stack filters are a class of nonlinear filters for removing noise that is uncorrelated with signal. Their design is formulated as a high nonlinear optimization problem. An improved immune memory clonal selection algorithm (IMCSA) is suitable for designing stack filters. But as many algorithms for designing stack filters have to face that evaluation of each candidate solution is still takes the most computation complexity. By representing the positive Boolean functions (PBF) in objective function, a hybrid computation approach (software and hardware) for the calculation tasks has been proposed. Compared with available methods, the proposed method can improve the efficiencies of design stack filters and the design time is significantly reduced. The procedure of design and implementation for stack filters can be reached at the same time by the method

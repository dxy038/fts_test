Background: Robotic needle insertion in biological tissues has been known as one
the most applicable procedures in sampling, robotic injection and different medical
therapies and operations.
Objective: In this paper, we would like to investigate the effects of angular velocity in soft tissue insertion procedure by considering force-displacement diagram.
Non-homogenous camel liver can be exploited as a tissue sample under standard compression test with Zwick/Roell device employing 1-D axial load-cell.
Methods: Effects of rotational motion were studied by running needle insertion experiments in 5, 50 and 200 mm/min in two types of with or without rotational velocity
of 50, 150 and 300 rpm. On further steps with deeper penetrations, friction force of the
insertion procedure in needle shaft was acquired by a defnite thickness of the tissue.
Results: Designed mechanism of fxture for providing different frequencies of rotational motion is available in this work. Results for comparison of different force
graphs were also provided.
Conclusion: Derived force-displacement graphs showed a signifcant difference
between two procedures; however, tissue bleeding and disorganized micro-structure
would be among unavoidable results.

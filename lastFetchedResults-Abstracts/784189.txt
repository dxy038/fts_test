Purpose Few studies have examined the association
between physical activity (PA), measured objectively, and
adolescent depressive symptoms. The aim of this study was
to determine whether there is an association between
objective measures of PA (total PA and time spent in
moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA)) and adolescent
depressive symptoms.
Methods Data on 2,951 adolescents participating in ALSPAC
were used. Depressive symptoms were measured
using the self-report Mood and Feelings Questionnaire
(MFQ) (short version). Measures of PA were based on
accelerometry. The association between PA and MFQ
scores was modelled using ordinal regression.
Results Adolescents who were more physically active
(total PA or minutes of MVPA) had a reduced odds of
depressive symptoms [ORadj total PA (tertiles): medium
0.82 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.97); high 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.83)];
ORadj per 15 min MVPA: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98). In a
multivariable model including both total PA and the percentage
of time spent in MVPA, total PA was associated
with depressive symptoms (ORadj total PA (tertiles):
medium 0.82 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.98); high 0.70 (95% CI:
0.58, 0.85) but the percentage of time spent in MVPA was
not independently associated with depressive symptoms
[ORadj MVPA (tertiles) medium 1.05 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.24),
high 0.91 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.09)].
Conclusions The total amount of PA undertaken was
associated with adolescent depressive symptoms, but the
amount of time spent in MVPA, once total PA was
accounted for, was not. If confirmed in longitudinal studies
and randomised controlled trials, this would have important
implications for public health messages

In a typical image synthesis where multiple differently exposed images are captured for processing, it is important to design an anti-ghost algorithm so as to prevent ghosting artifacts from appearing in the final image. An anti-ghost algorithm is usually composed of a detection module and a correction module. In this paper, a new detection module is proposed to detect non-consistent pixels of all input images without predefining any initial reference image. The proposed module is suitable when an interactive mode is desired. In addition, a bidirectional approach is introduced to correct the non-consistent pixels in the correction module. Compared with existing unidirectional correction methods, the proposed bidirectional correction approach uses information from two adjacent images of a detected image to correct its non-consistent pixels. This leads to a quality improvement in the final image.

We propose a scalable networking scheme for high-speed networks where quality of service (QoS) is important. The main objective of the scheme is to provide QoS guarantees and to achieve scalability to very large traffic volume and link bandwidth. Other important goals include extensibility, small to moderate buffer requirements, high throughput, small latency, and loss-free communication. The proposed scheme can service a wide variety of traffic classes and is applicable to various switching and multiplexing techniques

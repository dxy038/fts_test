Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) method is used as auto speed regulator (ASR) to improve the dynamic performance of cascade control for winding motors in double closed loop control system. In order to optimize the numerous parameters of ADRC, an optimizing objective function is proposed, which is based on the error integral criteria and considered the static and dynamic characteristics and control energy requirements. By the proposed optimizing objective function, genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the ADRC parameters. The simulation experiment results show that control performance is improved greatly with strong anti-interference, fast response and small overshoot, due to the ADRC which parameters are optimized by genetic algorithm. The parameter optimization results can also provide reference for engineering tuning of ADRC.

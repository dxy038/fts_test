High efficiency, high torque density, and small size increase the popularity of Brushless DC Motors (BLDCMs). BLDCMs, because of their construction, have high nonlinearities. Therefore Fuzzy Logic Controllers(FLCs) were used to control the speed and current. Two closed loops were constructed. While the inner loop has a fuzzy logic current controller, the outer loop has a fuzzy logic speed controller. The proposed method was simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The objective of this paper is to analyse FLCs for BLDCMs. The number of the rules was changed and comparisons were made. Also comparisons with single loop fuzzy logic and single loop PI speed controller has given.

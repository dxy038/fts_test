The objective of this research is to determine the molecular structure of the mineral hidalgoite PbAl3(AsO4)(SO4)(OH)6 using vibrational spectroscopy. The mineral is found in old mine sites. Observed bands are assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of (SO4)2− and (AsO4)3− units, stretching and bending vibrations of hydrogen bonded (OH)− ions and Al3+–(O,OH) units. The approximate range of O–H⋯O hydrogen bond lengths is inferred from the Raman and infrared spectra. Values of 2.6989 Å, 2.7682 Å, 2.8659 Å were obtained. The formation of hidalgoite may offer a mechanism for the removal of arsenic from the environment.

An algorithm for LPC (linear predictive coding) parameter optimization in multipulse (MP)-LPC based speech coders is presented. It is shown that, by taking into account the nature of the MP-excitation signal into LPC parameter computation, it is possible to improve the effectiveness of the LPC model. This results in a better quality of the reconstructed signal in terms both of objective and subjective criteria. The implementation details of the algorithm are discussed and experimental results are presented. In particular a comparison with standard MP-LPC techniques is given

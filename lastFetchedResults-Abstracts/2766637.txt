Signature-based matching has been the dominant choice for state-of-the-art person re-identification across multiple disjoint cameras. An approach that exploits image dissimilarities is proposed, treating re-identification as a binary classification problem. To achieve the objective, the person re-identification problem is addressed as follows: (i) first, compute the image dissimilarity between a pair of images acquired from two disjoint cameras; (ii) then learn the linear subspace where the image dissimilarities lie in an unsupervised fashion and (iii) lastly train a binary classifier in the linear subspace to discriminate between image dissimilarities computed for a positive pair (images are for the same person) and a negative pair (images are for different persons). An approach on two publicly available benchmark datasets is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods for person re-identification.

The proposed Irrigation Performance Assessment Module has been developed using Irrigation performance indicators of Irrigation system, for different irrigation system conditions and objectives, and conducted for different levels of assessment with limited parameters. An internal-comparative standard has been developed for interaction-influence of indicators. Defined linguistic-expression indicators has been developed the combined qualitative-quantitative model to use "subjective" and "objective" judgment of water users and experts on system "productivity" and "convenience", respectively. The model was tested by Standard method in Ghazvin Irrigation system. The F-TEST for comparison between Marndani fuzzy Product and Minimum inference is 98%, and correlation coefficient is 0.99. These results indicated that, the selection of fuzzy Product or Minimum inference is not important in this model. Results of comparison to Standard method indicated that product combination gives the better result. The separation of initial condition, process, effect and result of performance is indicated that, 12% of performance deficit is subjected to initial condition of the system. Management Delivery Performance measures from water users and irrigation water supply agency's judgments in this pilot were 39% and 58%, respectively. The results demonstrated that, unfavorite physical and natural conditions are not the main problems of the system. But difference between actual water users needs and unsufficient plan of water delivery, is the main problem of the system. Assessment of Irrigation system with this model is more applicable with limited requirement data, and it can be easily adapted and programmed on different Agricultural and Natural Resource management systems.

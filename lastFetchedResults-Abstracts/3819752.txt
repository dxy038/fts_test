Power and code allocation across two adjacent cells is studied for the downlink of a code-division multiple-access voice network. Each user has a utility function that measures the user´s willingness to pay, or utility, as a function of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio. The objective is to maximize the total utility over the two cells subject to code and power constraints. When all active users receive the same utility, the optimal allocation is characterized by a pair of threshold radii for the two cells, where each radius specifies the set of active users in that cell. The behavior of the optimal radii are characterized as a function of load and available resources (power and codes). The corresponding optimal power allocation can be achieved through a pricing scheme, in which each base station announces a price for each resource, and each user responds by requesting the amount of resources that maximizes the user´s surplus (utility minus cost). We show that, depending on the load and resource constraints, the two cells may have to coordinate, or exchange information, in order to maximize the total utility.

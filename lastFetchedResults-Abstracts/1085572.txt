Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to record their pain sensation and to assess children`s reaction objectively and subjectively while receiving dental local anesthesia with 27- and 30-gauge needles. Methods: Forty children (24 boys and 16 girls) participated in this study. A random double-blinded crossover design was used so that each child served as his or her own control, receiving each treatment on the same sides of the same arch at different sessions. Each patient received an injection either with a 27- or 30-gauge needle during the second visit and during the third visit with the other needle. Objective and subjective evaluations were performed. Results: Children`s reactions to mandibular nerve block with 27- or 30-gauge needle regarding SEM scale and Face scale demonstrated significant difference, whereas children receiving the injection with a 27-gauge needle presented more sensation of pain objectively and subjectively. Conclusion: Significant difference was demonstrated concerning pain when 27-gauge or 30-gauge needle was used, and no difference was found in success of local anesthesia. As to these two variables, measured and reported in this study, it can be concluded that 30-gauge needle exhibit clinical advantage in inferior dental injection in children.

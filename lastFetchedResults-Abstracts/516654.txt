Linolenic acid (omega 3) and Linoleic acid (omega 6) are essential fatty acids
that our body cannot synthesis them, so these fatty acids should be taken via foods.
Objective: The aim of this study was measuring of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids in
species of linum ssp.
Methods: Seed samples of Linum ssp. including: L. usitatissimum L., L. strictum L.,
L. mucronatum Bertol, L. nodiflorum L., L. bienne Mill and L. austriacum L. were selected
from Agricultural source researches center of West Azarbaijan and grown in its research
farm. Oil content was measured using Leiboritz method in three replications. The amounts of
fatty acids were detected and measured by gas chromatography.
Results: This study indicated; all of investigated Linum species except one species, had more
amounts of omega 3 fatty acids content than other oilseeds and all of the wild Linum species
had more amounts of omega 6 fatty acids content in comparison with crop species.
Conclusion: Oil of the crop Linum had better quality and quantity than oil of the other oil
seeds, also these wild species were suitable cases for biotechnological projects and elevate
amounts of omega 6 essential fatty acids of crop species.

In this work, the problem of transmitting an i.i.d Gaussian source over an i.i.d Gaussian wiretap channel with an i.i.d Gaussian side information at the intended receiver is considered. The intended receiver is assumed to have a certain minimum SNR and the eavesdropper is assumed to have a strictly lower SNR compared to the intended receiver. The objective is minimizing the distortion of source reconstruction at the intended receiver. In this work, it is shown that the source-channel separation coding scheme is optimum in the sense of achieving the minimum distortion. A hybrid digital-analog Wyner-Ziv coding scheme is then proposed which achieve the minimum distortion. This secure joint source channel coding scheme is based on Wyner-Ziv coding scheme and wiretap channel coding scheme when the analog source is not explicitly quantized. The proposed secure hybrid digital-analog scheme is analyzed under the main channel SNR mismatch. It is proven that the proposed scheme can give a graceful degradation of distortion with SNR under SNR mismatch, i.e., when the actual SNR is larger than the designed SNR.

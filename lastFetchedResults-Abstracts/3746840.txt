This paper addresses the electromagnetic modeling of the communication link between the automated transfer vehicle (ATV) and the Tracking &amp; Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The link is analyzed during the ISS attached phase, i.e. when the ATV is docked on the International Space Station (ISS). The main objective of the study is to verify, by adopting a deterministic approach, if in every ISS orbit there are at least 15 minutes available to safely establish the ATV-TDRSS link.

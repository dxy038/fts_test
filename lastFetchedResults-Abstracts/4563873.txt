The objective of this paper is to design, develop and implement a multi-agent system (MAS) that provides intelligent and enables real-time management to a smart grid located at a distribution level (so called distributed smart grid). The MAS application development is discussed concerning suitable agent development framework, agent specification, agent architecture, and implementation of MAS. The paper illustrates MAS application in power systems. As faults and outages are inevitable and likely to occur in distribution systems, an efficient and fast switching operation scheme is required to detect the fault location, isolate the fault, and restore power to de-energized areas. The system under study consists of both physical (microgrid) and cyber elements (MAS). Finally, the simulation result indicates that the developed MAS for power system restoration applications can provide an effective and timely solution to manage microgrid given the existence of fault in the system.

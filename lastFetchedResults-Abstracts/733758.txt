Objective
To evaluate sunburn, sun sensitivity factors and sun protection behavior in school-age children.
Methods

2002 to 2004 survey of 2942 children in primary schools of Valencia, Spain, and their parents, using a self-administered questionnaire filled by the children with the help of their parents.
Results

Having a fair skin (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.38–3.04), light coloured eyes (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12–1.68), freckles (OR: 1.32; 95% CI:1.12–1.56), and older age (OR: 2.34; 95% CI:1.96–2.80) were associated with occurrence of sunburns. Hair color, gender, use of sunscreens, wearing T-shirts and sunglasses were not. Wearing hats (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54–0.75) was inversely associated. Parents were significantly more inclined to protect younger and fair-skinned children with sunscreen and T-shirts.
Conclusions

As expected, phenotype is related to sunburns and appears to influence parent's sun protection behaviours.

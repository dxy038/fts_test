Objective
sive symptoms are common after liver transplantation (LT). We studied whether depressive symptoms affect long-term survival after LT.
s
rospective cohort study, 134 liver transplant patients were assessed for depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory—short form (BDI), focusing on the 3 months post-LT score and on the score change from the waiting list period. They were followed up for long-term survival. The median duration of the follow-up period was 43 months post-LT. None of the 134 patients was lost to follow-up for survival.
s
l of 33.6% of the LT patients had mild to moderate depressive symptoms 3 months post-LT. Eighteen (13.4%) patients died during the follow-up. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–1.40, P&lt;.003), one more point in the BDI score being associated with a 17% increase in mortality risk. Other predictive factors of mortality were older age and hepatitis C virus with recurrence 3 months post-LT. Similarly, an increase in depressive symptoms between the waiting list and 3 months post-LT periods predicted mortality (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01–1.38, P=.03), especially for patients without depressive symptoms on waiting list (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16–2.12, P=.004).
sion
sive symptoms after LT and an increase in depressive symptoms between the waiting list and post-LT are associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality. Interventions that could reduce depressive symptoms could potentially decrease long-term mortality after LT.

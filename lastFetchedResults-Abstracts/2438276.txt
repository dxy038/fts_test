The paper is concerned with the uncertain parameters and time-delays of chaos system with random noises. A scheme based on differential evolution algorithm (DE) is newly introduced to solve the problem via a nonnegative multi-modal nonlinear optimization, which finds a best combination of parameters and time-delays such that an objective function is minimized. The illustrative examples, in both systems free of time-delays and time-delays systems with random noises, are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

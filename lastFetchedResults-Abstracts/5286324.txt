Reliable control of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is necessary to ensure high efficiency and high load-following capability in the operation of modern wind power plant. This is often difficult to achieve using conventional linear controllers, as wind power plants contain many uncertainties. This paper proposes a predictive controller for a power control of DFIG. The control is derived by optimization of an objective function that considers the tracking factors under realistic constraints. The prediction was calculated based on the DFIG model. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed controller, the effectiveness of the proposed method.

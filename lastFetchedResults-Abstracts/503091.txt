Introduction 
Continuing environmental crisis, human was aware of the necessity for revising the 
methods of dealing with environment during the development. Therefore, changing 
the development paradigm from classical to modern, sustainable development and 
environmental issues have become the major pillars of development and achieve 
sustainable development depends on the complete recognition of environment and 
natural resources as well as accurate and strategically planning in this regard.  
 
Methodology 
Strategic planning of the best methods to achieve the goals could be  considered. 
This paper was conducted to determine the development goals objectives of rural 
environment system in Gandoman County, Borojen Township in a 10- year 
perspective. SWOT Analysis Model was utilized for strategic planning.  
According to the strengths and weaknesses (capacities and resources) as well as the 
opportunities and treats (external factors and effective process), the invasive model 
as an effective model for environmental system has been adopted, and based on it, 
the strategies and quantities preferment goals have been determined and the 
coherence between them have been established.  
 
Results 
In order to analyze the rural environment systems in Gandoman County, first of all, 
the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the system were identified as 
follows.  
Strengths; having ecotourism potential and attractions, existence of two permanent 
rivers, numerous springs, suitable aquifers, high quality of water resources and 
mineral water springs and a number of Qantas, being moisture more than half of the 
year, there are nine plain rural for Agricultural Development and highland rural for 
horticultural development, existence of wild medicinal plants in the region, etc.  
Weakness; lack of Watershed activities, the risk of water erosion and the natural 
eruption, earthquake and flood, law quality of health centers, many activities against 
natural disasters, environmental and sound pollution of gas station, surface water 
and groundwater pollution, and landscape pollution because of deficient system of 
waste collection and landfill. 
Opportunities; increased consumption of mineral water producers and development 
policies in the category of  mineral waters in Iran, suitable markets for medicinal 
plants, increasing importance of tourism, the policies of natural hazards and 
detrimental health pollution, existence divers germ plasma and crop varieties in the 
country and the existence of oil and gas resources in the province  
Threats; being surface water management outside the province, negative balance of 
underground waters, poor crisis management, lack of proper and complete 
implementation of sustainable development policies, shortage of funds for dams, 
watershed management and construction of irrigation networks and deficient 
systems of waste collection and landfill in rural areas. 
Conclusion 
It should be noted that internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) of the status have 
been extracted from reviewing the regional environment system through the Library 
Reviews documents and field studies as well; and the external factors of region 
(opportunities and threats) also have been extracted from reviewing the documents 
of this field in the country as well as the province.  
The significance of coefficient of each internal and external factor was calculated by 
software Expert Choice based on the Delphi method and according to experts using 
paired comparisons. The basis of paired comparisons was Thomas L. Saaty 
importance coefficient (rather identical (important 1) until quite  preferable 
(important 9)). The important coefficienties were standardized through divided by 
average (total coefficients standard for internal and external  factors is equal to 
one).To determine the final weight, a rate of points between each  strength, 
opportunitiy, weakness and threat, a rate of points between 1 to 4 based  on the 
importance and final weight of internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) was 
calculated 3.08 and external factors (opportunities and threats) was calculated 3.53. 
Finally, these weights were pointed in SWOT diagram and aggressive pattern was 
determined as an effective model for environmental systems of Gandoman. This 
pattern for achieve the main objective (sustainable environmental  development in 
the region) selects the strategies that apply the available regional strengths for using 
the identified opportunities. Therefore, sustainable environmental development 
strategies of Gandoman County are as determined as follows:  
- Management development, conservation, restoration and sustainable 
exploitation of natural resources as well as environmental ones; 
- Developing public participation in a development process, conservation, 
restoration and sustainable exploitation of natural resources and environmental, 
- Mineral Water Industry Development, 
- Developing and strengthening the tourism industry with emphasis on 
ecotourism and rural tourism, 
- Improving crisis management in order to prevent the consequences of natural 
disasters and deal with it them villages,  Reducing hazards and detrimental to human health and the environment 
pollution. 
Obviously, in order to achieve the determined strategies and according to the 
main goal, objectives should be defined. These objectives in 3 levels, internals are 
periods such as: long term (10 years), medium term (five years) and short-term (2-1 
years) goals. The short-term objectives include increasing of public awareness on 
natural disasters, promotion of rural outreach skills, safety principles in building 
new homes, familiarize farmers with the principles of sustainable agriculture, 
identify species of medicinal plants in the County pasture, preventing the 
indiscriminate cattle grazing in pastures, improving exploitation model of water 
resources, inhibition of seasonal surface water, especially flowing waters, 
identifying the potentials of tourism in the region, familiarizing farmers with the 
importance of Aquifers and Watershed Management, predispose for public 
participation in forestry activities, improving knowledge and skills of villagers to 
preserve watersheds and aquifers, the identification qualities and  quantities 
capabilities of regional water to develop mineral water industries, studies about 
sanitary waste collection and burial in the rural area.

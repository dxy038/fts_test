This work is made in order to adapt e-learning systems both to the student profile and to the pedagogic objective (goal) defined by the trainer. It will guide the learner in his formation by providing the optimal strategy to follow, to achieve the goal. This goal is meant to deal with the educational act and to evaluate the required capacities. The problem is seen as an optimization problem of which the initial, final and the intermediate state are respectively the profile, the objective, and the state of student profile after a course. The solution will be the optimal series of courses to be followed. Thus, we used genetic algorithms.

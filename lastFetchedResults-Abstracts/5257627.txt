In the case of emergency and sudden illness, a simple ad-hoc network based on MOTE has been developed for home health care. The objective system requires installing and handling easily as well as low cost. We have developed a simple ad-hoc network to monitor the behavior and physical activity in daily life. The system consists of low power wireless transmission, interfaces of environment such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide, interface of physical activity monitor by acceleration signal per unit time, pyroelectric sensors and main computer. The installation of system is very easy and not time-consuming. Subject wore the small physical activity monitor with low-power wireless terminal. The environment and subject´s movement inside a room were also monitored. The ad-hoc network can operate without any trouble. The subject´s movements inside the room as well as outside were easily followed. The system may be useful for home health care

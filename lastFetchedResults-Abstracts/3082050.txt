The objective of this paper is to present a software-based systematic approach to separation of common-mode and differential-mode conductive EMI, and design of EMI filter. Based-upon the presented method, the features of common-mode and differential-mode conductive EMI components can be clearly identified. As compared to existing hardware-based and software-based approaches, the presented method doesnÂ´t require LISN with two-terminal output socket. An example using switching mode power supply as EUT (equipment under test) is illustrated. Measured results demonstrate that the presented software approach can effectively identify the features of EMI signals

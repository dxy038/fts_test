The surrogate objective function is constructed using C<sup>1</sup> piecewise response surface based on the design sensitivity analysis using FEM for the global optimization. The sampling points used for constructing the response surface are adaptively inserted during the process. Applications to benchmark problems and the optimum design of a permanent magnet system show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm

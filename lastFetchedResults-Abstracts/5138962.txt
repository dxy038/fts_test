This paper presents the design and test processes of a multi-robot architecture based on behaviors. This architecture is the result of simulation tests modifying the levels of knowledge, coordination and organization of multiple robots. The tests have been developed by a team of robots doing a task with a common objective. The behaviors are heuristics defining a logical sequence to resolve the task defined. The execution of a behavior depends on the execution of previous behaviors in the sequence, the robot sensor information and the actual state of the task objective. A central process in the architecture knows the states of the robots and that of the executing task. It intervenes only if there are indicators showing stagnation in the task objective.

Objective(s): The present paper attempts to study the trend in age at first marriage based on the health survey study of 1999 and using the Brass model.
Methods: The national Health survey was conducted in 1999 and it involved 1/1000 of the total population,studied via cluster sampling (clusters of 8 households).
Our sample consisted of 16000 women aged 15-49; we gathered data on the following set of variables: current age, marital status, age at first marriage and area of residence (urban/rural). Age at first marriage for married women had a mean of 17.8 years (SD=3.7) for the entire country.
Results: The Brass model fitted to data revealed a significant decreasing trend for the proportion of married women in all age groups, especially for the 15-19 year-old category.
Conclusion: This obviously indicates a generally increasing trend in age at first marriage.

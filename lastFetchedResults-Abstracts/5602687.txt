Study on evaluation methods of ISAR jamming effect is to be an important research problem in electronic countermeasures (ECM). Up to now there is no generally accepted progress and objective criterion published. In this paper, on the basis of studying the image model of ISAR point target used the most classical range-Doppler(R-D) algorithm, equivalent jamming-to-signal ratio (EJSR) is utilized, and then the relation between image quality, jamming and jamming effect is built, and the evaluation index via recognition probability of point target is put forward. In the end, aiming to three kinds of typical blanket jamming modes, radio frequency(RF) noise jamming, frequency modulation(FM) jamming and amplitude modulation(AM) jamming, through simulation and analysis, the results indicate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.

Objective The aim of this study was to describe
the length of stay, cost of drug treatment, diagnostic
tests and other therapeutic measures in acute
psychotic patients admitted to acute in-patient psychiatric
units and to analyse the factors associated with
these.Methods A retrospective review was made of medical
records of 200 patients admitted for acute psychosis
in eight Spanish hospitals. Information was collected
concerning the length of stay,cost of drug treatment and
diagnostic tests; bivariate and multivariate analysis was
made of factors associated with length of stay and cost
of antipsychotic drug treatment.Results The average admission
cost ranged between 2,830.29 and 3,624.95 euros,
with a wide variability among hospitals.Of this cost,
94.3% corresponded to fixed costs, 3.4% to diagnostic
tests and 2.4% to drug treatment (84.2% of this latter
cost corresponded to antipsychotic drugs).Age younger
than 25 years and a diagnosis of schizophrenia were associated
with longer hospital stays; longer length of stay,
the presence of aggressiveness/agitation, a diagnosis of
schizophrenia, age younger than 25 years and the use of
atypical antipsychotics were associated with higher
costs in antipsychotic drug treatment. Conclusions The
hospital admission cost of an acute psychotic episode is
mostly dependent on the structural costs derived from
in-patient treatment. The differences in costs seem to be
related to the different length of stay schemes used by
the various hospitals rather than to the clinical characteristics
of patients or the drugs used.

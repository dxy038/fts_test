This paper introduces a procedure for multi-objective optimization in antenna design. The problem described consists of the optimization of a seven element antenna array to improve the radiating performance. The three objectives considered are the minimization of the return loss, together with the minimization of the cross polarization and the mutual coupling between the ports; simultaneously, the design should satisfy a complex constraint on the far-field pattern. Since there is no single optimum to be found, the MOGT and MOGA-II (Game Theory-based and Genetic Algorithm) were used as multi-objective algorithms. The optimization of the antenna was carried out by employing a parametric CST MICROWAVE STUDIOreg (CST MWS) model, performing a time domain analysis, and using ESTECOpsilas modeFRONTIER4reg multi-objective optimization and process integration tool. The distributed optimization search exploited the parallelization capabilities of the MOGT and MOGA-II algorithms, which allowed the simultaneous evaluation of several design configurations by running concurrent threads of the solver. The results obtained are very satisfactory, and the procedure described can be applied to even more complex antenna design problems.

In this paper, we explain our experience in designing a prototype for 3-D hand tracking and dynamic gesture recognition. Our objective is to be able to continuously visually track the hand in a general background and to be able to recognize dynamic gestures in real time. The constraints and the conditions for our system to justify our approach are generic nonrestricted environment and generic nonspecific application. Our prototype has undergone several stages-from simulation to three different cycles of development and testing. We also present a road map for future development to reach the final goal.

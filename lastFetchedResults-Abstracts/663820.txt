The determination of nitrogen (N) based loading rates for land application of biosolids is challenging and site specific. Over loading may contribute to environmental, agricultural, or human health problems. The objective of this study was to monitor N mineralization and losses in a moderately alkaline and calcareous desert soil amended with either anaerobically digested (AN) or lime-stabilized (LS) biosolids, and irrigated with and without urea enriched water. For Experiment 1, N inputs, leaching and residuals in soil were evaluated in an open soil column system. For Experiment 2, ammonia (NH3) emissions were evaluated in a closed soil column system. In Experiment 1, AN and LS biosolids increased soil ON (organic N) by three and two fold, respectively. Respective net N mineralization of ON from biosolids alone was 90% and 62% without urea, and 71% and 77%, respectively with added urea. Nitrogen leaching losses and residuals in amended soil did not account for all N inputs into the soil/biosolids system. In Experiment 2, NH3 emissions were not significantly different among treated soils with or without added urea, except LS amended soil receiving urea. Ammonia losses did not account for unaccounted N in Experiment 1. We concluded that deep placement and rapid mineralization of AN biosolids promoted anaerobic soil conditions and denitrification, in addition to the high denitrification potential of desert soil. LS biosolids showed greater potential than AN biosolids for safe and beneficial land application to desert soils regardless of biosolids placement and the inclusion of N rich irrigation water.

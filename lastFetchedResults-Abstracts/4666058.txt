This is a survey paper that highlights potential applications of online systems in modern power systems. The objective of this paper is to survey various topics in online analysis and controls systems, and to assess potential for applying them into utilitiesÂ´ power systems. It outlines the benefits of online systems in increasing effectiveness and efficiency, while leaving it at the initiatives of power utilities to consider applying them as part of the smart grid. The topics provided a summary of what others have written in online systems and in some areas applied in pilot cases to perform state estimation, simulation, wide area and online controls, power system information security, dynamic stability limits, load shedding, spinning reserve, loading equipment to thermal limits, determining maximum transfer limits, fault identification and detection, integration of decentralized controllers etc. Standards on these online systems topics are just starting to come into use, most are more related to the data exchange and the communication than to the applications.

A technique for laboratory characterization of instrument transformers designed for transmission level voltage and current measurements is presented. The technique is also extended to transient event recorders (TERs). The objective of the method is to determine the suitability of existing substation instrument transformers for harmonic measurements, particularly in the frequency range of 60 to 1500 Hz covering the first 25 harmonics. Specifically, the following characteristics are of interest: transfer function magnitude and phase, linearity, and sensitivity of the frequency response to burdens. The measurement technique is based on exciting the instrument transformer primary with an impulsive waveform. Both input and output waveforms are recorded using laboratory grade probes and digitizers. Digital signal processing techniques are used to compute the instrument transformer frequency response. Several voltage transformers and current transformers in the 230 kV-765 kV voltage range were tested. The results are described.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

This paper addresses the design of a dynamic, nonlinear, time-invariant, state feedback controller that guarantees constraint satisfaction and offset-free control in the presence of unmeasured, persistent, non-stationary, additive disturbances. First, this objective is obtained by designing a dynamic, linear, time-invariant, offset-free controller, and an appropriate domain of attraction for this linear controller is defined. Following this, the linear (unconstrained) control input is modified by adding a perturbation term that is computed by a robust receding horizon controller. It is shown that the domain of attraction of the receding horizon controller contains that of the linear controller, and an efficient implementation of the receding horizon controller is proposed.

A team of systems engineering students at George Mason University have developed an initial design for an integrated system, the Airport Departure Arrival Management System (ADAMS), which provides information and decision support capabilities to air traffic managers, ground controllers, and National Central Flow Control. The objective of ADAMS is to decrease the net arrival-departure delay for a network of airports by leveraging high fidelity weather forecasts, capacity optimization algorithms, and ground sequencing guidance. This paper presents the results of the design efforts, with a brief look at functional architecture, and preliminary simulation results to evaluate the impact of ADAMS on net flight delay and network stability in a six-node network of airports

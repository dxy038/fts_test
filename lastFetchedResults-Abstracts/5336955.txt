We examine the subjective and the objective performance of MPEG-2 main profile/high level for HDTV. Formal subjective assessment was performed by non-expert viewers on the sequences coded at a bit rate of 18 Mbits/s. Since MPEG-2 allows a great flexibility at the encoding end, we also examined the impact of various MPEG-2 encoding parameters on the quality of the reconstructed HDTV video sequences in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

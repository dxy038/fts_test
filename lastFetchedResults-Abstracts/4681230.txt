The College of Geosciences at Texas A&amp;M University introduces an exciting new Master of Geosciences Degree in Ocean Observing Systems. The objective of this program is to train a new generation of ocean professionals knowledgeable in the development, design, and implementation of real-time operational oceanographic systems. It is envisioned that the nascent U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, IOOS, will be akin to the National Weather Service and will be designed to provide real-time oceanographic data, services, and products (http://www.ocean.us). The TAMU graduate program in Ocean Observing Systems is designed to meet the anticipated demand for specifically trained oceanographic persons

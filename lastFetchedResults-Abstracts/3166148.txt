This paper describes a five year collaborative effort between Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University to develop a robotic interface utilizing neural signals recorded from the motor cortex of the brain. The ultimate objective is to provide severely disabled individuals a "natural" method of con trolling prosthetic devices. Initial research uses rhesus monkeys to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a cortical controller.

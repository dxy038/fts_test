The current quantum evolution algorithms have slow convergence rate and poor robustness. In order to overcome the two shortages, a novel self-adaptive quantum genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the new algorithm adopts an encoding method which is based on the Bloch spherical coordinates. Secondly, in the process of searching the optimal solution, a self-adaptive factor is introduced to reflect the relative change rates which are relative to the difference of the best individualÂ´s objective fitness between the parent generation and the child generation. The convergence rate and direction of the algorithm can be improved by adjusting the factor. The rules of updating the rotation angle and are constructed. Finally, using hadamard gate of the quantum in the mutation strategy, it can enhance the diversity of population. The simulation results of the optimizing problem of the multidimensional complex functions show that the new algorithm has not only avoided effectively the premature and improved the convergence rate, but also boosted strikingly efficiency and stability robustness of the algorithm.

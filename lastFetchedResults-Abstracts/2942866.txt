A postprocessing algorithm is proposed to reduce the blocking artifacts of joint photographic experts group (JPEG) decompressed images. The reconstructed images from JPEG compression produce noticeable image degradation near the block boundaries, in particular, for highly compressed images because each block is transformed and quantized independently. The reduction of these blocking effects has been an essential issue for high quality visual communications. The proposed postprocessing algorithm reduces these blocking artifacts efficiently. A comparison study between the proposed algorithm and other postprocessing algorithms is made by computer simulation with several JPEG images. These simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the blocking artifacts significantly in the subjective and objective views

While the road capacity is limited and less and less space on the road is left, a large number of seats in cars are currently not occupied. The promotion of carpooling is a very challenging but, at the same time, a very efficient task. With WIGeoPOOL an exchange service for carpools is been developed, that makes carpooling as easy as possible. With the integration of the arrangement of carpools in a multimodal traffic and traveller information system, WIGeoPOOL is a major innovation. The GIS-based, intelligent searching algorithm presents the various travelling possibilities as well as the arrangement of carpools to the user in an easy way, and what is more, it compares the single modes in an objective way. Through the open architecture of the system and interfaces it´s possible to use all types of mobile devices in addition to the traditional Internet PC. Even the integration into navigational systems is possible. Under the frame of the R&amp;D-programme 12, intelligent infrastructure, of the Austrian ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, WIGeoPOOL is being developed and will be presented to the public in September 2005. Moreover, the integration with the Offboard navigation will be demonstrated at the beginning of 2006. Multimodal traffic and traveller information systems clearly have a positive influence on the traveller´s behaviour and mode choice. Transport modes, which are environmentally friendly and more efficient, profit the most.

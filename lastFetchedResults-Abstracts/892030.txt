This paper presents a multi-objective optimization methodology to solve the Optimal Reactive
Power Flow (ORPF) problem. The "-constraint approach is implemented for the Multi-objective
Mathematical Programming (MMP) formulation. The solution procedure uses Mixed Integer Non-Linear
Programming (MINLP) model due to discrete variables, such as the tap settings of transformers and
the reactive power output of capacitor banks. The optimum tap settings of transformers are directly
determined in terms of the admittance matrix of the network since the admittance matrix is constructed
in the optimization framework as additional equality constraints. The optimization problem is modeled in
General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software and solved using DICOPT solver. Simulation results
are implemented on the IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus test systems to simultaneously optimize the total fuel
cost, power losses and the system loadability as objective functions. The simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm is suitable and effective for the reactive power planning

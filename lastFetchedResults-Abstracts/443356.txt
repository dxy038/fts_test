Background
Previous studies on the efficacy of primary treatments for ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) have focused on local recurrence rates. Our objective was to detail the outcomes of local invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, and breast cancer mortality in patients previously treated for DCIS.
Methods
Clinical, pathologic, and outcome data were collected prospectively for 1236 patients with pure DCIS accrued from 1972 through 2005.
Results
There were 150 recurrences (87 DCIS and 63 invasive). Invasive local recurrence after mastectomy was rare (0.5% of patients) and after breast preservation was more frequent (12.0% of patients). The 12-year probabilities of breast cancer-specific mortality after mastectomy and after breast preservation were 0.8% and 1.0%, respectively. The 12-year breast cancer-specific mortality and distant disease probability for the 63 patients with invasive recurrences were 12% and 15%, respectively.
Conclusions
Regardless of initial treatment, most patients with invasive local recurrence after treatment for DCIS can be treated and cured.

The wide range of cardiac pacing products on the market today requires that clinicians and technicians must consult a large number of specification brochures when deciding to purchase a particular pacing device. To provide a convenient and objective means of perusing this information, we have developed EasySearch-Pacing, a data retrieval system for cardiac pacing product specifications which contains a comprehensive record of each pulse generator and pacing lead currently available. The system runs under Microsoft Windows, is easily installed and is designed to be highly intuitive. It is at present being distributed to over 50 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom

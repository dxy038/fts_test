Objectives/Hypothesis A realistic three-dimentional (3D) model of the larynx could be of value for the understanding of normal laryngeal motion and for studying pathological changes as well as in modeling potential therapy outcomes. The objective of this research was to present a new method of creating a computer model of the human larynx using data obtained through micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Study Design Prospective study. Methods A 7-T micro-MRI scanner was used to scan an excised larynx obtained postmortem from a 68-year-old woman. MRI data was manually segmented and compiled into 3D images using Mimics12.1 reconstruction software. Measurements of the reconstructed structures were also calculated using Mimics12.1. Results The 3D laryngeal model contained the thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid cartilages. Nearly all of the intrinsic muscles could be segmented. Although the cricoarytenoid joint could be visualized, the features of the cricothyroid joint were not clear. Muscle and cartilage volumes and surface areas were calculated from the 3D model. Conclusions The combination of MRI and 3D reconstruction generates promising results in the hopes of creating a highly realistic and detailed model of the human larynx.

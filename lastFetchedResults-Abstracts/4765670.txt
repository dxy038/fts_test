The main objective of MAC protocol design is introduced, and the typical S-MAC protocol in wireless sensor networks is analyzed. Then, this paper proposes a MAC protocol called the Traffic-Aware Medium Access Control (TA-MAC), a contention-based Medium Access Control protocol for wireless sensor networks, aimed to the defects of the use of fixed window when S-MAC carrier sense. In order to create a trade-off between the energy consumption and latency in some time-critical applications, TA-MAC adaptively adjusts the contention window size, based on some relevant network statistics. NS2 is used to simulate TA-MAC, which has proved that new TA-MAC achieves the best tradeoffs between latency and energy-efficiency according to this dynamic adaptation of contention window-sizes. Especially, TA-MACÂ´s performance improved significantly, compared with fixed contention window size of S-MAC protocol in the wireless sensors network having a larger load change.

Congestion has a significant influence on spot price. This paper utilizes location based pricing concept and has suggested a nonlinear programming formulation to determine power prices, with an objective to maximize the system social welfare within the system constraints. Comparison study of spot price is made and analyzed with three-control mechanism under transmission congestion situation, namely: `generation control´, `demand control´ and `FACTS control´. Spot price theory is used to analysis the variation of spot price. Sensitivity of transmission constraints to control variables showed its capability to slow down the vibration of spot price. Examples were used to further compare the behavior and reveal the regularity of spot price under these control mechanisms

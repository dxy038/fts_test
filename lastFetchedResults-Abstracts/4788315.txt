Travel time reliability is of great importance for evaluating the service level of public transit. If service level is expected to effectively improve, the travel time reliability must be enhanced. This paper proposed a novel model for setting up bus lane in urban area with the constraint of travel time reliability. The objective function is to minimize the setting up fare of bus lane. This model is chance constraint programming model, which can be solved by branch-and-bound method and genetic algorithm. The Bus No. 188 is performed as a case study to validate the model.

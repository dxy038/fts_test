Introduction & Objective: Thyroid nodule is a risk factor in thyroid carcinoma. So proper awareness, evaluation and appropriate management of these nodules can result in early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer which can lead to better prognosis. Materials & Methods: In this study we evaluated 100 patients with thyroid nodules who referred to Imam khomeini hospital of Ahvaz during 1370-79. 
Results: Findings showed that 18% of the subjects were diagnosed as thyroid cancer after operation and 89% were those who had solitary and cold nodule. 
Conclusion: It is believed that medical suppression therapy is a treatment of choice in these patients but we believe this can induce delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. So, lobectomy and isthmectomy appear to be the management of choice in thyroid nodules especially in solitary and cold nodule in males.

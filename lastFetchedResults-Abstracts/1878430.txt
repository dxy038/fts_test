Monocyte/macrophage cell death is an important event during mycobacterial infection. To get insights about the influence of mononuclear phagocyte maturation in this event we compared the response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection of fresh isolated monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from healthy tuberculin positive individuals. Both monocytes and MDM underwent apoptosis, however, there was a higher numbers of apoptotic macrophages with active Caspases 8 and 9. We also compared Mtb-induced cell death in U937 pro-monocytes and PMA-differentiated cells (U937D). In response to Mtb infection, U937D cells underwent apoptosis and promonocytes both apoptosis and necrosis. There were high number of U937D cells producing TNF-α and high number of IL-10+ promonocytes. These evidences suggest that U937 could be a valid model to study the mechanisms that rule Mtb-induced cell death. Experiments with the cell line and fresh isolated mononuclear cells with pharmacological inhibitors showed that induction of necrosis involved calcium and cAMP signals resulting in IL-10 production. Necrosis also correlated with Caspase 3, PLA2 activity and bacterial growth. In U937D cells and monocytes from healthy donors there was activation of calcium, TNF-α and Caspase 8 activation and decreased bacterial load. Understanding the mechanisms that control the dichotomy events between apoptosis and necrosis/oncosis associated with cell maturity might open new strategies to better control the course of mycobacterial infections.

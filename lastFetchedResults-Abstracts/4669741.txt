TARDEC has researched, developed and demonstrated Intelligent Microgrid technology at two locations within Schofield Barracks in Hawaii: Wheeler Army Airfield and East Range. These Systems incorporate renewable energy, grid power, bidirectional vehicles and energy storage, and uses the available power to support building loads at the installations. The demonstration confirmed the capability of a system to automatically congregate and control multiple sources and loads. Using high reliability equipment can be beneficial for reducing Microgrid down time. Flexibility is needed for Microgrid designs to meet specific needs for the users at the site they are being installed, including addressing incorporation of vehicles capable of bi-directional charging. The demonstrated microgrid system increases power reliability to critical loads, increases duration of power availability during extended utility outages, and improves overall energy efficiency. The technology is applicable to both fixed installations and temporary operating bases.

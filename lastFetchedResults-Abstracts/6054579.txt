The objective of this paper is to design and implement a phase-control dimming electronic ballast system which consists of a phase controller, a boost converter, a half-bridge inverter and a system controller. The firing angle of the phase controller is sensed as a reference to adjust the output voltage of the converter and switching frequency of the inverter to achieve a dimming feature. The designed system can solve the practical installation problem of the system. Hardware measurements have been presented to verify the proposed method in this paper.

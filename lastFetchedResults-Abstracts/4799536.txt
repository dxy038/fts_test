This paper compares several camera calibration methods on the estimation of specific extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. Good estimates of the chosen parameters, rotation and radial lens distortion are essential to increase the accuracy of quantitative measurements and to accurately stitch single field-of-view-based images together. The parameters are obtained using two selected methods on different objective magnifications on a microscope system using a fixed grid calibration pattern. We evaluate two methods and show that the rotation angles from one of the methods is consistent with a simple homography while the other estimates a consistently smaller angle. The radial distortion estimates are both very small and relate to a distortion of less than one pixel.

The VLSI design problem was partitioned to different levels. The authorsÂ´ objective was to develop an expert system to transform the behavioral descriptions (as given by the user or contractor) to the algorithmic state machine level (where data and control flow are defined). Such a step cuts the time needed by the designer using traditional tools. This phase was done experimentally on the IBM PC using SMALL TALK, a frame-based expert system shell. An example of such a system is shown for the problem of traffic light control

Hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) is formulated to design the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller for the teleoperation system used in microsurgery. Such a HGA is capable of searching the structure of the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> and its coefficients simultaneously. A multiple objective ranking scheme is also incorporated so that both the force and position transparency are optimized against any strictly passive environment.

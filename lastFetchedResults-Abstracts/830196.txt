A novel approach to the art of optimal design of modern flying vehicles including the application of multiple objective functions and constraints is presented and should hopefully advance the art of modern aircraft design. First, the concept of system identification is used to characterize non-linear systems in terms of generalized state space coordinates. Next, modern optimal control theory is applied to design concurrently, the functional elements of an aircraft system. Furthermore, modal coordinates are used to formulate the equations of motion of the total system so that the computational effort is minimized. The proposed analytical concept is validated using simple test cases.

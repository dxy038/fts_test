This paper presents a new asymmetrical multilevel inverter topology. The new topology can improve the number of output voltage levels greatly and simply topology structure using a bidirectional auxiliary switch. A hybrid PWM method is proposed for the new topology that switches in different cells works in different switching frequency to low switching losses. Lastly, an experimental 11-level voltage-source inverter system is built to verify the topology and PWM control method. It is demonstrated that the experimental results agree well with simulations.

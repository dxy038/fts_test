This paper proposes a genetic-algorithm-based learning strategy that models membership functions of the fuzzy attributes of surfaces in a model based machine vision system. The objective function aims at enhancing recognition performance in terms of maximizing the degree of discrimination among classes. As a result, the accuracy of recognizing known instances of objects and generalization capability by recognizing unknown instances of known objects are greatly improved. Performance enhancement is achieved by incorporating an off-line learning mechanism using genetic algorithm in the feedback path of the recognition system.

The objective of this study is to present the solar chimney power plant as a modern sensible technology for the use of solar power in the less developed countries. We introduce this new technology by first describing its principle of operation, then presenting a thermodynamic analysis to study its performance capabilities and limitations to match the desired output. We then presents an overview of the most suitable requirements needed for building a solar chimney in Lebanon or any other countries.

Study objective: Examination of alcohol consumption patterns of male spectators at two major-league baseball stadiums. Methods:  A prospective observational study was conducted at two stadiums over the course of three games at each venue. We approached 1,084 male spectators of drinking age in a consecutive fashion at two junctures: at the entrance gate and during the fifth inning inside the stadium's concourse. Of those approached, 747 (68.9%) participated. After verbal consent, participants completed a questionnaire and blew into a breath analyzer. The results were blinded and later analyzed. Results:  Forty-one percent of all participants tested positive for alcohol. The highest consumption occurred in the 20- to 35-year-old age group. In this age group, 50.8% had consumed some alcohol, and 10.8% had a blood alcohol level of .08% (intoxicated) or higher. Almost 5% of all participants tested during the fifth inning collection were intoxicated and claimed to be driving. Conclusion:  Of the spectators tested, those in the 20- to 35-year-old age group were most likely to have consumed alcohol and to be legally intoxicated. A disturbing number of spectators who had blood alcohol levels of .08% or higher late in the game claimed to be driving home.

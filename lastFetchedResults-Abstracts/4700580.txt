Device deployment is a fundamental issue of WSN provisioning. The types, number, and locations of devices determine many intrinsic properties of a WSN, such as coverage, connectivity, cost and lifetime. In this paper, we explore the problem of the optimal WSN deployment, with an objective of minimizing the network cost with lifetime constraint. We discuss and identify the characteristics of a type of WSN applications. The ultimate objectives of the device deployment for such applications are presented and discussed. We refine a deployment problem in a practical and fundamental scenario. We model this problem with the minimum set covering problem. Based on a recursive algorithm, a deterministic deployment strategy is proposed.

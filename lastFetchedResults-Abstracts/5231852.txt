Mission planning is one of the core steps to effectively exploit the capabilities of multi-level cooperative control of multiple semi-autonomous entities, such as unmanned aerospace vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we describe a methodology of Team Dynamics and Tactics (TDT) for mission planning in a military operation. This method for mission planning is implemented in a TDT module for an interconnected system called Strategies for Human-Automaton Resource Entity Deployment (SHARED). The main purpose of TDT is to develop and provide an effective target selection algorithm and an optimal salvo size algorithm to destroy the opposing force combat capabilities. Furthermore, the TDT mission plan will find an optimal assignment of decoys and avoid collateral damage. The proposed mission-planning scheme supplies the optimum degree of force for campaign objectives by using a linear integer programming with fuzzy objective function to allocate the best UAVs and weapons against each target and a parameter Nash game with proportional feedback control to determine optimum salvo size for each UAV. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated by a Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) example, and is demonstrated in a simulation environment based on the Boeing C4ISim Open Experimentation Platform (Boeing OEP).

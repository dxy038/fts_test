The objective of this paper is to propose the use of finite energy-type disturbances for modelling and estimation of power system harmonic signals using a linear matrix inequality formulation. The voltage or current signal to be estimated is assumed to be corrupted by finite-energy measurement and process disturbances which may be deterministic or stochastic in nature. Also, the magnitude and phase angle of each harmonic component is assumed to be unknown. Estimation techniques based on various criteria are presented to estimate the harmonic signal when corrupted by these disturbances. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed techniques

In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach for finding optimal protection cycles in Wavelength-Division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. To guarantee optimality, all cycles are considered as candidates in our study. When the working capacity is known, our first step is to create all cycles using the Span-Based Cycles (SBC) algorithm. Then the Heuristic Cycle Efficiency Selection (HCES) algorithm is used to search this set of cycles. The objective is to achieve full protection, while minimizing the spare capacity, with a fast computation time. Overall, the results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve results within 5.4% redundancy difference from the optimal value with less than 2 seconds of computation time in large scale networks.

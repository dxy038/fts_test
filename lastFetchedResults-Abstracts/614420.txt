Background & Objectives: Tuberculosis is one of the most important causes of mortality in undeveloped countries and causes more than 8 million deaths worldwide annually. In this research we studied epidemiologic parameters of tuberculosis in a period of five years in Rafsanjan and highlighted weakness and strength of health services.  
Methods: In a descriptive study all TB patients referred to Rafsanjan Health Centers were studied. The demographic data (e.g. sex, age, name, address, nationality, residence), result of sputum smear before and after treatment, type of disease, and success of treatment were included in a questionnaire and compiled for each case. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. 
Results: In total, 239 cases were diagnosed and the majority of them (148 cases) were Afghans. The number of cases decreased from 2002 to 2006 when the Afghans start to come back to their country. The majority of cases were female from urban areas with pulmonary tuberculosis. Most of them were in a range of 21 to 30 years old. The majority of cases was treated through prescribing 4 anti tuberculosis medicine and had negative sputum smear after treatment course.  The sputum smear were not tested in 16.5% and 22.5% of pulmonary TB patients before and after treatment, respectively.
Conclusion: As the majority of cases were Afghans, more attention should be paid on screening and preventive measures amongst them. Since the incidence rate of pulmonary TB in women was higher than men, their children should be checked for the disease. Although the majority of cases were treated successfully but the sputum smear test before and after treatment were not administered sufficiently and that more attention should be paid on this matter. The lower mean age of patients might be related to immigration of young Afghan job seekers to Rafsanjan.

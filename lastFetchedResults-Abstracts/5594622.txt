In this paper, a multi factor decision making approach is presented for prioritizing failures causes for the digester of pulping system of a paper mill as an alternative to traditional approach of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). The approach is based on the `technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution´ (TOPSIS). The priority ranking is formulated on the basis of six parameters (failure occurrence, non detection, maintainability, spare parts, economic safety and economic cost). The Shannon´s entropy concept is used for assigning objective weights to maintenance parameters.

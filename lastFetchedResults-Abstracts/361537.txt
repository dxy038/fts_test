Study objective: To determine whether pediatric patients with acute, mild to moderate acetaminophen exposures, treated with home monitoring alone, develop systemic signs of hepatic injury. Methods: A prospective, observational study of calls to a regional poison center over a 25-month period was performed. Patients were eligible for the study if they were younger than 7 years and had an acute maximum possible acetaminophen exposure of up to 200 mg/kg. Exclusion criteria included previous decontamination measures, possibility of ingestion of an extended-release preparation, health or medication issues that could increase susceptibility to hepatotoxicity, current symptoms of hepatotoxicity, and indeterminable ingestions. Study protocol included reviewing the signs and symptoms of early and late acetaminophen toxicity, a 4- to 6-hour follow-up call, and a 72-hour follow-up call. Outcome measures were defined as a verbal report by the patientâ€™s parent or guardian of the presence or absence of signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Results: A total of 1,039 patients were enrolled in the study, including 519 girls and 520 boys, with exposures ranging from 20 to 200 mg/kg. Eighteen patients were lost to follow-up; data were incomplete for 2 patients. At 72-hour follow-up, the remaining 1,019 patients were all doing well, without signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Conclusion:  On the basis of these data, pediatric patients with acute acetaminophen exposures of up to 200 mg/kg, treated with home monitoring alone, do not develop signs or symptoms of hepatic injury.

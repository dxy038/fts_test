Objective
A low-fat diet is hypothesized to be associated with significant weight loss. However, most previous studies have been limited to low-fat, low-calorie restrictive diets. This study evaluated the effect of isocaloric diets given “ad libitum” but different in relative amounts of fat and carbohydrate on body size, energy metabolism, body composition, insulin-like growth factor-1, and leptin serum levels in growing Wistar rats.
Methods

Weanling male rats were fed with one of three diets that contained a ratio of carbohydrate to fat of 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1. Food intake, body weight, body length, oxygen consumption, and body composition were measured at ages 21 to 50 d. Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin were also determined.
Results

Energy intake was similar across groups. The ratio of body weight to body length remained adequate throughout the experimental period. However, groups that received 3:1 and 2:1 showed increased weight and progressive decreases in energy expenditure, body fat composition, and serum level of leptin, but the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-1 to body length was not affected.
Conclusions

Dietary substitution of fat with carbohydrates contributes to weight gain by decreasing energy expenditure and possibly by decreasing leptin secretion.

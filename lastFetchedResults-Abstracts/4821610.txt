The medical image has become a diagnostic technique largely applied for the determination of doctorÂ´s diagnosis. But it is difficult for detecting the medical image borders accurately. This paper proposes a new medical image edge-detection technique based on PSO Algorithm. A new fitness function is formulated as the objective function. PSO algorithm is adopted to find the optimal filter mask to enhance the accuracy of the inspection system. The present method has been efficient in detecting borders of medical images. The results indicate the accuracy of the proposed edge-detection method is superior to that of conventional edge-detection methods for medical image.

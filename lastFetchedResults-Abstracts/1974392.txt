The primary objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of the heat-inactived lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cells involved in the adsorption of patulin. The bacterial cells were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique. The patulin-exposed bacterial cells and patulin-unexposed bacterial cells were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Zeta Potential and Contact Angle Method. It was found that Lactobacillus brevis 20023 (LB-20023), which has the highest specific surface area and cell wall volume, showed the highest capacity to adsorb patulin from the aqueous solution. Five major elements (C, N, O, P, and S) were detected by SEM-EDS, and LB-20023 displayed the highest nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) ratio (0.2938). LB-20023 exhibited the highest hydrophobicity, but the zeta potential was not prominent compared to other bacterial cells. The main functional groups involved in adsorbing patulin were C–O, OH and/or NH groups, suggesting that polysaccharides and/or protein were important functional components. Above all, the adsorption capacity of bacterial cells had close relationships with physical and chemical properties of cell surface, including specific surface area, cell wall volume, nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) ratio, hydrophobicity and functional groups. Further study will be needed to find other additional functional factors.

Background and Objective: Dietary nutrient imbalance create problems. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of iron therapy of women with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) cosulting 4 Iran University of Medical Sciences hospitals in Tehran.
Materials and methods: The subjects were thirty-seven nonpregnant women, 18 to 49 years, with iron-deficiency anemia by WHO criteria, receiving a daily dose of 100 mg Iron (as ferrous sulphate tablets 2/d ) for 8 weeks. Initial and final indices of iron and copper status were determined, and the intakes of the 2 metals were measured using the 24-hour diatry recall questionnaires (3 times). Data analysis was performed with the SPSS software, using the paired t test, Wilcoxon signed-ranked test and Pearson's correlation.
Results: Iron therapy resulted in significant increases (p<0.001) in the serum levels of the heamatologic (Hb, Hct, MCV, MCH, MCHC) and biochemical (Fe, ferritin, TS) parameters; the desirable change in TIBC was also significant (p<0.001). The serum Cu concentration did not increase significantly, while Cp increased from 33.76 ± 10.27 mg/dl to 39.56 ± 9.08 mg/dl. The ESOD activity also increased (from 371.62 ± 72.52 to 401.86 ± 67.39 U/ml; <0.05). The mean dietary Cu and Fc intakes were 24.9 ±11.2 and 1,18 ± .55 mg/d, respectively, with no variations during the period.
Conclusion: The treatmcn led to alleviation of IDA and increases in the body iron stores to normal levels. There were no adverse effects on the status of copper, the intake of which was low. Therefore, the present national iron supplementation program for IDA prevention and is justified.

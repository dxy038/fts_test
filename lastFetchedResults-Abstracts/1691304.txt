Inroduction & Objective: Usually the life duration of the fish species are faced with the problem of starvation naturally. Usually the case in winter, when during long migration to spawning and feeding on the living environment, decreased occur because of different reasons and cause severe loss of body energy reserves in fish.
Material and Methods: Experiments were done in five groups and three replications: Control: 5 weeks full feeding Group 1: One week starvation + One week feeding, group 2: Two weeks starvation + One week feeding, group 3: Three weeks starvation + One week feeding, group 4: Four weeks starvation + One week feeding. The amount of dissolved oxygen was fixed on 5.5 - 6 ppm, the temperature 24-28 0C and pH 7.5 to 8 were so controlled through the experiment. Carps fry were fed during the experimental period in control and compensatory growth times with commercial food (containing: 8.7 % moisture, 11.2 % ash, 32 % protein and 10.5 % fat).
Results: The results of carcass quality showed that there are significant difference at protein, fat, ash and fiber in different groups (P < 0.05). The results showed that increase of starvation period causes a decrease at protein, fat, ash and fiber an increase ash carcass. Also, results showed that increase of starvation period causes a decrease carcass quality and survival in Cyprinus carpio fry.

This paper proposes a parallel branch and bound algorithm designed for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) on NOWs (Networks of Workstations). Our objective is to minimize the execution time by considering parallel implementation to find an exact solution to the VRP in real time. Our experimental studies reveal that the proposed parallel branch and bound algorithm can achieve super-linear speedup for large problem sizes. Dynamic load balancing techniques for solving the VRP on NOWs are also discussed

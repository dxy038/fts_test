The biological characteristics of human reaming debris (HRD) generated in the course of surgical treatment of long bone diaphyseal fractures and nonunions are still a matter of dispute. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation has been to characterize the intrinsic properties of human reaming debris in vitro. Samples of reaming debris harvested from 12 patients with closed diaphyseal fractures were examined ultrastucturally and were cultured under standard conditions. After a lag phase of 4–7 days, cells started to grow out from small bone fragments and established a confluent monolayer within 20–22 days. The cells were characterized according to morphology, proliferation capacity, cell surface antigen profile, and differentiation repertoire. The results reveal that human reaming debris is a source of multipotent stem cells which are able to grow and proliferate in vitro. The cells differentiate along the osteogenic pathway after induction and can be directed toward a neuronal phenotype, as has been shown morphologically and by the expression of neuronal markers after DMSO induction. These findings have prompted interest in the use of reaming debris-derived stem cells in cell and bone replacement therapies.

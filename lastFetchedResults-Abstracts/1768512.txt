Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and its composites are recognized as alternative bearing materials for use in arthroplasty because of their mechanical properties. The objective of this project was to evaluate the biological response of two different kinds of carbon fiber-reinforced (CFR) PEEK compared with ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in vivo as a standard bearing material. Wear particles of the particulate biomaterials were injected into the left knee joint of female BALB/c mice. Assessment of the synovial microcirculation using intravital fluorescence microscopy as well as histological evaluation of the synovial layer were performed 7 days after particle injection. Enhanced leukocyteâ€“endothelial cell interactions and an increase in functional capillary density as well as histological investigations revealed that all tested biomaterials caused significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased inflammatory reactions compared with control animals (injected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline), without any difference between the tested biomaterials (P &gt; 0.05). These data suggest that wear debris of CFR-PEEK is comparable with UHMWPE in its biological activity. Therefore, CFR-PEEK represents an alternative bearing material because of its superior mechanical and chemical behavior without any increased biological activity of the wear particles, compared with a standard bearing material.

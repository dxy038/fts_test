Objective
st and participation in global health (GH) has been growing rapidly among pediatric residents. Residency programs are responding by establishing formal GH programs. We sought to define key insights in GH education from pediatric residency programs with formal GH tracks.
s
model pediatric residency programs with formal GH training were identified in 2007. Faculty directors representing 6 of these programs participated in expert interviews assessing 6 categories of questions about GH tracks: understanding how GH tracks establish partnerships with global sites; defining organizational and financing structure of GH tracks; describing resident curriculum and pre-trip preparation; describing clinical experiences of residents in GH tracks; defining evaluation of residents and GH tracks; and defining factors that affect development and ongoing implementation of GH tracks. Data were analyzed using qualitative methodology.
s
ograms relied on faculty relationships to establish dynamic partnerships with global sites. All programs acknowledged resident burden on GH partners. Strategies to alleviate burden included improving resident supervision and providing varying models of GH curricula and pre-trip preparation, generally based on core residency training competencies. Support and funding for GH programs are minimal and variable. Resident experiences included volunteer patient care, teaching, and research. Commitment of experienced faculty and support from institutional leadership facilitated implementation of GH programs.
sions
ors of 6 model GH programs within pediatric residencies provided insights that inform others who want to establish successful GH partnerships and resident training that will prepare trainees to meet global child health needs.

Objective: The efficacy and safety of gasless laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy during pregnancy were compared with those of conventional laparotomy. Study Design: Subjects for the 2 study groups were selected from consecutive patients who satisfied all entrance criteria. Seventeen women who underwent gasless laparoscopic cystectomy were compared with 18 women who underwent cystectomy by laparotomy. The intraoperative and postoperative courses, pregnancy outcomes, and complications were compared. Results: The patientsâ€™ ages, body mass indexes, mean cyst diameters, fetal gestational ages, and types of cysts did not differ significantly between the two groups. Blood loss, analgesic use, and need for tocolytic agents were significantly less in the laparoscopy group than in the laparotomy group. No abortions or preterm deliveries occurred in the laparoscopy group, whereas 1 abortion was recorded in the laparotomy group. Conclusion: Gasless laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy offers significant advantages with respect to laparotomy for the pregnant patient. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:554-7.)

The next generation Internet has a potential to become a ubiquitous and pervasive medium communication of all types of information. Yet, because of its decentralized nature and weak support for semantic, the Internet remains a chaotic repository, lacking of ability to allow users to discover, extract and integrate information of interest from heterogeneous sources, and its ability to provide these users with efficient tools to manipulate and convert the discovered information into knowledge. Recently, the peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay technologies have emerged to leverage the resource discovery on the Internet by providing a scalable framework to develop efficient mechanisms to distribute, share, and access resources in a large scale, highly dynamic environments. The main objective of this paper is to leverage P2P overlay technology to enable a personalized Web architecture for structured Internet resource access and knowledge sharing between community members of similar interests. The personalized Web architecture uses an ontology-based representation of the resources to enable a semantic resource discovery and access that reflects the interest of the user. The basic components of the personalized Web architecture are discussed, including the DHT-based, P2P overlay structure for indexing and resource location, the mechanisms required to support scalable routing, and the services and protocols to enable resource advertising, discovery and management.

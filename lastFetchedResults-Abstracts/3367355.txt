The objective of this project is to evaluate KellerÂ´s Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) in an appropriate course in engineering. This method is characterized by demanding unit perfection, being self-paced, using lectures only as motivational devices, and using proctors for most of the routine contact with students. In a rapidly advancing technology it is important to teach engineering students to be able to continue learning after graduation. The PSI method should be able to take advantage of the tight structure and definite course objectives of most engineering courses to develop self-learning ability in the students. This project takes the material in a senior level course in nuclear engineering and divides it into appropriate study units, develops a hierarchy between units, and creates the study questions and test material required by the PSI method. An evaluation of this technique in engineering is made using standard forms in existence in the Department of Educational Psychology and in the College of Engineering, as well as a comparison between the self-paced students and students who have taken the same course by the standard lecture method.

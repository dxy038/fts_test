In the present communication, a new series of 2-[(phenylmethylene)hydrazono]-4-oxo-3-phenyl-5-thiazolidineacetic acids (2a–p) have been synthesized. Benzaldehyde 4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazones substituted (1a–p) were also obtained and used as intermediate to give the title compounds. All synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, 1H and 13C NMR. The in vitro anti-Toxoplasma gondii activity of 1a–p and 2a–p was evaluated. The 4-thiazolidinones (2a–p) were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. For anti-Toxoplasma gondii activity, in general, all compounds promoted decreases in the percentage of infected cells leading to parasite elimination. These effects on intracellular parasites also caused a decrease in the mean number of tachyzoites. In addition, most of the 4-thiazolidinones showed more effective toxicity against intracellular parasites, with IC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 1 mM. According to results of antimicrobial activity, compounds 2f, 2l, and 2p showed best activity against Mycobacterium luteus, 2c was more active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 2g, 2l, and 2n showed same activity as nistatin (standard drug) against Candida sp. (4249).

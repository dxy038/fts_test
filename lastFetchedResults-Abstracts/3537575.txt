The successful evolution of an organisation depends upon the skill with which the reactions to change of a vital resource, the people involved, can be predicted and allowed for. Human behavioural patterns are highly complex and not readily amenable to logical prediction. Nevertheless, their influence on the success of an organisational structure is great. A number of classic experiments have taken place, largely in manufacturing industry, to identify guidelines for general planning but it remains very much a matter of individual case studies, if experience is to be built upon. One such study can be made of the way in which the technological evolution of a national network of television and radio transmitters has brought with it a need for continuous and iterative assessment of staff reaction to change in promoting successfully the long term objective. A particular aspect is studied, involving the problems created by small isolated working groups, and some conclusions are drawn to account for the limited success of that part of the overall plan. The creation of an organisation to meet an objective is often thought to start with a clean sheet of paper. In reality the paper often already bears the imprint of people and their reactions. Unless this is clearly recognised and taken into account, complete success is unlikely.

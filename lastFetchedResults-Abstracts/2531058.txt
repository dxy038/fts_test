Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic and progressive disease that has reached&nbsp;the epidemic level around the world. In Malaysia, according to the third National Health and&nbsp;Morbidity Survey (2006), the prevalence of diabetes has increased to 14.9% from 8.3% in&nbsp;1996. Co-morbid psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, and stress have been&nbsp;shown to be high among type 2 diabetic patients in Malaysia and they were also associated&nbsp;with the level of glycemia. The present study sought to examine the relationships of diabetes&nbsp;distress and psychological well-being to glycemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: A total of 60 adults with type 2 diabetes participated in the study and were given&nbsp;the diabetes distress scale (DDS-17) and well-being questionnaire (W-BQ 22) to measure their&nbsp;level of distress and psychological well-being using Pearson correlation test. The most recent&nbsp;data on glycemic control (or blood glucose level, HbA1c) were obtained from the participants&rsquo;
medical records, (with poor glycemic control defined by HbA1c>7.5%). Statistical Package&nbsp;for the Social Sciences (SPSS 19) used to analyze the data obtained from questionnaires.
Results: Pearson correlation results indicated significant positive relationship between blood&nbsp;glucose level and variables of diabetes distress (r=0.27, P=0.03) and psychological well-being&nbsp;(r=0.53, P=0.00). There were no significant relationships between blood glucose level and&nbsp;diabetes distress dimensions (emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related
distress, and internal distress). However, there were significant relationships between blood&nbsp;glucose level and variables of depression (r=-0.27, P=0.03) and anxiety (r=-0.41, P=0.00), both&nbsp;of which are dimensions of psychological well-being.
Conclusion: The study results have shown that diabetes distress and psychological wellbeing&nbsp;are associated with glycemic control and while it is not always possible to avoid stress,&nbsp;learning to recognize and cope with stressors may help individuals with diabetes maintain&nbsp;good glycemic control and improve general well-being. These results are consistent with the
results of past studies in Malaysia.abuse.

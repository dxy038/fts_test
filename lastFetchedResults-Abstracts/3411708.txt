The HIPAC Ion Source is a novel device intended to produce very highly stripped heavy ions; the achievement of this objective would permit the acceleration of heavy ions in relatively modest cyclotrons, linacs, etc. The problem of stripping heavy ions by successive electron impacts is discussed in general terms. The HIPAC Ion Source is then described using for illustrative purposes a nominal set of characteristic parameters. A torus 20 cm in maior radius is estimated to yield 1013 ions/s of Kr20+ or 1011 ions/s of U60+. The current status of experimental work on the concept is briefly reviewed.

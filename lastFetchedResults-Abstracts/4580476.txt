The objective of this work is to develop the technology for human-machine communication through the research of the emergence of mind in mechanical systems. In this paper, the hypothesis about the emergence of mind is proposed. First, a system chart expressing the human brain information processing and the development of an autonomous mobile robot &#8220;WAMOEBA-IR&#8221; (Waseda artificial mind on emotion base) are described. The conception of the WAMOEBA-IR design is that robots should have a self-presentation evaluation function. Further more, the method to evaluate the whole system is described from the viewpoint of the animal psychology. As a result of the experiments, WAMOEBA-IR showed specific emotional reactions with color appearances to some situations. WAMOEBA-IR has the sense of values about colors and sounds based on self-preservation as the first step of the emergence of mind

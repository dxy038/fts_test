The Distributed Power Flow Controller (DPFC) is a new device within the family of FACTS devices. The DPFC has the same control capability as the UPFC, but with much lower cost and higher reliability. The paper presents the experimental results of the DPFC in a scaled simple power system. The objective of this DPFC experimental setup is to verify the principle of using 3<sup>rd</sup> harmonic to exchange active power between shunt and series converters. Several converters are made, and each is controlled by an individual DSP. It proves that the DPFC can independently control active and reactive power flow through the line.

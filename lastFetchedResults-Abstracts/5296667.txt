The distributed generation (DG) plant mix connected to any network section has a considerable impact on the total amount of DG energy exported and on the amount of losses incurred on the network. A new method for the calculation of loss adjustment factors (LAFs) for DG is presented, which determines the LAFs on a site specific and energy resource specific basis. A mixed integer linear program is formulated to optimally utilise the available energy resource on a distribution network section. The objective function incorporates the novel LAFs along with individual generation load factors, facilitating the determination of the optimal DG plant mix on a network section. Results are presented for a sample section of network illustrating the implementation of the optimal DG plant mix methodology for two representative energy resource portfolios

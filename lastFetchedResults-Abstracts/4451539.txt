The project MAVT within the European Research program on advanced communication (RACE) has the objective to develop a demonstrator for a Mobile Audio Visual Terminal. Further researches are conducted for the development of a terminal simulation in the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). The main objectives of the project are: To develop powerful video and audio coding algorithms for transmission of moving video, still video and speech in UMTS. To implement these algorithms on a demonstrator called MAVT in a DECT environment and in an UMTS simulation. The project duration was from February 1992 to December 1994. The MAVT main achievements of the first year have been: Clear definition of services and user requirements. Description of transition between different networks. Introduction of the mobile test sequences MAVT carphone and MAVT foreman. First reference model for px8kbit/s video codec. Due to the noisy channels and high error rates in a mobile environment the source data stream is protected by RCPC Codes (Rate Compatible Punctured Convolutional Codes)

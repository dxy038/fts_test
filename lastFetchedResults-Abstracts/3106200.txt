Hyperspectral reflectance data collected diurnally from an instrumented tower were examined in conjunction with the eddy correlation fluxes and meteorological measurements made throughout a growing season at a mature Douglas fir forest in British Columbia, Canada (DF49). Here we present 2006 in situ results relating the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI<sub>551</sub>) to photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE). Canopy structure information was used to partition the forest canopy into sunlit and shaded fractions. At each observation period, the PRI<sub>551</sub> was examined for the sunlit, shaded, and mixed sunlit/shaded canopy segments as defined by their instantaneous position relative to the solar principal plane (SPP). We show that the PRI<sub>551</sub> clearly captures the differences in leaf groups on sunny days. We also examined PRI<sub>551</sub> from MODIS ocean band imagery acquired over DF49 during a five year period (2001-2006) from both Terra (late morning) and Aqua (early afternoon) platforms. The MODIS observations from Terra and Aqua were acquired in different viewing planes above the landscape over a range of view zenith angles, and sampled the backscatter (sunlit) and forward scatter (shaded) sectors of the forestÂ´s bidirectional reflectance distribution function. When tower-based bulk canopy LUE from 2006 was recalculated to estimate foliage-based values for the three foliage groups under their incident light environments, a strong linear relationship with PRI<sub>551</sub> was demonstrated (r<sup>2</sup>~0.80). A similar relationship between the MODIS PRI<sub>551</sub> and tower-based bulk LUE was obtained from satellite observations (r<sup>2</sup>~0.62), but only for the backscatter observations obtained at high light levels (APAR, &gt;1500 mumol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The MODIS observations, while not ideal in terms of spatial resolution (&gt; 1 km<sup>2</sup>) or optimal viewing configuration, nevertheless provided a means to m- - onitor forest under stress using narrow spectral band indices and off-nadir observations.

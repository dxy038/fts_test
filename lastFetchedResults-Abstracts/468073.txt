Objective: This study examined the effects of order of previous modes of delivery on the rate of cesarean delivery and duration of a trial of labor among women with a history of 1 previous cesarean delivery and 1 previous vaginal delivery. Study Design: The medical records of 4393 women at our institution who were seen June 1984-July 1996 for a trial of labor after a previous cesarean delivery were abstracted. The 800 women with a history of 1 previous cesarean and 1 previous vaginal delivery were included in this analysis. They were split into 2 groups by obstetric history: (1) 1 cesarean delivery followed by 1 vaginal delivery (vaginal last) and (2) 1 vaginal delivery followed by 1 cesarean delivery (cesarean last). Patient characteristics, durations of labor, and rates of cesarean delivery were compared with Ï‡2 analysis, the Student t test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Possible confounding variables were controlled for with multivariate logistic regression. Results: The rates of cesarean delivery for the vaginal last and cesarean last groups were 7.2% and 14.7%, respectively (P = .002). The median durations of labor for the vaginal last and cesarean last groups were 5.6 and 7.0 hours, respectively (P = .01). The differences in cesarean rates and durations of labor were seen regardless of the indication for the previous cesarean delivery. Conclusions: Among women with 1 previous cesarean and 1 previous vaginal delivery, those whose most recent delivery was vaginal had a lower rate of cesarean delivery and shorter duration of labor than did those whose most recent delivery was cesarean.

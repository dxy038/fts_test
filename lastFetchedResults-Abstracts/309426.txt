Pressure ulcer incidence and sacral skin temperature (Ts) were measured in hospitalized neurologically impaired Thai patients (n = 17) positioned supine and then laterally. Pressure ulcer incidence within 2 weeks of admission was 47%. Regardless of reclining position, mean sacral Ts in subjects who developed a pressure ulcer was higher (p < .01) than those who did not develop an ulcer. The data suggest that Ts may increase at least 1.2 °C 24–96 hr before sacral pressure ulcer development. Sacral Ts may be an objective predictor of sacral pressure ulcer development in hospitalized neurologically impaired Thai patients.

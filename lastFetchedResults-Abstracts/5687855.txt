This paper presents a Multicycles Protocol for Hospital Automation (MP-HA) that works over multicast addressing and uses a Master-Slave architecture. The protocol creates a segmented logical network based on multicast addressing associated to hospital beds. The objective of MP-HA is to ensure the determinism on network through medium access control mechanism increasing the transmission throughput. Thus, it creates a periodical environment making use of parallel cycles which is called multicycles.

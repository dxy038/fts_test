First results of controller design and implementation applied to the UNIWEX wind turbine system are presented. Identification experiments have been designed such that all relevant dynamics are excited. Experiments on a real life wind turbine have been carried out. Using prediction error methods experimental models with a Box-Jenkins structure have been calculated. Experimental models have been compared to theoretical models of the test turbine. Based on normalized coprime factorization of one experimental model a controller has been designed such that it robustly stabilizes all models. The implemented controller has been evaluated by means of measurements on the UNIWEX wind turbine and has proven to satisfy the design objective

Objective: The self-made novel therapy &#8220;cross electro-nape-acupuncture&#8221; (crisscross electroacupuncture in the nape points) was employed to promote the remodeling of cough reflex as a protective reflex in order to prevent and control respiratory tract infection. Methods: A random number table was used according to the order of visits. Single-blinded evaluation was conducted. Forty-five cases of stroke with impaired cough reflex through a tracheotomy tube were randomly divided into three groups. Group I received cross electro-nape-acupuncture combined with basic Western-medicine treatment, Group II received acupuncture(without electricity) combined with basic Western-medicine treatment, and control group received basic western medicine alone. Statistical analysis showed no statistical difference in age, gender and disease duration between the three groups. Self-made Guofeng Cai tracheotomy tube cough reflex grading scale, Kubota´s water swallow test, evaluation of swallowing function, clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) were recorded and compared before and after treatment. Results: There were statistical differences in Guofeng Cai tracheotomy cough reflex grading scale, Kubota´s water swallow test, evaluation of swallowing function and CPIS (all Ps &lt;; 0.05). Conclusions: 1) Cross electro-nape-acupuncture can promote the remodeling of cough reflex as a protective reflex; 2) Cross electro-nape-acupuncture can improve swallowing function in patients with cerebral infarction; 3) Cross electro-nape-acupuncture can assist in treating the lung infection among patients with impaired cough reflex. 4) The action of cross electro-nape-acupuncture in promoting cough reflex may be associated with the effect of electric field on the medullary respiratory center.

The objective of the present study was to perform experimental and theoretical analyses of the process of roasting turkey breast slices in a steam-convection oven with a view to determining the optimal values of temperature and steam saturation during roasting, under the assumption of a constant slice thickness. The roasting process was conducted at air temperature of 160 °C, 180 °C, 200 °C and 220 °C and steam saturation of 0%, 20%, 50%, 70% and 90%. Two qualitative criteria based on eating quality and nutritive value have been applied in process optimization. Those criteria proved to be mutually opposing. As regards eating quality, the best product was that roasted at a temperature of 160 °C without the application of steam in the oven. The same product was characterized by the lowest nutritive value. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the protein content of turkey meat, largely responsible for its nutritive value, is related to changes in protein concentrations in samples resulting from weight loss during cooking. The highest nutritive value was noted in respect of the product roasted at a temperature of 200 °C with 20% steam saturation. Both optimal products were microbiologically safe.

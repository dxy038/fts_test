The authors propose an adaptation and learning algorithm to adjust behavior coordinator against small changes of the objective task or a new one. This method measures the relation between the each local behavior and the global behavior, and then determines the direction of change of the activation values from the behavior coordinator based on the measurements. The monkey-type locomotion robot, Brachiator III has 13 links and 12 joints and is able move like a real ape in a three-dimensional space. The controller is designed for a primitive case. The proposed algorithm is used when the branch interval is changed and when continuous locomotion is desired. We show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments using Brachiator III

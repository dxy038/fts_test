As an inherently process-oriented and participatory art form, new media art has a profound influence on the roles of the curator, artist, audience, and institution. Social and technological developments have transformed the role of the curator from a carer of objects to one that focuses on the processes, systems, and the interaction between "multiple agents." As a curator, the author\Â´s objective is to challenge the conventional presentations of new media art in galleries and move beyond screen-based representations. This article describes two exhibitions where she collaborated with artists to translate their work to a gallery setting, discusses the challenges of curating online work, and explores new representations of form for Internet-based work in galleries.

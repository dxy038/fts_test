The objective of this paper is to elaborate a new watermarking algorithm applied to the medical imaging. This algorithm must be invisible, robust and has a rate, relatively high, integrating data. The proposed method uses the standard JPEG compression for the integration of medical data. The insertion block is inserted just after the quantization phase. To control identification and eventually the correction (if possible) of the inserted data, we use a series of turbocodes to recover the inserted data, after application of several attacks. The simulation studies are applied on MRI medicals images.

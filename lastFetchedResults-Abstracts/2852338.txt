This paper discusses the use of personalisation in crowd systems. Crowd Systems are systems, which may be virtual or physical, and which involve a crowd of people in the realisation of one or more system-level objective(s). We define Crowd Systems in terms of the General System Theory, propose a classification scheme and discuss their complexity. Then we highlight the benefit of using personalisation in such systems. We introduce the concept of Personalised Crowd System, its specificities and the associated research challenges. The discussion is further illustrated with examples and research results of specific cases. To our knowledge this is the first paper attempting to examine the usage and impact of personalisation on Crowd Systems.

The VBC (Voltage Bus Conditioner) is a bidirectional DC-DC converter for damping the instability and any transients of bus voltage in the DC DPS (Distributed Power System). In this paper, the PI controller for the VBC has designed at the frequency domain. The proposed PI controller is not only damping the bus transients, but also keeping the storage voltage level. Simulation by Matlab Simulink and experimental results are presented for the validity of the proposed control technique.

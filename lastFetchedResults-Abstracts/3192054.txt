Experiments have been performed on the production, conditioning, and propagation of high current electron beams using NRLÂ´s SuperIBEX generator.<sup>1</sup> The objective of these experiments has been to produce high current density electron beams that are able to propagate multiple betatron wavelengths without suffering disruptive hose growth. The key to producing a hose-stable high current beam is to condition the beam by damping radial perturbations and tailoring the emittance profile to prevent growth of the instability. Results from recent experiments on beam production, conditioning, and propagation will be presented.

Energy storage devices play a very important role in nowadays inter-connected power systems. They could be used for peak shaving as well as mitigating the fluctuations caused by distributed generation sources. The development of battery technologies makes it possible to integrate large-scale battery energy storage (BES) devices into power systems. In this paper, a multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) model including BES is proposed to study the effect of BES on power generation scheduling. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the total generation cost considering charging and discharging costs of BES. State of charge (SOC) constraints and other power network constraints are taken into consideration in the model. The proposed model determines the optimal output power in each period as well as the battery charging/discharging schedule. Finally, the numerical example based on IEEE-30 system shows effectiveness and validity of the proposed model.

Background: Fertility protection is important in young patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the effects of ABVD and ChlVPP chemotherapeutic protocols for Hodgkin's disease on the spermatozoa fertility indices of male rat. Materials and Methods: After determining tolerance dose of drugs in pilot study, 24 male rats were divided to four groups: ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycine, vinblastin, dacarbazine) group, ChlVPP (chlorambucil, vinblastin, procarbazine, prednisolone) group and two control groups one for each treatment group. One half of the lethal dose for fifty percent of population was used for treatment of animals in each protocol. Spermatozoa were used for computer- assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and morphology analyses. Heads of spermatozoa were counted. Results: Body weight, testis and epididymis weights, spermatozoa number, and live ratio in treated rats were significantly less than their control groups (p<0.05) specifically these parameters in ABVD group was less than ChlVPP group (F= 19.6, p=0.000). Spermatozoa morphology in treated groups were more abnormal than control groups (p<0.05). Evaluation of reproductive system efficacy showed that there was no pregnancy in ABVD group and in ChlVPP group there was only one pregnant female (16.6%). Conclusion: According to this study results, the ChlVPP had fewer side effects than ABVD in tolerance doses on male rats' reproductive system. More clinical trial studies are suggested on Hodgkin's patients. With equal treatment effectiveness, it will be better to use the most reliable and safe treatment especially in young patients.

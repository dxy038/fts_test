It is shown that all degree-4 Borel Cayley graphs can also be represented by more restrictive chordal rings (CRs) through a constructive proof. All bidirectional, degree-4 Borel Cayley graphs have the more restrictive CR representations, and hence Hamiltonian cycles always exist for these graphs. A step-by-step algorithm to transform any degree-4 Borel Cayley graph into CR graphs is provided. Examples are used to illustrate this concept

Considering problems of power quality in sustainable buildings and the development needs of electric vehicles (EVs), a DC micro-grid based on sustainable buildings is proposed, and EV batteries are presented as storage device to balance voltage fluctuation of DC micro-grid and meet the need of EVs for DC electricity. To enable bidirectional energy flow between the DC bus and EV batteries, double closed-loop control strategy is applied in the bidirectional DC/DC converters. The simulation results show that, during both grid-connected mode and islanded mode, the presented system can realize the expected operating target.

A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a network of intelligent vehicles that communicate with other vehicles in the network. The main objective of VANET is to provide comfort and safety for passengers. In addition, various transaction based services, such as information about gas prices, restaurant menu, and discount sale, can be provided to drivers. In order to make these services available, there is a need for an efficient service discovery protocol. In this paper, we propose a new protocol called Address Based Service Resolution Protocol (ABSRP) to discover services in vehicular ad-hoc networks. As most of the transaction based services are provided by roadside units, we exploit their presence to perform service discovery. We utilize the unique address assigned to each service provider in order to discover a route to that service provider. Our technique proactively distributes the service providerÂ´s address along with its servicing capabilities to other roadside units within a particular area. Each roadside unit will then utilize this information to service the request placed by the vehicles. If the service provider (destination node) is not reachable over the vehicular network, we propose to use a backbone network to service requests. Our approach is independent of the network layer routing protocol. We have evaluated the performance of our approach by using the Qualnet simulation tool.

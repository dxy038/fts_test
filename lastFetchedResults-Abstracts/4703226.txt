A modified Smith predictor for linear delayed haptic interaction is presented. The objective is to design a feedback law which compensates the time delay by its somehow elimination from the characteristic equation of the closed loop system. This method is robust within a certain safe prediction interval. The applicability of Smith predictor in the case of haptic interaction using computer haptic algorithms is shown.

Sorbents for semidry-type flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process can be synthesized by mixing coal fly ash, calcium oxide, and calcium sulfate in a hydration process. As sorbent reactivity is directly correlated with the specific surface area of the sorbent, reacting temperature, concentration of the reacting gas species and relative humidity, two major aim in the development of a kinetic model for the FGD process are to obtain an accurate model and at the same time, incorporating all the parameters above. Thus, the objective of this work is to achieve these two aims. The kinetic model proposed is based on the material balance for the gaseous and solid phase using partial differential equations incorporating a modified surface coverage model which assumes that the reaction is controlled by chemical reaction on sorbent grain surface. The kinetic parameters of the mathematical model were obtained from a series of experimental desulfurization reactions carried out under isothermal conditions at various operating parameters; inlet concentration of SO2 (500 ppm ⩽ C 0 , SO 2 ⩽ 2000 ppm), inlet concentration of NO (250 ppm ⩽ CO,NO ⩽ 750 ppm), reaction temperature (60 °C ⩽ T ⩽ 80 °C) and relative humidity (50% ⩽ RH ⩽ 70%). For a variety of initial operating conditions, the mathematical model is shown to give comparable predictive capability when used for interpolation and extrapolation with error less than 7%. The model was found useful to predict the daily operation of flue gas desulfurization processes by using CaO/CaSO4/coal fly ash sorbent to remove SO2 from flue gas.

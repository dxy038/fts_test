In this paper, we present a novel color image demosaicking algorithm using a voting-based edge direction detection method and a directional weighted interpolation method. By introducing the voting strategy, the interpolation direction of the center missing color component can be determined accurately. Along the determined interpolation direction, the center missing color component is interpolated using the gradient weighted interpolation method by exploring the intra-channel gradient correlation of the neighboring pixels. As compared with the latest demosaicking algorithms, experiments show that the proposed algorithm provides superior performance in terms of both objective and subjective image qualities.

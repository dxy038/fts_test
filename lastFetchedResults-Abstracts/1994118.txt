Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasiticâ€“infections and zoonotic disease in the countries of Mediterranea basin and Middle East, including Iran. The causative agent of visceral eishmania in Iran is leishmania infantum and dog and canines are main reservoirs. Infections of leishmania infantum in rodents have been proved. The  main objective  of  this investigation was to screen leishmania  infection  in  rodents  and  possible role in transmission of  the disease  to human by Parasitology, Serology and Molecular methods in  Sarab District,  East  Azarbaijan  Province  in 2011. In  this  research, 100 rodents of  four  species  and  genus were  trapped  alive  in  various parts of  the Sarab  area. Befor killing the caught rodents, blood  samples were  collected  from  each of them in Polypropylene  tubes  and   this  samples  were  tested  by  direct agglutination  test (DAT). Amongst  them 1(1% )rodent  seropositive, 6 (6%) rodents  had  lower titers  than  positive  titer, and  93 rodents were  seronegative. The  smears were  prepared  from  spleen  and  liver   all  animals  examined  microscopically  and  did  not  show  any  amastigotes. Part  of  the  spleen and  liver of  rodents were cultured   in  NNN, RPMI 1640  media, but lishmania  were not isolated  from  culturs  media.  Finaly, from 100  rodent,s   spleen tissue  DNA  extraction  for  PCR  with  using  specific  primers  named  k-DNA  were  done but any  Band  linked  to lishmania were observed.

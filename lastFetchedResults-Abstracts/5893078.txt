The objective of this paper is to develop and analyze models used in emergency care system. A different modeling approach is presented based on the idea of using a priority measure defined as &#8220;operating priority&#8221; that changes with time as a patient waits for service and each resource pays due consideration to skill hierarchy and selects the next patient for treatment. The new modeling approach breaks away from the conventional approach in which entity drives the request for resources. The resource is the driver in the new approach. This paper presents a comparison of performance between the conventional and the new approach in modeling emergency care. The paper also discusses potential enhancements of the proposed approach.

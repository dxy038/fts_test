Image quality assessment plays an important role in various image processing applications. A great deal of effort has been made in recent years to develop objective image quality metrics that correlate with perceived quality measurement. Unfortunately, only limited success has been achieved. In this paper, we provide some insights on why image quality assessment is so difficult by pointing out the weaknesses of the error sensitivity based framework, which has been used by most image quality assessment approaches in the literature. Furthermore, we propose a new philosophy in designing image quality metrics: The main function of the human eyes is to extract structural information from the viewing field, and the human visual system is highly adapted for this purpose. Therefore, a measurement of structural distortion should be a good approximation of perceived image distortion. Based on the new philosophy, we implemented a simple but effective image quality indexing algorithm, which is very promising as shown by our current results.

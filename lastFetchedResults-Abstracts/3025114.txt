The objective of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of multihopping technique applied to CDMA packet communication system. The system model is designed so that mobile stations that have no direct connectivity to any base station setup multi-hopped paths by way of neighbor mobile stations. Two policies are addressed in selecting relay stations based on battery usage, minimized usage on relay station and minimized usage on all stations along multihopped path. With these conditions, system characteristic is evaluated in terms of system capacity and coverage area extension. The result of computer simulation shows that multihopping technique does extend the coverage area with effectively equal performance to the conventional single hop system when the system load is relatively light.

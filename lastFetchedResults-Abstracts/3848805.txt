A methodology for robust design analysis of microelectromechanical systems is presented by considering the example of comb microresonators and uncertainty in parameters governing the resonant frequency and the transconductance values. Analytical models for the variability in the resonant frequency and transconductance are developed as function of the parameter uncertainty, and used as objective functions sought to be minimized in a robust design endeavor. An enumeration search over the design space is utilized to determine the optimal design of microresonators that minimize the variability subject to constraints on performance requirements. The results are presented over a wide interval of operating resonant frequency, and can be used in the robust design of microresonators.

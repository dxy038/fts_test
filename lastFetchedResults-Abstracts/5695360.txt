In this paper we consider the use of Single Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization (SC-FDE) scheme in Single Frequency Network (SFN) broadcasting systems, with the objective of studying the impact of distinct Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) between the local oscillator at each transmitter and the local oscillator at the receiver. We consider a specific scenario in order to propose an efficient method for estimating the channel frequency response and CFO associated to each transmitter. We also propose a set of receiver structures which are able to compensate the variations of the equivalent channel. The performance results show that we can have excellent performance, even when the considered transmissions have substantially different CFOs.

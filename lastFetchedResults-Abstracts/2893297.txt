Electronic Product Code has been widely used to identify items with RFID tags. To the best of our knowledge, however, few works focus on exploring the value of textural data in the EPC Network that pertains to EPC. In this paper we propose the concept of the content-based query for tagged items by applying information retrieval method to the EPC network resources. The objective of the content-based query is to discover a set of class-level tagged items of interest which correlate with the user-specific keyword or EPC in question. Accordingly, we describe the strategies in terms of content integration, modelling and similarity measurement for the content-based queries. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

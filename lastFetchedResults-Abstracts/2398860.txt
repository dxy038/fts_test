Objective
ng the force between the implant and the bone by recapitulating a similar matrix has the potential to reduce implant failure. To begin to pursue the goal of creating a periodontal ligament interface between a dental implant and bone, the mechanism of cellular attachment to dental implant surfaces must be characterized.
s
s study we examined the role of integrin receptors in the attachment of periodontal ligament fibroblasts to titanium surfaces utilized on dental implants; those surfaces included smooth polished titanium, acid pickled titanium, ground titanium, sandblasted and acid etched titanium, non-oxidized titanium that has been sandblasted and acid etched, hydroxyapatite coated titanium, titanium plasma sprayed or uncoated titanium. For these studies integrin mediated fibroblast attachment was blocked by the integrin blocking peptide GRGDSP or anti-integrin Î²1 antibody or a combination of the two. Quantitation of periodontal ligament fibroblast attachment was completed by counting cells on the various implant surfaces after culturing in vitro for 24 h with and without the integrin receptor blockers.
s
dy and peptide treatment significantly reduced the number of fibroblasts cells attached to the various implant surfaces but this effect varied significantly depending on the surface. Moreover, increased levels of peptide further decreased fibroblasts attachment in a dose dependent manner.
icance
ng studies suggest first, that integrin receptors function in periodontal ligament attachment to titanium surfaces and second, that different integrin subunits are important in attachment to a particular surface.

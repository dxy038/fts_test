Modular isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter has interesting features such as low switching losses, bidirectional power flow, compatibility for high power applications and less number of switching devices. Zero voltage switching (ZVS) capability without using any auxiliary circuit, is one of the most important specifications of the modular isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter. Multiplicity of switches and high power applications of modular converters enforce to study the ZVS conditions. In this paper, the ZVS conditions of the modular isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter are studied and its soft-switching criteria are derived in detail. The simulation and measurement results are presented to verify the theoretical aspects.

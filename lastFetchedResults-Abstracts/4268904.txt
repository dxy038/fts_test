Using a skill is not a single action. The relationship the specific actions are such that each contributes under some direct manner to the capability of people to function effectively or ineffectively in a given situation. Since a skill is the ability to demonstrate a system and sequence of behavior, it must result in something observable, something that some one in the person´s environment can see. For example planning ability is a skill. People who have this skill can identify sequence of action to be taken to accomplish a specific objective. They can identify potential obstacles to those actions. People who have this skill can identify sources to help in avoiding obstacles or overcoming them when they interface with the action sequence. None of these separate actions constitutes a skill, but the system of behavior does. People who have this skill can apply it in any number of situations or contexts.

This paper presents a methodology for optimal allocation and sizing of photovoltaic grid-connected systems (PVGCSs) in distribution systems. The optimization process is solved by multi-objective optimization approach with methods to evaluate technical and economical impacts. The technical impact is related with the improvement of the feeder voltage stability. This enhancement is evaluated by means of the potential rise of loadability limits. The economical impact is associated with the PV generation profitability and the potential loss reduction on the feeder. The losses and voltage profile evaluation is based on a power flow method for radial networks with the representation of dispersed PV generators. The application results of the proposed methodology are presented for an actual feeder.

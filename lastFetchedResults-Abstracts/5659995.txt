The big earthquake will produce many sufferers. Rescue robots which help sufferers are developing in various laboratories. And it is very important for rescue team to grasp sufferer´s condition. If it is possible to know them, we can decide order to rescue and take suitable treatment after rescues. And a lot of life of the sufferers will be saved. It seems that it is difficult for the rescue team to approach the sufferer at the disaster. Therefore, in the disaster area, the measurement of the sufferer´s bio-signals should be taken by remote sensing or easy contact. Our objective of this study is the development of the bio-signal sensors which can be set on the small rescue robot for this kind of measurement. In this paper, we will talk about our developed sensors which can measure respiratory rate and pulse rate.

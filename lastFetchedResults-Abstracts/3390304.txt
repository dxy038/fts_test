A zero-current-switching (ZCS) switched-capacitor (SC) quasi-resonant (QR) converter is presented to suppress current stress during the bidirectional power flow control processing. The voltage conversion ratios 4/ 1/4 are achieved by using the four-MOSFET switches, a switched-capacitor and resonant-inductor. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the ZCS SC QR bidirectional converter.

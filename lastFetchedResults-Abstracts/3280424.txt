Varieties of multimedia data are being captured, stored and shared at an unprecedented scale. The technology that helps people search, use and express themselves with such media is lagging behind. The variety of media types from multiple sources is an essential feature of modern multimedia content. Effective integration of multimedia data is a challenging problem. The overall objective of this study is to show that the common representation strategy should be capable of taking full advantage of information collected from multiple sources and combine the descriptions of data in a unified framework for various tasks to be performed for analysing the multimedia content. This paper aims at proposing a framework to deal with variety and integration of Multimedia data in a generic form to express as input for video processing systems and get a desired optimal correlation and prediction of multimedia data.

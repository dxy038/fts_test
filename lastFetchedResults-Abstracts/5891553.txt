The main function of vehicle turning mechanism is to realize the ideal relations of turning angle of internal and external wheels when vehicle steering. It plays an important role in reducing the tire side-slipping and enhancing the turning stability. The traditional analysis of the integral type steering mechanism has still been approximate planar motion analysis. Because of kingpin inclination angle and caster angle, vehicles steering movement is actually spatial motion. Thus analysis of the integral type steering mechanism by using planar projection method and spatial kinematics method can provide the reference to the optimization of the trapezoidal mechanism. This article first analyzes the characteristics of steering mechanisms, and then establishes about objective function and design variables, obtains the constraint condition which in the steering trapezium organization optimization designs. Optimization results, to the wheel theory corner and the actual corner has carried on the fitting analysis and the error analysis, has proved that solve the optimization problem using MATLAB is a simple, efficient method. This method may realize vehicle steering trapezium organization fast optimized design.

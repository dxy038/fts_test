Near-field scanning is often used to solve EMC problems. Aside from the purpose of visualization of near-fields, measured near-field data can be used to estimate far-field. One of many challenges associated with using near-field to far-field transform (NFFFT) technique for EMC application is the handling of attached cables. The objective of this investigation is to evaluate different methods to add cable information to the near-field data for far-field estimation. The investigation is carried out using numerical experiments in EMCoS EMC studio, which is a commercial MoM (Method of Moment) tool for EM simulation. Measurement results from a test structure are also presented to validate the simulation results.

Summary from only given, as follows. This paper deals with the detailed modeling of the human body for the evaluation of implanted electrode potential distributions and defibrillation fields. Modeling details have been achieved in 2-D and 3-D down to the arbitrary topologies of the human body and its organs. This type of analysis dictated for the need for 2-D and 3-D mesh generators that can be used to discretize arbitrary shapes (as those of the human organs). Developed grid generators provide an optimum finite element model of the problem. The main objective of this study is directed towards the 2-D and 3-D computation of the potential distribution across the human heart and to solving the inverse problem of determining the optimum sizes and locations of the stimulation electrodes to be used in achieving a successful defibrillation.

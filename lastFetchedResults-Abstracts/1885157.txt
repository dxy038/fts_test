Biodiesel is considered as a renewable hydrogen source for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This study contributes to a fundamental understanding of biodiesel autothermal reforming (ATR), which has not yet been widely explored in the open literature. Ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) ATR is established as a baseline for this analysis. This work applies a micro-soot meter based on a photo-acoustic method to quantify the condensed carbon from a single-tube reactor, and uses a mass spectrometer to measure the effluent gas composition under different operating conditions (reformer temperature, steam/carbon ratio, oxygen/carbon ratio, and gas hourly space velocity). The key objective is to identify the optimum operating environment for biodiesel ATR with carbon-free deposition and peak hydrogen yield. Thermodynamic analysis based on the method of total Gibbs free energy minimization is used to evaluate the equilibrium composition of effluent from the reformer. The experimental investigations complimented with this theoretical analysis of biodiesel ATR enable effectively optimizing the onboard reforming conditions. This study is one component of a three-part investigation of bio-fuel reforming, also including fuel vaporization and reactant mixing (Part 1) and biodiesel–diesel blends (Part 3).

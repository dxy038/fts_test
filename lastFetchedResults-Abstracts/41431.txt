Patterns of stand development may be interpreted from spatial analyses, based on variables such as tree age and size, together with past records of climate and disturbance. In the present study, our objective is to examine spatial patterns of tree age and size to determine if they are consistent with the episodic pattern of tree regeneration proposed for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) and expected changes in tree spatial patterns as cohort patches age. According to our hypothesis, internal patch structure should become less clumped as single cohort patches age due to self-thinning, with few trees attaining dominance in a small patch. In this study, tree spatial patterns in 16 stands of P. ponderosa in the Colorado Front Range are described and related to patterns of stand development. Analytical methods included Ripley's K(t) (a univariate statistic of tree spatial distribution), Ripley's K12(t) (a bivariate statistic of spatial association), and Moran's I (a measure of spatial autocorrelation). Spatial patterns imply establishment of patches of pines followed by self-thinning. Continued stand development results in strong size hierarchies as manifested by stronger spatial autocorrelation of tree age than tree size. Hence, pines exhibit a strong size class hierarchy developed within an even-aged patch.

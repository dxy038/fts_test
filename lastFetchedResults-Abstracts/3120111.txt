The Unit Commitment Problem is to determine a minimal cost turn-on and turn-off schedule of a set of electrical power generating units to meet a load demand while satisfying a set of operational constraints. The production cost includes fuel, startup, shutdown, and no-load costs. Some of the operational constraints that must be taken into account include, 1. The total power generated must meet the load demand plus system losses. 2.There must be enough spinning reserve to cover any shortfalls in generation. 3. The loading of each unit must be within its minimum and maximum allowable rating. 4.The minimum up and down times of each unit must be observed. The unit commitment is aimed at devising a proper generator commitment schedule for a power system over a period of one day to one week. The main objective of unit commitment is to minimize the total production cost over the study period &amp; to satisfy the constraints imposed on the system such as power generation-load balance, spinning reserve, operating constraints, minimum up time &amp; minimum down time, etc. Several conventional methods are available to solve the unit commitment problem. But all these methods need the exact mathematical model of the system &amp; there may be a chance of getting stuck at the local optimum. This paper describes the application of fuzzy logic algorithm for determining short term commitment of thermal units in electrical power generation. The results obtained from fuzzy logic based approach are compared with the priority list method solution to unit commitment problem. The comparison fuzzy logic based approach are powerful tools for solving such highly non-linear, multi constrained optimization problems in electrical power systems.

A new type of bidirectional DC&#8212;DC converter for electric power systems in advanced electric vehicles is proposed in this paper. This converter consists of half-bridge circuits with a high frequency transformer, which is well applicable as an interface between a high-voltage DC bus line and a low-voltage power source. In order to reduce the switching loss, newly developed ZCS loss-less snubber cells are applied to the primary side power stage. By the proposed topology, a soft switching operation can be achieved under the wide range of load current. The converter operation is demonstrated with simulation results, and the feasibility of the new topology is discussed as well as the converter design consideration.

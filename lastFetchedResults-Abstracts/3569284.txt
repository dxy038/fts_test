The Domain system is a distributed processing system designed for both general-purpose and interactive graphics applications. It is a collection of personal workstations and server computers interconnected by a high-speed local-area network. Its objective is to integrate mainframe capability with local area networking and raster graphics capabilities at a cost appropriate to engineering and graphics applications. The authors describe the architecture of the Domain system and the benefits of this architecture for general-purpose applications.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of electric fields application for the reduction of membrane fouling, the inactivation of microorganisms and the enhancement of particle coagulation. It was found that electric fields treatment prior to microfiltration showed in large quantity of cumulative permeates than those in non-electric fields. This is attributed to the promotion of particle coagulation and interaction between particle and membrane surface. The number of active bacteria was reduced by electric fields treatment. This may be a positive result for the prevention of membrane bio fouling as well as microbial inactivation. Coagulant dosage could also be saved about 75% compared with non-electric fields in terms of the 95% turbidity removal at 10 (kV/cm). Therefore, it is expected to improve the efficiency and the economics of the process by providing electric fields for wastewater treatment.

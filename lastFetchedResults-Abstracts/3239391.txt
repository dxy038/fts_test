The objective of this paper is to track the maximum power from Photovoltaic panel by varying the converter duty cycle with the help of fuzzy logic based maximum power point tracker. The input parameters of fuzzy logic controller are error (E) and change in error (&#916;E). The fuzzy logic controller will generate the converter duty cycle for the inputs given to it from the Photovoltaic panel under various operating conditions. Photovoltaic system including a solar panel, a fuzzy maximum power point tracker, a step up (boost) converter and a resistive load are designed and simulated.

The automatic design of Synchronous Reluctance machines is proposed, based on Multi-Objective Optimization and Finite-Element Analysis. An original description of the rotor geometry in the simple terms of three parameters per flux barrier is formalized and tested with finite elements and experiments. The results obtained with the proposed geometry are compared to the ones previously obtained applying the same automatic design procedure to simpler geometries. Plus, a state of the art rotor, designed with no restrictions in terms of geometric degrees of freedom is also used as a further benchmark for the comparison. The paper demonstrates that three variables per barrier is the appropriate number of parameters to be used for a fast and yet accurate description of multi-barrier Synchronous Reluctance machine rotors.

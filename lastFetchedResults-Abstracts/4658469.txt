A sequence of radar images containing the target is collected using an avian radar system. Radar image is composed of complex background and the target (flying birds, aircrafts, missiles etc). The main objective is to detect the target using Fast Independent Component Analysis (Fast ICA). Fast ICA separates the background and target from the radar image. Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) determines the power threshold above which the return echoes have been originated from the target. Clutter suppression is done by Conventional CFAR segmentation method and Two parameter CFAR methods. A new scheme based on Fusion of Conventional CFAR and Two Parameter CFAR is adopted and an average detection of 85% is obtained. After fusion, the target is detected from the radar images.

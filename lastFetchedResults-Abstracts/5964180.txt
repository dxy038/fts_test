The objective of this paper is to develop an approach to objectively evaluate foreground detection algorithms. The purpose of the desired application is human detection in images sequences. This paper presents in a first part the state of the art on foreground detection algorithms. In a second part, we use realistic synthetic videos to perform our evaluation. This kind of videos is very interesting for the evaluation study because it permits to evaluate the influences of some artifacts (changing light, video quality, shadow). We use a common metric to quantify the efficiency of the 11 selected algorithms. Time computation is also considered.

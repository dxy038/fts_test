The efficiency and materials cost of a linear oscillatory actuator (LOA) for a diaphragm blower depends on the design of magnetic circuit. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the magnetic circuit in order to develop a high efficiency and low price LOA by employing the magnetic field analysis method and an optimization method. In this paper, the 3-D multi-objective optimization of LOA with large magnetic force and small magnet volume is carried out using the combined 3-D finite element method (FEM), evolution strategy (ES), and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

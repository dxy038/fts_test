A novel dual-latching bidirectional linear actuator requiring only one solenoid is described and demonstrated as a bistable switch. The device uses a compact centrally located gapped magnetic flux circuit and a compound plunger design. The magnetic force profile is engineered through the use of multifaceted poles in order to achieve short switching times as well as large closure forces. The 220 &#956;m throw length can be switched over 600 times per second asynchronously with as little as 9 mW of power. The switching speed actually increases when burdened with a passive load such as an optical fiber

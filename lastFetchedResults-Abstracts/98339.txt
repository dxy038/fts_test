Red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) stands in the Pacific Northwest are the common first stage in succession following disturbance. These stands are highly productive and contribute a large amount of N to the soils as a result of their N2-fixing symbiosis with Frankia. As these alder stands age, the soils not only increase in total N, but concentrations of NO– 3 increase and pH decreases as a result of nitrification. The objective of this study was to determine how the nodulation capacity of Frankia varies as red alder stands age and if differences in nodulation capacity are related to changes in soil properties. Nodulation capacity was determined by a red alder seedling bioassay for soils from red alder stands in the Oregon coast range covering a wide range of ages. Six chronosequences were sampled, each containing a young, an intermediate, and an older alder stand. Soil total N, total C, NO– 3, NH+ 4, and pH were measured on the same soil samples. These factors as well as alder stand characteristics were compared with nodulation capacity in an attempt to identify soil characteristics typical in developing alder stands that most strongly affect nodulation capacity. Soil pH and NO– 3 concentration were highly correlated with nodulation capacity and with each other. Cluster analysis of the sites using these two variables identified two groups with distinctly different nodulation capacities. The cluster with the higher nodulation capacity was lower in NO– 3 and higher in pH than the other cluster, which included the majority of sites. There was substantial overlap in the age ranges for the two clusters and there was no significant correlation between age and nodulation capacity. Thus nodulation capacity appears to be most closely related to soil properties than to stand age.

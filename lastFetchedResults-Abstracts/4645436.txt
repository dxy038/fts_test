KORRIGAN is a large-scale joint multinational initiative of leading system houses and research laboratories in Europe aiming at the development of an independent and state-of-the-art capability in GaN HEMT technology. The main objective of KORRIGAN is to establish a stand alone European supply chain and foundry service. Several key research areas such as materials, processing, reliability evaluation, thermal management and packaging, are addressed and are involve in European industrial and university partners. The benefits of GaN technology are finally evaluated at system level for critical defence applications up to 20 GHz with the fabrication and test of circuit, MMIC and module demonstrators.

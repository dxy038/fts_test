This study implements a virtual laboratory for half bridge, full bridge and three phase voltage source inverters (VSI). Users can connected to the system from any computer having internet connection and perform any experiment by using designed user interface. Simulation models have been constructed with MatLAB/Simulink software while user interfaces have been arranged with LabVIEW software. The connection between these two software has been provided by Simulation Interface Toolkit (SIT) as uninterruptible and bidirectional. Implemented system can be used as a useful education tool for learning VSI subject.

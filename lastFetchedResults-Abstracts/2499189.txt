<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em><strong>(</strong>CA-MRSA) is increasingly reported worldwide. We aimed to determine the frequency of invasive CA-MRSA in children admitted to the pediatric wards of Imam Reza and Ghaem hospitals of Mashhad, Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>In this retrospective study, data regarding <em>S. aureus </em>isolates from pediatric patients’ sterile body sites (i.e. blood‚ joint, bone and lymph node aspiration) were retrieved in a time period from March 2006 to March 2012. Disc diffusion data was analyzed to determine the resistance pattern of the isolates, and differentiation between community- acquired and nosocomial <em>S. aureus </em>was done according to CDC guidelines.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Twenty three invasive community-acquired <em>S. aureus </em>isolates from sterile body sites were identified, of which seventeen (74%) were CA-MRSA. The CA-MRSA isolates showed high frequency of resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics (71% to erythromycin‚ 53% to co-trimoxazole, 44% to gentamicin and 36% to ciprofloxacin).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>In this study, the majority of invasive community-acquired <em>S. aureus </em>isolates were found to be CA-MRSA. Therefore, we recommend that primary treatment should be with antibiotics such as clindamycin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin for any invasive infection suspected to be caused by <em>S. aureus </em>in these two hospitals.</p>

The fish community in sublittoral and profundal waters, at stony shores, and densities of vendace larvae were studied in the southern Lake Saimaa, Finland. The objective was to investigate the possible recovery of fish populations after modernizations at the pulp and paper mills discharging into the lake. Sublittoral and profundal waters were studied by gill net trial fishings, stony shores by electrofishing, and vendace larvae by beach seine. The research area was divided in a polluted (0.5–4.0% effluent), an intermediate (0.1–0.5%) and a ‘clean’ reference area. The fish community in sublittoral and profundal waters in the lake was dominated (>60%) by perch and roach. Relative abundance of fish was highest in the polluted area, and lowest in the reference area. The number of species caught was similar among areas. The abundance of bleak and ruffe was highest in the polluted area, while the abundance of vendace and whitefish was highest in the intermediate and reference area. The fish fauna of stony shores in the lake was dominated by bullhead, stone loach and minnow, densities were lowest at polluted shores and highest in the intermediate area. Minnow, apparently a more sensitive species to pulp mill effluents, were not caught at the most polluted shores. The catch of vendace larvae was similar among areas, larvae were also caught in the vicinity of the mills. Compared with before the modernization at the mills, the relative abundance of perch in the polluted area was increased, ruffe decreased, while populations of whitefish and vendace showed signs of recovery. These changes may be explained by the reduced nutrient load and toxicicity of pulp mill effluents. At present, the fish community in the polluted area can be considered typical for a moderate eutrophication.

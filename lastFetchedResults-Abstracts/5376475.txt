The early stages of new product development, called the Fuzzy Front End (FFE), are essential for the success of innovation. Therefore, various software tools have been proposed to support FFE activities. However, little evidence is provided about the benefits of using such tools. The objective of this study is to present evidence that will assist industry practitioners to make informed choices about software support tools to be used in the FFE. The method used for this study was a systematic literature review that analyzed 1090 articles published between 1997 and 2009. The results show that software tools can speed up the FFE, reduce costs, increase collaboration, improve decision quality and knowledge management, reduce risks, and enhance overall creativity.

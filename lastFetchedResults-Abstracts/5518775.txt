K highest label path algorithm (KHLP) is presented for MPLS-TE. The algorithm first uses generalization of highest-label pre-flow-push algorithm to calculate K-shortest paths, then chooses the LSP in terms of the link criticality and the residual bandwidth, combines K value to give different links weight, further combines offline with online routing to reduce the computational complexity, simultaneously considers other QoS parameters. The main objective of KHLP is to prevent the neglect of non-critical link which is important, and to avoid choosing the overlong path, then provides an effective guarantee of QoS. The simulation shows the algorithm is improved greatly compared to both CSPF and MIRA in reject ratio, delay, throughput and computation time, is an efficient and quick routing algorithm.

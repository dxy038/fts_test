The thermal protection of space crafts during hypersonic re-entry into the Earth's
atmosphere by ablative composite and nanocomposite has been the subject of
intensive investigation in recent years. An evaluation has been made on the
advantages of relative performances of various ablation materials which is based on
the thermal degradation mechanism and thermal stability of these materials. The
objective of this work is to investigate the effect of kaolinite nanocrystal on the thermal
degradation of resol-type phenolic/asbestos nanocomposite during pyrolysis using
thermogravimetric analysis and to compare the results with that of the
phenolic/asbestos composite. Thermal degradation and char forming mechanisms
could be obtained from parametric adjustments of the process model to the thermogravimetric
experimental data. The results of this work are the kinetic parameters of
thermal degradation, i.e., the activation energy, frequency factors, and degree of thermal
degradation which are employed to clarify the degradation mechanism.

The objective of the current work is to introduce the concept of boundary-condition-independent (BCI) reduced-order modeling (ROM) for complex electronic packages by employing the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin methodology. Detailed models of complex electronic packages that consume large computational resources are used within system-level models in computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based heat transfer analysis. If a package-level model that reduces computational resources (reduced-order model) and provides accurate results in many different flow situations (boundary-condition-independent model) can be deployed, it will accelerate the design and analysis of the end products that make use of these packages. This paper focuses on how the proper orthogonal decomposition-Galerkin methodology can be used with the finite volume method (FVM) to generate reduced-order models that are boundary-condition-independent. This method is successfully used in the present study to generate boundary-condition-independent reduced-order models for 1-D and 2-D objects for isothermal and isoflux boundary conditions. Successful implementation of the method is also shown on 2-D objects made of multiple materials and multiple heat generating sources for isoflux boundary conditions.

The paper analyzes the character of distribution network, utilizes the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm to carry on selecting and location optimization about the automatic equipment, takes switch as code of the chromosome gene, in each evolutionary generation, divides the community into three sub-communities which execute variation, crossover, fitness evaluation and select operation based on three factors respectively: Energy not supply (ENS), communication optical fiber cost, automation device invests. Then combine best individual into one unit, performances evolution operation on the next generation. By iterate process to obtain the best network scheme of distribution network automation planning finally. This paper analyzed the fault mode and consequence analytic method (FMEA) in the project usability, and made an improvement for this method, it means according to actual transmission capacity limit of the circuit, carry on verification of the load transfers through the flow calculation. As an auxiliary decision support system, the paper adopts visualization technology of based on the AUTOCAD, demonstrates the plan result on the geography background map, finally introduces the real distribution network application as an example.

Transverse flux permanent magnet synchronous motor is suitable for high torque applications, because it features a spatial decoupling between electric load and magnetic load. A new bidirectional cross-linking transverse flux permanent magnet synchronous motor (BCTF-PMSM) is proposed and analyzed, which can fully utilize the rotor permanent magnets and have larger space utilization ratio than the traditional transverse flux machine. First, the fundamental structure and operation principle of BCTF-PMSM is introduced. Second, based on the basic electromagnetic relations and the 3D finite element analysis, the design method of BCTF-PMSM is summed up. Last, one prototype is designed and manufactured. The no-load back-EMF and static torque experiments are carried out. The experiment results agree well with the theoretical analysis. That verifies the validity of the theoretical analysis and the rationality of motor design.

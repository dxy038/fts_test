With China´s degree of dependence upon overseas oil increase every year, the supply of oil resources impacts country´s economic development and social stability directly. However, overseas oil imports exists such as piracy attacks, line accident and other risk during transportation, so a reasonable choice of transportation paths can control cost, reduce risk. A multi-objective transportation problem which considering distance and risk in the supply of oil import is presented. Then a mathematic model of this transportation problem is established. Based on a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola, and then solving the model by a distance-risk matrix for a optimal compromise solution, finally with the actual data about China´s crude oil imports in 2006 for the model verification, in order to provide policy suggest for china to choosing reasonable transportation paths.

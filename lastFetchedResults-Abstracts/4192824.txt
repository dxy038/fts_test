Reliability is an engineering field that recently has captivated the attention of researches. Its goal is to develop new techniques to improve the security and performance of the systems. The increasing complexity in the systems as a result of growing technology makes them more susceptible for failures. In the redundancy allocation problem (RAP) its principal objective is to maximize the availability while reducing the cost, volume or weight of the system. In this research an Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithm (EDA) approach is proposed for solving the redundancy allocation problem for a series-parallel system.

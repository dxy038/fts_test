This paper describes a branch-and-price algorithm for the p-median location problem. The objective is to locate p facilities (medians) such as the sum of the distances from each demand point to its nearest facility is minimized. The traditional column generation process is compared with a stabilized approach that combines the column generation and Lagrangean/surrogate relaxation. The Lagrangean/surrogate multiplier modifies the reduced cost criterion, providing the selection of new productive columns at the search tree. Computational experiments are conducted considering especially difficult instances to the traditional column generation and also with some large-scale instances.

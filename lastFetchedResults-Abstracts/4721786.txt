Cloud computing has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With the growth in the number and frequency of applications being deployed into clouds, the burden of resource management of cloud providers is becoming heavier. The resource deployment must satisfy the need about the performance, availability and reliability of applications from the view of clients, but also ensure the high resource utilization of the cloud providers. In this paper, we design a multi-objective serial optimization with priorities approach, named RMORM, to find the resource deployment in clouds rapidly. This approach is of great practical significance and engineering value and scalable to add new constraints.

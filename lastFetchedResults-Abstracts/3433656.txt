Simultaneous multiple product design is essential to meet customer expectations faster and with a focus on shortening life cycles, and new methodologies are needed to address the complexities related to it. quality function deployment (QFD) can help gather customer needs and link them to product design. However, understanding customer needs accurately is a challenge for traditional QFD analysis, and for this reason, Kano´s model of customer satisfaction is associated with QFD in the literature. However, incorporating the results of Kano´s model into QFD presents another challenge. The objective of this research is to provide a step-by-step methodology that fine-tunes the QFD method by combining Kano´s model and QFD in a robust manner, from the perspective of simultaneous multiple product design. This research also includes an application of this proposed methodology on cockpit weather information system (CWIS) design, a part of NASA´s Aviation Weather Information (AWIN) project, to demonstrate its usefulness

Alternative technician dispatching is one of the most promising problems in the field service management. However, good dispatching practices heavily rely on human intelligence. Therefore, a decision supporting system with veteran dispatchersÂ´ knowledge is needed. Exploiting the knowledge-based technology as well as a multi-objective analysis, this paper presents a design and its simulation model for field technician dispatching. Cores to the knowledge-based dispatching are decision tree representation models. A simulation model and test runs over a field service compatible environment demonstrate both the feasibility and potential effectiveness for applications. The decision tree model has the advantage of human-like reasoning procedures, which is important for technician dispatching knowledge documentation.

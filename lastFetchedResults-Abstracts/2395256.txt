Lunar highland region and associated craters are mostly composed of anorthosite. In the present study, we studied the reflectance spectra of terrestrial anorthosites collected from Sittampundi Anorthosites Complex, which is considered as equivalent (simulant) of lunar highland anorthosites. The objective of the study is to interpret diagnostic spectral features of analog anorthosite for remotely exploring lunar highland region. Reflectance spectra of anorthosites were measured under two different environments, such as controlled field and laboratory conditions. In these two procedures, the laboratory spectra give clear, diagnostic spectral information in the present study. Reflectance spectra captured under 350–2500 nm covering UV, Visible, NIR, and SWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral characteristics of anorthosites measured under various parts of electromagnetic spectrum have diagnostic absorption features at 380–387, 700–740, 930–1100, 1160–1200, 1415, 1920, 2200 and 2330 nm correspondingly due to plagioclase UV absorption, Fe3+ electron transition absorption, Fe2+ pyroxene and olivine absorption, OH/Mn3+ crystal transition absorption, pyroxene absorption, Al–OH absorption and Mg–OH absorption. Mineralogical and chemical analyses were carried out for four anorthosites and compared with the results of chemical component of lunar anorthosite. The percentage of plagioclase content, relative abundance of low and high calcium pyroxene and olivine in different anorthosite samples are correlated with the albedo range, absorption shape, absorption centers and band depth. The similarity in the diagnostic spectral features of the anolog anorthosite with lunar anorthosites could be effectively utilized for remotely mapping the lunar highland region.

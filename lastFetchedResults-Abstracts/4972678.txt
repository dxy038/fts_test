Rapid growth in number and diversity of real time Internet applications has made it imperative to consider more than one Quality of Service (QOS) constraint and more than one Traffic Engineering (TE) objective to route requests in an optimal way. Recently, some bandwidth-delay constrained routing algorithms appear to satisfy meeting QOS requirements of bandwidth and delay. However, most of them do not take into account TE objectives for the usage efficiency of their network infrastructure. In this paper, we present a new Bandwidth constrained least Delay least Cost Routing Algorithm (BDCRA). In our approach, we have relied on bandwidth constraint to satisfy bandwidth guarantees and we have based on bandwidth and cost criteria to distribute network load, avoid network bottlenecks, and reduce routing cost. Moreover, our proposed algorithm satisfies as possible the delay requirement by taking into account delay constraint. Finally, simulations where carried to compare the performance of our algorithm against some existing ones.

Objective: Current trends are showing a rapid increase in the elderly population, particularly the subgroup that is 75 years of age or more. Considering the fact that several ocular diseases are more prevalent among the elderly, it is increasingly important to investigate normal visual function in this subgroup of our population. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of advanced aging on visual retinocortical function by evaluating the electrophysiological responses of the most rapidly increasing segment of the geriatric population.
Methods: Fifty-eight healthy subjects between the ages of 20–32 years (n=30) and 75–88 years (n=28) participated in this study. We recorded their pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) and cortical visual evoked potentials (VEPs) under stimulus conditions biased toward the preferential response of the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the visual system.
Results: Elderly subjects showed reduced ERG amplitudes relative to young participants. The amplitude of the VEPs also decreased with age, while their latency increased. The effect of senescence was most apparent under stimulus conditions combining the magnocellular and parvocellular pathway contributions and less pronounced when the stimulus conditions were biased to favor the response of either system.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that visual retinal and cortical function deteriorates with old age. Our data further indicate that senescence has widespread effects on the visual system, altering the functioning of both the magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways.

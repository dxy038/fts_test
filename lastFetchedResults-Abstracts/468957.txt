Objective
Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic occlusion of uterine vessels in treating symptomatic fibroids and compare with embolization of the uterine arteries.
Study design
We studied 46 premenopausal women, aged 43 (34-51) years with symptomatic uterine fibroids, undergoing radiologic embolization (n = 24) and laparoscopy closure of the uterine arteries (n = 22).
Results
The laparascopic technique reduced picture blood assessment score after 6 months by 50% from an initial value of 345 (±288). Uterus volume was reduced by 37% (±18%), and the dominant fibroid was reduced by 36% (±31%). Postoperative pain and use of pain relief differed significantly, requiring more pain medication after embolization: ketobemidon 38 mg compared with 16 mg in the laparoscopic group (P = .008). Specific complications to the laparascopic technique were temporary damage to the obturator nerve in three patients.
Conclusion
Laparoscopic occlusion of uterine vessels is a promising new method for treating fibroid-related symptoms, with less postoperative pain than embolization and comparable effects on symptoms.

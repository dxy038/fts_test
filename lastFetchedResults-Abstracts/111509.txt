On the basis of comparisons between cattle and sheep genome mapping information the ovine (alpha)-amylase gene was examined as a possible genetic marker for milk traits in sheep. The objective of the present study was to isolate, map and determine whether this gene is a candidate gene for milk traits. DNA fragments (832 and 2360 bp) corresponding to two different AMY genes were isolated, and one SNP in intron 3 and one GTG deletion in exon 3 of the 2360 bp DNA fragment were found. The 2360 bp ovine AMY DNA fragment was located on chromosome 1 by linkage mapping using the International Mapping Flock. No association was found between estimated breeding values for milk yield, protein and fat contents and AMY genotypes in a daughter design comprising 13 Manchega families with an average of 29 daughters (12-62) per sire.

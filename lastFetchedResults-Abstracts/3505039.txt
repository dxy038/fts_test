We present a new traffic engineering (TE) model which is based on QoS rerouting and uses hybrid resilience to improve the recovery performance of multi-layer networks where an MPLS network is layered above an MPlambdaS network. We formulate the rerouting of the LSPs/lambdaSPs as a multi-constrained problem and use its polynomial reduction to find a heuristic solution that can be implemented by standardized constraint-based routing algorithms. This heuristic solution uses a cost-based routing optimization to achieve different network configurations which multiplex/separate bandwidth-aware LSPs/lambdaSPs on the network links. We formulate the resilience upon failure as a multi-objective problem consisting of finding a resilience strategy that minimizes recovery operation time and maximizes the LSP/lambdaSP restorability. A solution to this problem is proposed where a hybrid resilience framework is used to achieve restoration in the MPLS layer to complement path switching in the MPlambdaS layer. We evaluate the performance of the TE model when rerouting the tunnels carrying the traffic offered to a 23- and 31-node networks. Simulation reveals that the hybrid resilience model performs better than classical recovery mechanisms. In terms of restorability, quality of rerouting paths and rerouting stability

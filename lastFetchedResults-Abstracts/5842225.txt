Fast power silicon thyristors are very promising for power modulators, but they have some drawbacks preventing their wide use. The main drawbacks are: instability of uniform current distribution which could lead to current localization (filamentation of current) and to burnout of the device under high currents; turn on time depends on the thickness of base layers and as well on maximum voltage. High voltage thyristors have longer turn on times. So to turn on high voltage during short time it is necessary to connect many low voltage fast devices in series. In this case the main question, which should be answered is on how to synchronize all thyristors. The objective of the paper is to show how to overcome these drawbacks

We present a low complexity approach for the estimation of the temporal and spatial activity parameters of videos which are captured by a front-facing camera of a vehicle based on context information of the vehicle. The estimated parameters are integrated into an objective video quality metric, which can be used to determine the perceptual quality of a compressed video stream. Our proposed video quality metric has very low computational complexity, which makes it suitable for live video streaming applications. It shows a high Pearson correlation of 0.98 with an average root-mean-square error of 6%, as verified by statistical analysis with data from subjective tests.

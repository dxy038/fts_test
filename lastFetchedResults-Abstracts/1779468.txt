Objective: In the recent past, adenocarcinoma has become the commonest histological type of lung cancer (LC) in the developed countries. The present study was conducted to assess the change in epidemiology of LC, if any, in North India. Methods: Prospectively collected data on 250 newly diagnosed LC patients presenting to a tertiary care institute was analyzed. Results were compared with the previously published data from this center. Results: No significant differences were observed in the demographical, histological or smoking profiles of LC patients compared to those seen three decades earlier. The mean [standard deviation] age was 57.9 [Â±11.3] years (previously 54.3 years). Male to female ratio was 4.43:1 (previously 4.48:1; p = 0.952) while the smoker to non-smoker ratio was 2.67:1 (previously 2.68:1; p = 0.980). The commonest histological types were squamous cell (34.8%), adenocarcinoma (26.0%) and small cell (18.4%) while previously these were 34.3%, 25.9% and 20.3%, respectively; p = 0.916. However, in the present study, significant differences were observed between smokers and non-smokers in relation to distribution of gender, histology and disease stage. Conclusions: There has been no significant change in the epidemiology of LC in North India over the past three decades. An absence of change in the smoking pattern of the population could be a possible reason.

The most promising advantages of Web service technology is the possibility of creating value-added services by compositing existing ones. Because of the characteristic of autonomy and openness, the security problem of Web service composition is increasing crucial. This paper applies the trust management into the field of Web service composition and addresses the topic of optimal selection of composition Web services with trust constraints. Firstly, we propose a framework to facilitate trust-based service composition and selection. Then we investigate the characteristics of trust in service composition, and give an evaluation model for trust. Based on this, we utilize multi-objective genetic algorithm to solve the optimal selection problem, aimed at maximizing Qos and trust. Finally, we use some simulation experiments to show the feasibility of the proposed trust model.

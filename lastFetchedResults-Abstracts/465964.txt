Objective: This study assessed the feasibility of ultrasonographically guided transrectal aspiration of gynecologic pelvic abscesses to treat patients for whom intravenous antibiotic therapies failed and whose abscesses were not optimally amenable to colpotomy drainage or transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonographically guided aspiration. Study Design: This was a retrospective review of the first 15 women with pelvic abscesses that resulted from salpingitis or complications of gynecologic surgery who underwent transrectal pelvic abscess drainage after failure of antibiotic therapy. Results: Purulent material was aspirated from the abscesses in 14 of the 15 women. All 14 women with aspirated material were successfully treated with real-time ultrasonographically guided transrectal drainage; only 4 of the 14 had indwelling catheter placement. Conclusion: Ultrasonographically guided transrectal drainage of gynecologic pelvic abscesses is a safe and effective treatment of pelvic abscesses for women who do not have an adequate response to antibiotic therapy.

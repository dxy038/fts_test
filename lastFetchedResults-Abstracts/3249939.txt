In this paper, the weighted sum Particle Swarm Optimization (WSPSO) technique is projected to address multi-objective Economic Dispatch with emission minimization (EED) problem by generating sets of the Pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions provide many alternate dispatch options for reducing conflicting objectives like cost and harmful gases. A multi-attributed decision making problem consisting four objectives, namely fuel cost, COx, SOx, and NOx emission functions have been solved using weighted sum method. Performance of the projected technique is tested on the standard IEEE 30 bus-six generating unit system from literature. The obtained results are found to be better than available in previous literature. Inequality and equality constraints along with network losses are included in the problem formulation.

Collaborative optimization is one of bi-level multidisciplinary optimization methods which consists of system level and discipline level and is applied for complex engineering problems. since this method is rigidly convergent at discipline level because of noisy constraints at system level on one hand and minimizing objective function necessity at system level on the other hand, this optimization method is forced to use evolutionary algorithms in order to minimize objective function at system level, also, It has been proved that, applying this algorithms according to their nature is expensive and time consuming. This paper with performed inspections is a new method for applying innovated optimization algorithms through which considerable results are obtained in solving sample problems. It is shown that using this method will decrease function calls number or problem solving time and therefore calculating costs will decrease considerably. Also it is shown that this method sometimes increase accuracy.

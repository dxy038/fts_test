An improved rate control strategy is proposed, which allocates the target number of bits at first on picture layer. And then different types of pictures respectively are processed on the basis of picture characteristics when each frame is coded. Finally, a quantization parameter is selected for each macroblock with different characteristics in a coded frame. As a result, the number of bits for each frame picture is allocated more reasonably, and the subjective and objective quality of the picture constructed at the decoding end can be raised, especially in some important detailed parts. The experiment shows that this rate control strategy can effectively avoid the overflow and underflow of the encoder buffer, and the output bit rates incline to stabilization.

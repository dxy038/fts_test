The paper considers the discrete time Kalman and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> approach to the two-state &#945;-&#946; target tracking problem. A closed form steady-state solution for the &#945;-&#946; parameter selection for H<sub>&#8734;</sub> tracker, which is similar to the tracking index process for the MSE (Kalman) criterion, is presented. The H<sub>&#8734;</sub> and Kalman processes model the radar/target system with the objective of keeping the target within the radar beamwidth. The two trackers are compared considering two cases that differ in input maneuver disturbances, random maneuver and constant acceleration. An example illustrates the performance of the &#945;-&#946; tracker with respect to keeping the target within the beamwidth in terms of probability of escape.

Abstract
According to Avicenna and Abolbarakate-Baghdadi, spatial movement is the oldest variety of movements. Avicenna sees spatial movement as the one which exclusively moves on a straight line so he does not consider circular movement as a type of spatial movement. His reason is that in circular movement the moving objectâ€™s components change their position in relation to the components of space but the moving object remains in its space altogether. Baghdadi considers both types of movement as spatial ones. Avicenna divides spatial movement to impulsive (QATIEH) and impetus-based (TAVASOTIEH) and postulates one as subjective and the other as objective. Baghdadi does not make such a distinction and probably 
attributes a sort of existence to spatial movement which he considers as causal through which a cause reaches its effect. Avicenna considers the driving force as different from the moving object.  Although Baghdadi puts emphasis on this distinction, he attributes the duration of the movement to the moving object.
In relation to vertical movement, Avicenna believes in immobility between the upward and downward movement while Baghdadi considers both the same.

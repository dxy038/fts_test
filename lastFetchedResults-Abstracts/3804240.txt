This paper describes an approach for determining the most suitable locations for installing thyristor controlled series capacitors (TCSC) in order to eliminate line overloads under a single contingency. The proposed approach introduces an index called the single contingency sensitivity (SCS) index, which is used to rank the system branches according to their suitability for installing a TCSC. Once the locations are determined, an optimization problem of finding the best settings for the installed TCSCs in case of a given set of contingencies is formulated and solved. The objective of the optimization problem is to eliminate or minimize line overloads as well as the unwanted loop flows under single contingencies. The proposed approach for locating and controlling TCSCs enhances the static security and reduces the power losses in a given power system. The IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems are used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

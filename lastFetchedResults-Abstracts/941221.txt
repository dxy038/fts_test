According to the Air Quality Framework Directive, air pollutant concentration levels have to be assessed and reported annually
by each European Union member state, taking into consideration European air quality standards. Plans and programmes should be
implemented in zones and agglomerations where pollutant concentrations exceed the limit and target values. The main objective of
this study is to perform a long-term air quality simulation for Portugal, using the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model, applied
over Portugal, for the year 2001. The model performance was evaluated by comparing its results to air quality data from the
regional monitoring networks and to data from a diffusive sampling experimental campaign. The results obtained show a modelling
system able to reproduce the pollutant concentrations' temporal evolution and spatial distribution observed at the regional networks
of air quality monitoring. As far as the fulfilment of the air quality targets is concerned, there are excessive values for nitrogen and
sulfur dioxides, ozone also being a critical gaseous pollutant in what concerns hourly concentrations and AOT40 (Accumulated
Over Threshold 40 ppb) values.

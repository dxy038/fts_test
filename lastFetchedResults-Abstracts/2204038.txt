Introduction & Objective: Salivary antioxidants play important roles in the defensive mechanism of saliva against free radicals. Due to Prevalence of diabetes and numerous factors associated in its pathogenesis, understanding the defensive mechanism of salivary antioxidant against free radicals can provide helpful strategies in diagnosis and evaluation of diabetes. The aim of this study was evaluation of the paraoxonase (PON1) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of saliva in diabetic subjects. Materials & Methods: In this case -control study, 40 patients diagnosed with type II diabetes (20 males and 20 females) aged between 40 to 60 years and 40 healthy controls were selected. 5 mL unstimulated saliva samples using Spiting method were collected. PON-I and TAC levels were examined using FRAP (Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma) methods. The data were ana-lyzed by t- test or its non parametric equivalent tests. Results: Mean PON-I in the subjects and control group were 8.05±2.099 nmol /ml 9.98 ±2.957 nmol/ml, respectively and the difference was significant (P=0.001) TAC in saliva of the sub-jects and control group were 377.38 ±191.229 and 402.25±189.105 and no significant differ-ence was found (P=0.56). Conclusion: The level of salivary TAC, PON-1 of patients with type II diabetes was lower than healthy controls. Additionally, plasma low density lipoproteins level of the diabetic subjects was higher compared with the healthy ones.(Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2015; 22 (2): 114-121)

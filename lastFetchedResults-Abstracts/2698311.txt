In this paper, we consider a bidirectional cellular relay network with distributed relays where a single base station exchanges information with multiple independent users through multiple single-antenna relays. We design the transceivers at the base station, the relays, and the users. The related optimization problems are generally non-convex and difficult to solve. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to design the transceiver algorithms based on two criteria, i.e. weighted sum MSE minimization and sum rate maximization. Specifically, we show that the sum rate maximization problem can be converted into an iterative weighted sum MSE minimization problem. Low-complexity iterative algorithms are developed for both weighted sum MSE minimization and sum rate maximization optimization problems. However, the convergence points of the proposed iterative algorithms are sensitive to the initial conditions, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For this reason, we further derive the high-SNR asymptotically optimal solutions and use them as the initials for the proposed iterative algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can approximately double the system throughput, compared to the conventional four-stage transmission schemes.

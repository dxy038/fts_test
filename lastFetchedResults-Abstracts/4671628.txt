The noise power spectrum estimation is an important component of a practical speech enhancement system. In this paper, a new method is proposed for noise estimation combine with minimum statistics algorithm. Experimental results show that the new method can follow abrupt changes in noise spectrum. Subjective and objective evaluation confirm that the new method can improve the quality of enhanced speech.

This paper presents an objective MPEG-2 video quality measurement method based on fragile digital image watermarking. Based on the DWT-based watermarking scheme, this paper presents a fragile digital video watermarking scheme that can work as an automatic quality monitoring system. We embed watermark in the DWT domain of the I-frames of an original video, and the DWT coefficients for embedding are carefully selected so that the degradation of the watermark can reflect the degradation of the video quality. This scheme can track the change of the PSNR value and the Watson JND value. The Watson perceptual model is taken into account to weight the quality measurement according to the human visual system. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme against MPEG-2 compression and noise pollution

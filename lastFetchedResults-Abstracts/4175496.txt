A modified model for the intraconnected bidirectional associative memory (IBAM) is introduced in which there are not only interfield connections but also intrafield connections added in each neuron field. In the modified IBAM recall process, the intralayer feedback processes run parallel, instead of sequentially as in the IBAM, with the interlayer processes. This results in both removal of the complement encoding problem and relaxation of the continuity assumption for reliable recalls of the BAM.

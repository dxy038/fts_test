The type of distributed generation unit that is the subject of this article relates to renewable energy sources, especially wind power. The wind generator used is based on a double fed induction Generator (DFIG). The stator of the DFIG is connected directly to the network and the rotor is connected to the network through the power converter. The objective of this work is to study the association a Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) in wind generator. This system is used to improve the quality of electricity provided by wind generator. It is composed of a flywheel; an asynchronous machine has cage and a power electronic converter. The control of FESS proposed in this paper and velocity using a fuzzy logic controller is validated by simulations is compared with results obtained PI. The results are presented and discussed.

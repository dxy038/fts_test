A simple control strategy is proposed and applied to a class of non-linear systems that have abundant sensory and actuation channels as in living systems. The main objective is the independent control of constrained trajectories of motion, and control of the corresponding constraint forces. The peripheral controller is a proportional, derivative and integral (PID) controller. A central controller produces, via pattern generators, reference signals that are the desired constrained position and velocity trajectories, and the desired constraint forces. The basic tenet of the this hybrid control strategy is the use of two mechanisms: 1. linear state and force feedback, and 2. non-linear constraint velocity feedback - sliding mode feedback. The first mechanism can be envisioned as a high gain feedback systems. The high gain attribute imitates the agonistâ€“antagonist co-activation in natural systems. The strategy is applied to the control of the force and trajectory of a two-segment thigh-leg planar biped leg with a mass-less foot cranking a pedal that is analogous to a bicycle pedal. Five computational experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the strategy and the performance of the controller. The findings of this paper are applicable to the design of orthoses and prostheses to supplement functional electrical stimulation for support purposes in the spinally injured cases.

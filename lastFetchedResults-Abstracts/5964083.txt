Most speech enhancement techniques do not perform very well in correlated or colored noise, as they assume that noise and speech are not correlated. In this paper, we propose a method, based on spectral subtraction, which takes into account possible correlation between noise and speech. Objective measures showed that the proposed method outperformed the power spectral subtraction method resulting in better speech quality and reduced levels of musical noise. Further enhancements in speech quality were obtained by applying a perceptual weighting function (estimated using a psychoacoustics model) that was designed to minimize noise distortion

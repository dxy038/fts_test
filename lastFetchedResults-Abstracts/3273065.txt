Recently, the content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) paradigm is gaining popularity in opportunistic mobile networks (OppNets) for its flexibility and adaptability. Since nodes in OppNets is controlled by humans, they often behave selfishly with an aim to maximize their own revenues without considering the performance of others. Therefore, stimulating nodes in OppNets to collect, store, and share content efficiently is one of the key challenges under this scheme. Meanwhile, guaranteeing the freshness of content is also a big problem for content dissemination in OppNets. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose an incentive-driven and freshness-aware pub/sub content dissemination scheme, called ConDis (Content Dissemination), for selfish OppNets. In ConDis, the Tit-For-Tat (TFT) scheme is employed to deal with selfish behaviors of nodes in OppNets. ConDis also implements a novel content exchange protocol when nodes are in contact. Specifically, during each contact, the exchange order is determined by the content utility, which is calculated by the direct subscribed value and the indirect subscribed value, and the objective of nodes is to maximize the utility of the content inventory stored in their buffer. Extensive realistic trace-driven simulation results show that ConDis is superior to other existing schemes in terms of total freshness value, total delivered contents, and total transmission cost.

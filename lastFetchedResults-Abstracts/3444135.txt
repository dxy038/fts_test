The timely deployment of three-dimensional (3-D) video applications requires accurate objective quality measures, so that time consuming subjective tests can be avoided. Investigated is the correlation between subjective and objective evaluations of colour plus depth map 3-D video. Subjective tests are performed to determine the overall image quality and depth perception of a range of asymmetrically coded video sequences. The subjective results are used to determine more accurate objective quality assessment metrics for colour plus depth map based stereoscopic video.

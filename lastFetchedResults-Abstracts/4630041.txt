Solar energy technologies offer a clean and renewable energy source, and are essential components of a sustainable energy future. In the design and evaluation of solar energy, information on solar radiation at a given location is needed. The principal objective of this study is the determination of solar energy characteristics anywhere and anytime. Mathematical models are exploited to analyze the solar energy characteristics in Sfax, Tunisia. These models present an estimation of the Sun position according to the considered site, a determination of the recovered solar energy and an evaluation of the electric energy produced by a photovoltaic surface. A comparison between theoretical and measured values has been presented to validate the mathematical expressions. An analysis of the influence of the incline angle on the recovered solar energy quantity is achieved. We affirmed that the general optimal angle, for all year round, will be equal to the latitude angle of the considered site. For a better optimization, the optimal angle for every month has been determined. In addition, to present the conversion phenomenon of the solar energy in electricity, a study of the produced photovoltaic energy by four different types of panels is elaborated.

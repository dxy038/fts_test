High speed real time data acquisition technology is receiving increasing attention due to exponentially expanding industrial control and measurement usage. Among high speed industry bus, PCI(Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus is one of the most widely used. The main objective of this paper is to enhance the speed of PCI bus for the application of data acquisition on the premise of real time data transfer. A kind of implementation solution based on FPGA and PCI bus is carried out, the application program is completed through SDK and LabWindows/CVI, and data transmission is realized by DMA mode and the ping-pong control of double SDRAMs, some factors which may influence the speed of data transfer are analyzed. Experimental results show that the proposed system has achieved a very high data transfer speed which is 86.9 MB/s, it is especially suitable for real time and high speed applications.

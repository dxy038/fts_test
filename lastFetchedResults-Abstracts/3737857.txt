The objective of this paper is to present an improved computational method for evaluating the reliability indices of HVDC transmission systems. The developed models and computational techniques are described. These can be used to simulate the operational practices and characteristics of a system under study efficiently and realistically. This method is based on the failure modes and effects analysis and uses the event tree method and the minimal cut set approach to represent the system´s operational behaviour and deduce the appropriate system´s failure anodes. A set of five reliability indices is evaluated for each output node being analyzed together with the probability and frequency of encountering particular regions of system performance levels. The analysis of an assumed HVDC bipolar transmission system is also included

According to several times the cost of increased fuel consumption in vehicles, companies pay a lot
of fuel in transportation costs section. Several factors such as vehicle fuel consumption in heavy
vehicle - the driver - the routing and scheduling systems to move cars - road - the amount of frightspeed
and acceleration have effect in fuel consumption. This article examines several factors in terms
of transportation companies that can reduce fuel consumption and to introduce a policy that will
result in reduced fuel consumption. Also provide a model for determining the minimum fuel
consumption in different maners. These models have better performance than only models that have
the vehicle routing problem (VRP 1) aproach. After measuring fuel consumption model, we will be
provided the model of multi-objective view of the company's transportation system that have three
parts â€“ car- driver and system. We can arrange for all of the parts are made in reducing fuel
consumption. Policies and tools that lead to cost reduction in the entire fleet will be introduced.
Finally, for a transportation company, a set of policies and tools provide with used multi-objective
function.

Introduction: Legionella pneumophila (LP) is a major cause of pneumonia worldwide. In spite of suitable epidemiological conditions and probability of LP existence in the region, the incidence of LP infection has not been determined in Ahvaz.
Objective: Determination the seroprevalence of LP in patients with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). Materials and Methods: In this prospective descriptive study, during one year period (2007-2008), 80 admitted patients were selected in Razi Hospital of Jundi Shapoor University of Medical Science in Ahvaz with CAP and was studied the serprevalence of LP among them. Sera were tested for L. pneumophila IgG and IgM by using Elisa kit (Vircell, Spain). Data were analyzed by using SPSS, version 16 statistical package. Results: Among 80 serum samples, 12 cases (15%) were positive for LP- IgG+ IgM. Age, gender and area of residency did not significantly affect the seroprevalence of L P. (P>0.05). The prevalence of L P seropositivity was not significantly affected by co-morbidities except diabetes mellitus (P>0.05). Smoking and receiving antibiotic was observed in 100% seropositive patients.
Conclusion: Legionella Pneumophila is a prevalent infectious agent in Ahvaz and should be considered in patients with CAP especially in diabetic and smoker patients.

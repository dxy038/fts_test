Background.
Tuberculous involvement of the esophagus has been extremely rare during the past 40 years. It will be, however, more frequently encountered in the future, as the number of immunocompromised patients is growing. This condition is usually secondary to infection in other thoracic sites, such as lungs, larynx, or mediastinum. The diagnosis is difficult if the suspicion of tuberculosis is not raised. Dysphagia and cough after ingestion of fluids and food are common symptoms without any other specific signs in these patients. Diagnosis is based on combination of esophagography, esophagoscopy, bronchoscopy, and computed tomographic scan.
Methods.

We present 3 patients with tuberculous fistulas of the esophagus. Two of our 3 patients were treated successfully with the combination of operation and antituberculous chemotherapy. Fistulas were resected and closed directly. Suture lines were secured with pedicled pleural flaps.
Results.

Both patients who underwent operation recovered without complications. One patient died without definitive diagnosis and treatment.
Conclusions.

Treatment of tuberculous fistulas consists of operation and antituberculous chemotherapy, although antituberculous medication alone has been suggested to be effective if the diagnosis is early. However, operation is usually necessary to establish the correct diagnosis. Therefore, we believe that if the cause of the esophageal fistula cannot be verified, thoracotomy should be performed. If the fistula is left untreated the consequences are usually fatal.

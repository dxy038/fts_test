A new minimum recognition error formulation and a generalized probabilistic descent (GPD) algorithm are analyzed and used to accomplish discriminative training of a conventional dynamic-programming-based speech recognizer. The objective of discriminative training here is to directly minimize the recognition error rate. To achieve this, a formulation that allows controlled approximation of the exact error rate and renders optimization possible is used. The GPD method is implemented in a dynamic-time-warping (DTW)-based system. A linear discriminant function on the DTW distortion sequence is used to replace the conventional average DTW path distance. A series of speaker-independent recognition experiments using the highly confusible English E-set as the vocabulary showed a recognition rate of 84.4% compared to ~60% for traditional template training via clustering. The experimental results verified that the algorithm converges to a solution that achieves minimum error rate

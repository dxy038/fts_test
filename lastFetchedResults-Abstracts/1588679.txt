Abstract 
With regard to the importance of forage production in Iran, the main objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between inputs and yield in different alfalfa harvesting systems by using production function. Therefore, data on alfalfa hay production were collected from 75 farms in Zanjan province using face to face surveying in the year 1391(2012). By a systematic random sampling method. Two farms in different areas were managed by silage harvesting system and data on all farms for alfalfa silage production estimated based on data obtained. The relationship between inputs and yield were estimated using Cobb-Douglas production function for different harvesting systems (alfalfa hay and alfalfa silage). The results of the production function showed that machinery had the highest impact among the inputs for alfalfa hay and alfalfa silage productions. The biocide and electricity for irrigation had negative impacts on yield in different alfalfa harvesting systems. Seed for alfalfa hay and machinery for alfalfa silage production had the highest marginal product values. Moreover, these results revealed that scale economies exist in different harvesting system of alfalfa production. Accordingly, proportionate increase in the inputs is recommended in order to find a more economical production process.

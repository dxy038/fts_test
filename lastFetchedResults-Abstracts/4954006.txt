This study examines three project diversity, including project size, project member diversity, technical complexity; five critical success factors, including project objective and bound, top management support, project plan and monitoring, project user involvement, project communications; and six success criteria, including time, cost, quality, information quality, information use, user satisfaction. Through literature review, hypotheses, data collection, data analysis, validation, we get conclusions and recommendations. In this paper, we have found that five critical success factors including project objective and bound, top management support, project plan and monitoring, project user involvement, project communications would have significant impacts on the performance of the information system development projects. On the other words, that means we could gain success by controlling theses critical success factors. Furthermore, we also found that the factors have significant differences between the different projects.

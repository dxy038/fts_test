One of the key elements in production planning hierarchy is master production
scheduling. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare thirteen alternative
MPS development methods, including multi-objective optimization as well as
twelve heuristics, in different operating conditions for multi-product singlelevel
capacity-constrained production systems. We extract six critical criteria
from the previous related researches and employ them in a MCDM framework.
The Shannon entropy is used to weight the criterion and TOPSIS is proposed
for ranking the alternative methods. To be able to generalize the results, 324
cases considering different operating conditions are simulated. The results show
that the most important criteria are instability and inventory/setup costs,
respectively. A performance analysis of MPS development methods is reported
that the heuristics provides better results than multi-objective optimization in
many conditions. A sensitivity analysis for critical parameters is also provided.
Finally, the proposed methodology is implemented in a wire & cable company.

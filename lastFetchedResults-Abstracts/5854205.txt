Production scheduling is an important and complex problem faced by iron and steel enterprises, which is featured by its discrete and continuous process as well as multi-objective decision making characteristics. Recognized as a NP-Hard problem, it is clear that analytical method is difficult to effectively address this production scheduling problem. Combined with visual simulation technology, this paper drew a comprehensive analysis of steelmaking-continuous casting production and logistics system simulation methods to propose visual simulation system structure for iron and steel production scheduling process based on simulation software Flexsim, for which functional analysis, key technology and development process are presented. Also simulation model is designed for steelmaking-continuous casting production scheduling with discussion on the optimization algorithm and key technologies. Then applied with actual production data, simulation examples are shown on simplified production model.

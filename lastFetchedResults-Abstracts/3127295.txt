Vibration of a hydraulic excavatorÂ´s body and boom occurs when the boom quickly stops during upward or downward motion. The main objective of this research is to present an idea of suppressing the vibration. Several parameters which affect the vibration are defined and analyzed thoroughly and a method suppressing the vibration is presented in this paper for a specific real existing hydraulic excavator. Experimental results show that the proposed method works very well.

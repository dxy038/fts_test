The cognitive paradigm allows exploiting spectral resources, generally allocated for licensed systems, as `secondary´ users. When this paradigm is applied to television broadcasting, the unused frequencies are called `white spaces´. In this work we reports some experimental results of a 802.11-based system that uses a `white space´ for providing a bidirectional service in order to overcome the digital divide problem in an alpine valley.

The application of computer in education is on the rise recently. However, using Web logs in English language teaching (ELT) is rather new in Malaysia since the studentsÂ´ acceptance of writing web logs has not been extensively examined in previous studies. Therefore, the objective of this study is to measure studentspsila acceptance of writing Web logs employing the Davispsila technology acceptance model (TAM). Two determinants-perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) are used to determine an individualpsilas behavioural intention (BI) of writing Web log. To investigate the relationships among PEOU, PU, and BI of users with and without hands-on experience of blogging, pre- and post-questionnaires were administered on three intact groups of undergraduate students as the target sample. Three hypotheses were formulated based on the objectives of the study. The result of the study shows that with the support of hands-on experience, the students accepted to write Web logs because they found it was more useful rather than easy to use. Besides, TAM also had been found suitable to be adopted in educational context to predict technology acceptance prior and subsequent to users having any hands-on experience with the technology for pedagogical purpose.

A method and related algorithm for assessing the quality of a full-carrier, double-sideband signal are presented that were developed through statistical processing of empirical measurements of parameters of the received signal before and after detection. Preliminary results are presented showing the comparison of the objective automated measurement ratings against subjective human listener ratings of overall quality on a five-level scale. The algorithm has been developed to gauge the perceived quality and, inferentially, the intelligibility of a broadcast composed of speech, given that the ultimate goal of a broadcaster is to have the message received and understood by the largest audience possible. The algorithmic measures apply to all broadcast program material; music, as well as speech

Kea++ is a well known tool for assigning key phrases to documents. But Kea++ contains noise and irrelevant terms in the key phrase result set. The extended refinement methodology was developed to fine tune the results of Kea++ for multiple domains. However using Kea++ and its refinement as a system for assigning key phrases to documents is not simple for users of a domain other than computing. The system needs to be installed and configured. It does not have any GUI to facilitate users in assigning key phrases. The objective of the Kea KAT is to develop a web-based key phrase assignment tool to facilitate users in assigning relevant key phrases to their documents online. Kea KAT saves users not only from installing and configuring the system, but also improves the usability of the system.

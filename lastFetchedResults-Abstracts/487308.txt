Objective(s): To determine the effect of continuous acupressure at P6.applied by Sea -Bands with acupressure buttons on the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the 8-20 weeks.
Methods: A two-group quasi-experimental posttest-only and posttest-repeated measure in seventeen medical clinics or offices in southern Tehran was carried out. A convenience sample of Persian-speaking; healthily pregnant women in their 8-20 weeks of pregnancy; who had at least one episode of nausea, vomiting, or both before their prenatal clinic/ office visit where they were recruited. The women were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo groups.
Treatment group (1) applied Sea-Bands with acupressure buttons to both wrists for 4 days and removed the Sea-Bands for 3 subsequent days. Placebo group (2) applied the Sea-Bands with out acupressure buttons to both wrists on the same time schedule as group 1.
Self-reported daily diaries of the number of times per day that participants experienced nausea, the severity of nausea, the number of vomiting episodes per day, and the severity of vomiting were recorded. Results: Mann-Whitney U test revealed that the treatment group had significantly less frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy while wearing the Sea-Bands than did the placebo group. The treatment group also had significantly less frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy while wearing the Sea-Bands than when not wearing the Sea-Bands.
Conclusion: Sea-Bands with acupressure buttons are a noninvasive, inexpensive, safe, and effective treatment
for the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

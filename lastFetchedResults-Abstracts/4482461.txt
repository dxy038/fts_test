Work presented in this paper studies the potential of employing inerters - a novel mechanical device used successfully in racing cars - in active suspension configurations with the aim to enhance railway vehicle system performance. The particular element of research in this paper concerns railway wheelset lateral stability control. Controlled torques are applied to the wheelsets using the concept of absolute stiffness. The effects of a reduced set of arbitrary passive structures using springs, dampers and inerters integrated to the active solution are discussed. A multi-objective optimisation problem is defined for tuning the parameters of the proposed configurations. Finally, time domain simulations are assessed for the railway vehicle while negotiating a curved track. A simplification of the design problem for stability is attained with the integration of inerters to the active solutions.


Objective: The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of group Triple-P on the
relationships of mother-child with ID (Intellectual Disability). Methods: In this semi-experimental study with pretest and posttest design by control group,
Parent-Child Relationship Scale (PCRS) was determined in 40 random clustering selected
mothers of children with ID before and after the intervention. The aim of the scale was to
obtain information with regard to emotional aspects such as conflict, closeness, dependency,
and positive relationship. The mothers were randomly assigned in experimental and control
group with equal numbers. Experimental group participated in 8 sessions (each session lasts for
60 minutes; twice a week) and were trained by Triple-P, but control group did not. Multivariate
analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used for analyzing the data by using SPSS software
(version 16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: There were significant differences between experimental and control group with
respect to emotional aspects such as conflict, closeness, dependency, and positive relationship
as a whole after participation in intervention sessions (P<0.001). Conclusion: There was a significant decrease in conflict and increase in closeness, dependency,
and positive relationship in experimental group. Our findings showed that group Triple-P has
led to promotion of relationships of mother-child with ID.

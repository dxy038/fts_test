Objective: To systematically evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of tongguan capsule (TGC) on the patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Method: Literatures associated with randomized controlled trials (RCT) or quasi-RCT of TGC in treating patients with CHD was retrieved by computerized searching from related medicine database Quality assessment and data extraction were done by two reviewers independently. Statistical analysis was performed by Cochrane CollaborationÂ´s RevMan 5.1 software Result: Thirteen trials involving 877 patients were internalized in which 617 patients were treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The results of meta-analysis showed that TGC improved the symptom of angina pectoris (AP)(RR=1.22, 95%CI[1.12, 1.33], P&lt;;0. 00001), elevated the left ventricle ejection fraction(LVEF)(WMD=0.03, 95 %CI[0.01, 0.05], P=0.01), and depressed the level of fibrinogen (FIB) in CHD patients after PCI (WMD=-0.54, 95 %CI[-0.87, -0.20], P=0.002). Conclusion: TGC is beneficial to AP and heart function in patient with CHD, which could improve the hyper-coagulant status and adjust the balance of coagulant-fibrinolysis system of CHD patients after PCI.

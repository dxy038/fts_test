Convergence of one-way broadcast and bidirectional unicast networks can be leveraged for efficient delivery of on-demand broadband contents in future telecommunication systems. In this work we are modelling an integrated broadcast and unicast bidirectional network with transcoding capabilities and addressing optimization of on demand content delivery under alternative approaches. Two alternatives are considered which maximize the efficiency of the integrated network providing a compromise between the efficiency and QoS respectively. The approaches are validated through simulations and assessed again a broadcast network without transcoding facilities.

Random equipment incident is a major problem when scheduling flexible assembly systems (FASs). In this paper, the authors suggest a reactive scheduling approach through the parameter associated to the line balancing, the objective is to adapt the line balancing to the equipment state. The consistency technique is used to solve the balancing problem and an heuristic approach is provided for online scheduling. Finally, the results of a computer simulation, compared with another heuristic approach, are reported

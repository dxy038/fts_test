The objective of this paper is to compare the robustness performance of continuous time periodic controller with conventional non-linear sliding mode controller (SMC) for a highly non-linear system cart-inverted pendulum. The goal is to determine which control strategy delivers better performance to pendulum´s angle and cart´s position. It is observed that although both the controllers are capable to control the multi output inverted pendulum system successfully; time varying periodic control delivers better robustness compared to nonlinear SMC control strategy by virtue of its loop zero-placement capability. Simulation study is done in MATLAB-SIMULINK environment and the responses are presented in time domain with detailed analysis.

The watershed algorithm is the most common method used for peak detection and integration in two-dimensional chromatography. However, the retention time variability in the second dimension may render the algorithm to fail. A study calculating the probabilities of failure of the watershed algorithm was performed. The main objective was to calculate the maximum second-dimension retention time variability, Δ2tR,crit, above which the algorithm fails. Several models to calculate Δ2tR,crit were developed and evaluated: (a) exact model; (b) simplified model and (c) simple-modified model. Model (c) gave the best performance and allowed to deduce an analytical expression for the probability of failure of the watershed algorithm as a function of experimental Δ2tR, modulation time and peak width in the first and second dimensions. It could be demonstrated that the probability of failure of the watershed algorithm under normal conditions in GC × GC is around 15–20%. Small changes of Δ2tR, modulation time and/or peak width in the first and second dimension could induce subtle changes in the probability of failure of the watershed algorithm. Theoretical equations were verified with experimental results from a diesel sample injected in GC × GC and were found to be in good agreement with the experiments.

Recent advances in propagation modeling, ionospheric diagnostics, and signal processing have helped overcome the limitations the ionosphere imposes on sea-state measurements with HF skywave radar. Wind-direction fields in tropical storms can be routinely mapped under most ionospheric conditions, but waveheight and wave-spectrum extraction is more sensitive to ionospheric distortions and requires care in signal processing and in selecting an ionospheric path. Spot measurements with a high-resolution radar have verified its ability to measure (in order of increasing difficulty) wind-direction fields, rms waveheight, and the scalar ocean-wave spectrum at ranges up to 3000 km using one ionospheric hop. Although such a radar can in principle map these quantities over millions of square kilometers of an ocean area, the time required to do so under various ionospheric conditions remains to be determined. A minimum objective of one map of rms waveheight per day seems attainable.

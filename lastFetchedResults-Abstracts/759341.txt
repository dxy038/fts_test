Objective: to investigate homotypic and heterotypic
longitudinal patterns of symptoms of separation
anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD), social phobia (SoPh), panic disorder (PD), and obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD) in young adolescents
from the Dutch general population.
Method: 2,067 individuals (51.4% girls) from a Dutch
community sample, who were assessed for the first time
when they were aged 10 to 12 years, were followed up
across a period of two years. At both assessments, anxiety
symptoms were assessed with the RCADS, a self-report
questionnaire.
Results: Regression analyses indicated that homotypic
continuity was relatively high for SAD, GAD, and SoPh
symptoms, and for PD in girls.
Conclusions: In many studies, anxiety disorders are
treated as one group of disorders, and some widely used assessment
instruments, such as the Child Behavior Checklist,
do not even contain scales that tap different anxiety dimensions.
In the present study, evidence for homotypic continuity
was found, especially for symptoms of separation, social,
and generalized anxiety, and for symptoms of panic disorder
in girls, underscoring the usefulness of making distinctions
between different anxiety constructs.

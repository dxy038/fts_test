This paper originally presents a model-based photovoltaic (PV) performance monitoring system with an online diagnosis function in the LabVIEW environment. The collected data are compared with the estimated ones that are obtained using a single-diode practical PV model. The proposed LabVIEW-based PV monitoring system will raise an alarm as soon as the difference between the measured and estimated data is over prescribed criteria. All the important parameters such as irradiance, cell temperature, output voltage, current, and power of a PV module are displayed in a front panel in the LabVIEW environment like physical instrument, which is programmed with a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI). The main objective of this paper is to make the PV monitoring system have the self-diagnosis function that is based on the simulation of a built-in practical PV model under real operating conditions. Finally, the validation of the proposed system using a commercial PV module demonstrates its simplicity, user-friendliness, and accuracy.

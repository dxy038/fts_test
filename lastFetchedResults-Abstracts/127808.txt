Background & Objective: Osteopenia is a common complication in renal transplant recipient resulting to increased rate of bone fracture especially in spine, ribs and hip. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree and pattern of bone loss in the first three months after renal transplantation.
Method: This observational study was carried out on 10 renal transplant recipients(4 males, 6 females) with the age range of 13 to 57 years old. The immunosuppressive therapy consisted of cyclosporine, azathioporine and steroids. In all patients bone mineral density(BMD), Tscore and Zscore were measured at lumbar spine(L2-L4) and femoral neck a few days before transplantation and 3 months post renal transplant.
Results: The results of BMD, Tscore and Zscore in lumbar spine before and after transplant was(1.024±0.15, 0.99±0.20), (-1.32±1.48, -1.86±1.69) and (-1.11±1.50, -2.1±1.146, P<0.025), in femoral neck(0.89±0.09, 0.86*0.09, P<0.01), (-1.02±0.883, -1.32±0.86) and (-0.69±0.95, -1.08±0.79, P<0.04) respectively.
Conclusion: Three months after renal transplantation, BMD and Zscore in femoral neck and Zscore in lumbar spine decreased significantly.

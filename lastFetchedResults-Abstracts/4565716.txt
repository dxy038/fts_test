This paper discusses the use of multi-objective optimization in the context of designing a dual antenna system for diversity reception or MIMO communication on a mobile platform in the recently released communication band 750-800 MHz. The performance of such systems is highly dependent on the received signal levels and also on the correlation between the signals. Also, from a radio-engineering point of view, there are limitations on the S-parameters of the design. Further, the antennas also need to share space with other devices on the platform, which adds requirements on the size of the antennas. All these aspects often lead to conflicting requirements, which traditionally are dealt with in the optimization by weighting the different requirements into a single requirement. That approach has several disadvantages including that no trade-off discussion between the different requirements can be made. Multi-objective optimization avoids these disadvantages and has the benefit that the decision of optimal design is made by the antenna engineer then all possibilities and limitations are known.

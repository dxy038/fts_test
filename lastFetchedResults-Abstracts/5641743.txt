The main objective of this system is to make ATM transactions as secure as possible. This system replaces the conventional ATM card with Fingerprint. Therefore, users don´t have to carry a plastic card to withdraw money. The Fingerprint and the phone number of all users are stored in the system database during Registration. Fingerprints are used to identify a Person´s genuinity. A Fingerprint scanner is used to get the fingerprint of the user, after which the system requests for the PIN (Personal Identification Number). Once the user enters the PIN, the user is prompted to enter the OTP (One Time Password) which is a 4-digit random password sent by the server to the user´s registered mobile number. On cross verification with the data stored in the system database, the user is allowed to make a transaction. The underlying mechanism involves combining the concepts of Cryptography and Steganography. The PIN and OTP are encrypted using AES 256. Then the encrypted data is steganographed with the fingerprint image which acts as the BASE image. The Steganographed image is sent to the server, where it is de-steganographed and verified with the data available in the system database.

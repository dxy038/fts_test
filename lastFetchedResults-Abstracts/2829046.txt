Induction machines 100 kW to 7.5 MW are designed for Low Voltage (LV) 460 V, 690 V or Medium Voltages (MV) 2.4 kV to 4 kV and 12 kV in special cases. The objective of this paper is to compare doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) with different voltage and speed ratings for wind energy systems. This paper investigates the effect of alternate number of poles and voltage ratings on the performance of a DFIG. The design of a DFIG has been optimized by means of an analytical model and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Several optimized DFIG designs were generated in this manner, and then matched with a suitable single-stage gear box and a back-to-back converter connected to the rotor. This paper suggests an improved system by considering the quality of output power, voltage and number of poles.

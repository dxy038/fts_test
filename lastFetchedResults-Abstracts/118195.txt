The objective of this study was to measure the medullary pressures generated during bone cement injection, pressurization and femoral prosthesis insertion. The measurements were recorded throughout the length of an in vitro femoral model while implanting a series of prosthetic hip stems using different pressurization techniques. The prostheses used were a Charnley 40 flanged stem (Johnson & Johnson DePuy International Limited), an Exeter No. 3 stem (Stryker Howmedica Osteonics, Howmedica International Limited), and a customized femoral component (Johnson & Johnson DePuy International Limited). The following parameters were derived from the pressure data recorded: peak pressure, decay pressure and duration above optimum pressure of 76 kPa to predict adequate penetration. The custom and Exeter stems generated cement pressures throughout the length of the cavity model that were predicted to achieve adequate bone cement interdigitation into cancellous bone. For all the conditions investigated in this study, when using the Charnley femoral component, an adequate level of cement pressurization was generated in the medial-distal portion of the femoral cavity. It is postulated that this could result in reduced integration of the cement mantle with bone and less effective transmission of functional loads applied during a patient's normal activity, postoperatively.

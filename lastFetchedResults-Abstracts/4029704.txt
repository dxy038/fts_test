Mastoidectomy is a core surgical procedure in otologic surgery. It is believed that the procedure is performed by different surgeons with some variability. However, it is also believed that all surgeons use a finite number of fundamental surgical actions to complete the procedure. To determine how a surgeon performs a mastoidectomy, we sought to identify the fundamental surgical actions [called action primitives (APs)] and determine the transition boundaries among those APs. Our motivation for this paper is both to delineate the APs necessary to complete a mastoidectomy and to optimize and potentially automate the surgical process. In this paper, we present a new approach to developing methods for parsing raw data (position and orientation of the surgical tool and end-effector force) into a sequence of surgical tasks. The overall objective is to deconstruct the surgical procedure into a series of APs. This paper presents results from our initial investigation on detecting transition boundaries and identifying APs involved in mastoidectomy.

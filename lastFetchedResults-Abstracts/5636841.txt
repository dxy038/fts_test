In this paper, we propose the depth estimation and view synthesis approaches for the scene rendering of narrow-baseline videos. Depth estimation is performed by global energy minimization using graph cut technique. A novel smoothness energy term is proposed to enforce powerful smoothness of the estimated depth. In view synthesis, smart hole filling is proposed to efficiently remove the burr artifacts along the object boundary. Experimental results show that compared with the MPEG reference software, our method can generate more accurate depth maps and achieve much better objective (PSNR) and subjective quality in view synthesis.

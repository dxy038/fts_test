Background: Despite the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in many countries still have not found a certain cure for it.
Objective: So the purpose of this study was to survey the effect of curcumin supplementation with resistance training in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Methods: In a randomized, controlled trial study, 45 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were divided into 4 groups (resistance training, curcumin supplement consumption, resistance training with curcumin supplement consumption, and placebo). The experimental groups performed a 12-week resistance training 3 days a week or consumed a curcumin capsule per day or both of them. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels before and after the protocol were measured. Data were analyzed by using ANCOVA with SPSS 22 software in P < 0.05 level.
Results: ALT and AST levels in resistance training and resistance training with curcumin supplement consumption significantly decreased (P < 0.05) but in ALP levels significant differences was not seen (P > 0.05). The grade of liver fat in any groups did not change significantly (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: On the basis of these results, we suggested that the Curcumin supplementation with resistance training in patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could cause to improve liver function, but more studies must be conducted in this area with more subjects.

sorting based algorithm is proposed in this paper for finding non-dominated set in Multi-Objective optimization. The algorithm is composed by sorting step and dominated solutions deleting step. Some enhancement techniques including primary non-dominated solutions, scoring and summation sequence are used to reduce the computa tional complexity. Compared with the classic Kung et al.´s efficient algorithm, experiments show sorting based algorithm performs almost the same efficiently as the Kung et al.´s algorithm when there are less objectives and solutions, and much better when there are more objectives and solutions.

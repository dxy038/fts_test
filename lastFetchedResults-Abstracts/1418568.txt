The optimal design of linear structural systems under stochastic, stationary dynamic excitation is discussed. Several measures are considered for quantification of the stochastic performance, including the standard H 2 and multi-objective H 2 measures related to the second-order statistics of the response, as well as a measure related to first-passage system reliability. Of these, first-passage reliability is the performance measure most closely aligned with the design of Civil Engineering structures, but it is also the least analytically-tractable. This paper discusses the evaluation and optimization of these performance measures, including an efficient approximation to first-passage reliability, and examines the degree to which the optimal structural design, and its reliability, vary when the optimization is carried out under these different measures. For the reliability-optimal design, the effect of the spatial and temporal correlation of multiple out-crossing events is investigated. An example is presented, which considers the optimal configuration of viscous dampers for protection of a five storey structure under earthquake excitation.

The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary Ca concentration affects the ability to maintain Ca homeostasis in non-lactating non-pregnant dairy cows fed diets differing in dietary cation–anion difference (DCAD). Eight non-lactating non-pregnant multiparous Holstein cows (594 ± 80.3 kg body weight; 34.5 ± 11.4 month old) were fed diets Low or High in DCAD (−64 vs. 82 mequiv./kg dry matter, respectively) in combinations with Low or High dietary Ca concentration (3.0 vs. 9.1 g/kg of dry matter, respectively) in a duplicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 14-d periods. On d 14 of each period, cows were subjected to an EDTA challenge that consists of an intra-jugular infusion of EDTA solution to decrease blood Ca concentration. In this protocol, the time required to recover to 90% of the pre-challenge blood Ca concentration was determined as recovery time. During the EDTA challenge, mean blood bicarbonate concentration was lower for cows fed Low-DCAD diets although mean blood pH was not affected by treatment, indicating that cows fed Low-DCAD diets had mild compensated metabolic acidosis. Feeding High-Ca diet shortened the recovery time (106 vs. 134 min; P=0.04) when DCAD was low, while Low-Ca diet shortened the recovery time (125 vs. 159 min; P=0.02) when DCAD was high. These results suggest that the optimum dietary Ca concentration to minimize the risk of hypocalcaemia in dairy cows is likely different depending on the DCAD value.

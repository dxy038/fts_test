In recent years, demand for three-dimensional simulations has continued to grow in the  eld of computeraided
engineering. Especially, in the analysis of forming processes a fully automatic and robust mesh
generator is necessary for handling complex geometries used in industry. For three-dimensional analyses,
tetrahedral elements are commonly used due to the advantage in dealing with such geometries.
In this study, the advancing front technique has been implemented and modi ed using an optimization
scheme. In this optimization scheme, the distortion metric determines ‘when and where’ to smooth,
and serves as an objective function. As a result, the performance of the advancing front technique is
improved in terms of mesh quality generated

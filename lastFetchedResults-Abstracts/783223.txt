Objective This study compares the satisfaction
with emergency interventions among severely
mentally ill (SMI) service users of a community-based
and a hospital-based mental health service (South-
Verona, Italy and Nunhead, South-London, UK).
Methods A measurement of the satisfaction with psychiatric
emergency services was conducted among all
those users in the two catchment areas who, in a 1-year
period: (1) had at least two contacts with the service; (2)
had a diagnosis of psychosis according to ICD10; (3)
had not been living in hospital or sheltered apartment
for most of the time. These users completed seven items
belonging to the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale
(VSSS) regarding their satisfaction with crisis response
during and out of office hours and their satisfaction
with the different interventions, which may be provided
during emergencies, such as consultation for the
user, consultation for the relative, day-centre attendance,
informal and compulsory admission. Results
Users in South-Verona were generally more
satisfied with emergency interventions. The main differences
between the two samples were due to contacts
outside the hospital setting, whilst satisfaction scores
for informal admission were similar. The number of
users who did not receive, but would have liked, different
types of emergency intervention was smaller in
South-Verona than in Nunhead. In South-Verona,
users wishes mainly concerned consultation for the
relatives during emergencies; in the Nunhead sample,
the most requested types of intervention were consultation
for the user and the possibility of day-centre
attendance during crisis. Conclusions The findings
suggest that users of a service with a well developed
community-oriented approach and with crisis intervention
outside the hospital setting are more satisfied
of the emergency interventions than users of a mental
health service relying mostly on hospital facilities
during emergencies

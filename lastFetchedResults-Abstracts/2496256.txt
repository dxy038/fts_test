Objective
Prevalence of neonatal stroke has been reported 1/2300-1/4000 live births and
accounts for 12-20% of the cases of neonatal seizures. Although stroke has been
introduced as the second cause of the neonatal seizures in literatures, it may
remain unclear in diagnostic evaluations of seizure in neonates. This study was
performed to assess the prevalence of stroke in neonates with seizure.
Materials & Methods
In this cross-sectional study, all neonates ? 28 weeks of gestation with a diagnosis
of seizures admitted to the NICU of Boo-Ali Sina Hospital in Sari, north of
Iran, were enrolled. Brain CT scan and a Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography
were performed for the all cases. In cases that stroke were reported in one or
two above modalities, an MRI was also performed and prevalence of stroke
was reported. Putative risk factors of stroke were analyzed with univariate and
multivariate statistical methods.
Results
From 174 newborn infants, 75.3% of neonates were male. Prevalence of stroke
was 8%, 2.3% and 3.4% in Doppler ultrasonography, CT scan and MRI reports
respectively. Umbilical venous catheterization was the risk factor of stroke in
the univariate and multivariate analysis (P= 0.001; OR, 10.39; 95% CI, 2.72-
39.77). The most common form of seizure was focal clonic seizures (78.6%) in
neonates with stroke.
Conclusion
Investigation of stroke as an etiology of neonatal seizures is essential because
seizure may be the only symptom of neonatal cerebral infarction. Doppler
ultrasonography can be a valuable diagnostic tool at first in critically ill neonates
or in situations that MRI is not available primarily. Further studies with notice to
outcome assessment of these infants recommended.

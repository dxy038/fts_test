The conventional statistical-based transformation functions for voice conversion have been shown to suffer over-smoothing and over-fitting problems. The over-smoothing problem arises because of the statistical average during estimating the model parameters for the transformation function. In addition, the large number of parameters in the statistical model cannot be well estimated from the limited parallel training data, which will result in the over-fitting problem. In this work, we investigate a robust transformation function for voice conversion using conditional restricted Boltzmann machine. Conditional restricted Boltzmann machine, which performs linear and non-linear transformations simultaneously, is proposed to learn the relationship between source and target speech. CMU ARCTIC corpus is adopted in the experimental validations. The number of parallel training utterances is varied from 2 to 40. For these different training situations, two objective evaluation measures, mel-cepstral distortion and correlation coefficient, both show that the proposed method outperforms the main stream joint density Gaussian mixture model method consistently.

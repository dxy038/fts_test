In mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), due to rapidly changing network topology, routing break occurs frequently. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector adaptive backup with local repair routing (AODV-ABL) protocol creates and maintains backup routes to the destination node by overhearing data packets to increase the success rate of repairing invalid routes. However, AODV-ABL may lose some backup routes with one hop distance to the destination node, and cannot adjust the primary routes in time to adapt to the dynamic topology. In this paper, based on AODV-ABL, an AODV bidirectional fast adaptive backup local repair (AODV-BFABL) routing protocol for bidirectional traffic load scenarios is proposed, which can maintain the bidirectional routes to the destination and source nodes to reduce route failures. In order to improve the adaptability of AODV-BFABL, the primary routes are merged with the backup routes and the routes are updated when transmitting the data packets. Simulation results show that AODV-BFABL has better packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and control overhead than AODV-ABL.

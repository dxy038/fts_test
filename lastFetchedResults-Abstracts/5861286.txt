In this paper, we evaluate the cabin system of human-vehicle-environment of contain vehicle aggregately based on analytic hierarchy process method. And then detail the evaluation methods, principles and processes. The analysis of the vehicle comfortableness can improve the driving safety, guarantee the driver security and reduce the wrong operation effectively. We first state the aim and meaning of the vehicle comfortableness analysis. Then, we analyze the factors may affect the comfortableness. After that, we build the cabin system of human-vehicle-environment and finally establish the analysis contents and proposal. Based on the national and industry standards, we put forward the subjective and objective evaluation of display class, control class, vehicle class and environment class. Meanwhile, we design the evaluation system of cabin system of human-vehicle-environment. Using the analytic hierarchy process method, we evaluate the cabin system of driver-vehicle-environment of contain vehicle aggregately and calculate the weight value of all the factors of this system. Then, we get the quantitative evaluation result and provide improvement method for the traditional design.

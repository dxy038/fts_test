Backgroud and Objective: Congenital esotropia is one of most common ocular disorder in children with genetic origin. Amblyopia, decreased streopsis and cosmetic problems are its complication that affect person's fate in terms of career psychological issues.  The aim of this study was to determine the effect of botulinum toxin A (Dysport) injection in subconjunctival space near medial rectus insertion of both eyes for treatment of congenital esotropia.
Subjects and Methods:  Thirty babies (aged 6-54 months) with congenital esotropia who were otherwise systemically and neurologically normal were enrolled in this study. Ten units of toxin (Dysport) were injected (under sedation) into the subconjunctival space near medial rectus insertion of both eyes. The angle of deviation was measured six times: after 3 days, 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after injection.
Results: Twelve months after injection ,angle of deviation decreased from 52 ± 17 PD to 27.8 ± 21.29 PD in  86.3%  of   patients . Success  of  treatment achieved   in  23.3%  of   patients  ( P=0.008) .In seventeen cases (56.6%) with   angle of deviation? 45 PD (before   injection) improvement was better (p=0.030), 41.1%  of  this  group  after 1  month , 70%  after 3 months , 76%  after  6  months, and  41.1% after  12  months follow up  achieved  orthophoria.
Conclusion: Botulinum toxin A injection into subconjunctival space near medial rectus insertion is a safe method that is not only effective transiently for eye alignment but also can reduce total deviation. Long term improvement seems to be achievable in cases with small angle deviation (equal or less than of 45 PD).

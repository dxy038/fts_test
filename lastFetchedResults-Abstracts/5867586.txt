A hybrid genetic-ant colony algorithm (HGACA) has been presented for contingencies security optimal power flow (CSOPF) in this paper. The CSOPF can be divided into three steps involving security analysis, severest event selection, and preventive algorithm that called preventive CSOPF. The HGACA is integrated with genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithm, and the objective of GA is to improve the searching quality of ants by optimizing themselves to generate a better result, because the ants produced randomly by pheromone process are not necessary better. This method can not only enhance the neighborhood search, but can also search the optimum solution quickly to advance convergence.

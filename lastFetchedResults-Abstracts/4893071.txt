In our earlier work [1], we employed MVDR (minimum variance distortionless response) based spectral estimation instead of modified-linear prediction method [2] in pitch modification. Here, we use the Bauer method of MVDR spectral factorization, leading to a causal inverse filter rather than a noncausal filter setup with MVDR spectral estimation [1]. Further, this is employed to obtain source (or residual) signal from pitch synchronous speech frames. The residual signal is resampled using DCT/IDCT depending on the target pitch scale factor. Finally, forward filters realized from the above factorization are used to get pitch modified speech. The modified speech is evaluated subjectively by 10 listeners and mean opinion scores (MOS) are tabulated. Further, modified bark spectral distortion measure is also computed for objective evaluation of performance. We find that the proposed algorithm performs better compared to time domain pitch synchronous overlap [3] and modified-LP method [2]. A good MOS score is achieved with the proposed algorithm compared to [1] with a causal inverse and forward filter setup.

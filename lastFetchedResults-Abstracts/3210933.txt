Summary form only given. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is widely utilized as the adopted symmetrickey algorithm in security-constrained and high-performance applications. The objective in using the AES is to preserve the confidentiality of the data transferred. However, this may be compromised by the attacks that take advantage of the side-channel information leaked. Moreover, natural hardware failures may cause the AES algorithm not to function as intended. The preceding facts which suggest that the confidentiality of the AES does not guarantee its reliability are the motivations for this workshop. In this workshop, we will investigate the negative effects of the natural and malicious faults on different hardware implementations of the AES algorithm through going over previously conducted several exhaustive simulations. The faults considered include both transient and permanent ones which can be modeled as single, multiple, or burst stuck-at and bridging faults. This study suggests that even a single stuck-at fault may result in an undesirable output. Therefore, to make the AES implementations reliable, we study two classes of low-power and high-performance fault attacks countermeasures. Session.

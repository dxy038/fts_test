The objective of the present study is to examine whether a simple affine-linear model of autonomous nervous activities would be able to reproduce the characteristic features of MAP regulation observed over long periods of time. In this study, we approach the problem first by constructing a modified nonlinear model for the human ABP regulation system. By simulating with various gain combination values, we quantified the role of the neural modulations in the four baroreflex limbs for blood pressure regulation.. We applied this method to the experimental water loading. Then, we characterized the transfer function from drinking rate input to pressure output in water loading experiment. Eigen value study is done using the root locus technique. Last, we discuss the origin of the humoral control to capture the sustained and transient components of the response, based on the analysis of the neural control of the dynamic model.

Background/Objective: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a new therapeutic technique for unresectable hepatic malignancies. We report our experience with the use of this method for the first time in Iran. Patients and Methods: Eighteen patients with primary or metastatic hepatic malignancies, which were considered not suitable for surgical resection, were included in our study. RFA was performed via the percutaneous ultrasound–guided method, under general anesthesia, by an interventional radiologist. Patients were followed prospectively with contrast– enhanced CT or ultrasonography, and tumor marker serum levels 1, 3 and 6 months after RFA. Results: RFA was used to treat 26 tumors (diameters of 12-70 mm). These tumors included hepatocellular carcinoma in three cases and metastatic carcinoma in 23 cases. Three patients had complications: two bilomas and one abscess in the right lobe. At follow-ups, tumor recurred at the site of RFA in four tumors, all of which were over 4 cm in diameter. Conclusion: RFA is a procedure with the potential to be safe and effective for treating unresectable liver tumors.

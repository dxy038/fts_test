Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of 2 automated blood pressure monitors against mercury sphygmomanometry and intra-arterial blood pressure determination in women with preeclampsia. Study Design: The auscultatory and oscillometric monitors were compared with mercury sphygmomanometry according to the British Hypertension Society protocol and criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation in a group of 30 women with proteinuric preeclampsia. In addition both monitors were compared with intra-arterial blood pressure measurements in a group of 6 women with severe preeclampsia. The mean (± SD) of the differences was calculated and a paired t test was used to compare values obtained with each monitor with intra-arterial measurements. Results: Compared with mercury sphygmomanometry the auscultatory QuietTrak monitor markedly underestimated systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 13 ± 15 mm Hg. The oscillometric SpaceLabs 90207 monitor also underestimated systolic pressure by 10 ± 10 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by 8 ± 7 mm Hg. According to the British Hypertension Society grading criteria both monitors achieved the lowest grade (D) for recording systolic and diastolic pressure. The 2 monitors also did not meet the accuracy criteria stipulated by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Compared with intra-arterial readings the SpaceLabs monitor significantly underestimated systolic and mean arterial pressures (by 19 and 7 mm Hg, respectively, P< .01). The QuietTrak monitor significantly underestimated systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (by 25 mm Hg, P< .05, 18 mm Hg, P< .01, and 20 mm Hg, P< .01, respectively). Conclusion: Neither monitor can be recommended for clinical use in women with proteinuric preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:1203-10.)

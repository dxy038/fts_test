Crack tunneling has been commonly observed in crack growth experiments on specimens made of ductile materials such as steel and aluminum alloys. The objective of this study is to investigate the crack tunneling phenomenon and study the effects of crack tunneling on the distribution of several mechanics parameters controlling ductile fracture. Three-dimensional (3D) elasticâ€“plastic finite element analyses of stable tearing experiments involving tunneling fracture are carried out. Two model problems based on stable tearing experiments are considered. The first model problem involves a plate specimen containing a stationary, single-edge crack with a straight or tunneled crack front, under remote mode I loading. In the numerical analyses, the crack tip opening displacement, the von Mises effective stress, the mean stress, the stress constraint and the effective plastic strain around straight and tunneled crack fronts are obtained and compared. It is found that crack tunneling produces significant changes in the stress and deformation fields around the crack front. The second model problem involves a specimen containing a stably growing single-edge crack with a straight or tunneled crack front, under remote mode I loading. Crack growth events with a straight or tunneled crack front are simulated using the finite element method, and the effect of crack tunneling on the prediction of the load-crack-extension response based on a CTOD fracture criterion is investigated.

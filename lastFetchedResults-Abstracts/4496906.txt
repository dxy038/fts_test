The objective of the long-term operating planning problem is to determine the optimum strategy for the generation of electricity, aiming towards the minimization of total operating cost over the planning period. In a competitive electricity market, based on a tight-pool model, generators will look for the maximization of their profits, which requires a better knowledge of hydraulic resources than that which is currently available. In this context, the agents will require that the independent system operator have a precise operating planning model to be able to do this. So, in this paper we present a long-term operating planning model based on a power plant individualistic representation. In order to support the high computational burden, a suitable parallel processing algorithm is proposed

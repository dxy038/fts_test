The objective of this paper is to develop an energetic dynamical description of a model of an Internal Combustion Engine. This model is based on a simple power balance between input and output power of engine. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) is used to organize the IC engine model. This energetic description will be coupled with the whole vehicle previously developed with EMR. The fuel consumption and the detailed power flow will be analysis for a complete drive cycle.

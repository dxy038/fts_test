OBJECTIVE: A method is described by which residents can perform transvaginal sacrospinous colpopexy simply, quickly, safely, and effectively. STUDY DESIGN: Over 11 years, 134 sacrospinous suspension procedures have been performed, all or in part by residents, under the direct intraoperative supervision of the author. Minimum follow-up is 1 year. An operative technique has been developed with use of standard instruments and lights. The sitting resident, the attending physician, and the medical student are able to see the ligament penetrated by the suture. If necessary, the attending physician is able to perform the difficult steps of the operation without changing places with the resident. RESULTS: Results are known for 112 of the patients. There have been five recurrences of significant prolapse, and incontinence has developed in 8 patients. Ninety-nine patients felt the outcome to be satisfactory or excellent. There were two major complications and one postoperative death. CONCLUSIONS: This teaching method has provided our residents a direct-view, hands-on familiarity with sacrospinous colpopexy while achieving results for the patients consistent with the outcomes of other centers.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:6)

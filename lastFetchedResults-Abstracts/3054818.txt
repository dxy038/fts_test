The paper investigates the constrained capacity of sequential ARQ linear precoding in flat fading MIMO systems. To utilize fully the time diversity provided by ARQ, we derive the optimal linear ARQ precoders in a flat fading MIMO channel with the objective of maximizing the mutual information delivered by multiple transmissions of the same packet. The capacity-maximizing ARQ precoders combine water-pouring power loading and the optimal pairing of singular vectors in the current retransmission with those from previous transmissions. This optimal pairing is a special feature unique to sequential ARQ precoding and plays important role in maximizing the mutual information.

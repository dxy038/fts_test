Growing awareness of the importance of conserving the biodiversity of livestock breeds is paralleled by genetic advances that will help objective planning of conservation. Inventories of breeds, long advocated, are now being established and concepts originally formulated for the quantification of species diversity are being applied. The breeds thus conserved will provide valuable resources for the future of agriculture, especially in the developing world.

The objective of this paper is to determine a suitable rotor structure with high-power performance for a small-scale wind power permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Five types of rotor structures are considered: a surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM), an inset PM, a tangentially-magnetized interior permanent magnet (IPM), a radially-magnetized IPM, and a V-shaped IPM. All have magnets of approximately the same size. They are analyzed by the 2-D finite element method (2D-FEM). From the results, the most suitable rotor structure is determined by comparing the average torque, power output, and efficiency for the rated conditions.

Objective(s): To determine the level of dental health services utilization by HIV-positive patients. Methods: In this study we used a proportional random sampling method to select 230 HIV-positive patients from three HIV counseling centers. An anonymous questionnaire was completed for each patient. Results: The total demand for dental services was 165. The rate of demand was 47.9% and the rate of utilization was estimated 75.9%. Most patients (56%) did not have insurance. Only 60% of these individuals notified the health workers of their HIV status. The most common reason for not demanding services was high cost, and the most common reason of non-utilization was the refusal by health workers to provide services. The main reason for not reporting the HIV-positive status was fear of rejection by the dentist. Conclusion: Inadequate insurance coverage and poverty might result in decreased access to dental health in HIV-positive individuals. In addition there is need to improve knowledge of HIV in dentists and change their attitudes and practices in order to increase utilization of dental services by HIV-positive patients.

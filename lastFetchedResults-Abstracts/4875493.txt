This paper applies genetic algorithms (GAs) to control a simple one-machine infinite bus power system. The objective is to design an output feedback controller for the test system. To validate the proposed method, full state feedback using an LQR approach is first solved using both MATLAB and the proposed GA. Then, the GA is used to design an output feedback controller that minimizes the same performance index as the LQR. The feedback gain values are quantized into a binary format so the GA operators could be applied in a binary format

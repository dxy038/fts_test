This paper describes the construction and operation of a 4-dimensional neural network computer. This demonstration system uses holographic interconnects recorded in a volume spectral hole burning medium. The paper provides an overview of the demonstration system and includes experimental details of components: the tunable laser, the detector arrays, the spatial light modulators, and preparation and cooling of the spectral hole burning medium. Experimental results showing association of image patterns and a bidirectional associative memory experiment are presented and discussed

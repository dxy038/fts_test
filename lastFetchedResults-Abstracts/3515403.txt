The objective of this study is to investigate a remote laboratory on electric motors using high-speed networks between Japan and the United States. The client, situated at Stanford University, Stanford, CA, accessed the remote laboratory system set up in Japan. Through this client, the remotely located user operated the motors and conducted experiments. The remote laboratory was conducted over a high-quality digital video conference system, making it possible for both sides to communicate smoothly with each other and for the remote user to observe close-up details of the laboratory, including the motorÂ´s fine movements. Using a network bandwidth of 15 Mb/s, the authors were able to demonstrate the validity of the remote laboratory experiment.

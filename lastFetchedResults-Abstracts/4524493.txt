In this paper, the inverse position, workspace and dexterity of the 4-PTT parallel mechanism were analyzed. Based on genetic algorithm, the structural parameters were optimized with the main objective function method, while workspace and dexterity were taken as the optimized goal. The optimization data and atlases were obtained with Matlab. By contrasting the results, we can see that performance of the mechanism is good after optimization. The study provides foundation for future application.

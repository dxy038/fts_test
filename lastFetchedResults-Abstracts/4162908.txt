The paper discusses the use of different, &#8220;design of experiment&#8221; and statistical theory based methods to improve and speed up the &#8220;generalised response surface method&#8221;, using multiquadrics to describe the objective function in parameter space, for the optimization of multiminima design problems in magnetics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach to enhance the convergence of stochastic optimisation algorithms is tested on a couple of test problems and the results are discussed

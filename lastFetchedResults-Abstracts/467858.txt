OBJECTIVE: It is known from animal experiments that blood flow through the ductus venosus changes with fetal strain. Therefore the ratio of umbilical vein to ductus venosus flow rate in human intrauterine growth retardation and multifetal pregnancies was investigated and compared with that in control subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Blood flow rates in the umbilical vein and in the ductus venosus, as well as peak velocity, minimum velocity, mean velocity, and pulsatility index (maximum velocity envelope curve) in the ductus venosus, were measured in women with normal pregnancies (n = 55), intrauterine growth retardation (n = 20), and multifetal pregnancies (10 women with 20 fetuses) with color Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Average ductus venosus blood flow rates (mean ± SD), normalized for estimated fetal body weight, were 60 ± 30, 69 ± 35, and 77 ± 28 (ml • min–1 • kg–1) in control subjects, intrauterine growth retardation, and multifetal pregnancies, respectively. Umbilical vein blood flow rates amounted to 140 ± 59, 111 ± 54, and 141 ± 47 (ml • min–1 • kg–1). Both absolute flow rates increased with gestational age, whereas normalized flow rates decreased. The percentage of umbilical blood flow passing through the ductus venosus in the control group was 43% + 9%. It was significantly increased in both intrauterine growth retardation (62% ± 8%) and in multifetal pregnancies (55% ± 12%). Peak velocity, minimum velocity, mean velocity, and pulsatility index in the ductus venosus were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: The increased ratio of ductus venosus blood flow to umbilical vein blood flow may indicate fetal strain. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:943-9.)

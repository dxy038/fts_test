The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to predict the hydrogen sulphide content of raw biogas produced during anaerobic mono-digestion of a bioenergy feedstock. Detailed chemical and biological analyses were made on 37 different feedstocks originating from urban wastewater treatment plants, farms, agri-food facilities and municipal wastes. Total sulphur content ranged from 1 to 29.6 mg S/kg of total solids, and 66% of the feedstocks analysed contained less than 5 mg S/kg of total solids. The biochemical methanogenic potential and biochemical biogas potential of each feedstock combined with its S content were used to predict appearance of H2S in the raw biogas. A model to link H2S in biogas with the carbon:sulphur ratio was established. Based on this model, a minimum carbon:sulphur ratio of 40 is required in feedstock to limit the concentration of hydrogen sulphide in raw biogas to less than 2% (volume/volume).

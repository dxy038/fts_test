This paper describes our experiences learnt from a research project called MeMVaTEx in developing embedded software for automotive electronics. The objective is to propose a model-based methodology satisfying automotive safety standards and helping engineers to model their system, enhancing the requirements validation and traceability. For that, we describe automotive systems an architecture description language EAST- ADL, and use two UML profiles: SysML for system modeling and MARTE for real-time aspects. The proposed methodology is applied on a case study to show its efficiency. We also discuss the limit and recommendation when delaying the methodology.

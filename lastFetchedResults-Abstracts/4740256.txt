Currently, a tremendous amount of human effort and time is spent for maintenance and calibration of operations of Transport Management &amp; Control Systems (TMCSs). TMCS maintenance and calibration is usually performed by experienced personnel in the lack of an automated and systematic approach with no guarantee that the overall maintenance procedure will end-up successfully. Severe congestion, delay and safety problems may occur during manually-based maintenance and calibration activities, which usually take from several months to few years until completed. AFT2 is aiming at replacing the manually-based TMCS maintenance and calibration by a fully-automated procedure applicable to general TMCSs. The approach of AFT2 is based on a recently introduced Adaptive Optimization (AO) methodology which was proven - using rigorous mathematical arguments - to provide with safe and reliable, efficient and rapid maintenance and calibration of general TMCSs. The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate AFT2 efficiency through its application - in simulation - to three different complex, large-scale road TMCSs.

Introduction:· Preeclampsia is the most common complication of pregnancies and one of the three major causes
of mate mal mortality. So diagnosis of disease and minimizing the complications on mother and newborn is very
important.
Objective: Determine the association between the ratio of random urine protein to creatinine and 24-hour urine
protein in women with suspected preeclapmsia who referred to Alzahra hospital.
Materials and Methods: Sixty women with suspected preeclampsia at>20 weeks of gestation were studied
prospectively. The ratio of protein to creatinine and 24-hour urine protein was obtained. Data were analyzed by
t-test, Pearson correlation and ROC curve.
Results: Thirty five percent of the studied population had significant proteinuria. There was a significant
moderate correlation between the ratio of protein to creatinine and 24-hour total protein (r=0.511, p-value«
0.0001). The area under the eurve was 82% (%95 CI, 0.72-0.93). The data suggest that a cut-off equal or more
than 0.22 has the most sensitivity. specifity. and predictive value.
Conclusion: According to the results, the ratio of random protein to creatinine was not moderately correlated
with the standard test of24-hour urine protein and can not be performed as the alternative method for diagnosis
of preeclampsia

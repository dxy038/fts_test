A new scheme is proposed for a multiuser system in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environment. It combines space-time block coding (STBC) with modified singular value decomposition (SVD) methods. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to enhance the performance of the multiuser system not only by using transmit diversity, but also by mitigating the effect of multiple access interference (MAI) with SVD. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

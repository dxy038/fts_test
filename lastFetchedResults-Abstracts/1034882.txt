Different welding techniques are used in this study to evaluate the mechanical performance of weldments of HY-80 steel. Weldments are prepared using different welding processes such as shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, and submerged metal arc. The objective is to determine the optimum welding method for the steel. After welding, the effects of welding methods on weld metal microstructure and mechanical properties including weld metal tensile strength and Charpy V-notch impact toughness over the temperature range −20 to 20 °C are investigated. Charpy impact and tensile tests are performed on standard notched specimens obtained from the welded and main sections of the material. The hardness distribution measurements on the differently welded specimens are conducted in order to gain a deep insight of different welding methods.

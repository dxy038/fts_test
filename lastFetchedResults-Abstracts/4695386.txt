With trends towards utilisation of millimetre wavelength1s, the m11etrology of reflector antennas via holographic-based techniques will be expensive, and perhaps unreliable, because of the requirement for a phase reference channel and the difficulty of achieving accurate phase measurements. An alternative measurement strategy, requiring only intensity, has recently gainied credability with the successful application of phase-retrieval algorithms (Anderson &amp; Sali [1]). In its most convenient form, phase-retrieval requires only a single intensity pattern (Gardenier [2], McCormack et al [3]) and the extention of this objective to planar near-field scanning is considered here.

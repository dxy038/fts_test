This work is aimed at looking into the flatness control of the crane detailing adopted mechanisms and approaches in order to be able to control this system and to solve problems encountered during its functioning. The control objective is the sway free transportation of the crane s load taking the commands of the crane operator into account. Based on the mathematical model linearizing and stabilizing control laws for the slewing and luffing motion are derived using the input/output linearization approach. The method allows for transportation of the payload to a selected point and ensures minimisation of its swings when the motion is finished. To achieve this goal a mathematical model of the control system of the displacement of the payload has been constructed. A theory of control which ensures swing free stop of the payload is presented. Selected results of numerical simulations are shown. At the end of this work, a comparative study between the real moving and the desired one has been presented.

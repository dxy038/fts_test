Background and Objective: Cognitive models state that cognitions are organized hierarchically, so that the underlying maladaptive schemas affect behavior via superficial cognitive processes. This study aimed to determinate the mediating role of dysfunctional cognition between early maladaptive schemas and obsessive compulsive disorder. 
Subjects and Methods: The subjects of this descriptive-cross-sectional research were 500 employees of Khuzestan steel company who were selected via multi-phases random sampling method. In this study the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R(, the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44 (OBQ-44), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), the Early Maladaptive Schemasâ€™ Questionnaire-Short Form (SQ-SF) and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire  (ATQ) were used. Data was analyzed by using Pearson correlation and structural equation modeling via SPSS19 and AMOS19.
Results: Results showed that the proposed model fit clinical sample extremely well. In this the model early maladaptive schemas and the dysfunctional cognition had significant direct effect on obsessive compulsive (P < 0.0001). Also, dysfunctional cognition mediated between early maladaptive schemas and obsessive compulsive significantly (CI=0.14-0.31).
Conclusion: Present study showed that early maladaptive schemas affect surface- level of cognitive processes. This study suggests that it is better to attend to early maladaptive schemas and dysfunctional cognition in treating obsessive compulsive disorder.

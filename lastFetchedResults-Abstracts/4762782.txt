Take the cantilever beam for example, Basic thought of reliability and roburt design are used to obtain the main dimension parameters of optimization reliability. The reliability sensitivity is added to the reliability-based optimization design model, combining reliability-based robust optimization design into multi-objective optimization question meeting reliability requirement, giving mathematical model of strength reliability-based robust optimization for cantilever structure which obey normal distributional parametric.

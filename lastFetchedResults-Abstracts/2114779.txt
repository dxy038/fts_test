Background: ?-thalassemia is the most common hereditary disease in Iran and more than 2 million carriers of the ?-thalassemia mutant gene are living in this country.
Objective: To determine pregnancy outcome of women with ?-thalassemia minor.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective, case-control study in two universities affiliated hospitals in Shiraz, all pregnancies occurred between 2006 and 2008 were included. Patients were divided in two groups regarding the presence of ?-thalassemia minor. Patients in case and control groups were matched according to maternal age, gestational age and number of previous pregnancies. Cesarean delivery, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor were recorded in each group and were compared using the ?2 or Fisher exact tests.  
Results: Overall 510 ?-thalassemia minor subjects and 512 healthy controls were studied. Cases with ?-thalassemia minor had significantly higher prevalence of oligohydramnios (p<0.001) and cesarean section delivery (p=0.001). There was no significant difference regarding Apgar score in 1st (p=0.65) and 5th minute (p=0.25), IUGR (p=0.073), gestational diabetes mellitus (DM) (p=0.443) and preeclampsia (p=0.116) between two study groups.     
Conclusion: ?-thalassemia minor does not significantly influence the pregnancy outcome in the negative way.

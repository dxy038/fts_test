
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the applications of carrot (Daucus carota) in traditional medicine is to treat stimulus and inflammation of digestive tract. Also an antispasmodic effect of this plant’s extract on uterus was proven but there was no research in relation with its effect on intestine movement. Therefore it was decided to investigate the effects of carrot aqueous extract on ileum contractions in male rats.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 male Wistar rats 200-300g were divided in 4 (potassium chloride (KCl), barium chloride (BaCl2), propranolol, naloxone) groups. After laparotomy, a piece of ileum (1.5cm) was excised and mounted in an organ bath (10ml) containing Tyrode’s solution under 1gr tension. After making contraction with KCl (60mM), BaCl2 (4mM) the effect of cumulative doses of carrot aqueous extract (0.1-0.8mg/ml) were assayed. Also new pieces of ileum were incubated with propranolol (1µM), naloxone (1µM) separately in propranolol and naloxone groups and after making contraction with KCl (60mM), the function of cumulative concentrations of the extracts in each group was recorded.
FINDINGS: Cumulative concentrations of the extract had antispasmodic function and cumulative concentration 0.8mg/ml decreased ileum contractions that induced by KCl 33.33±6.8 and BaCl2 41.4±10 dose-dependently (p < 0.001). Also incubation of tissues with propranolol and naloxone had no effect on spasmolytic process of this extract. 
CONCLUSION: The results show that the antispasmodic effect of carrot aqueous extract has done without involvement of beta adrenergic and opioid receptors and presumably this effect is due to interference with the function of calcium channels.

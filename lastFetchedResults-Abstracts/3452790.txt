The application of magnetostriction in the design of a hybrid, electromechanical/hydraulic high-performance linear (large force and stroke) and/or rotational (large moment and angle) actuator is considered. The design concept combines the high power density of actuation possible with magnetostriction (approaching 0.1 HP/cm/sup 3/ of the magnetostrictive material assuming 3 kHz excitation frequency) and the design flexibility of hydraulics. The objective of the research described was to validate the concept theoretically and to study alternatives and improvements. The system, as currently envisioned, offers very small packaging volume (approximately an order of magnitude smaller than conventional electromechanical systems), flexible packaging (relative location of the major system components is not critical), and easy control (precise control of actuation speed, quick reverse time, and inherent position lockup). The major technical problems associated with the design are outlined, and results of a computer simulation of a prototype actuator are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Simultaneous incorporated application of
Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) and Power
System Stabilizers (PSSs) in multi-machine power
systems under different loading conditions is presented in
this paper. As a search strategy, the Imperial Competitive
Algorithm (ICA) is used to find the parameters of optimal
controllers. For the purpose of enhancing system stability
performance the recommended objective function,
containing the speed deviations between generators, has
to be minimized. For comparison, the application of PSS
and TCSC exclusively and then together is tested. The
results indicate that simultaneous usage of incorporating
controllers based on bacterial swarm has damping
performance more robust than exclusive application of
optimized PSS controller based on ICA (ICAOPSS) and
optimized TCSC controller based on ICA (ICATCSC)
under different disturbances and in a wide range of
operating conditions. Furthermore, the results are
calculated with the Bacteria Foraging Optimization
Algorithm (BFOA) as well as Genetic Algorithm (GA),
which concludes the superiority of ICA over the other
methods to achieve a global optimal solution.

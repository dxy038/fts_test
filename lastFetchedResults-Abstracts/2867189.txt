E-services are those public services provided by government in the form of electronic delivery. Successfully implementing e-services brings huge benefits and opportunities for social and economic development. However, online services adoption is a complex multi-stage process in which contains a huge amount of risks and challenges. In order to overcome the barriers and fulfill the mission of electronic services, it is obviously necessary to address determinants that affect online services growth, not only from technical aspects but also from organizational and environmental perspectives. The objective of this research is to provide a more comprehensive outlook on critical determinants of e-services delivery at national level. The result of data analysis emphasizes the importance of management optimization, government leadership and regulatory environment to online services development; and implies that the different level of ICT infrastructure between countries is not statistically significant contributing to e-services delivery. The findings are useful for policy makers in developing e-government development strategy.

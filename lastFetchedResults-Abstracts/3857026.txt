In this note, the problem of decentralized model reference adaptive variable structure control for a class of perturbed large-scale systems with varying time-delay interconnections is investigated. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, an adaptive variable structure control strategy for solving the robust tracking problem without the knowledge of upper bound of perturbations is developed. The use of adaptive technique is to adapt the unknown upper bound of perturbations so that the objective of globally asymptotical stability is achieved. Once the system enters the sliding manifold, the dynamics of controlled systems are insensitive to matching perturbations. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.

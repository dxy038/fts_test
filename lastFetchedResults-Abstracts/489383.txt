BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vertigo is a common cause of consultation with a doctor and there is no specific cause in most of cases. There is some evidence that in some cases of benign positional vertigo there is hyperlipidemia coincident. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of hyperlipidemia in benign positional vertigo cases with symptoms of true vertigo.
METHODS: In a case-control study, frequency of hyperlipidemia in 136 cases of benign positional vertigo compared with a control group. Hyperlipidemia defined as triglyceride or cholesterol more than 200 mg per deciliter of serum. Data was analyzed by chi-square test and t-test. Odds ratio was calculated and p<0.05 was considered significant.
FINDINGS: From 136 patients with benign positional vertigo, 87 cases (64%) were female and 49 cases (36%) were male, respectively. Mean age of cases was 48.1 years and for control group was 49.4 years. Most of cases were between 41-60 years. There was hyperlipidemia in 70 cases (51.5%) with benign positional vertigo and in 22(16.2%) in the control group (OR=5.5, CI=3.1-9.7, p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the accompaniment of hyperlipidemia and benign positional vertigo has been agreed. According to their high rate, the assessment of serum lipids in every unknown case of vertigo is recommended. Treatment of hyperlipidemia will probably be effective in decreasing the frequency and severity of vertigo attacks.

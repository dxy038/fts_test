In order to reverse losses of lowland heathland substantial areas of former agricultural and forestry land are currently being targeted for restoration. In this study we assessed the success of heathland re-creation on 37 former arable, improved grassland and conifer plantation sites in southern England, UK. The similarity between the vegetation and seed banks of the re-creation sites and undisturbed heathland controls were examined in relation to former land use, soil properties and re-creation management. Former land use was found to be the most important determinant of re-creation success. On former arable, and to a lesser extent improved grassland, antecedent management had caused significant changes to seed bank and soil properties. As a result, regeneration of Calluna heath had been minimal, even on sites where appropriate management (e.g. cropping, addition of pH amendments) had been undertaken and heathland species introduced. In contrast, former plantation seed banks and soils were similar to heathland controls, and, as a result, rapid regeneration of Calluna heath had taken place. It was concluded that conifer removal provides the most practical and cost-effective means of re-creating Calluna heath on former heathland, although further research is required to assess the effect of litter removal and the rate at which heather seed banks decline following conversion to forestry. In contrast, re-creation on former agricultural sites will require effective management to reduce soil pH, fertility and the abundance of competitive species as well as the introduction of heathland propagules. Given limited resources a more realistic objective for these sites is likely to be reversion to an acid grassland or grass-heath.

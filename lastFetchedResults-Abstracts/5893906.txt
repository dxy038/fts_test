To make use of the availability of Controller Area Network (CAN) messages for the various new applications of car control, such as active safety, traffic efficiency and driver assistance, the objective of this paper is to build a firmware platform for communication between the CAN bus in vehicle and a host PC for car control. The firmware has two ports which are connected to the CAN bus so as to monitor the signal transferring in the CAN bus and send out the command CAN signal into the CAN bus. It also has a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface which exchanges data between the firmware (hereafter called main board) and a host PC. The main board is designed to be capable of supporting high speed CAN communication that the bit rate can be up to 1 Mbps.

This paper deals with a lightweight implementation of the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) protocol for the Contiki operating system, offering a standardized, open, web-service like architecture, as opposed to existing technologies which lack proper open architecture. To achieve our objective, our implementation is based on the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) and XMPP. Until recently IP was thought to be too complicated and power consuming, but with advances in chip integration and software implementation, it becomes a reality. Following the IPv6 standard as the basic underlying networking technology, we also embrace the application protocol XMPP which provides a push-based notification functionality that is especially appropriate for the event-driven paradigm of low power operating systems. XMPP offers functionalities such as short instant messaging, presence, publish-subscribe and also provides the authentication and encryption required for data protection. In this paper, we first introduce the benefits of XMPP for low power wireless sensor network nodes. We then introduce the Contiki operating system and present ??XMPP, our lightweight implementation of the XMPP protocol and its operation in the Contiki operating system. This architecture is light, flexible, highly functional and open, therefore it is particularly interesting for low power wireless sensor network nodes and other smart devices that will populate the Internet of Things.

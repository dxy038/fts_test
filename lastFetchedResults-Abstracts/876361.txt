In this paper it is shown that a relaxation defining the class of generalized d-V-type-I functions
leads to a new class of multi-objective problems which preserves the sufficient optimality and duality
results in the scalar non-differentiable case, and avoids the major difficulty of verifying that the
inequality holds for the same kernel function. The results obtained in this paper generalize and extend
the previously known results in this area.

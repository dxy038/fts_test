The problem of performance robustness, especially in the face of significant parametric uncertainty, has been increasingly recognized as a predominant issue of engineering significance in many design applications. Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is very effective for dealing with this class of problems even when there exist hard constraints on closed loop response. In this paper, SISO-QFT is viewed formally as a sensitivity constrained multi objective optimization problem which can be used to set up a constrained H<sup>&#194;&#191;</sup> minimization problem whose solution provides an initial guess at the QFT solution. In contrast to the more recent robust control methods where phase uncertainty information is often neglected, the direct use of parametric uncertainty and phase information in QFT results in a significant reduction in the cost of feedback. An example involving a standard problem is included for completeness.

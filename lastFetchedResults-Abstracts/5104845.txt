The objective is to implement multimedia communications on the existing Ethernet networks. The main problem with transmission of voice and video (synchronous data) on the Ethernet protocol is that Ethernet is a packet network protocol with unpredictable delays-which makes it difficult to send data at fixed intervals. The paper presents a method to transfer voice and video over Ethernet networks with reasonable quality

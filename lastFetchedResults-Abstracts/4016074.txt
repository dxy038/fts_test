Digital radio was launched in the London area in September 1995 with five transmitters working as a single frequency network, offering Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4, Radio 5 Live and additional experimental services. At the time of writing the BBC´s services cover London, Birmingham, Manchester and the interconnecting motorways.

This paper discusses the specifications and general structure of an electric circuit and motor drive solver on FPGA. The `Electric Hardware SolverÂ´ or eHS presented in this paper have the objective to facilitate the usage of high-fidelity FPGA solutions for Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation by avoiding the difficulties associated with the coding of such devices by simulation engineers.

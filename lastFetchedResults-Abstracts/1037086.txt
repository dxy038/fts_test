Stainless steel clad plate is widely used in petroleum, chemical and medicine industries due to its good corrosion resistance and high strength. But cracks are often formed in clad layer during the manufacture or service, which are often repaired by repair welding. In order to ensure the structure integrity, the effects of residual stress need to be considered. The objective of this paper is to estimate the residual stress and deformation in the repair weld of a stainless steel clad plate by finite element method. The effects of heat input and welding layer number on residual stresses and deformation have been studied. The results show that large residual stresses have been generated in the repair weld. The heat input and layer number have great effects on residual stress distribution. With the heat input and welding layer number increasing, the residual stresses are decreased. Using multiple-layer welding and higher heat input can be useful to decrease the residual stress, which provides a reference for optimizing the repair welding technology of this stainless steel clad plate.

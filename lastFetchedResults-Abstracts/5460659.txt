This paper studies the problem of designing robust H<sub>infin</sub> controllers for networked control systems with time delay, packet dropout and time-varying sampling period, which may receive control input during a sampling period. The problem of controller design for aforesaid NCSs is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem in terms of LMIs, and some methods can be used to deal with the multi-objective optimization problem. The simulation results have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed H<sub>infin</sub> controller design.

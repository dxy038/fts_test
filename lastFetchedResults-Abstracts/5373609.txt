A multi-objective Adaptive Cruise Controller of Hybrid Electric Vehicle (so called i-HEV-ACC) is proposed in this paper. It integrates both advantages of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and HEV, and it reaches comprehensive performances on traffic safety, fuel efficiency and ride comfort. According to the analysis of i-HEV-ACC, a hierarchical control structure with steady-state optimization and dynamic coordination is presented. Furthermore, on the basis of global longitudinal dynamics model, the control strategy of i-HEV-ACC which incorporates comprehensive performances has been developed by employing nonlinear model predictive control algorithm. Finally, the i-HEV-ACC forward simulation platform is established. Through system simulation and analysis, the results demonstrate that i-HEV-ACC can realize coordinated performances of traffic safety, fuel efficiency and ride comfort.

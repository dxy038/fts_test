High PM10 concentrations can cause human health problems, both related to short-term and long-term exposure to particles. In this work the impact of efficient PM10 control problems in Northern Italy is assessed by means of a two-stage methodology. In the first stage a multi-objective optimization approach is applied. The multi-objective problem defines two control objectives (the emission reduction costs and the air quality index) to be minimized varying the decision variables (precursor emission reductions). The solution of the multi-objective problem is the Pareto efficient PM10 control policies. In the second stage, the ExternE methodology is applied to estimate health impacts and external costs for the efficient emission reduction scenarios computed in the first stage. The methodology has been applied over Lombardia region, one of the most polluted areas in Europe.

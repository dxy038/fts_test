We demonstrated near-field recording with the combination of a GaN laser diode and a 1.5 NA objective lens. The realized linear bit density was less than 90 nm (corresponding to the areal recording density over 40 Gbit/in/sup 2/) regardless of using a small 1.0 mm-diameter super-hemispherical solid immersion lens (SIL). Further improvement of a near-field phase-change optical disk will enable a linear bit density of 80 nm or less. In this talk we shall also report the fabrication process of the plateau, and of the electrode on the SIL.

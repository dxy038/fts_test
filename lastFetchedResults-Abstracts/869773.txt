Previous research has shown that in some cases fuzzy regression may perform better than statistical regression. On the other hand, fuzzy regression has also been criticized because it does not allow all data points to influence the estimated parameters, it is sensitive to data outliers, and the prediction intervals become wider as more data are collected. Here, several multi-objective fuzzy regression (MOFR) techniques are developed to overcome these problems by enabling the decision maker to select a non-dominated solution based on the tradeoff between data outliers and prediction vagueness. It is shown that MOFR models provide superior results to existing fuzzy regression techniques; furthermore the existing fuzzy regression approaches and classical least-squares regression are specific cases of the MOFR framework. The methodology is illustrated with rainfall-runoff modeling examples; more specifically, fuzzy linear conceptual rainfall-runoff relationships, which are essential components of hydrologic system models, are analyzed here.

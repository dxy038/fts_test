The objective of our study is mindfulness is a practice of mind, a type of sustained attention, focused on every moment that goes by. Mindfulness, seen as a contemplative attention, allows us to use each moment like an opportunity to learn, to explore in detail the present, perceiving it with a better acuity than in case of an usual attention. The case is about a social phobia and an excessive consume of Extraveral (80 mg Valeriana, 20 mg Phenobarbital). The treatment was only based on psychotherapy, initially including cognitive-behavioral techniques and continuing with mindfulness tools. The cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in social phobias proved to be useful a long time ago, but practicing mindfulness after the therapy ends keep the obtained results and prevents the rebound. Mindfulness improves perception. The sustained mindfulness force is based on the effect it has on thoughts, state of mind and feelings. The practice of mindfulness every day, following the cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, strengthens the obtained results. Mindfulness is not a simple treatment technique; it is a way of living.

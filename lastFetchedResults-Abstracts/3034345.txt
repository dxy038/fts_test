The objective of this study was to develop a method of data integration involving intensity, hue, and saturation (IHS) enhancement using RADARSAT-1 Principal Component and Landsat7 ETM+ band 6 imagery. RADARSAT-1-PC2 image provides optimal topographic enhancement of the surface expression characterizing known kimberlite pipes in the Buffalo Head Hills, and complement associated thermal anomalies observed in the Landsat7 ETM+ band6. The IHS data fusion of RADARSAT-1-PC2 with Landsat7 ETM+ band 6L images resulted in a virtual image with 12.5 m resolution. Locations of some of the known kimberlite pipes were defined by the brighter absolute radiance response in band 6L compared to the host sedimentary rocks (Lower-Upper Cretaceous shales). Cross verification of the outlined thermal anomalies has been achieved using high-resolution aeromagnetic (HRAM) data.

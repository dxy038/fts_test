Cardiac adaptation to aerobic exercise training includes improved cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium handling. Our objective was to determine whether cytosolic calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and its downstream targets are modulated by exercise training. A six-week aerobic interval training program by treadmill running increased maximal oxygen uptake by 35% in adult mice, whereupon left ventricular cardiomyocyte function was studied and myocardial tissue samples were used for biochemical analysis. Cardiomyocytes from trained mice had enhanced contractility and faster relaxation rates, which coincided with larger amplitude and faster decay of the calcium transient, but not increased peak systolic calcium levels. These changes were associated with reduced phospholamban expression relative to sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and constitutively increased phosphorylation of phospholamban at the threonine 17, but not at the serine 16 site. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIδ phosphorylation was increased at threonine 287, indicating activation. To investigate the physiological role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIδ phosphorylation, this kinase was blocked specifically by autocamtide-2 related inhibitory peptide II. This maneuver completely abolished training-induced improvements of cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium handling and blunted, but did not completely abolish the training-induced increase in Ca2+ sensitivity. Also, inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II reduced the greater frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation that was observed after aerobic interval training. These observations indicate that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIδ contributes significantly to the functional adaptation of the cardiomyocyte to regular exercise training.

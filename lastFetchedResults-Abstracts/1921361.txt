Our objective was to evaluate the safety of percutaneous transfemoral catheterization performed by way of synthetic aortofemoral vascular grafts. Between 1994 and 2003, 123 catheterization procedures were performed using a synthetic aortofemoral graft (median graft age 2.5 years, range 4 days to 10.3 years), including 63 (51%) interventional and 60 (49%) diagnostic procedures. Adverse events related to vascular access occurred in 7 of 123 procedures (5.7%), including blood transfusion (4.1%), thrombotic occlusion (1.6%), transient limb ischemia (0.8%), and retroperitoneal hemorrhage (0.8%). No deaths, graft infections, or pseudoaneurysms occurred.

A multiple objective function for handling voltage deviations, production cost, losses, flows, and their combinations is developed. It is formulated using a quadratic model of power systems, and exploits a nonlinear optimization method which satisfies necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimum. The algorithm is based on the simplex-like algorithm which selects the constraints that are binding and the ones which are not. Critical contingencies causing overloads and voltage deviations are corrected. The capability of the method is demonstrated using several medium- and large-scale systems. The effects of various contingencies and their corrective measures are discussed. The method is flexible and general enough to assist dispatchers and operators for effective operation of power systems

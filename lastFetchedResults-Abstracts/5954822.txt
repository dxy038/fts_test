An optimization system which uses the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is presented for sizing second generation current conveyors (CCIIs). The proposed optimization system uses HSPICE as circuit evaluator and its usefulness is highlighted by sizing two CCIIs, which are optimized in voltage and current modes in three parameters: gain, bandwidth and offset, and including as constraint that all transistors are in saturation operation.

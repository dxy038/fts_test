In this paper, a new approach to NoC test scheduling based on bandwidth-sharing is presented. The test scheduling is performed under the objective of co-optimizing the wrapper area overhead and the resulting test application time using two complementary NoC wrappers. Experimental results showed that the area overhead can be optimized (to an extent) without compromising the test application time. Compared to other NoC scheduling approaches based on dedicated paths, our bandwidth sharing approach can reduce the test application time by up to 75.4%.

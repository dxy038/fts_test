Peer to peer (P2P) technology has dramatically transformed the landscape of the Internet traffic in recent years, which induces greatly attention and research on the deployment of P2P-based applications in heterogeneous networks. Indeed many obstacles still lie ahead. The main objective of this paper is to present a new method to deploy the most promising P2P technologies for heterogeneous networks based voice services. IMS, SIP and SOA are adopted in this work to ensure the possibility of heterogeneous communication and the scalable VoIP service in the heterogeneous environment. Because P2P VoIP traffic potentially suffers from performance issues like packet loss, delay, jitter, which greatly affect the quality of service (QoS), a QoS-aware scheme deployed on end-points is proposed in the paper. A flow diagram is presented to make clear of how the Qos-aware scheme operates. Finally, we set up a simple testbed to validate the proposed scheme.

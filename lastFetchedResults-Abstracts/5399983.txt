The main objective of this paper is to explore H.264/AVC operating in intraframe mode to compress a mixed image, i.e., composed of text, graphics, and pictures. Even though mixed contents (compound) documents usually require the use of multiple compressors, we apply a single compressor for both text and pictures. For that, distortion is taken into account differently between text and picture regions. The new approach deviate bits from pictorial regions to text in order to keep text edges sharp, i.e., change the H.264/AVC quantization parameter on a macroblock by macroblock basis. The reconstructed images have better text sharpness with the good PSNR rate.

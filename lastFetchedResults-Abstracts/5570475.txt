An application of PC-based discrete event simulation that contains multiple objectives is presented. Each objective is listed and a modeling technique for satisfying each objective is discussed and illustrated. The case presented is the design of a cellular manufacturing facility for the SSC (Superconducting Super Collider) particle accelerator. Specifically, an initial simulation of the final assembly of the dipole magnets is described. The quantity of magnets required, roughly 5000 during the construction of the SSC, and the coordination of cutting-edge processes make simulation an appropriate analysis tool. Satisfying all the objectives of this study required robust problem definition, software selection, progressive modeling with phased validation, and multiple perspectives with animation

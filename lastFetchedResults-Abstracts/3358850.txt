Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an emerging remote-sensing technology with potential to assist in mapping, monitoring, and assessment of forest resources. Despite a growing body of peer-reviewed literature documenting the filtering methods of LiDAR data, there seems to be little information about qualitative and quantitative assessment of filtering methods to select the most appropriate to create digital elevation models with the final objective of normalizing the point cloud in forestry applications. Furthermore, most algorithms are proprietary and have high purchase costs, while a few are openly available and supported by published results. This paper compares the accuracy of seven discrete return LiDAR filtering methods, implemented in nonproprietary tools and software in classification of the point clouds provided by the Spanish National Plan for Aerial Orthophotography (PNOA). Two test sites in moderate to steep slopes and various land cover types were selected. The classification accuracy of each algorithm was assessed using 424 points classified by hand and located in different terrain slopes, cover types, point cloud densities, and scan angles. MCC filter presented the best overall performance with an 83.3% of success rate and a Kappa index of 0.67. Compared to other filters, MCC and LAStools balanced quite well the error rates. Sprouted scrub with abandoned logs, stumps, and woody debris and terrain slopes over 15&#176; were the most problematic cover types in filtering. However, the influence of point density and scan-angle variables in filtering is lower, as morphological methods are less sensitive to them.

The feature selective validation (FSV) method has been proposed as a technique to allow the objective, quantified, comparison of data for inter alia validation of computational electromagnetics. In the companion paper "Feature selective validation for validation of computational electromagnetics. Part I-The FSV method," the method was outlined in some detail. This paper addresses two specific issues related to the implementation of the FSV method, namely "how well does it produce results that agree with visual assessment?" and "what benefit can it provide in a practical validation environment?" The first of these questions is addressed by comparing the FSV output to the results of an extensive survey of EMC engineers from several countries. The second is approached via a case study analysis

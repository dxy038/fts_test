We discuss the need for bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic microsimulation for evaluating vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in a simulation framework. As the selection of a mobility model influences the outcome of simulations to a great deal, the use of a representative model is necessary for producing meaningful evaluation results. Based on these observations, we present a hybrid simulation framework composed of the road traffic simulator SUMO and the network simulator OMNeT++. The coupled simulation environment is used for an evaluation of two protocols for incident warning in VANETs.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of Smad2 and Smad4 proteins, the downstream signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) superfamily, in the porcine ovary. Cellular localization of Smad2 and Smad4 proteins was examined using immunohistochemistry. The specificity of the antibodies was examined using Western blot assay. Western blot analyses demonstrated that 52 kDa Smad2 and 60 kDa Smad4 proteins were expressed in the porcine ovary. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Smad2 and Smad4 were widely expressed in the porcine ovary, mainly localized in the oocyte, granulosa and thecal cells at different stages of folliculogenesis. Within the primordial and primary follicles, Smad2 and Smad4 showed strong staining in oocytes and follicular cells. In the antral follicle, strong staining was observed in oocytes, granulosa and theca cells. These findings suggest that Smad2 and Smad4 may be a key regulator of follicular development and growth of oocytes in the porcine ovary.

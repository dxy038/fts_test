Background
This study was conducted to assess the effects of examination-induced stress on the technical performance of junior surgery residents.
Methods

Twelve first-year surgery residents completed 2 surgical tasks (skin excision, tracheotomy) in low- and high-stress condition (in-training examinationâ€”Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills [OSATS]). Residents rated their subjective stress levels on a 10-point Likert-like scale. Performances were videotaped and assessed by 3 blinded experts using checklist and global rating scales.
Results

Residents reported moderately higher stress levels in the exam condition than in the low-stress conditions (P < .05). Their performance was rated higher in the exam condition on the checklist scales (P < .05) but not on the global rating scales (P = .79).
Conclusions

Residency in-training exams induce moderate stress levels in junior surgery residents and are accompanied by improvements in technical performance as assessed by checklist-based scales. There were no differences on the global rating scales due to stress conditions, suggesting that residents were better at following the itemized sequence of movements when stressed, but their overall global performance was not altered.

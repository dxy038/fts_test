The objective of this study is to explore suitable spatial filters for inverse estimation of cortical equivalent dipole layer imaging from the scalp electroencephalogram. The effects of incorporating signal and noise covariance into inverse procedures were examined by computer simulations. The parametric projection filter (PPF) and parametric Wiener filter (PWF) were applied to an ideal 3D head model under various noise conditions. The present simulation results suggest that the PPF has better performance than the PWF, when the correlation between the signal and noise is low, and the PWF performs better than the PPF when the correlation is high.

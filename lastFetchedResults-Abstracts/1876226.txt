Objective
rpose of this study is to determine the impact of a home communication intervention (HCI) for ischemic heart failure Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) patients â‰¥ 65 years of age on self-efficacy, coronary artery disease risk factor modification and functioning posthospitalization.

omized clinical trial with repeated measures was used.

ample of ischemic heart failure CABG surgery patients (n = 35) was drawn from the parent study of 180 CABG patients.
s
rticipants (n = 18) had significantly higher adjusted mean self-efficacy scores [F(1, 29) = 6.40, P &lt; .05] and adjusted mean levels of functioning (physical, general health, mental, and vitality functioning) compared with the routine care group (n = 17), using repeated measures analysis of covariance with baseline scores as covariates. There were also significant effects of time on bodily pain and role emotional functioning. Significantly higher exercise adherence (t = 3.09, P &lt; .01) and lower reported stress (t = 3.77, P &lt; .01) at 3 months after surgery was reported by HCI subjects.
sions
rom this pilot study can be used to strengthen the HCI intervention with more tailored strategies for vulnerable subgroups of CABG patients.

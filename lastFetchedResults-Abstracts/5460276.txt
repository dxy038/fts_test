To solve the hierarchical topology optimization issue in overlay network for multicast service, this paper proposed a hybrid clustering model (HCGA) combining k-means method with genetic algorithm. The hybrid model formulated the related issue as a multiple-objective optimization, and then modeled it as a weighted clustering problem. HCGA made fully use of genetic algorithm for better clustering performance. Based on the optimal parameter experiments, the experiment results illustrated, compared with k-means, that the proposed model is effective in topology routing performance with the different topology configuration.

In this letter, a new multiple-input (MI) hybrid energy conversion topology is presented. The proposed topology is capable of energy diversification among different energy sources with different voltage-current characteristics while achieving low part number and bidirectional operational. Compared to the earlier MI buck-boost converter, the proposed topology provides positive output voltage without any additional transformer, is capable of bidirectional operation, and has the capability of operating in buck, boost, and buck-boost modes separately. A fixed-frequency switching strategy is considered, and analytical analyses, detailed device-level simulation, and experimental results are presented.

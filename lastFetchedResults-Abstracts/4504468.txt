Fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric power systems appear to be very promising in satisfying high energy and high power requirements for vehicular applications. The power and energy management of the hybrid system is very important for dynamic response under various load conditions. In this study, an FC and an energy storage system (ESS) supply power demand using a DC/DC boost power converter and a dual source bidirectional DC/DC converter, respectively. We focus on a novel fuzzy logic control algorithm integrated into the power conditioning unit (PCU) for FC/Battery/Ultracapacitor (UC) hybrid vehicular power systems. The control strategy is capable of managing power flow from FC system, battery and UC bank and keeps the DC bus voltage around its nominal value by supplying propulsion power and recuperating breaking energy. Simulation results obtained using MATLAB<sup>reg</sup> &amp; Simulink , SimPowerSystems<sup>reg</sup>, Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and ADVISOR<sup>reg</sup> are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

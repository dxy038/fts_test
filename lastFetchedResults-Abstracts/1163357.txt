Statistical estimation of G-renewal process parameters is an important estimation problem, which has been considered by many authors. We view this problem from the standpoint of a mathematically ill-posed, inverse problem (the solution is not unique and/or is sensitive to statistical error) and propose a regularization approach specifically suited to the G-renewal process. Regardless of the estimation method, the respective objective function usually involves parameters of the underlying life-time distribution and simultaneously the restoration parameter. In this paper, we propose to regularize the problem by decoupling the estimation of the aforementioned parameters. Using a simulation study, we show that the resulting estimation/extrapolation accuracy of the proposed method is considerably higher than that of the existing methods.

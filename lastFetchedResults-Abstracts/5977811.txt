Emerging multimedia applications have increased the need for video quality measurement. Motion is critical to this task, but is complicated owing to a variety of object movements and movement of the camera. Here, we categorize the various motion situations and deploy appropriate perceptual models to each category. We use these models to create a new approach to objective video quality assessment. Performance evaluation on the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) Video Quality Database shows competitive performance compared to the leading contemporary VQA algorithms.

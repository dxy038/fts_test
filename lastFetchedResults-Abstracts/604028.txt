Operating risk is one of the most important components of corporate governance and it is often called the first risk item, which must be detected and managed, properly. The primary objective of this paper is to determine important barriers in implementation of operating risk. The proposed study of this paper is implemented in one of Iranian banks located in province of Semnan, Iran. Cronbach alpha is calculated as 0.9043. The results of the study have indicated that lack of possibility of quantifying operating risk components, unfamiliarity of managers with various methods for measuring operating risk components, lack of sufficient rules and regulations, insufficient information, no regulation for monitoring the implementation of rules and regulations and underestimating importance of operating risk are considered as the most important barriers in operating risk implementation.

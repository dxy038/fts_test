Objectives: Writing papers can be used as a means to convey a
message. Knowledge transfer is also about conveying the right
message to the right target audience. The aim of this study was to
determine the proportion of articles that had mentioned a clear
message and the target audience in the abstract and the article as a
whole, and also to examine their association with different determinant
factors.
Methods: Articles published from 2001 to 2006 that were based
on clinical and health system research conducted on Iranian populations
and on maternal care, diabetes and tuberculosis were
searched systematically in domestic and international databases.
Eventually checklists (Additional file 1) were completed for 795
articles.
Results: Overall, 98.5% of articles had a clear message, whereas
12.5% had addressed the direct target audience. Presence of a clear
message in formatted abstracts were seen 3.6 times more (CI95%:
1.5-8.7) than in articles without formatted abstracts (p = 0.005).
Addressing of the direct target audience was seen twice as much in
health system research articles as compared to clinical studies,
odds ratio was 2.3 (CI95%: 1.47-3.48 ,p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Creating a format for journal abstracts seems to be
an effective intervention for presenting the message in articles.

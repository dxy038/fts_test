We present a novel approach to realize bidirectional/bipolar current-voltage characteristics for cross-point selector device application. These utilize the instability of Cu ions in filament state for switch elements. The conductive filament instability was controlled by the compliance current with which the filament was formed. For in-situ control of the device, a complementary atom switch concept was implemented. The proposed device presents another attractive selector among the field of bidirectional selectors with the unique attributes such as the extremely low leakage current and the exponentially increased conduction behavior.

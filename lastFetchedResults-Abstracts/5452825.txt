Often customer information services or virtual support guides make use of friendly interface to facilitate human-machine interaction. Indeed, virtual guided tours or helpdesks use a talking anthropomorphic head to communicate with the user. In this paper, we present a talking head for Smart phones, PDAs and, in general, all the mobile devices able to support J2ME and MIDP protocol. The objective of this article is to illustrate how to make such an interface as portable as possible by maximizing the limited computational resources of these devices.

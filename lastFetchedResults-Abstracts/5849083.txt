The main objective of this paper is to construct a distributed environment through which the contingency selection for voltage security analysis, line overloads and the reactive power limit violations of multi-area power systems can be monitored and controlled. A single-server/multi-client architecture has been proposed which enables the neighboring power systems to access the remote contingency server at any time, with their respective contingency data and can able to get the contingency ranking based on their performance indices. An RMI (remote method invocation) based distributed model has been developed in such a way that for every specific period of time, the remote contingency server obtains the system data simultaneously from the neighboring power systems which are the clients registered with it and the server sends back a contingency ranking list based on the performance index as response to the respective clients. Security assessment studies are carried out and preventive and corrective actions are dealt with to keep the system in secure state. The contingency server creates a new thread of control for every client request and hence complete distributed environment has been exploited.

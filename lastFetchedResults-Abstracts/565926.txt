Background and Objective: Although diabetic patients are recommended to increase their intake of fiber, there is evidence showing that these patients have a low fiber intake in Iran. The purpose of this qualitative research project was to investigate the benefits and barriers regarding consumption of high-fiber foods as perceived by type-2 diabetes patients.
Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, conducted in 2010, six focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with 55 type-2 diabetes patients 34 â€“70 years old. Data analysis was done using the Strauss and Corbin' s analytical method for  qualitative studies.  
Results: Perceived benefits of high-fiber food consumption included  better blood sugar control, improved gastro-intestinal function, and  prevention and control of some diseases. The main perceived barriers could be classified into 3 groups: personal (lack of awareness, lack of  interest, lack of sufficient time, cost, dental problems, false beliefs, fear of hyperglycemia, fatigue, and gastrointestinal problems); social (lack of awareness, lack of family support, and family pressure); and educational (insufficient education  and  insufficient service accessibilty).
Conclusion: The results reveal the benefits of, and the barriers to, high-fiber food consumption as seen by type-2 diabetes patients. These findings can be used in designing educational intervention programmes based on the transtheoretical model, aiming at changing nutritional behavior of these patients leading to increased  consumption of high-fiber foods.

Toroidal transformers are widely used in various low power applications such as switching circuits. Optimal design of these transformers involves solution of a series of nonlinear electromagnetic equations. In this paper, the application of fuzzy logic in the optimal design of toroidal transformers is discussed. The objective function could be cost, weight, power loss or any combination of them. To ensure the practicality of the final design, technologic and practical limitations such as minimum inner diameter of the core, wire gauges and standard core sizes are imposed in the optimization routine. The routine is run with the relationships and variables defined as a combination of fuzzy and exact sets

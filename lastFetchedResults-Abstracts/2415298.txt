 Objective
Homocystinuria is a neurometabolic diseases characterized by symptoms
include Neurodevelopmental delay, lens dislocation, long limbs and thrombosis.
Materials & Methods
The patients who were diagnosed as homocystinuria marfaniod habits, seizure
in the Neurology Department of Mofid Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Tehran, Iran
between 2004 and 2014 were included in our study. The disorder was confirmed
by clinical andneuroimaging findings along withneurometabolic and genetic
assessment fromreference laboratory in Germany. We assessed age, gender, past
medical history, developmental status, clinical manifestations, and neuroimaging
findings of 20 patients with homocystinuria.
Results
A total of 75% of patients were offspring from consanguineous marriages. A
total of 95% of patients had a history of developmental delay and 40% had
developmental regression. A total of 75% had seizures from these 45% showed
refractory seizures. Seizures among 13 patients werecontrolled with suitable
homocystinuria treatment. The patients with homocystinuriawere followed for
approximately 10 years and the follow-ups showed that the patients with an early
diagnosis and treatment had more favorable clinical responses for growth index,
controlled refractory seizures, neurodevelopmental status, and neuroimaging
findings. Neuroimaging findings include brain atrophy and/or white matter
involvement.
Conclusion
According to the results of this study, we suggest that early assessment and
detectionplayan important role in the prevention of disease progression and
clinical signs. Homocystinuria in patients with a positive family history,
developmental delays, or regression, refractory, or recurrent seizures should take
precedence over other causes

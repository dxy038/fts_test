Objective: My purpose was to explore the criteria of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (Technical Bulletin No. 163) for perinatal asphyxia to be linked to subsequent cerebral palsy.
Study design: Analysis of four cases of intrapartum fetal insults with subsequent cerebral palsy and a literature review are presented.
Results: All of the four cerebral palsy cases had sufficient intrapartum causes of cerebral palsy, yet none fulfilled The American College of Obstetricians and Gyneclogists' linkage criteria. Complications in the cerebral palsy cases were as follows: maternal intrapartum cardiac arrest, fetal skull fracture with brain infarct, intrapartum fetal stoke, and a newborn delivered after uterine rupture with only central nervous system defects. There are no well-done laboratory or clinical studies that unequivocally support the “criteria” that umbilical artery pH must be < 7.00 or the requirements of Apgar score < 3, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and multiple organ dysfunction. Apparent exceptions to these criteria occur.
Conclusions: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Technical Bulletin's criteria for cerebral palsy linkage and the role of parturition in cerebral palsy should be reevaluated. A rebirth of obstetric enthusiasm for cerebral palsy research, teaching, and treatment needs to occur.

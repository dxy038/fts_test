In order to effectively control the operation of linear compressor, a new control system based on bidirectional triode thyristor was proposed. According to the running requirement, the hardware and software of the control system were developed. The control system is mainly composed of a synchronous pulse circuit, a trigger pulse circuit, a display circuit, a protection circuit and a current detection unit. Some functions such as startup, shutdown and flow regulation can be well realized by the change of input power which is caused by changing control angles of bidirectional triode thyristor, while bidirectional triode thyristor is under the control of single chip micro controller. An experimental measurement system was established to research the performance of this control system. The voltage and current curves of a linear compressor were measured. The experimental results show that the piston stroke and clearance can be effectively measured and controlled by the present control system, which indicates that the control scheme is feasible.

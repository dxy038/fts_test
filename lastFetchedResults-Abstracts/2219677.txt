The objective of this work was to conduct a detailed assessment of the microstructure and mechanical properties of an emerging Al–Zn–Mg–Cu powder metallurgy (P/M) alloy known as Alumix 431D. A variety of techniques were considered including optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron-probe micro-analysis, thermal dilatometry, and differential scanning calorimetry as well as apparent hardness, tensile testing, and bending fatigue. Alumix 431D exhibited many of the same attributes found in wrought counter parts such as 7075. A sintered density of approximately 99% of theoretical was achieved, indicating that the alloy was highly responsive to sintering. Once heat treated, a T6 hardness of 86 HRB and a room temperature ultimate tensile strength of 448 MPa were noted. Thermal analyses implied that the precipitation behaviour of Alumix 431D closely mimicked comparable 7XXX series wrought alloys and was largely premised on the precipitation of η-phase variants. Tensile properties of the alloy in a T1 temper were found to be relatively stable at temperatures up to 150 °C and 1000 h of exposure time. Those of T6 specimens degraded under the same exposure conditions to the point where equivalency with the T1 product was noted.

The Earthquake Damage Analysis and Processing System based on RS and GIS (RSEDAPS) is practical software system developed specially for the post-earthquake emergency disaster monitoring and assessment during from 2006 to 2008. The system has been deployed in the National Earthquake Emergency Command Center, China Earthquake Administration and partially applied in the emergency response of 2008 Sichuan earthquake with magnitude 8.0 which causes a total of more than 86, 000 deaths and missing persons. The paper demonstrates the design objective, the system work modes, the system development and running environment, the system functions and the primary application in the emergency response of great Sichuan earthquake.

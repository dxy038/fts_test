This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach for dc-dc boost converters. A discrete-time switched nonlinear (hybrid) model of the converter is derived, which captures both the continuous and the discontinuous conduction mode. The controller synthesis is achieved by formulating an objective function that is to be minimized subject to the model dynamics. The proposed MPC strategy, utilized as a voltage-mode controller, achieves regulation of the output voltage to its reference, without requiring a subsequent current control loop. Furthermore, a state estimation scheme is implemented that addresses load uncertainties and model mismatches. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed control methodology, which include a fast transient response and a high degree of robustness.

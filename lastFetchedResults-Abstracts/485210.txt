Background and objective: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCaS) is the most common endocrine disorder
among reproductive-age women. There is very little information about the prevalence of pcas in [ran. With
regard to the symptoms of pcas which begin after menarche and regarding to its side effects on women's
health, we aimed to determine the prevalence of pcas in adolescents in Zanjan, [ran.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive community based study, 1882, 14-18 year old adolescents were
randomly selected from Zanjan schools. The presence of pcas was determined by the presence of
olygomenorea, hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia. For correlation between pcas and obesity, 8MI
and central obesity was evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using K' test.
Results: peas was present in 54(2.9%), hirsutism was present in 161 (8.6%), acne was present in 220
(11.7%), androgenic alopsia was present in 130(6.9%) and menstrual irregularity was present in 281 (16.9%)
ofthe cases. The prevalence of central obesity and over weight did not differ among the studied groups.
Conclusion: The prevalence of PCas in our study was similar to the results reported from other societies.
With regard to pcas side effects, we suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of pcas is better to be started
from adolescence.

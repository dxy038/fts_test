Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), due their inherent resource constraints and other limitations has prompted the researchers to device energy and bandwidth efficient transmission techniques and protocols. This objective has confronted scientists with the conflicting requirements of energy efficiency and latency. Most of the well known energy efficient protocols like ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) protocol and dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol although provide solution for the efficient utilization of the battery power of network nodes but on the other hand, end to end transmission delays are not catered properly. In this paper we proposed a novel cross layer approach to mitigate the latency issues inherently present in the AODV at the same time maintaining the efficient use of battery power. We used received Log-Likelihood ratios (LLR) at each node as the decisive parameter whether or not to participate in the transmission. Hence the nodes deciding against taking part in transmission save lot of energy. The proposed LLR based approach adapts itself according to the nature of traffic. If there is real time traffic, the nodes operate at high transmission power and in case of non real time traffic the transmission power is low. We have applied these modifications in the AODV and the resulting scenario has been simulated with the NS2. Simulation results proved that our scheme conforms to the standards of real time traffic as well as maintain the same energy efficiency.

In this work, quantification of the theories and models attributed to the NROM cell V<sub>t</sub> decay and the dominant charge loss mechanism dictating this phenomenon are discussed. The main objective is to determine whether the transport of the localized trapped charge is mainly lateral within the nitride layer or vertical back to the silicon substrate. Electrical characterizations and analytic modeling are employed for comparison of theories.

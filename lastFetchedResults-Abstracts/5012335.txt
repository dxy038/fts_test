The objective of this paper is to introduce a novel solution to reduce the projected high component count for large aperture phased arrays. NGSTÂ´s patent pending bidirectional amplifier topology is ideal for this application, due to its switchless operation. In addition, the size, weight, and cost of the transceiver module can be greatly reduced, since only a single amplifier is required. A GaAs based bi-directional amplifier is presented here in common-source configuration.

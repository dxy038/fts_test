We propose a multi-functional cylindrical tactile sensor with a single structure to test the magnitude and direction of the contact force imitating the human finger. This sensor consists of two coils and two media. A step-by-step method is used to realize the multi-functional sensing objective and in each step, different quantity is sensed. Based on the special structure of the sensor and the ingenious measuring methods, we realized to test more than one quantity with a single sensor. A detailed analysis of the step-by-step method to the sensor is made.

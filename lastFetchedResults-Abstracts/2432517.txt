The optimization of composite materials such as concrete deals with the problem of selecting the values of several variables which determine composition, compressive stress, workability and cost etc. This study presents multi-objective optimization (MOO) of high-strength concretes (HSCs). One of the main problems in the optimization of HSCs is to obtain mathematical equations that represents concrete characteristic in terms of its constitutions. In order to solve this problem, a two step approach is used in this study. In the first step, the prediction of HSCs parameters is performed by using regression analysis, neural networks and Gen Expression Programming (GEP). The output of the first step is the equations that can be used to predict HSCs properties (i.e. compressive stress, cost and workability). In order to derive these equations the data set which contains many different mix proportions of HSCs is gathered from the literature. In the second step, a MOO model is developed by making use of the equations developed in the first step. The resulting MOO model is solved by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA employs weighted and hierarchical method in order to handle multiple objectives. The performances of the prediction and optimization methods are also compared in the paper.

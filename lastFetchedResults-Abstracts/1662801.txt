This review summarizes and discusses the research carried out on the determination of antimony and its predominant chemical species in atmospheric aerosols. Environmental matrices such as airborne particulate matter, fly ash and volcanic ash present a number of complex analytical challenges as very sensitive analytical techniques and highly selective separation methodologies for speciation studies. Given the diversity of instrumental approaches and methodologies employed for the determination of antimony and its species in environmental matrices, the objective of this review is to briefly discuss the most relevant findings reported in the last years for this remarkable element and to identify the future needs and trends. The survey includes 92 references and covers principally the literature published over the last decade.

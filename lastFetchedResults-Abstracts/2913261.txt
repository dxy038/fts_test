MOVA is a control strategy using a new detector layout for isolated traffic signals (ie not co-ordinated with any other traffic signalled junctions). It is a self-optimising system designed to reduce delays and stops, and to maximise capacity during peak periods. The paper presents some of the results and experiences of the 20 site trial programme. The objective of the trial is to validate and verify the installation of MOVA add-on units into a variety of approved traffic signal controller types and junction layouts. The MOVA equipment has undergone an approval exercise with the Department of Transport, and will be approved for use as an add-on unit throughout Britain

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that activate the innate immune system. While it is clear that TLRs are important in the immune response against pathogens, they may also be exploited by some pathogens. Our objective is to determine whether feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection affects TLR expression or function thereby resulting in innate immune dysfunction. To this end, we cloned partial sequences for feline TLRs 1–3, 5–8, and developed real-time PCR assays to quantify feline TLRs 1–9. TLR expression was quantified in normal cat lymphoid tissues, purified lymphocyte subsets, and FIV-infected cell lines. Different expression patterns of TLRs were found in spleen, mesenteric lymph node, retropharyngeal lymph node, thymus, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, and lamina propria lymphocytes. B lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells all expressed TLRs 2–5, 7–9; however, the relative levels of expression varied among lymphocyte phenotypes. Infection of cell lines with FIV resulted in altered TLR expression levels that differed depending on cell type. These results demonstrate that tissue distribution of TLRs is associated with the immunological role of a particular tissue, that lymphocytes may also express these ‘innate immune’ receptors, and that FIV infection can alter TLR expression.

Objective
sue the suggested increased incidence of bipolar disorder by examining for a cohort effect in the proportional representation of Bipolar Disorder in two independent clinical samples of depressed patients.

ment of polarity status was undertaken with some consistency over defined collection periods in two independent samples.
s
fetime proportional rates of bipolar disorder declined with age from some 60% to 30% in both samples.
sions
rikingly similar age-related pattern in both samples and the linear trajectory support a cohort effect where the incidence of bipolar disorder may be increasing disproportionately in younger individuals.

In this study, we have conducted the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in two heterogeneous systems, i.e. conventional emulsion and miniemulsion, with identical reaction conditions. The main objective is to compare the living character in both systems according to the nucleation mechanism, the latex stability, the particle sizes and particle size distributions of latexes, the molecular weights and molecular weight distributions (or polydispersity index, PDI) of PMMA, and the kinetics of the RAFT polymerization. The RAFT agent used in both systems was 2-cyanoprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate (CPDB). The effects of an oil-soluble initiator 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and a water-soluble initiator kalium persulfate (KPS) on the RAFT/emulsion and RAFT/miniemulsion polymerizations were investigated. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Me-β-CD) was used as a solubilizer. The average molecular weights and molecular weight distributions (PDIs) of dried PMMA samples were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The experimental results showed that the RAFT/miniemulsion polymerization of MMA exhibited better living character than that of RAFT/emulsion polymerization under the conditions of our experiment. The PDI of PMMA in RAFT/miniemulsion polymerization was decreased with the addition of Me-β-CD. However, Me-β-CD did not have influence on the PDI of PMMA prepared in RAFT/emulsion polymerization.

This paper presents the distributed processing feature for Trade Wind, a cloud deployment and management solution. The main objective of this research is to evaluate performance and feasibility of this feature for big data applications. A prototype has been created and tested in the calculation of monthly average temperature and humidity based on data from a public data set. Preliminary results show great improvement in terms of time reduction, speedup, and efficiency.

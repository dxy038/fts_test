Acompetition is a unique way for groups in one research community to test theories and hardware in an objective manner. Although robot competitions have played a growing part in K-12 and undergraduate education, they have involved graduate students to a lesser degree. For focused topics with publishable research, a competition can be an effective way of engaging dozens of graduate students to form a community and culture and provide a base for the future of that research.

Objective
Murine erythroblasts infected with the anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVA cells) terminally differentiate to the reticulocyte stage after 48 hours of culture in vitro in response to erythropoietin (EPO). The objective of this study was to determine the possible role of proteasome-mediated proteolysis during the terminal differentiation of FVA cells.
Materials and Methods

The proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin were used to perturb the normal function of proteasomes during terminal differentiation. Effects of proteasome inhibitors on terminal differentiation were quantitated by evaluation of cellular morphology after benzidine staining and by Western blot analyses.
Results

Treatment of EPO-stimulated FVA cells with lactacystin or MG132 at later periods of culture increased accumulations of nuclear and cytosolic ubiquitinated proteins and decreased nuclear extrusion to less than 40% of controls.
Conclusion

Our results suggest that the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins plays an important role in the enucleation of mammalian erythroblasts.

It is shown that once the linearity of a channel sounder is established, its ability to resolve paths in the delay-Doppler domain is best described by the ambiguity function. The ambiguity function for the sounder employed in these measurements, together with preliminary channel sounding measurements in inner city Dublin at 1.808 GHz, are reported for the first time. Channel sounding measurement analysis techniques are then described in detail and are applied to the measured data. The K-S goodness-of-fit test is presented as a systematic method of analysing the statistics of the measured data and is shown to give an accurate and objective measure of the goodness-of-fit

An internal antenna handset with the sputter-deposited Ni/Ag/Ni hetero structure has been extended for the first time to the domain of wireless mobile propagation device. Efficiency distribution image for optimized at 870 MHz and 1990 MHz, total efficiency result are 47% and 55% in par field condition, respectively. From CST results the simulated current distribution densities are 98.8 A/m and 39.8 A/m at 870 MHz and 1990 MHz, respectively. Main objective of this research is characteristics comparison with VSWR and S<sub>11</sub> also include radiation pattern performance.

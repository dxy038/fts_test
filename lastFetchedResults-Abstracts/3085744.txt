Quality assessment plays a very important role in almost all aspects of multimedia signal processing such as acquisition, coding, display, processing etc. Several objective quality metrics have been proposed for images, but video quality assessment has received relatively little attention and most video quality metrics have been simple extension of metrics for images. In this paper, we propose a novel quality metric for video sequences that utilizes motion information in video sequences, which is the main difference in moving from images to video. This metric is capable of capturing temporal artifacts in video sequences in addition to spatial distortions. Results are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of our quality metric by comparing model performance against subjective scores on the database developed by the video quality experts group.

An application of the multi-objective H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control flexible spacecraft is presented in this paper. The design objectives are mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performances which are specified on different channels of the closed-loop system. In order to reduce conservatism, different Lyapunov functions are used. Based on observer structure, a controller is obtained by applying the method of Youla parameterization and LMI optimization. The validity of the approach is illustrated by designing a controller of flexible spacecraft.

A STUDY OF THE flow of electromagnetic energy in a typical, somewhat idealized 3-phase alternator is carried out on the basis of the electromagnetic field analysis with the objective of a better understanding of synchronous machines from an educational and analytical standpoint, and in the hope that it may be of value in design. This article constitutes a sequel to a previous similar study of d-c machines.<sup>1</sup> Relatively few authors have considered problems in electric machinery on this basis.<sup>2&#8211;4</sup>

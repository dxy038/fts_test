An approach based on dynamic programming is presented for the dispatch of direct load control (DLC). The objective is to coordinate DLC strategies with system unit commitment such that the system production cost is minimized. To achieve this goal, the DLC dispatch is first integrated into the unit commitment problem. An optimization technique based on dynamic programming is then developed to reach the optimal DLC dispatch strategy and system generation schedule. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, results from a sample study performed on the Taiwan power system are described

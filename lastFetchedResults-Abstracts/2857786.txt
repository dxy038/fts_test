The number of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments has grown in an unprecedented rate during the past few years. This expansion has led analysts and individual industrial companies to the prediction that a few tens of billions of devices will be deployed in the next decade in diverse industries such as automotive, utility, health, logistics and home automation. This growth in physical deployments and physical devices fuelled the development of cloud middleware for managing a large number of sensor data streams generated by the individual sensors. In this paper, we describe one such computational middleware, called IoT-Framework, built on open source components. The main objective of this framework is to disseminate the generated raw data streams as well as processed and fused streams to multiple interested parties. The IoT-Framework is using the RabbitMQ publish-subscribe system and the elasticsearch search and storage technology. In this paper we provide preliminary evaluation results on the performance of the combined operation of the two components.

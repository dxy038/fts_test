This paper addresses the problem of the determination of regions of stability for linear systems with amplitude and successive dynamics restricted actuator through anti-windup strategies. The objective by designing anti-windup gains is to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and the respect of the controlled output constraints for a region of admissible initial states as large as possible. Based on the modeling of the closed-loop system resulting from the controller plus the anti-windup loop as a linear system with a dead-zone and dynamics restricted nonlinearities, constructive stability conditions are formulated by using quadratic and Lure approach associated with the FinslerÂ´s lemma. Numerical procedures are discussed.

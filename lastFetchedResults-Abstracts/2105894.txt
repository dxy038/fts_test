Paratuberculosis or Johne's disease of livestock, which is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), has increased in prevalence and expanded in geographic and host ranges over about 100 years. The slow and progressive spread of MAP reflects its substantial adaptation to its hosts, the technical limitations of diagnosis, the lack of practical therapeutic approaches, the lack of a vaccine that prevents transmission and the complexity and difficulty of the on-farm control strategies needed to prevent infection. More recently evidence has accumulated for an association of MAP with Crohn's disease in humans, adding to the pressure on animal health authorities to take precautions by controlling paratuberculosis. Mycobacterial infections invoke complex immune responses but the essential determinants of virulence and pathogenesis are far from clear. In this review we compare the features of major diseases in humans and animals that are caused by the pathogenic mycobacteria M. ulcerans, M. avium subsp. avium, M. leprae, M. tuberculosis and MAP. We seek to answer key questions: are the common mycobacterial infections of humans and animals useful “models” for each other, or are the differences between them too great to enable meaningful extrapolation? To simplify this, the immunopathogenesis of mycobacterial infections will be defined at cellular, tissue, animal and population levels and the key events at each level will be discussed. Many pathogenic processes are similar between divergent mycobacterial diseases, and at variance between virulent and avirulent isolates of mycobacteria, suggesting that the research on the pathogenesis of one mycobacterial disease will be informative for the others.

To control the temperature and humidity in a room with a specific area, the traditional control method of air conditioning systems involves frequent starting and stopping of the compressor. Programmable logic controller (PLC) was applied to realize the fuzzy controlled air conditioning system. The keyboard is used to simulate temperature, the DIP Switch (DSW) is used to simulate humidity, and the stepping motor is used to simulate compressor. The feedback signal through PLC is transferred to computer for fuzzy control. Finally, the control signal from computer is transferred to PLC to control speed of stepping motor for simulating the operation of compressor. This system can change the speed for different loads as well as adjust the compressor at any time. With this system, the temperature and humidity provided by the air conditioning system remain at comfortable levels and reduce the air conditioning load to achieve the objective of energy savings.

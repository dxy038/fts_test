The conventional method for the scene imagination of non-existing buildings in an existing environment has been based on miniature scenes with physical study models. However, the lack of reality from miniature scenes has interfered with better scene imagination. The 3D representation and AR (Augmented Reality) representation can be considered as alternatives to address the limitation of the conventional method in scene imagination. However, their different features lead to two main issues: size difference and angular difference in orientation. The objective of this study is to address the question of an appropriate representation method that best supports the scene imagination. The experimental results showed that the AR representation was better than the 3D representation with respect to the accuracy of the scene imagination. Even though there may be still technical issues regarding time and task load to be addressed, the AR representation is a promising method for the scene imagination.

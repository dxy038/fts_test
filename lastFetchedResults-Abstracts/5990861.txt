Clock networks contribute a significant fraction of dynamic power and can be a limiting factor in high-performance CPUs and SoCs. The need for multi-objective optimization over a large parameter space and the increasing impact of process variation make clock network synthesis particularly challenging. In this work, we develop new modeling techniques and algorithms, as well as a methodology, for clock power optimization subject to tight skew constraints in the presence of process variations. Key contributions include a new time-budgeting step for clock-tree tuning, accurate optimizations that satisfy budgets, modeling and optimization of variational skew. Our implementation, Contango 2.0, outperforms the winners of the ISPD 2010 clock-network synthesis contest on 45nm benchmarks from Intel and IBM.

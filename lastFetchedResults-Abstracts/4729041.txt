CONTEXT - Global Software Development (GSD) is an emerging trend to perform software development activities across national boundaries. Despite of the benefits gained from GSD, there are certain challenges associated with it. Among these challenges one of the critical challenge, which has got very little attention amongst the software engineering research community and industrial practitioners, is the integration of software products and components developed by distributed teams located at different locations. OBJECTIVE - The objective of this project is to develop a Software Integration Model (SIM) that will assist vendors to appropriately address the challenges and factors associated with software/product integration in all three stages i.e. before, during and after the integration process in GSD for different sized projects and various products types. METHODOLOGY - During first phase of the project we will conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the challenges and factors mentioned above. SLR is different from ordinary review because it is unbiased and works on a predefined protocol. In second phase an empirical study with the industry practitioners will be conducted to identify practices and to validate findings of the SLR. Case study approach will be used for evaluation of the SIM. EXPECTED OUTCOME - The expected outcome of this project is to identify the challenges and factors associated with software integration process. These factors in the long run will lead us to develop SIM, as discussed in the objective section.

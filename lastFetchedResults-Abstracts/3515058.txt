Typical analog and radio frequency (RF) circuit sizing optimization problems are computationally hard and require the handling of several conflicting cost criteria. Many researchers have used sequential stochastic refinement methods to solve them, where the different cost criteria can either be combined into a single-objective function to find a unique solution, or they can be handled by multiobjective optimization methods to produce tradeoff solutions on the Pareto front. This paper presents a method for solving the problem by the former approach. We propose a systematic method for incorporating the tradeoff wisdom inspired by the circuit domain knowledge in the formulation of the composite cost function. Key issues have been identified and the problem has been divided into two parts: a) normalization of objective functions and b) assignment of weights to objectives in the cost function. A nonlinear, parameterized normalization strategy has been proposed and has been shown to be better than traditional linear normalization functions. Further, the designersÂ´ problem specific knowledge is assembled in the form of a partially ordered set, which is used to construct a hierarchical cost graph for the problem. The scalar cost function is calculated based on this graph. Adaptive mechanisms have been introduced to dynamically change the structure of the graph to improve the chances of reaching the near-optimal solution. A correlated double sampling offset-compensated switched capacitor analog integrator circuit and an RF low-noise amplifier in an industry-standard 0.18mum CMOS technology have been chosen for experimental study. Optimization results have been shown for both the traditional and the proposed methods. The results show significant improvement in both the chosen design problems

An approach for recovering the structure of a rigid scene composed of straight line segments and the pose of moving camera from multiple images under perspective projection is presented. Recovery is formulated as minimizing the total squared image distance between measured segments and the projection of the reconstructed infinite lines with respect to structural and motion parameters. An efficient algorithm for minimizing this nonlinear objective function is presented. The approach can be directly used for accurately locating correspondences in multieyed stereo, as well as for pose estimation from landmarks. Its effectiveness is demonstrated quantitatively through simulation and qualitatively with a real image sequence

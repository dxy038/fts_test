This concept represents an AC-to-AC conversion for voltage and current control scheme with instantaneous reactive power minimization also reduce the harmonics for high power applications in a distorted AC power supply. The strategy uses the commutation state of the converter in the subsequent sampling time according to an optimization algorithm given by a simple cost function and the discrete system model. Using this model, harmonics in the input current generated by the resonance of the input filter and output filter are strongly reduced. By using bidirectional converter will reduce the reactive power by connecting the capacitors at the both side of control unit.

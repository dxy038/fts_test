This paper describes an attempt to enable computers to generate truly novel conceptual designs of solid objects by using genetic algorithms (GAs). The current capabilities of the system are illustrated by the example of designing a table. Each individual table has its functionality specified by an explicit objective function, which is utilised by GAs to evolve candidate designs. These designs are represented using spatial partitions of `stretched cubesÂ´. The effect that varying the number of spatial partitions in each design has on evolution is investigated. Additionally, a method of producing symmetrical designs is explored

The objective of this paper is to examine causality and feedback relationships between primary commodity prices and US inflation. To this end, the bivariate noisy Mackey–Glass process recently developed by Kyrtsou and Labys [Evidence for chaotic dependence between US inflation and commodity prices, J. Macroecon. 28(1) (2006) 256–266] has been applied to assess this relationship. Results obtained support evidence in favour of causality, which can help to identify the influences of speculative price behaviour on inflation.

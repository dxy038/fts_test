Back ground and objective: During the 8 year Iraq-Iran war (1980-1988) chemical weapons were frequently used against Iran .The aim of this study was to determine some related factors besides a spirometry test that can predict and evaluate late pulmonary effects on persons exposed to mustard gas.
Method: In a cross sectional study of 500 mustard gas exposed persons, we measured spi-rometric parameters with an assessment of their relationship with related factors including respiratory symptoms and signs, age, number of exposure episodes, length of post first exposure time and use of protective mask at time of exposure.
Findings: Of 500 exposed persons with the mean age of (45.6Â±6.5y), 91.6 %( n= 458) had lung Symptoms, dyspnea 88.2% (n=441, productive cough 36.2 % (n=181 ), dry cough 29.4 % (n= 147), haemopthesis 18.6 % (n= 93), and 8.2 % (n=41) had positive findings of the following in physical examination: wheezing 6.6 % (n=33), ronchi 1.2 % (n=6), and crackles 0.4 % (n=2 ). In a spirometry test, 52.4 % (n=262) had a dysfunction. Of these, 27.2 %( n=136) showed obstructive pattern, and 25.2 % (n= 126) showed a restrictive pattern. Prevalence of mild lung restrictive was 94.44% (n= 119) and mild obstructive pat-tern was 36.03 % (n=49). For moderate lung restrictive pattern prevalence was 5.56 % (n=7 ) and moderate obstructive pattern was 33.09 % (n=45). For moderate to severe lung ob-structive pattern prevalence was 11.76 % (n= 16), and of severe lung obstructive pattern prevalence was 19.12% (n=26). Prevalence of dysfunction spirometry test increased with increasing the length of post first exposure time and no use of protective mask at the time of exposure. There wasn't any statistical significant relationship between respiratory symptoms and signs, the number of exposure episodes, and age with dysfunction spirometry test.
Conclusion: The most common type of dysfunction spirometry test is obstructive and then restrictive pattern in mustard gas exposed persons. The factors contributing to the increase of prevalence of dysfunction spirometry test include increasing the length of post first expo-sure time and no use of protective mask.

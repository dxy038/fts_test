The coaxial two-mirror telescope consists of two mirrors facing each other. Classical two-mirror arrangements are Gregorian and Cassegrain. These systems are usually applied to space telescopes and often have optical baffles to prevent stray light from entering the focal plane. The optical baffles consist of concentric rings suspended between the secondary and the primary mirror. The secondary baffle for a large two-mirror optical system is designed and analyzed in this paper. According to mission of a telescope, the structure should have high stiffness and high reliability and light weight. Compared with invar, aluminum alloy and titanium alloy, carbon fiber composite is currently the best material in terms of weight-to-strength ratio. It also has advantages of high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion. So carbon fiber composite is chosen as material to meet requirements of the coaxial telescope. In this paper, optimization method based on finite element analysis (FEA) is used for design the secondary baffle. Minimum weight of the baffle is chosen as an objective function. Thicknesses of former tube and vanes are chosen as variables. Analysis results show that the designed secondary baffle has maximum diameter of 180mm, total length of 120mm and weighs 142g. And its fundamental frequency reaches 651Hz. Therefore the baffle has many advantages, such as ultra-light weight, high stiffness and dimensional stability, etc. The optimization method and the baffle design can be helpful to other coaxial telescopes, such as Cassegrain, Gregorian and their subdivisions.

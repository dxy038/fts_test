More convincing evidence has proven the existence of a bidirectional relationship between neurons and astrocytes. Assume now that astrocytes, a new type of glial cells previously considered as passive cells of support, constitute a system of nonsynaptic transmission plays a major role in modulating the activity of neurons. In this context, we proposed to model the effect of these cells to develop a new type of artificial neural network operating on new mechanisms to improve the information processing and reduce learning time, very expensive in traditional networks. The obtained results indicate that the implementation of bio-inspired functions such as of astrocytes, improve very considerably learning speed. The developed model achieves learning up to twelve times faster than traditional artificial neural networks.

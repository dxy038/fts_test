In this paper the automatic diferentiation algorithms are used in the load flow analysis in power systems. This method is a computational tool based on the chain rule to obtain the instantaneous exact derived, besides the function value. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that using automatic differentiation the exact Jacobian is obtained. The method of Newton-Raphson will be used since it provides the exact calculate of the Jacobian, it will be observed that both are the same ones

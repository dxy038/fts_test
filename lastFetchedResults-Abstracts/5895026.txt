Automated image analysis of multiplexed brightfield immunohistochemistry assays is a challenging objective. One central task of the analysis is the robust identification of the different stains in the image, called stain unmixing. Stain unmixing strongly depends on the method of image acquisition. Currently available multispectral cameras enable color unmixing of single fields of view (FoV), selected by matter experts (e.g. pathologists). Beyond the individual FoV approach, there is an increasing need to process larger regions or whole histopathological sections (whole slide imaging; WSI). Rapid color deconvolution in WSI is a challenge that is only partially solved. We propose a method based on a multilayer perceptron to compute dye-specific stain layers for chromogenic red and brown labeling in WSI.

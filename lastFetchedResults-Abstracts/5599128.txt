We propose and describe our implementation of an automatic control system for the center wavelength of a fiber Bragg grating. The proposed system consists of a Fabry-Perot filter and cantilever structure controlled by a step motor interfacing computer. We considered the change of the center wavelength and the reflective spectrum shape for a given FBG according to the translation distance of the push stick and the cantilever thickness variation. The proposed system can control the center wavelength of a FBG with a resolution of 0.01 nm by applying compression or extension to the FBG. The proposed system has characteristics that keep the objective wavelength of the FBG with a variation of environmental conditions.

The paper embraces the principal facets of thermionic valve reliability. It begins by defining the various types of reliability requirements and then deals with the authorsÂ´ own work in designing and manufacturing &#194;&#191;trustworthy&#194;&#191; valves with the objective that they shall give trouble-free service under conditions of vibration and shock. It is stated that, although work was concentrated on only one form of reliability, it has proved to be a major contribution in dealing with other reliability applications. The results so far obtained are discussed. Emphasis is given to the importance of the contribution of other component makers and of close liaison between valve maker and circuit designer if maximum circuit reliability is to be obtained. In conclusion, the future trends are outlined.

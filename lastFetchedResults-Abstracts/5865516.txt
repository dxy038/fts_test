This Paper presents Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm to solve complex Economic Emission Load Dispatch (EELD) problems of thermal generators of power systems. Different emission substances like NOx, SOx are considered for case studies. Biogeography deals with the geographical distribution of biological organisms. Mathematical models of Biogeography describe how species migrate from one habitat to another, how species arise, and how species become extinct. Here, it is discussed how BBO can be used to solve EELD problems. This algorithm searches the global optimum mainly through two steps: Migration and Mutation. To show the performance of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm has been applied for solving multi-objective EELD problems in a 3 Generator system with NO<inf>X</inf> and SO<inf>X</inf> mission and in a 6 Generator system addressing both valve-point loading and NO<inf>X</inf> emission

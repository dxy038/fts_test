The authors study the static assignment to M parallel, exponential, heterogeneous servers. Blocked customers are lost, while the objective is to minimize the average number of blocked customers. The problem is formulated as a stochastic control problem with partial observation, and an equivalent full observation problem is formulated. Numerical experiments are conducted and the structure of the optimal policies is studied

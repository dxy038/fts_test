An accurate estimation of both rotor and stator resistances is usually required to achieve high performance control in induction machine drive systems. In this study, an output feedback predictive controller which is adaptive with respect to these parameters uncertainties is proposed. Such design attempts to a fully decoupling in speed and flux magnitude regulation, as soon as an estimation scheme has converged to the true parameters values. Two-stage of high gain observer are used to provide on-line estimation of the rotor and stator resistances as well as the rotor fluxes and load torque. Then, the instantaneous estimates are exploited in a state feedback predictive control law to generate a bounded decision variable that perform the admissible tracking objective. Benefits of the proposed algorithm are mainly emphasized in two titles. First that, unlike other adaptive observers, our estimator is not computationally expensive. The second feature consists in the ability of the controller to handle input constraints which allows to isolate peaking phenomenon from the system states. Simulation results shows that the proposed controller is suitable for high dynamics performance applications.

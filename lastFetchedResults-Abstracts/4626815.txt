Ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation of austenitic steel components or welded unions usually presents difficulty for small flaw detection, due to complex structure and wave scattering at grain boundaries. Ultrasonic signals from small flaws are masked by grain or structural noise whose frequency band partially overlaps the frequency response of the ultrasonic transducer. The main objective of this work is the application and performance analysis of a cycle-spinning undecimated wavelet transform processor for denoising ultrasonic traces acquired from a test block made of austenitic steel.

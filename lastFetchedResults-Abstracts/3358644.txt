When several maser waves having different frequencies are generated in the resonant cavity, the interactions between these waves will occur via the so-called coherence effect. The objective of this paper is to show that the basic features of all the computed waveforms are governed by the linear interaction between the two dominant frequencies that are formed in the resonant cavity. These frequencies arise because the resonant cavity is not well tuned. Other frequencies present in the cavity can be treated as a linear addition to the interaction between these two dominant frequencies. The line at 1.420 GHz is due to the atomic hydrogen maser action.

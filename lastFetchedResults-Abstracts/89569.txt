A dual half-bridge (DHB) bidirectional dc-dc converter is a new proposed topology that has the advantages of decreased number of devices, soft-switching implementation, low cost, and high efficiency. Typical applications of this converter are the auxiliary power supply in fuel cell vehicles and battery charging and discharging systems where the power density, cost, weight, and reliability are critical factors. A switching-frequency-dependent state-space averaged model of the converter is developed here for either direction of power flow. This averaged model can be used to derive the steady-state characteristics and small signal dynamics of the proposed topology. It also provides a fast simulation tool to investigate the transient response of the converter. The simulated waveforms of the mathematical model are compared with the detailed circuit simulation to verify the accuracy of the modeling.

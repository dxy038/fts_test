Mobile compatibility testing has been identified as one urgent and challenging issue. Mobile apps are expected to work on thousand kinds of mobile devices with diverse device features and mobile platforms. So mobile compatibility testing is complex and costly, it is impossible to test mobile apps on all mobile devices and in all environments with limited test resources. Then the question is how to select test devices in cost-effective mobile app compatibility testing. This paper proposes a novel test device selection approach using multi-objective genetic algorithm. Using the proposed approach, the minimum number of mobile devices is selected, and the multiple test coverage requirements are met simultaneously. Furthermore, the case study results have successfully demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective for mobile compatibility testing.

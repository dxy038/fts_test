The concepts developed through this report are based on the results of TRV studies carried out to define the main data of the new circuit breakers of the second switchyard of BrazilÂ´s Tucurui power plant. Tucurui is the largest Brazilian generating station. This power plant, located in the North of Brazil, with two power houses and two air-insulated switching substations, will generate, transform and transmit about 9 GVA. In order to reduce the short circuit level to a suitable value, it was decided to make use of a set of air-insulated series reactors connecting both switchyards at the level of 550 W. The objective of this paper is to show some flashes of the studies developed during the phase of specifications of the circuit breakers of these reactors

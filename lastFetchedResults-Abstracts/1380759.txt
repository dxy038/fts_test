Background and Aim: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common musculoskeletal condition. Women with patellofemoral pain syndrome would present significant weakness in many of hip muscle groups when compared with the healthy group. The objective of the present study was to compare the strength of hip abductor, extensor and external rotator muscle groups in sedentary women with bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome to a matched control group of sedentary women without patellofemoral pain syndrome. 
Materials and Methods: Twelve women with bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome as experimental group and other twelve matched women as control group participated in this study. Maximum isometric strength for three hip muscles including abductor, extensor and external rotator muscle groups was measured bilaterally in all subjects using a dynamometer fixed on a platform and finally averaged between two limbs and compared with the control group. 
Results: The hip abductor, extensor and external rotator muscle groups of experimental group were statistically weaker than that of the control group (p< 0.001). 
Conclusion:  It seems that lower limb muscles including hip muscles of women with patellofemoral pain syndrome become weaker due to disuse conditions.

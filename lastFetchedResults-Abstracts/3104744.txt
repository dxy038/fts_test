This paper presents a strategy of matrix converter driving three-phase brushless DC motor (BLDCM) with trapezoidal back electromotive force. The matrix converter is described as an equivalent circuit combining virtual rectifier stage and virtual inverter stage. Input current space vector modulation and 120deg conduction mode are employed in these two stages respectively. An important part of this paper is dedicated to the analysis and deduction of modulation scheme which was employed in these two stages. The transfer matrix for the nine bidirectional switched matrix converters can be obtained by synthesizing the two stages. Experiment results on a matrix converter prototype show the strategy proposed is valid.

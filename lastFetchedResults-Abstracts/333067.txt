The objective of this study was to determine whether nonenhancing pancreatic lesions are accurate in estimating pancreatic necrosis. Twenty-six consecutive abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations performed over a 3-year period that met the CT criteria for pancreatic necrosis were reviewed. Follow-up CTs in three of 26 patients demonstrated pancreatic enhancement, indicating viable parenchyma, within the previously nonenhancing regions. All three patients had undergone surgical debridement in that area. Twenty-three cases demonstrated either no change or enlargement of the nonenhancing pancreatic lesions. Follow-up ranged from 1 week to 26 months. While CT is accurate in diagnosing pancreatic necrosis, lack of enhancement in CT may occasionally overestimate the extent of necrosis. Nonenhancing, viable but at-risk tissue may be present adjacent to frankly necrotic tissue. Surgical debridement may facilitate recovery of this viable tissue, which may enhance normally on follow-up CT.

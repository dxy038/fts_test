Objective: This study was done to explore the relationship between components of metabolic syndrome and smoking.
Materials and Methods: In this analytical cross-sectional study in Ahvaz, south west of Iran, the gathering data sheet was completed. Body mass index, abdominal and waist circumference, Fasting Blood sugar, Triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Atherogenic index, predictor of myocardial infarction, and Brinkman index to investigate cumulative impact of cigarette smoking was calculated.
Results: Of the 944 participants, 16.1% were smokers. Among male participants, 24.8% and in female participants, 8.7% were smokers. There was no significant correlation between cigarette smoking and metabolic syndrome.  Systolic blood pressure, waist circumference and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in smokers. Comparison of Atherogenic index in participants with and without metabolic syndrome in smokers and non-smokers showed significant difference. In male participants, Atherogenic index was higher than female. Brinkman index showed no significant relationship with metabolic syndrome and its components.
Conclusion: Smoking does not show relationship with metabolic syndrome, but has a relationship with mean systolic blood pressure, serum triglyceride levels and waist circumference. Atherogenic index was higher in participants with metabolic syndrome, cigarette smoking and male gender. Brinkman index had no correlation with metabolic syndrome and its components.

The objective of this paper is to implement and control a modified magnetically coupled ´Cuk converter for the optimal charging of a battery. The paper shows how simple modifications in the bidirectional magnetically coupled ´Cuk converter results in a converter that exhibits a fifth order minimum phase behaviour for both buck and boost operation. With the use of a novel feedback clamped controller, the converter is tested for the optimal bidirectional battery charging applications. Steady-state and dynamic analysis of the derived converter is also described. Experimental and simulation results are presented to verify the proposed algorithm.

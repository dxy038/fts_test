The objective of this paper is to realize a UV sensor with an Al/TiO<sub>2</sub>/ITO structure and the high quality TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films were grown on ITO substrates prepared by sputtering and the sol-gel method at 300degC. The proposed UV device adopted metal semiconductor metal (MSM) light-dependent resistor has characteristics of varying film thickness, and high photo-electric and stability. The photo-electric measurements show that thin film thickness could remarkably influence the photo-electric properties of the TiO<sub>2</sub> electrodes. In the sputtering method, film is produced 300 nm with high quality crystal and strong photoelectric activity, showing the largest photo-current. With the sol-gel method, film is produced at 50 nm showing the largest photo-current. The UV photo response of sputtered TiO<sub>2</sub> film and sol-gel TiO<sub>2</sub> film were about 0.14 mAW<sup>-1</sup> and 0.06 mAW<sup>-1</sup> respectively. In this study, the crystal quality, optical and electrical properties of these high quality TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical absorption and I-V measurements.

Objective
The purpose of this study is to test the postulated immuno cross-reactivity between proteins derived from raw gutta percha (RGP), gutta percha point (GPP) and natural rubber latex (NRL).
Methods

Antigenicity and cross-reactivity of proteins were determined by the FITkit (FITBiotech, Finland) and ELISA inhibition assays.
Results

Antigenicity of proteins derived from RGP or GPP was not demonstrated. Except for NRL glove extracts, neither extracts from RGP or GPP were reactive in ELISA inhibition assay.
Significance

There is no immunologic cross-reactivity in vitro between proteins derived from RGP or GPP, and from NRL gloves. Thus, therapeutic use of GPP is unlikely to initiate adverse immuno-reactivity in individuals previously sensitized to NRL proteins.

This paper presents a method to estimate electrical parameters in a three-phase induction motor (MIT) equivalent circuit, using genetic algorithm (GA). This method is applied in a MATLAB&#174; Simulink environment. The methodology consist in minimize objective function to represent the estimated current error with GA. The stator current versus slip curve is a simulation result and it will be used to estimate electrical parameters of equivalent circuit. In this work two different theory MIT model are considered Chapman[1] and Wildi [2]. The goal is define the better current versus slip estimate curve for each model and to determine which one has the best motor simulate representation.

This paper presents the performance of a sliding mode based hybrid controller for three phase voltage source inverter. The main objective of this analysis is to observe the effectiveness of the controller for fault ride through (FRT) capability improvement of the DC based distributed generations (DG). The performance of the conventional PI based cascaded controller is also presented for comparison purpose.

The objective of this paper is to present a new &#8220;event-oriented&#8221; method of online load modeling for the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) microgrid based on synchrophasor data produced by phasor measurement units. Several load models and their parameter estimation methods are proposed. The online load modeling process is based on an adjustable sliding window applied to two different types of load step changes. The load modeling tests and related analysis of the synchrophasor data from the IIT microgrid are demonstrated.

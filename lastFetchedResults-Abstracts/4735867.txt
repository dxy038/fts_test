The inaccuracy of gas measurement data exists commonly in iron and steel corporations, which is adverse for production planning and enterprise economic accounting. A new gas data reconciliation model is proposed in this paper. The composition of gas users and features of gas production and consumption of an Iron and steel corporation are analyzed. Then, a prediction model is established to predict the amounts of gas production and consumption according to production plan. An objective function is built to minimized difference between gas measured values and predicted values. By solving the objective function, the optimum of rectification data is obtained. Using data reconciliation model, gross error of measurement data can also be detected. The result of experiment indicates that the presented model can regulate reasonablely the measurement data of gas and achieve the gas balance.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate and understand how ubiquitous computing framework is applied in next generation network (NGN) and what the major challenges which require looking into are. Due to converged network and standardization of more simplified protocols, now there are many deployments that are based on ubiquitous computing framework. However, there is not very much evidence to tackle complex events that are raised by very many devices in the framework in a uniform manner. The events that are raised by devices are not the same due to heterogeneous software and network system. Also, events that are generated could be ´reactive´ or ´proactive´; the, former is caused due to an action that causes an event to be triggered, for example software process failure, external change in the system state or just an informative message, latter ones need some sort of action required by the system to handle the futuristic reaction. The main challenge is to effectively handle both reactive and proactive events that are probabilistic in nature by looking into event context, timing and casualties. Also, the systems that are in use today in ubicomp framework mainly are custom made to meet specific domain. In this paper, a complex event processing framework for ubicomp by making use of industry standard protocols would be created. In order to demonstrate that such system is capable and required in ubiquitous computing framework in next generation network, a prototype middleware would be designed and developed which will be capable of handling various events and processes them proactively. This prototype model would be called a sPEPUS (Proactive Event Processing Using SIP).

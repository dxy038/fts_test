One of the key features of third generation cellular mobile systems, known as UMTS (universal mobile telecommunication system), is to further enhance UMTS network capacity, by means of macro, micro and pico cells. Simulations are performed to study the viable deployment of both UTRAN (UMTS terrestrial radio access network) modes, FDD (frequency division duplex) and TDD (time division duplex) in additional and diverse spectrum arrangements, considering the interference between them. In the 2500-2690 MHz band, we investigate the feasibility of future enhanced-UMTS FDD and TDD modes with MISO (multiple input single output) to carry digital broadcast services such as MBMS (multimedia broadcast multicast service) and provide to a number of existing operators in the actual band an asymmetric capacity extension, with no impact on existing frequency arrangements. The objective of this work is to choose suitable scenarios for each environment for enhanced-UMTS (FDD/TDD) to provide broadband broadcasting/multicasting services in a flexible, efficient and low cost manner.

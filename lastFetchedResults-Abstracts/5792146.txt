Occlusion of feature points or feature points leaving the field of view (FOV) of a camera, is a significant practical problem that can lead to degraded performance or instability of visual servo control and vision-based estimation algorithms. In this paper, a new daisy chaining method is combined with image geometry to reconstruct the Euclidean coordinates of feature points even if they leave the FOV or become occluded. By assuming one known Euclidean distance between two feature points is available, homographic relationships and image geometry are used to determine the Euclidean coordinates of feature points in the field of view. The daisy chaining method is then used to relate the position and orientation of a plane defined by the feature points to other feature point planes that are rigidly connected. Through these relationships, the Euclidean coordinates of the original feature points can be tracked even as they leave the FOV. This objective is motivated by the desire to track the Euclidean coordinates of feature points on one face of a satellite as it continually rotates.

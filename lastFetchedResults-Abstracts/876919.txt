The objective of this paper is to study systematically the dynamical properties of a ratio-dependent
predator–prey model with nonzero constant rate predator harvesting. It is shown that the model has at
most two equilibria in the first quadrant and can exhibit numerous kinds of bifurcation phenomena, including
the bifurcation of cusp type of codimension 2 (i.e., Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation), the subcritical and
supercritical Hopf bifurcations. These results reveal far richer dynamics compared to the model with no
harvesting and different dynamics compared to the model with nonzero constant rate prey harvesting in
[D. Xiao, L. Jennings, Bifurcations of a ratio-dependent predator–prey system with constant rate harvesting,
SIAM Appl. Math. 65 (2005) 737–753]. Biologically, it is shown that nonzero constant rate predator
harvesting can prevent mutual extinction as a possible outcome of the predator prey interaction, and remove
the singularity of the origin, which was regarded as “pathological behavior” for a ratio-dependent predator
prey model in [P. Yodzis, Predator–prey theory and management of multispecies fisheries, Ecological
Applications 4 (2004) 51–58].

In this paper, we present a generic model for automatic generation of basic multi-partite graphs obtained from input data that are collections of complex objects composed by a set or list of heterogeneous elements. This generic model is the formal basis of a tool for automatic graph generation that we have developed. This tool automatically generates the basic multi-partite graph that represents the arbitrary data provided as input. Our tool provides an interface for the user to specify the nodes and edges that are relevant for the application domain in each case. Those nodes are obtained from the complex input objects by the application of simple extraction rules. The objective of this paper is to present the model to represent basic multi-partite graphs and the tool supporting it.

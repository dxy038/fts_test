The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different phospholipid coatings on osteoblast responses in vitro. Commercially available phospholipids [phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyl-serine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)] were converted to their Ca–PL–PO4 and were coated on commercially pure titanium (Ti) grade 2 disks. Using uncoated Ti surfaces as controls, cell responses to phospholipid-coated surfaces were evaluated using the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) CRL-1486 human embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells (HEPM), an osteoblast precursor cell line, over a 14-day period. Total protein synthesis and alkaline phosphatase specific activity at 0, 7, and 14 days were measured. It was observed that Ti surfaces coated with PS exhibited enhanced protein synthesis and alkaline phosphatase specific activity compared to other phospholipids and uncoated surfaces. These results indicate the possible usefulness of PS-coated Ti surfaces for inducing enhanced bone formation and are very encouraging for bone and dental implantology.

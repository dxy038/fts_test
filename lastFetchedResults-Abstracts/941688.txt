A comparative study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with particulate matter (TSP) in the ambient air in
an urban area in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and in Osaka, Japan was carried out from 2005 to 2006. The objective of this study
was to investigate the environmental levels, emission sources, seasonal variations and health risk of eleven PAHs in the two cities,
especially Ho Chi Minh City where air pollution is becoming a serious concern. The results showed that the concentrations of TSP
and total PAHs were significantly higher in Ho Chi Minh City than levels in Osaka. The concentrations of 5- and 6-ring PAHs
(BeP, BbF, BkF, BaP, BghiP and InP) were much higher in TSP samples in Ho Chi Minh City than in Osaka, accounting for 82%
and 51% of total PAHs, respectively. These PAHs are known to be highly carcinogenic and mutagenic in humans. Vehicular
emission is suggested as one of the main pollution sources of PAHs in both cities. Motorcycles and gasoline automobiles are
suggested as the main emission sources of PAHs in Ho Chi Minh City, whereas diesel automobiles are the primary source in Osaka.
Seasonal variations of PAHs were observed in this study; higher concentrations of PAHs were found in the rainy season (May–
December) and lower concentrations corresponded to the dry season (February–April) in Ho Chi Minh City, while higher
concentrations of PAHs were observed in the winter (November–January) in Osaka. The number of sunshine hours was an
important meteorological factor affecting seasonal variations of PAHs in Ho Chi Minh City, while the temperature was a main
factor causing the variations of PAHs in Osaka. The high BaP equivalent concentration of 5- and 6-ring PAHs even in the ambient
air is an alarming signal for harmfulness to human health and environmental quality in Ho Chi Minh City.

The values of attributes are not always known with sufficient precision to justify the use of traditional databases to store these data. Fuzzy databases have been developed for purpose of managing fuzzy data. They are sophisticated but also complicated for smaller solutions. Our objective is to investigate managing (storing, updating and retrieving) fuzzy data in the traditional relational databases. Furthermore, fuzzy inference systems consist of fuzzy sets and rules. Therefore, we could store these parameters in the same relational database using the same procedures. Hence, the promising research topic could be the integration of information system capable to manage fuzzy data with a self-developed fuzzy inference system.

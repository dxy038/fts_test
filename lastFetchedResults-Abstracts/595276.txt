Objective: To determine the outcome of esophageal dilatation in caustic esophageal strictures in our patients Material and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in the department ofGastroenterology and Hepatology Hayatabad medical complex from 1999 to 2007. Patients with caustic esophageal strictures and above 03 years ofage were included. Patient with caustic stricture and fistulae or diverticulae, peptic stricture and malignant stricture were excluded. Patients were initially evaluated with barium swallow and meal. Consenting patient were asked to come in the morning after over night fasting. Guide wire was positioned across the strictures with the help ofthe endoscope (GIF-140/GIF-N130). SkvouryGilliard plastic dilators ofincreasing sizing were employed. Repeated sessions were performed fortnightly till a 15mm (45Fr) lumen size was achieved. Follow up session were arranged whenever dysphagia developed. Results: Out of20patients, 11 patients (55%) were more than 12years ofage. Mean age is 19.25 ranging from 3 years to 65 years. There were ten males (50%) and ten females (50%). Total dilatations were 442. Successful dilatation up to a lumen size of15mm could be achieved in twelve patients (60%). In six patients (30%) satisfactory dilatation could not be achieved and were referred for surgery. Two patients (10%) had perforation with an incidence rate of0.45%o. Conclusion: Caustic Stricture is more common in adolescent and adults in our population Endoscopic dilatation is modestly effective in achieving adequate dilatation and relieving dysphagia

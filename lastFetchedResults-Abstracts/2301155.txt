Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of different kinds of swallowing disorder and itâ€™s severity in patients after stroke.
Patients and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 91 consecutive stroke patients were screened by the Northwestern Dysphagia Patient Check Sheet (NDPCS) and the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS).
Results: Forty seven percent of those assessed demonstrated signs of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Mild dysphagia was seen in (10.98%) patients, moderate dysphagia was present in 14.28% and 22% patients had severe dysphagia.
Conclusions: Dysphagia is common after acute stroke and its presence can have serious consequences. These results emphasize the importance of assessment and management of swallowing function in stroke patients.

This paper discusses the factors influencing the overall structure and layout of the planning of land reclamation, proposes a multi-objective and multi-level comprehensive evaluation index system for the planning of land reclamation based on fuzzy thoughts, and then establishes a multi-objective decision-making model. The paper also uses concrete examples to illustrate the index system is rational and the decision-making model feasible, and thus hopefully serves as an approach and reference for the land reclamation projects with regard to initiation, plan designing and construction management.

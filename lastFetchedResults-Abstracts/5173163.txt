The objective of this study is to develop a novel design of electric bike. The authors used some engineering approach packages in this study to analyze kinetic and dynamics of the system. The newly developed suspension design of the E-bike will also be incorporated using ADAMS and BikeSim simulation into the design consideration of suspension. To improve the ride comfort and driving safety of the E-bike, an optimization problem is formulated based on the comfort and safety cost function. To obtain the optimal performance for the proposed suspension, evolution algorithms (EAs) are studied to obtain the optimal suspension parameters.

The objective of this paper is to present a model updating strategy of non-linear vibrating structures.
Because modal analysis is no longer helpful in non-linear structural dynamics, a special attention is
devoted to the features extracted from the proper orthogonal decomposition and one of its non-linear
generalizations based on auto-associative neural networks. The efficiency of the proposed procedure is
illustrated using simulated data from a three-dimensional portal frame

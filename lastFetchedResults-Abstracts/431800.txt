Background
Performing a Ross operation in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction is controversial. The objective in this retrospective study was to determine the outcome of 15 patients with aortic valve disease (11 had aortic insufficiency and 4 had aortic insufficiency and aortic stenosis) associated with reduced left ventricular function (ejection fraction < 40%) treated with a pulmonary autograft.
Methods
We identified 15 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction from 226 consecutive pulmonary autograft procedures done between age 18 and 50 years from 1986 to 2001. Patients had documented preoperative ejection fraction less than 40% and were in New York Heart Association class III or IV. Preoperative ejection fraction ranged from 18% to 37% (mean, 31% ± 6.5%). Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained preoperatively and at 1-week, 6-month, and 1- and 2-year intervals were reviewed. Records were evaluated for survival, clinical status, left ventricular function, and valve function.
Results
There were no operative deaths, late deaths, or reoperations. All patients had follow-up examinations within the past year and are clinically well (67% > 2 years follow-up). Ten of 15 patients (67%) had substantially improved ventricular function (> 20% increase). The average ejection fraction increased from 31% ± 7% preoperatively to 51% ± 11% at 2 years, and the increase is significant from 1 week on (p< 0.02). Average left ventricular mass index decreased by 41% at 6 months (n = 10; p = 0.009) and by 44% at 2 years (n = 9; p = 0.02). Mean Z values for left ventricular mass decreased from 7.6 to 3.6 after more than 2 years (p = 0.007).
Conclusions
The Ross operation is an appropriate option in adults age 50 or younger in the presence of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Neither operative mortality nor postoperative sequelae were identified in our subset of patients. Excellent survival and ventricular recovery are predicted.

A computer-aided design (CAD) method and associated architectures are proposed for linear controllers. The design method and architecture are based on recent results that parameterize all controllers that stabilize a given plant. With this architecture, the design of controllers is a convex programming problem that can be solved numerically. Constraints on the closed-loop system, such as asymptotic tracking, decoupling, limits on peak excursions of variables, step response, settling time, and overshoot, as well as frequency-domain inequalities, are readily incorporated in the design. The minimization objective is quite general, with LQG (linear quadratic Gaussian) <e1>H </e1><sub>&#8734;</sub> and new <e1>l</e1><sub>1</sub> types as special cases. The constraints and objective are specified in a control specification language which is natural for the control engineer, referring directly to step responses, noise powers, transfer functions, and so on

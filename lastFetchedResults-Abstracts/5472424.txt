It is proposed particularly that a self-turning fuel injection control system on integrating Neural Network and self-turning control. The system is suitable for the control of engine that gasoline is as fuel, and meets with the diversified the request of air-fuel ratio in different working condition. The system is also applicable to the control of engine that gasoline and methanol is compounded as fuel, and is flexible to specify the objective air-fuel ratio in meeting with the different mixture ratio of gasoline and methanol. It can achieve the request that the objective air-fuel ratio is arbitrary continuous to be specified in certain scope. The result of experiment indicates that the system has better self-applicability, robustness and speediness. Moreover, the system not only overcome the diversified error from manufacturing, wearing and parameter changing, but also structure is simple, memory is occupied less, on-line train time is short, computation speed is fast, learn capacity is strong and the object specified value of system is by zero error tracking.

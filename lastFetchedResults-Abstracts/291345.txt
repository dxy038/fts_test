Probiotic lactic acid strains are live micro-organisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts as part of food, confer a health benefit on the host. The scientific basis for the use of selected probiotic strains has only recently been firmly established, and appropriate and well-conducted experimental in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinical studies, are now beginning to be published, especially with regard to the effectiveness of probiotic strains in antagonizing pathogens. In particular, experimental data have allowed new insights into selected probiotic strains that express strain-specific probiotic properties and into the mechanism of action of these strains. The objective of this review is to analyse the in vitro or in vivo experimental studies in which the antimicrobial activity of selected Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains has been documented.

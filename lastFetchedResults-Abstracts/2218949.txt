Objective(s):Hyperglycemia worsens the neuronal death induced by cerebral ischemia. Previous studies demonstrated that diabetic hyperglycemia suppressed the expression of heat shock protein 70 and 60 (HSP70 and 60) in the liver. IgG antibody titres against heat shock protein 27 (anti HSP27) were measured to determine whether hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic brain damage by suppressing the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in the brain.
Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled study of traumatic brain injury ICU patients treated either by intensive insulin treatment (IIT) or by conventional glucose control (CGC) was conducted. Patients received at least 50% of their estimated daily energy requirements parenterally. Serum anti HSP27 antibody concentration was assessed at baseline, day 7 and day 14.
Results: Twenty-six out of 29 patients (n=13 in each group) completed the study. At baseline, there were no differences between the two groups. On day 14, there was a significant reduction in anti HSP27 titre concentration in the IIT compared to the GCG group (0.47±0.27 mg/dl vs 0.60±0.15 mg/dl, P=0.03).
Conclusion: In this study, intensive control of traumatic brain injury patients on parenteral nutrition reduced anti HSP27 titre, possibly suggesting a reduction in stress.

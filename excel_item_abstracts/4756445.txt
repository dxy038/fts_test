With regard to the basic characteristics of spatial information, the mutuality and integrated mode of Global Positioning System (GPS), geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) is presented in this paper. The requirement and feasibility of SIT integration are analyzed and the feasibility of integrating spatial information and mobile communication is discussed. Based on the analysis of necessity and feasibility of their integration the integrating mode and method including the integration of SIT with communication technology are studied. The key technologies of the system integration are discussed and the architecture of SIT integration is proposed. The application fields and prospect of spatial information integration are expatriated through the analysis of some typical cases.

The escalating popularity of multi-agent systems makes it one of the promising technologies that provide the environment for developing collaborative intelligent software systems. We have proposed the light weight and fault tolerant architecture for multi-agent systems. SAGE-Lite is a lightweight context aware multi-agent system which senses the capabilities of the light-weight devices and reacts accordingly. Agents existing on lightweight devices can communicate and provide services via Bluetooth and the communication with the server is done via WAP. The intelligence may be pretty minimal but often will include some degree of learning from past experience. This paper addresses the issues of wireless environment and gives the detailed design of lightweight architecture context-aware light-weight multi-agent system of SAGE-Lite and its evaluation. The main objective is to allow light weight agents to participate in flexible communicating environment. As the system is based on the latest FIPA specifications, agent uses the FIPA-ACL for communication and bit-efficient protocol for encoding and decoding of ACL message

Noise source identification and the transmission path modeling are important in practical applications, when several noise sources exist simultaneously. The possibility of using convolutive blind separation (CBS) method to separate bidirectional coupled noise sources over the same frequency band is investigated in this paper. The analysis begins with a discussion of traditional partial coherence method in separating unidirectional coupling noise sources and puts an emphasis on its ineffectiveness in separating the bidirectional coupling noise sources. Then the feasibility of adopting the CBS technique in the separation of the bidirectional coupled noise sources is investigated based on a simulation experiment with the measured signals of seawater pump and electromotor. The transmission paths are varied in this study to gauge the robustness in signal separation. It is found that the proposed CBS algorithm can separate the bidirectional coupled noise sources over the same frequency band well.

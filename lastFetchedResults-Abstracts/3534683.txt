For the objective and quantitative measurements of the subjective quality of TV pictlures impaired by multiple ghost images, a ´Perceived D U Ratio´ (PDUR) is proposed in this paper. It is defined as the power sum of the levels of individual ghost images(DU ratio), weighted by subjective effects due to r.f. phase (40 and delay (T). The ´PDUR´, in the sense of subjective equality of quality-degradation, agrees well with the DU ratio of a 5 ps positive single ghost image, in the case of the standard picture defined in this paper.

This paper a Multi-objective Firefly Algorithm (MOFA) is proposed for Environmental/ Economic Power Dispatch (EED) problem. Due to the environmental concerns that arise from the emissions produced via fossil-fueled electric power plants, the classical economic dispatch, which operates electric power systems so as to minimize only the total fuel cost, can no longer be considered alone. Actually, EED problem is the scheduling of generators which fulfill the load demand of the power plants using fossil fuel and also making combined production, in order for them to perform with minimum cost and emission. Therefore, by EED, emissions can be reduced by dispatch of power generation to minimize emissions. Which is affect on power generated, system loads, fuel cost and emission coefficients in real-world situations. The MOFA technique has been carried out on the IEEE 30- and 118-bus test system. This technique is compared with other techniques which reveals the superiority of the proposed approach and confirms its potential for solving other power systems problems.

Introduction & Objective: Zolpidem their therapeutic effects by acting on the central nervous system-mediated facilitation of GABAergic neurons in the performance of its functions. Zolpidem performance in the treatment of sleep disorders is similar Benzodiazepine drugs. This study aimed to survey of Effect of Zolpidem Medicine on Hepatic Enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) and weight in Male Mature wistar Rats.
Materials and Methods: In this research 50 male matured field rats from the wistar group with the weight of 200Â±10 grams have been participated in the experiment, witness and control groups. The experimental group was divided in 3 subgroups and the medicine was given to them through mouth for 21 days with the amount of 150, 300 and 450 mg / kg. 1 ml of distilled water was given to witness group, but the control group did not receive anything. At the end of 21 days blood sample was withdrawn from hearth ventral areas and density of the enzymes of ALP, AST and ALT were matured using ELIZA method and the commercial kits and the results were evaluated using ANOVA and Tukey test.
Results: The results from this experiment show that ALP, AST and ALT enzymes in the experiment group had a meaningful increase compare to control group (p < 0.05) and also there has been a meaningful reduction in the weight of the experimental group 3 (with the maximum medicine was given the amount of 450 ml/kg) compare to control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results obtained from this research show that Zolpidem medicine cause damages to the liver which is mainly due to production of alcohol and it also damages the hepatic plasmas and increase in enzymes of ALP, AST, ALT in the liver.

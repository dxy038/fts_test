The aim of test paper composing is to compose an optimization test paper that satisfies the parameters which the user inputs, so the test paper composing problem is a classical multi-objective linear programming problem. After analyzing the mathematical model of the test paper composing problem, this paper converted part of the restricting conditions of test paper composing problem to objective function, and introduced the ant colony algorithm to solve the problem. According to the character of test paper composing, we designed the corresponding structural map, fitness function and heuristic function, achieved a more satisfactory results using integer coding. Experiment results show that the algorithm can solve the test paper composing problem quickly, effectively and can fit the requirements of intelligent test paper generating strategy.

In this paper we study a utility based optimized cross-layer multiuser scheduling for real-time video transmission over HSDPA. The utility here refers to the packet utility which is defined as a function of the packet urgency and the packet importance. Transmitting the packets with greater utility values firstly in each TTI can provide a higher level of satisfaction (video quality) for the users. Thus, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the aggregate packet utility over all the users under the HSDPA physical layer constraints. By employing the dynamic programming method, an optimal packet scheduling strategy can be obtained. In view of its high complexity, we further develop a method of suboptimal solution, the greedy algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms can provide higher received video quality than the existing ones for video transmission over HSDPA.

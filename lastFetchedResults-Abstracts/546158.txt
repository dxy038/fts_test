In this article, rubber bumpers of Double - Wishbone suspension system have been modeled and analyzed. The
objective of the present work is to predict the performance of these products during deformation, represent an optimum
method to design, obtain stiffness characteristic curves and utilize the results in the automotive suspension dynamic
analysis. These parts are nonlinear and exhibit large deformation under loading. They have an important role to limit
the motion of wheels and absorb energy. In this study, nonlinear FE model using ABAQUS software was used to obtain
the bumper load - displacement curve. Then a laboratory test was done on the bumper to get this curve. The comparison
between numerical and experimental results shows a good adaptation. A less than 2 percent difference has been
observed between them. Thus, we can use this numerical method to simulate bumpers easily and accurately

Schistosomiasis japonica continues to remain a public health problem in the Philippines affecting 10 out of 16 regions with 6.7 million people at risk mostly farmers and fisher folks. Early efforts focused on snail control in the absence of an effective drug against the disease. Discovery of praziquantel shifted control focus from the expensive snail control to a more manageable one involving case detection and treatment. At present, the government's objective is to reduce morbidity by chemotherapy and supplemented with environmental sanitation, health education, and mollusciciding. In the past, external funds infused into government control programs helped a lot in bringing down prevalence rates of the disease in many highly endemic areas. The end of this foreign assistance has expectedly affected implementation of the programs bringing fears of a possible resurgence in many endemic areas. Such anxiety is also founded on the perennial problems of low disease awareness among people at risk, aggravated security problem, poverty and the negative effects of a devolved set-up in the health care delivery system. Experts suggest that the national health department should be more aggressive in dealing with the disease in terms of ensuring implementation and of continuously searching for better and more improved methods of control. Any new strategy should always consider the devolved set up of the health department.

The current Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager infrared (IR) channels experience a midnight effect that can result in erroneous instrument responsivity around satellite midnight. An empirical method named the Midnight Blackbody Calibration Correction (MBCC) was developed and implemented in the GOES Imager IR operational calibration, aiming to correct the midnight calibration errors. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the MBCC performance for the GOES-11/-12 Imager IR channels by examining the diurnal variation of the mean brightness temperature (Tb) bias with respect to reference instruments. Two well-calibrated hyperspectral radiometers on low Earth orbits (LEOs), the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder on the Aqua satellite and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on the Metop-A satellite, are used as the reference instruments in this study. However, as the timing of the collocated geostationary-LEO intercalibration data is related to the GOES scan angle, it is then necessary to assess the GOES scan angle calibration variations, which becomes the second objective of this study. Our results show that the applications and performance of the MBCC method varies greatly between the different channels and different times. While it is usually applied with high frequency for about 8 h around satellite midnight for the short-wave channels (Ch2), it may only be intensively used right after satellite midnight or even barely used for the other IR channels. The MBCC method, if applied with high frequency, can reduce the mean day/night calibration difference to less than 0.15 K in almost all the GOES IR channels studied in this paper except for Ch4 (10.7 &#956;m). The uncertainty of the nighttime GOES and IASI Tb difference for different scan angles is less than 0.1 K in each IR channel, indicating that there is no apparent systematic variation with the scan angle, and therefore, the estimated diurnal cycles of GOES Imag- r calibration is not prone to the systematic effects due to scan angle.

In this paper, performance of CO<sub>2</sub> Emission (CE) and Investment Value (IV) of a Wooden Detached House shape were studied for bi-objective optimization. Sapporo, Tokyo and Naha as Japanese three typical locations were considered. Feasible solutions of optimal Pareto curve illustrated that: shape with larger southern roof area and fully covered with PVS perform the best in IV than others, and pitche of roof in the given locations should be less than its ideal solar absorption case. To minimize CE, roof with larger pitch is needed.

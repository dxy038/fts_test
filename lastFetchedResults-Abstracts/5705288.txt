This paper deals with the investigation on the status quo of power supply and distribution of the low-voltage grid, this paper, through the investigation, clarify the objective causes of the earthing faults and intentions of the manual earthing (mainly neutral-point earthing), analyze the electric characteristics of two modes of earthing, point out the dangers of the earthing of the power grid, find out the fundamental causes of the failure of creepage protector for the residual current, unveil a huge shared geo-electric system consisted of many manual earthing and fault earthing, and probe into the possible consequences of the two modes of earthing that universally exist; in addition, the authors put forward a new thought that can guarantee the grid to be operated in the air and cleaned independently so as to supply power economically, safely, steadily and cleanly after releasing the manual earthing, monitoring system and fault earthing thereof.

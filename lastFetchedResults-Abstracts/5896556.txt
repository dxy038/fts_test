In this paper, we consider a Prize Colleting Vehicle Routing Problem (PCVRP). Prize collecting Vehicle Routing Problem is a Variant of Vehicle routing Problem. One of the major concerns of the Prize collecting Vehicle routing problem is that all customers need not to be visited compulsory, but prize must be collected from each customer visited and a penalty has to be paid for every unvisited customer. To guarantee good customer satisfaction, the demand of all visited customers should reach a pre specified value. The objective of this paper is minimization of total distance and total cost of schedule by maximizing the total prize collected by each customers. We have proposed a Hybrid edge recombination approach to solve the PCVRP. To avoid the bias we compare the result with other well know evolutionary algorithm. Computational result shows that the proposed methodology has the promising result.

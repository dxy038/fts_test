FIG World Aerobics Championship rapidly grows to be the worldÂ´s top event of competitive aerobics. Enthusiasms put into the event by nations trigger a crowded sports scene. And the World Championship results will be an objective reflection of aerobics development level of the participating countries. This paper fully considers the characteristics of aerobics competition, combines research methods of range analysis, variance and etc with the framework of two major themes of artistic level. Then, the paper calculates the finish coefficient of aerobics to support the computer application design of multi-group rating in aerobics completion. The empirical results generally show that the overall rating scale of referees in the Championship is consistent; and ratings of finish referee are better than artistic referee. Therefore, it is recommended to be widely used in competitions at all levels and of all kinds so as to make the ratings of aerobics referees more objectively and rationally.

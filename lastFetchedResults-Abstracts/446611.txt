Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initiation and utility of evaluating attending surgeons as educators by resident trainees. Additionally, we were interested in comparing resident measurements to attending self-perceptions.
Methods

A written evaluation form, (utilizing five-point ordinal scale assignments) queried respondents regarding the performance of surgical attendings in the operating room, and other clinical settings. A similar form was distributed to the faculty members, which they used to evaluate themselves. Mean scores were determined, as were comparisons between self-perception and resident assessments. Differences in scores with p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results

Thirty-six residents evaluated 23 attendings. Mean assignments by residents of performance in the operating room, other clinical settings, and overall scores for all faculty members as a group were 4.22 ± 0.04, 4.11 ± 0.03, and 4.16 ± 0.03, respectively, with a score of five, generally corresponding to a most favorable rating. When overall scores were analyzed, 10 attendings received scores that differed significantly from those received by their peers, with half of subjects above, and the other half being below the 95% confidence interval. Eighteen (78%) of attendings completed the self-evaluation forms, and of these, 11 (61%) had self-perceptions that differed significantly from overall scores as reported by the residents.
Conclusions

Our evaluation process delineated significant differences among attending faculty members and identified individual strengths and weaknesses. Many educators’ self-perceptions differed significantly from resident assessments, and attendings who did not evaluate themselves scored lower than their peers.

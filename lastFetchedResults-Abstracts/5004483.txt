Cloud Computing promises to deliver on an objective that building on compute and storage virtualization technologies, consumers are able to rent infrastructure "in the Cloud" as needed, deploy applications and store data, and access them via Web protocols on a pay-per-use basis. For application and data deployment in cloud, high availability and service level agreement must be satisfied. To leverage the performance and the number of concurrent access of application and data, dynamic application deployment and data replication are usually employed. The consistence of multiple data replicas is discussed in this paper and lazy update approaches are used to separate the process of data replication and data access in cloud computing, which improves throughput of the data access and reduces response time. Initial experiments show the methods are efficient and effective.

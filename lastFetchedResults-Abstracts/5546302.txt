Appropriate mobile technologies have brought a new life for digital learning and have realized the concept of learning everywhere at any time more efficiently and actively. Ubiquitous learning is different from mobile computing in its ability to usefully adapt the services or information provided. However, current applications of ubiquitous learning are focused on a single environment or field which will face certain learning problems from different disciplines under the same field. The objective of this study is to design a U-learning platform based on service-oriented architecture and utilize the concept of process and web service composition for the U-learning environment integration. This is to solve the problems and increase the extensibility, flexibility and agility of learning process. A learning domain and context-aware ontology model is also proposed. In addition, learning functionalities presented and accessed with service components shall help in cross-discipline and cross-field learning as well as reusing the learning resources.

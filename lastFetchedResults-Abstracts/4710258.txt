In order to damp the resonance and realize system efficiency control for the three-phase grid connected LCL inverter system, in this paper a novel model predictive controller (Discrete Current Model Predictive Controller) DCMPC is introduced. System performance such as output current tracking and switching action can be included in the objective function of the controller while the latter is critical for system efficiency. At the same time, an on-line algorithm based on branch and bound is given. Finally, the effectiveness of DCMPC is verified through simulation and experiment.

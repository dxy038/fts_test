The purpose of this study was to review a series of distal biceps tendon ruptures treated with a 2-incision mini-open repair. The procedure is performed through a transverse incision in the antecubital fossa of 2 cm or less and a 3-cm posterior incision. It requires minimal soft-tissue dissection and uses a combined incision length that is typically less than a single anterior incision. The described technique was used to repair distal biceps tendon ruptures in 33 men. Patients were started on an immediate active range-of-motion protocol. Subjective and objective data were obtained on follow-up examination. All patients were satisfied with the surgical outcome. Heterotopic ossification developed in 1 patient, which was functionally insignificant. This technique is an effective method of repair of distal biceps tendon rupture that can be performed safely, with minimal surgical dissection, and appealing cosmesis.

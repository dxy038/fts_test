A new method is described to treat slide lines in cell-centered lagrangian schemes for the modeling of sliding problems between two fluids in the framework of compressible hydrodynamics. The method is an extension of the one proposed in Clair et al. (2013) [1] and is conservative in momentum and total energy. We illustrate our method, which is based on the minimization of an objective function over a specific set that models the sliding constraint, by several basic problems.

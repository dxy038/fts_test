Sub-healthy state is a status between health and illness. The causes of the sub-healthy states are complicated, often with all kinds of symptom features. There are few special treatments and objective evaluation criteria of sub-healthy states in modern medicine science, comparing with which the traditional Chinese medicine has some special advantages in sub-healthy diagnosis. Taking the sub-healthy research of college students as the base platform and based on the inspection and palpation of TCM, we build the decision tree(DT) and analyze the sub-healthy states by combining the decision tree generating principles in data mining with foreknow knowledge in TCM.

This article deals with two significant aspects related to synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR-I) of relevant theoretical and applicative interest. The first objective regards the analysis of the most-used SAR-I approaches under the unified mathematical framework provided by the Porter-Bojarski integral equation. The second objective is to provide an updated overview on how SAR-I research is generalizing previous algorithms to deal with unconventional scenarios.

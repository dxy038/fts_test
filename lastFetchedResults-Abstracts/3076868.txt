The main objective of this paper is to present an innovative equipment for practical teaching in control engineering, paying special attention to its conceptualisation and its possibilities for the theoretical-practical training. The role of the control and automation issues applied to this prototype is discussed. A distributed control system (DCS) applied to this prototype and its possibilities will be introduced

Development of soil and water resources through flood spreading systems is one of the accepted methods in water resources engineering and management. At the time being, 35 flood spreading stations constructed in Iran, and covers about thousands villages and a million hectares of the flood area. Expenditure of the operation and maintenance of such a modern systems is a main constraint for the gov¬ernmental management agencies. Hence, dissemination of this modern system is restricted among local communities. Evaluation of these systems is the main objective of this explanatory research in Kashmar flood spreading station. The necessary data and information were collected and achieved by reviewing the secondary data, field survey and conducting workshops through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), Rapid Appraisal (RA) and Participatory Diagnoses (PD). The results of this research showed that within 8 years of operation of this system, only 5% of the project area were covered by flood and the rest of spread¬ing area remained unused. Therefore, as an economic aspect, it can be said, although the B/C is more than 1.14, the construction of such a huge system is not accepted. The benefit of groundwater recharges (more than 5 billion Rials over 8 years period) is too high in comparison to others outputs (lese than 0.4 billion Rials). These results show if we focus on limited objective (groundwater recharges only), it could be a solu¬tion for reduction of mentioned constraints.

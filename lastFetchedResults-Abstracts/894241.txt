Background and Objective: The 360-degree evaluation is a method which is used to assess performance of medical students. It is important for instruments such as questionnaires for 360-degree assessment to be reliable and valid. This study has been designed with the objective to assess validity and reliability of 360-degree questionnaires.
Materials and Methods: At first, some questionnaires were developed based on an extensive literature review and expert panel views. Then they were distributed among a sample of faculty members, medical students, nurses, and patients. The collected data was analyzed with spss15 soft ware.  Mean scores of the respondents in each category were calculated. Cronbachâ€™s alpha was run to examine the internal consistency. Factor analysis was used to clarify the factorial structure of the data. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was computed to examine the correlation between the evaluators' scores.
Results: The instruments' content and face validity were acceptable. Factor analysis confirmed the factor structure of the questionnaires. However, no significant correlation was found between the questionnaires.
Conclusion: Based on this study, 360-degree assessment tools are reliable and valid measures for evaluating performance of medical student.

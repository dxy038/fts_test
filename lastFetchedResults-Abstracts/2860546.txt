Non-iterative co-simulation is a prerequisite for the time correct coupling of distributed solved numerical problems. For this coupling approach typically signal-based extrapolation schemes are used to resolve existing bidirectional dependencies between the interacting subsystems. Nevertheless, the introduced coupling errors influence the entire system behavior. In the case of coupled real-time systems inherent time-delays and noisy measurements lead to significant additional distortions. Thus, to avoid a deteriorating dynamic behavior of coupled systems - which can even lead to instability - new coupling approaches are mandatory. A model-based extrapolation scheme is motivated to realize a compensation of the occurring round-trip-times and noise-handling. Besides the description of the fundamentals a representative example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed coupling approach.

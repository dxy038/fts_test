Traditionally, the problem of hospital pharmacy management of inventories has been paid little attention. This problem is treated in this paper as a work-in-progress. The main objective is to estimate the demand of stock in different services of the hospital pharmacy, obtaining a reliable method for future planning and management. A better demand estimation implies a better management and therefore, significant savings in inventory costs. Some methods will be described an applied to series of data from the Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia (Co&#769;rdoba). The results will be compared in order to establish the best strategy to implement.

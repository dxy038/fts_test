A microcomputer program is presented that gives information when insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients need to make decisions regarding the insulin regimen in intensified conventional insulin therapy in conjunction with self-monitoring of blood glucose. This information consists of the optimum insulin dose and timing of its administration that these IDDM patients need. Estimates were made by a statistical approach based on the impulse response of blood glucose to a bolus injection of insulin (insulin sensitivity) calculated from blood glucose profiles, which consisted of nine daily blood glucose level measurements. This information is objective because it is mathematically substantiated, and useful because it can be obtained from insulin sensitivity.

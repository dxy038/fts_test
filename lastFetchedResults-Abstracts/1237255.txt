
   The objective of this study was to examine the effect of Paulownia particles addition and pressing time on the surface quality of particleboard made. In this regard, Paulownia chips and industrial chips were used in surface and core layers, respectively. Urea-formaldehyde resin was applied at 12% for surface layer and 8% for core layer. Variables include Paulownia chips charges at 3 levels of 10, 20 and 30 percent and 2 pressing time (6 and 8 minutes). To evaluate surface roughness of the samples a completely randomized design was used and 8 roughness parameters include average roughness (Ra), maximum roughness (Rmax), average bumps and troughs (Rz), maximum vale depth under the average (Rv), maximum peak on the average line (Rp), Abbott group parameters included Rk, Rpk, Rvk, were measured according to ISO4287 standard using roughness measuring device available in Grogan university of agricultural sciences and natural resources. Surface quality of the particleboard improved as the pressing time (6 to 8 minutes) and the Paulownia chips charges (10 to 30 percent) increased.

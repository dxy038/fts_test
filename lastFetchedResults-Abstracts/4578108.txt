This paper is about designing a reliable actuator of a high-density und high-speed optical disk drive. The higher density the disk has and the faster spinning speed the disk drive has. the more power to its coils the actuator needs because the actuator is required to cope with higher servo bandwidth. This may cause a reliability problem by conducting excessive heat to its objective lens. In this study, the factors affecting on the temperature of the lens were found through numerical simulations and experiments. Design modification and amelioration has been successfully applied under design constraints

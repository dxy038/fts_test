Additional operating costs taken place due to the variability of wind power in comparison with conventional means of power generation. Forecast and market design play an important role when integrating wind power because they determine additional reserve capacity and any other imbalances. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to analyse the management of wind power variability in the operation of the balancing market.

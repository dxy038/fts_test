A photovoltaic (PV) charging station for electrical vehicles (EV) has been designed and built. The general objective of this work is to study and promote the use of PV energy to charge EV in an urban area. The installation has a 9.24 kWp PV generator designed as a curved parking cover with 6 different tilt angles, from 12.5/spl deg/ to 50/spl deg/. Two electric charging towers manage the system energy flow, user control and system monitoring. Two grid connected inverters feed the energy to the EV and excess to the electrical grid. The installation has been designed as portable for demonstration purposes.

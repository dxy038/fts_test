Abstract
Introduction: Chemotherapy drugs are used to treat various types of neoplasms. In dong so, such drugs leave many side effects. Furthermore, in recent years, several attempts have been made to develop drugs based on platinum or palladium which have low toxicity and is more sensitive to the drug-resistant diseases.
Objective: To evaluate the effects of newly synthetized palladium complexes, as anticancer drugs, on gastric cancer cell line (AGS).
Materials & Methods: In this study, gastric cancer cell line (AGS) was purchased from Pasteur Institute, Iran and cultivated in RPMI 1640 and then, the cytotoxic effects of various concentrations of newly synthesized complexes were evaluated by clonogenic assay and acridine orange/ ethedium bromide staining.
Results: The results showed that the new complexes have different effects in concentration-dependent manner so that complexe1 ? 0.1 µg /ml, complexe2 ? 0.05 µg /ml and complexe3 ? 1 µg /ml lead to cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. Comparison of the number of colonies formed after treatment with concentrations of palladium complexes showed significant differences, compared with controls (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: In this study, it was demonstrated that the use of low concentrations of palladium complexes of dithiocarbamate derivative increases apoptosis and necrosis, also, reduces the number of cell colonies, thus, it can be considered as an alternative drug for the treatment of gastric cancer.

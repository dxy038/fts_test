Objective
luate the use of transperineal template-guided prostate biopsy for patients with persistently elevated PSA despite multiple negative prior biopsies.
als and methods
ospective review was performed of patients with at least two prior prostate biopsies who underwent transperineal template-guided biopsy. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain relevant clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data.
s
l of 34 patients underwent transperineal template-guided biopsy. Patients had a mean of 3.7 ± 1.6 (range 2–8) prior biopsies, including prior negative transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy in 6 (17.6%) patients. Prostate cancer was detected in 17 (50%) of the 34 patients. Of these, 14 (82.4%) patients had cancer in the anterior prostate, 9 (52.9%) patients had cancer in the apical prostate, and 16 (94.1%) patients had cancer in either the anterior or apical prostate. Gleason score was 3+3 in 9 (52.9%) patients and 3+4 or greater in 7 (47.1%) patients. The mean number of positive cores was 4.5 ± 3.0 (range 1–11). Of the 17 patients with a diagnosis of cancer, 7 underwent radical prostatectomy, 7 underwent radiation therapy, 1 elected active surveillance, and 1 was deciding between surgery and radiation therapy; 1 patient received palliative chemotherapy for synchronous metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. Patients in whom cancer was detected had significantly smaller prostate volume, higher PSA, higher PSA density, and greater PSA velocity.
sions
erineal template-guided prostate biopsy is an effective technique for detecting cancer in patients with persistently elevated PSA despite multiple negative biopsies. It improves sampling of the anterior and apical prostate, and should be included as part of the diagnostic algorithm to reduce extensive repeat biopsy.

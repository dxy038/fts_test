This paper presents a framework for optimum design of a small, low-cost, light-weight toy submarine for recreational purposes. Two state of the art optimization algorithms namely Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and Infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) have been used in this study to carry out optimization of the toy submarine design. Single objective formulation of the toy submarine design problem is considered in this paper to identify designs with minimum drag and internal clash free assembly. The flexibility of the proposed framework and its ability to identify optimum preliminary designs of a toy submarine are demonstrated. Design identified through the process of optimization is compared with an existing toy submarine to highlight the benefits offered by the present approach.

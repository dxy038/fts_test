A brief description of failure modes encountered in the analysis of subtransmission systems is presented. The concepts discussed are illustrated by application to a system which is sufficiently large that practical factors can be realistically modeled and assessed and also sufficiently small that the effect of sensitivity studies can be easily identified. The computer program SUBTREL, which can be used to consider all the factors which affect the reliability of a subtransmission system, is also discussed. The computer program for the reliability evaluation of subtransmission systems is suitable for analyzing a wide range of networks of sizes normally encountered in actual systems. A wide range of sensitivity studies, including adverse weather effects and high-order outages, can be conducted and the results can be used to make objective decisions

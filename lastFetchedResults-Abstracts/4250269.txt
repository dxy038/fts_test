A class of non linear discrete time models with periodic parameters is considered in a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) form. The main objective of this paper is to show the potential improvement in the area of nonlinear periodic system control and observation using TS models. In order to achieve this goal, two problems are developed in this paper. The first part is dedicated to the design of a periodic TS fuzzy observer, where stability conditions are provided. In the second part, some results about the stabilization of periodic TS models with time varying delay are given. The adopted framework is based on LyapunovÂ´s theory and uses linear matrix inequalities. In each case, a simulation example is provided to show the efficiency of the method.

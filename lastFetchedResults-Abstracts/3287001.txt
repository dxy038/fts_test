This paper proposes a new unidirectional three-phase five-level rectifier topology that requires only a minimum of six IGBT devices. The concept of this rectifier topology with reduced number of operating devices is derived from the basic structure of a bidirectional multiple-pole multilevel diode-clamped rectifier. Hence, this proposed rectifier is named as Multiple-pole VIENNA Rectifier (MVR) topology. The MVR topology achieves high power factor in the mains line requiring only a small input inductor. Only two cells (Outer cell and Inner cell) are required in each phase of the rectifier to incorporate a five-level input voltage stepped waveform. Two types of switching schemes- PWM techniques and switching angle-firing method are applied to outer and inner cell switches respectively. Simulation studies have proven the feasibility of the MVR concepts. Results obtained show that this 5L-MVR achieves a power factor of 0.99 and a current distortion as low as 3.43% at lower switching frequencies. This results in lower switching losses and good overall performance. A standard low cost integrated control circuit is designed achieve good dynamic current control.

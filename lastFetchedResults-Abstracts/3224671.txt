E-learning success is dependent on effective and efficient delivery of teaching and learning contents electronically. New technological innovations have greatly facilitated e-learning and have made it conducive to those who can afford. Developed countries have significantly benefited from these innovations whereas developing economies are still battling with the many challenges that have hindered e-learning success. The advent of Web 2.0 and Free Open Source Software (FOSS) would have been seen as the breakthrough for the developing economies to embrace e-learning. However, many factors still impede the utilization of these technologies for e-learning. The major objective of this paper is to discuss the factors that hinder institutions from utilizing Web 2.0 and FOSS for e-learning. Content analysis was used to evaluate the factors that had been identified in literature and to tally them according to their frequency. 36 factors were deduced and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) method. Results indicated that technological factors predominantly impact on the utilization of Web 2.0 and FOSS for e-learning. The framework of this study serves as a guideline in the use of Web 2.0 and FOSS technologies for e-learning.

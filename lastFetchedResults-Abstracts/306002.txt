Objective

To assess the prognostic value of sustained improvement, scar and inducible ischemi with or without viability in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

Background

Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (DASE) accurately detects scar, reversible dysfunction and the extent of coronary artery disease in LVD.

Methods

Three hundred fifty consecutive patients (age 62 ± 13 years, mean ± SD, 215 men/135 women) with moderate to severe LVD (LVEF < 40%, mean 30 ± 8%) underwent DASE and were followed for ≥18 months. Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiographic findings were classified according to sustained improvement in all vascular territories, scar, inducible ischemi (worsening wall motion at peak dose only or biphasic responses) and their extent.

Results

Sustained improvement occurred in 83 patients (24%), scar alone in 99 (28%) and inducible ischemi in 168 (48%, with biphasic responses in 104). Ischemi was induced in all vascular territories in 26 patients. Patients with sustained improvement or scar alone were treated medically, whereas 46% (78/168) with inducible ischemi were revascularized (coronary bypass surgery, n = 67 or angioplasty, n = 11). There were 76 hard events including cardiac death in 59, nonfatal myocardial infarction in 11, and resuscitated sudden death in 6. Hard events were rare in sustained improvement (5%, 4/83), uncommon in scar (13%, 13/99) and common (p < 0.01) in medically treated patients with inducible ischemi (59%, 53/90). Cardiac deaths were especially common (p < 0.01) in patients with biphasic responses (55%, 28/51). Inducible ischemi independently predicted hard events (χ2 = 75.35, p < 0.001) along with reduced LVEF at peak dose (χ2 = 8.38, p = 0.004). Hard cardiac events were uncommon (8%, 6/78, p < 0.001) in patients with inducible ischemi who underwent early revascularization.

Conclusions

Inducible ischemi during DASE was the major determinant of outcome in LVD and independent of clinical dat and left ventricular function. Improved wall thickening alone and scar alone predicted good outcome. Survival of patients with inducible ischemi was better after revascularization.

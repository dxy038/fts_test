The use of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technologies has recently received an increased amount of interest from many industries. For deployment of a PHM system successfully, A key step is prognosis certification. This calls for a set of performance metrics that not only evaluate key aspects of predicting into the future but also integrate notions from practical aspects such as reliability, safety, mission criticality, logistics, economic viability, etc. In order to standardize the prognostics evaluation, this paper conducts the related research as follows: firstly, the detail requirement including user requirements and technical requirements is presented to indicate the objective of prognostics evaluation; secondly, the correlative metrics are listed after the functional classification of prognostics metrics; based on the study mentioned above, a general evaluation flow for prognostics performance is designed in succession; at last, the issue from assessing the prognostics performance is discussed to help standardize subsequent developments.

This paper investigates the competitive relationship and rivalry of industrial markets, using Chinese household electrical appliance firms as a platform for the study. The common complex network models belong to one-level networks in layered classification, while this paper formulates and evaluates a new two-level network model, in which the first level is the whole unweighted-undirected network useful for macro-analyzing the industrial market structure while the second level is a local weighted-directed network capable of micro-analyzing the inter-firm rivalry in the market. It is believed that the relationship is determined by objective factors whereas the action is rather subjective, and the idea in this paper lies in that the objective relationship and the subjective action subjected to this relationship are being simultaneously considered but at deferent levels of the model which may be applicable to many real applications.

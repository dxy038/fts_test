The rapid growth and increasing of
information technology and computer network have
caused that data transition in digital form is considered
more and more. The main disturbance of owners and
producers of digital products is to protect distribution and
unauthorized copying. An effective solution for this
problem is digital watermarking techniques. The purpose
of audio digital watermarking is to insert a series of
hidden information into audio file so that it is not heard
and robust against signal processing attacks. This paper
proposes a new audio watermarking method that is able
to embed watermark sequence into host signal based on
remaining numbers. The extraction process is carried out
blindly without any knowledge about original audio
signal. For comprehensive evaluation of the proposed
method, several experiments including subjective and
objective tests (MOS, SNR and SNRseg measures),
robustness and performance (BER, NC, TP and FP
measures) against Stirmark attacks as well as capacity
have been performed. Experimental results show that the
proposed method is able to improve trade-off among
three measures transparency, robustness, and capacity.

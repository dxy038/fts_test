The problem of a subjective, as against an objective, analysis of glottal waveforms obtained through inverse filtering of the acoustic waveform is discussed. It is shown that a dynamical system phase-plane plot can be used to view the residual resonance characteristics and hence assess the quality of the glottal waveform

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of LaCl3 supplementation on rumen fermentation, urinary excretion of purine derivatives and feed digestibility in the total tract of steers. Eight ruminally cannulated Simmental steers (420 ± 20 kg) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment. The treatments were control (without LaCl3); La-low; La-medium and La-high with 450, 900 and 1800 mg LaCl3 per steer per day, respectively. Diet consisted of 600 g/kg corn stover and 400 g/kg concentrate (dry matter [DM] basis). Dry matter intake (averaged 9 kg/day) was restricted to a maximum of 90% of ad libitum intake. Ruminal pH (range of 6.59–6.42) was quadratically (P&lt;0.04) changed, whereas total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration (range of 74.16–88.61 mM) was linearly (P&lt;0.01) and quadratically (P&lt;0.01) increased with increasing La supplementation. Ratio of acetate to propionate decreased linearly (P&lt;0.01) from 3.28 to 1.79 as La supplementation increased due to the increased in propionate production. In situ ruminal neutral detergent fibre (aNDF) degradation of corn stover was improved but the crude protein (CP) degradability of soybean meal was decreased with increasing La supplementation. Urinary excretion of purine derivatives was quadratically (P&lt;0.01) changed with altering La supplementation (75.5, 81.0, 82.4 and 70.6 mmol/day for control, low-, medium- and high-LaCl3 supplementation, respectively). Similarly, digestibilities of organic matter, aNDF and CP in the total tract were also linearly and quadratically increased with increasing La supplementation. The present results indicate that supplementation of diet with LaCl3 improved rumen fermentation and feed digestion in beef cattle. It was suggested that the La stimulated the digestive microorganisms or enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. In the experimental conditions of this trial, the optimum La dose was about 900 mg LaCl3 per steer per day.

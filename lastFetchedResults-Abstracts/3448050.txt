A fundamental issue that arises in any systematic attempt to synthesize magnetic coils is the possibility of curve fitting a practical winding pattern from initial harmonics chosen a prion to achieve some desired performance. It is shown to what extent this objective is achievable. This paper reports on conditions of feasibility for winding coils of various types and satisfying a varety of winding constraints. A complementary fundamental issue, the possibility of inventing equivalent yoke configurations, will be discussed in the next paper. Theoretical inputs of this kind are basic to coil design from first principles.

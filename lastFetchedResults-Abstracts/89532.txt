Depth filtration can be very attractive for initial clarification because of low capital costs and ease of operation. However, there is currently no fundamental understanding of the effects of the filter pore size and morphology on the overall capacity and filtrate quality. The objective of this study was to examine the flux, capacity, and filtrate turbidity of a series of depth filters with different pore size ratings and multilayer structures for the filtration of yeast cell suspensions. Data were analyzed using available fouling models to obtain insights into the flux decline mechanisms. Filters with small pore size provide high filtrate quality at low capacity, with the reverse being true for the larger pore sizes. The multilayer structure of commercial depth filters leads to improved performance, although the choice of layer properties is critical. The highest capacity was achieved using a multilayer filter in which the upper layer allows significant yeast cell penetration into the filter matrix but still protects the retentive layer that is needed for a high quality filtrate.

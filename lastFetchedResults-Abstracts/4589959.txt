In ad hoc networks with Internet connectivity, an Internet gateway (IG) is used to connect ad hoc mobile nodes to the Internet. Multiple Internet gateways may be deployed in order to provide more scalable and robust ubiquitous coverage. In this case, we need to solve the Internet gateway selection problem in order for successful integration of the Internet with mobile ad hoc networks. An ad hoc mobile node first discovers available Internet gateways, and then the node selects a serving gateway among those candidates for optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Internet gateway selection scheme using redirecting selection method which is based on QoS attributes such as hop-count and residual capacity. Our objective is to design a selection method for providing enhanced performance. Simulation results show that our adaptive Internet gateway selection scheme achieves better performance as well as better load balancing than existing selection schemes.

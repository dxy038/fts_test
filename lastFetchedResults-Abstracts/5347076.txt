In this work, we discuss multi-objective design optimization of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) solved by genetic algorithm (GA) and boundary element method. We choose the decrease of cogging torque and the increase of torque as objectives applied to multi-objective optimization (MO) of automotive permanent magnet synchronous motor. The airgap length, teeth width and magnetization angle of permanent magnet (PM) are also selected for the design variables respectively. From the results, our approach method enabled us to efficiently obtain diverse Pareto optimal (PO) solutions from the practical point of view.

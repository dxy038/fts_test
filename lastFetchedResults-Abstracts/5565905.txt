The objective of this work is to present a new iterative method to solve electromagnetic field problems using the method of moments formulation. The new method is conceptually simple and requires much fewer mathematical operations per iteration when compared to other available methods. Further, the method can easily handle multiple right hand side vectors much the same way as direct solution techniques. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the new method.

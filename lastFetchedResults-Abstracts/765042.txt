The main objective of this paper is to analyse street network structure of the deteriorated areas in order to resolve permeability problem and spatial isolation of these areas. Previous researches that investigated the problems of deteriorated areas concern about land use per capita indicated that low permeability of these areas is not about area of streets but, it is because of inadvertence towards the urban street network   in developing new areas or regeneration of deteriorated areas.  In both cases, insufficient network of streets and roads have been produced. The common solution to encounter shortage of permeability was widening existing streets or creating new streets. Previous research regarding resolving lake of access and isolation on deteriorated areas, have been failed because they did not carried a methodical approach toward identifying the structure problems of deteriorated areas. Regarding the above theoretical and technical shortcomings, this paper would answer to two fundamental questions: How could weaknesses of urban street structure on deteriorated areas can be round and can be resolved?  Are there similar structural problems about permeability on all of the urban deteriorated areas? In order to answer to these questions, at first urban street structure of Mashhad has been analyzed utilizing Space Syntax method.  This method identified the weaknesses and deficiencies of Mashhad's deteriorated structure. The results show that, there are significant differences between the structure of deteriorated areas and other parts of the city; this differentiation helps to identify weaknesses in these areas. Also, analysis of urban street structure indicated that reasons of access weakness and permeability problems in various deteriorated areas are different, especially between central and suburban deteriorated areas. So, the problems of deteriorated areas cannot be resolved similarly.

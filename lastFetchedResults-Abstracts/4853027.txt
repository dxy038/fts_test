The objective of this paper is to present an approach for isolating the harmonic contents in both voltage and current waveforms at the outage feeder of Gharb Talkha substation (66/11 kv). A novel technique using Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) for the analysis of the waveforms harmonics content. At the beginning the substation is simulated using Sirnulink toolbox in Matlab program with and without the presence of capacitor bank The obtained voltage and current waveforms are compared to the actual data. The proposed model is used to study the effect of replacing the capacitor bank with single tuned parallel passive fiter. The resulting current and voltage waveforms are analyzed using the proposed DWT technique. The analysis showed that the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of both voltage and current waveforms is improved as well as the power factor.

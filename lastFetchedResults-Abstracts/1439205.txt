This paper proposes an adaptive framework that can help the owner of a wind/pumped storage power plant as a price-taker power producer to build hourly offering curves for participating in a pool electricity market. The proposed method sequentially solves a set of robust mixed-integer linear programming problems. In the robust optimization method, no longer need to predict uncertain parameters and instead, confidence level of uncertain parameters are defined. These intervals are successively divided into smaller intervals so that the offering production curves are achieved. In this paper, the uncertainty of electricity price, wind power and availability of wind and pumped-storage units are considered. It is necessary to note that the main objective of robust optimization method is to obtain optimal robust solutions for the worst possible event of the uncertain parameters in their uncertain spectrum. The obtained solution of aforementioned problem can provide enough information to make an hourly offering curve.

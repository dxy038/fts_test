The authors showed previously that very simple wavelength switches are sufficient for the implementation of unidirectional all-optical Manhattan networks. They illustrate that similar components can be used for the implementation of bidirectional all-optical Manhattan networks, with the advantage of a significant reduction in the number of nodes traversed by the user data, with a much smaller power loss. The basic ideas on which bidirectional all-optical Manhattan networks are based are described along with the node architecture

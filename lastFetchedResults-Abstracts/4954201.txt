This paper presents a comparison of different multiobjective predictive controllers that can be applied to an olive oil mill. The work is focused on the choice of one of the controllers to be implemented in the real plant. Previous studies showed the necessity of including objectives with different priorities in the control scheme. The control strategies have been tested under simulation, showing that good performance can be obtained by the use of a predictive controller with multi-objective prioritization. The work analyzes three different strategies that try to fulfill the specifications, showing their performances in different situations. Implementation issues, such as computational cost, are also considered since this topic is crucial for a successful application on the real plant. The results are illustrated with some simulations based on real data.

There appear to be two important developing trends in reliability. One is away from the use of statistics by reliability engineers; the other is toward increased use of Bayesian techniques. One source of the latter may be disillusionment with what is regarded as classical statistics; however, one source of the former may be dissatisfaction with what has been called Bayesian statistics. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these trends and to present a personal view of the issues between classical and Bayesian statistics. The objective is to show that there is some substance to the classical statisticianÂ´s opposition to Bayesian inference and that the issues are pertinent and meaningful to the reliability engineer.

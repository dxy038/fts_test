In this paper the optimum design of a rotary forging machine with parallel mechanism developed by the authors is presented. The difference between this machine and other traditional machines is the application of both the orbital motion and the feeding motion through the parallel mechanism which can easily provide complicated profiles. The table of the machine is hydraulically actuated through the hexapod mechanism and is responsible for all the forming motions so that the optimum performance is achieved. The objective functions in the optimization problem is minimizing the positioning error and the force required for actuators. The investigated parameters in the design optimization are the radius of the fixed platform (R0), radius of the mobile platform (R1), the angle between spherical joints (?) and between the universal joints (B). First, the objective functions were modeled by a program written in MATLAB for a specific domain. The results showed that for the minimum values of ? and R1, and the maximum values of R0 and B, the values of force and positioning error are the least. However these results are for R0 up to 400mm. For the larger values of R0 the trend changed, i. e. by a decrease in R1 the values of force and error increased. Both objective functions resulted in the same values indicating the reliability of the considered functions to achieve the optimum design.

The germinal center (GC) is a functional module positioned in strategic locations of the lymphatic network in the animal body, which is known to play an important role in the immune response. Its formation and function can be explained and analyzed from a computational point of view using neural network technology. The objective of the paper is to model GC organization in terms of NN architecture and dynamics. A cascade of three Hopfield networks along with the Hebbian learning principle is used in a data classification problem where the connection matrices determine the local and global feedback as well as the propagation from one state to another in the network

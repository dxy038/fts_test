PID control is used widely in hydraulic servo control system. The PID control parameters are very important to performance of hydraulic servo control system and how to find rapidly the optimum values of PID control parameters is very difficult problem. Based on Matlab/simulink software and taking the IATE standards of the optimization design as objective function, a global search optimization method, called the random virus algorithm was applied for the optimization of the three parameters of PID controller of electric-hydraulic servo system of 6-DOF parallel platform. Simulation results show that the proposed parameter optimum method is an effective tuning strategy and has good performance.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is successful as a pathogen because of its ability to persist in an immunocompetent host. This bacterium lives within the macrophage, a cell whose function is the elimination of microbes. Recent advances have improved our understanding of how M. tuberculosis  evades two major antimicrobial mechanisms of macrophages: phagolysosome fusion and the production of toxic reactive nitrogen intermediates. M. tuberculosis also modulates antigen presentation to prevent the detection of infected macrophages by CD4+ T cells.

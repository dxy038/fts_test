The expert fuzzy process control system consists of both precise and imprecise state descriptions and decision rules. The control system uses a supervising expert system, deterministic or crisp controllers and fuzzy logic controllers. The supervisor task is based on appropriate criteria which maintains the overall application objective. The selected system structure allows for use of both fuzzy and crisp controllers and encourages optimum allocation of the overall process control hardware and software resources. The control system is applied to a simulated rotary dryer process whose variables are nonlinear and exhibit interaction effects which typically require constant monitoring by skilled operators. Control automation is performed with the proposed system by implementation of the appropriate controller type under expert system supervisory control. The supervisory tasks include those which aid in improving the performance of control.

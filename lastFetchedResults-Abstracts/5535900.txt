A novel main circuit topology of current quality compensator is proposed in this paper, which is composed of PWM rectifier and cascade H bridge inverter. The three phase inverters are decoupling controlled. PWM rectifier is adopted to maintain the dc-bus voltage stably for the device, the later inverter is composed of cascade H-bridges. The inverter side is controlled by carrier phase shifting and adaptive fuzzy PI control is adopted as a output current control method which is able to enhance the ability of the control system to withstand the parameter variations and nonlinear uncertain disturbances. The simulation model is set up on the platform of RTDS, the problems of disturbance current such as harmonic current, reactive current and imbalance current are made as the multi-objective of current compensator. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed main circuit topology and control strategy is feasible and efficient.

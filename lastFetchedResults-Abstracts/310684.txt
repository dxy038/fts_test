Objective. The objective of this study is to determine the relation between arm load and the three-dimensional shoulder orientations.

Background. Analysis of a musculo-skeletal system by means of an inverse dynamical simulation requires postural data of the bony elements involved. For the shoulder, the positions of the clavicle and the scapula are difficult to record due to the skin displacement. It would therefore be useful to predict the three-dimensional relation between the orientation of the arm, the clavicula and the scapula, i.e. the three-dimensional shoulder rhythm, with respect to the thorax under different load conditions.

Methods. The orientation of the clavicula and the scapula was determined with respect to the thorax by means of palpation of skeletal landmarks, for seven postures of arm elevation in the frontal plane at four load conditions: 0, 0.9, 1.9 and 2.9 kg at the wrist. The data were expressed by Cardan angles and analyzed by means of repeated measurements analysis of variance.

Results. While the clavicular and scapular angles were significantly related to the arm elevation, no significant relation was found with the load in the hands for the seven arm postures.

Conclusions. The three-dimensional shoulder rhythm does not change under different gravitational load conditions on the arm.

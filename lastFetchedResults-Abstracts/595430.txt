Objective: To determine the frequency of nasal involvement in cutaneous leishmaniasis and to study demographic and clinical pattern of disease involving nose as well as nasal mucosa. Material and Methods: Patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis presented to leishmaniasis clinic situated in the Basic Health Unit for Afghan refugees at Sarai Gambeela, District Lakki Marwat from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 were registered. The patients were diagnosed clinically and confirmed by laboratory demonstration of parasite in a giemsa stained smear prepared from the lesion. Those having lesions primarily on nose, irrespective of age and gender were included in the study. All those cases with primary lesion elsewhere over face and secondarily involving nose (creeping lesion) were excluded. All important clinical details were recorded on a specially designed proforma and patients were given a registration card for the purpose of treatment and follow up visits. Results: Sixty seven out of 682 (9.82%) cases of nasal leishmanisis were encountered. Male to female ratio was 2:1. Forty nine (73.13%) had solitary lesions and among these fourty four (65.67%) had lesions limited to their nose. Wet type cutaneous leishmaniasis was seen in 19 (28.36) cases. Seventy three percent of sufferers were less than 30 years of age. Conclusion: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Distt. Lakki Marwat. Nose was a common site of involvement. In endemic areas, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of nasal lesions.

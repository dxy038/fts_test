The objective of this paper is to provide and verify simplified models that predict the longitudinal stresses that develop in C-section purlins in uplift. The paper begins with the simple case of flexural stress; where the force has to be applied at the shear center, or the section braced in both flanges. Restrictions on load application point and restraint of the flanges are removed until arriving at the more complex problem of bending when movement of the tension flange alone is restricted, as commonly found in purlin-sheeting systems. Winter's model for predicting the longitudinal stresses developed due to direct torsion is reviewed, verified, and then extended to cover the case of a bending member with tension flange restraint. The developed longitudinal stresses from flexure and restrained torsion are used to assess the elastic stability behavior of typical purlin-sheeting systems. Finally, strength predictions of typical C-section purlins are provided for existing AISI methods and a newly proposed extension to the direct strength method that employs the predicted longitudinal stress distributions within the strength prediction.

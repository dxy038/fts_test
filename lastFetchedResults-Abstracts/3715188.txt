Presented is a novel variable-frequency input ac-ac converter that accepts a wide frequency variation of input raw power. The new converter and control offers a high-frequency control capability, at both input and output sides, that is a magnitude higher than the operating range reported so far in literature. The new converter is designed and experimentally implemented by novel three-in-one integrated bidirectional power modules. High performance at high frequencies of fundamental power control at both input and load sides are verified extensively by experimental evaluations. Voltage-source characteristics are obtained at both input and outsides, thus improving system robustness when subjects to line imbalance and voltage distortion, which is important for distributed-power generation (DPG). The high-frequency excitation can reduce the size and weight of the generating and (or) motoring apparatus. The proposed system benefits the efficiency and power density of future DPG systems driven by variable-speed wind, water, and microturbines.

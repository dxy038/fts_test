A hybrid electric Kart is built as a didactical project for the students of the Master of Engineering: Energy of the K.U.Leuven. In order to cope with the growing number of students, a modular hybrid electric kart is conceived. The hybrid configuration allows to diversify between several tasks that have to be addressed by the students. The tasks include a control scheme for an induction motor, a control scheme and design of a power-factor-correction converter which enables power flow between the DC-link and a gasoline generator and finally the control scheme and design of a DC/DC converter allowing bidirectional power flow between a low voltage battery and the DC-link. All control schemes are supervised by a top level control scheme which maximises efficiency. The control schemes are programmed in Matlab/Simulink. A rapid-prototyping control board runs the model made in Matlab/Simulink. The control board interfaces between the different sensors and power electronics present on the kart.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of dental radiography is inevitable in order for disease diagnosis, assessment and monitoring. Radiogeraphy is potentially harmful due to the use of ionizing radiation. This study was conducted to evaluate dentists’ knowledge about the principles of dental radiology.

All the data were obtained by means of a questionnaire.

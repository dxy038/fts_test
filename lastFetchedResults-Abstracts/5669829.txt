In 1994 the Argentinean Interconnected System (SADI) presented the need to introduce some operative improvements in order to increase the generation capacity, by eliminating the transmission constraints caused by stability problems. The Argentinean Energy Department instructed CAMMESA-the System Independent Operator-to accomplish the Project &#8220;SADI Stabilizing Resources&#8221;. The ProjectÂ´s objective was to increase the transmission capacity of the Comahue 500 kV transmission lines, from 2700 MW to 3300 MW, eliminating the lack of damping which in 1995 brought very important transmission restrictions. CAMMESA defined the results to be achieved, as well as the necessary studies and corrective actions. The most important action was to implement an extensive PSS use. CAMMESA also contracted other companies for consulting, performing studies and supplying of equipment. This work presents the activities of PSS implementation, including field tests and an analysis of the Interconnected Power System. Not only the individual results are presented, but also the overall damping results. It also covers some changes in controllers and other developments related to the installation of new stabilizers

Objective
This study was undertaken to characterize primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) compared with ovarian carcinoma (OvC).
Study design
Within the framework of a nationwide epidemiologic Israeli study, 95 PPC patients were identified and compared with 117 FIGO stage III-IV epithelial OvC patients matched by age and continent of birth. Data were abstracted from medical records and personal interviews.
Results
Our data confirm the similarities between PPC and OvC. A higher rate of abdominal distention, volume of ascites, and malignant cells in ascitic fluid and lower rate of pelvic palpable mass and personal breast cancer history were found in the PPC compared with the OvC group. The overall survival was similar in both groups (30-33 months). In optimally cytoreduced patients, survival was better in the OvC group. Diameter of residual disease was associated with better survival only in the OvC group.
Conclusion
The clinical differences do not enable a preoperative distinction between the neoplasms.

We develop a method to reconstruct the rotation motion of a satellite from Sun sensor measurements. Mathematically, the estimation objective is formulated as the problem of phase reconstruction for a 2-dimensional periodic function. A computationally straightforward solution is proposed. Theoretical developments allow to assess the robustness to model imperfections, sampling and noise. Simulation results illustrate practically obtainable performance..

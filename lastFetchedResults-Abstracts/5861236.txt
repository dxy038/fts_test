Genetic algorithm is one important method for solving vehicle routing problem. Genetic algorithm has the special advantages in solving vehicle routing problem. A genetic algorithm for logistics vehicle routing problem is designed and implemented in this paper. At the same time the key technologies such as the implementing of the genetic algorithm based on natural number encode in the logistics vehicles dispatching have been expounded. And the solving effects are contrasted between reciprocal method of objective function and difference method for construction of fitness function of genetic algorithm. The results show that our algorithm has good performance on vehicle routing problem.

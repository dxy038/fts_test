Inter-cell interference coordination is an important question studied in 3GPP for Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA). The objective is to reduce interference and to increase cell-edge throughput and cell throughput. A novel interference mitigation technique, called resource time and frequency joint plan and scheduling (TFJPS), is introduced. Simulation results illustrate that enhanced performance is achieved.

Controlled islanding refers to the controlled separation of an interconnected power system into electrically isolated regions. The objective of this paper is to develop adaptive controlled islanding as a component of an emergency power system control strategy. There are two primary aspects of controlled islanding: 1) where to island and 2) when to island? Assisted by a decision tree (DT) approach, this paper seeks to address the "when to island" aspect. A decision tree based tool is proposed to recognize conditions existing in the system that warrant controlled islanding. A 29-generator, 179-bus system is employed to demonstrate the tool. Simulation data are used to train DTs, and the online performance of DTs is then evaluated as part of a controlled islanding strategy

A novel method of computation with simultaneously concurrent error detection using bidirectional operands (BIDO) is presented. This technique will provide an efficient and optimal design for an arithmetic unit with fault tolerance. The technique retains all the capabilities of the space redundancy and time redundancy methods, but does not inherit their drawbacks. BIDO requires less hardware overhead than RESO techniques and hardly any redundant time. These capabilities and features make BIDO better suited for designing arithmetic units of VLSI systems, which require high performance and high reliability

Energy storage system is necessary to maintain steady operation of the micro-grid and decrease its influence on the distribution grid. In this paper, some research has been carried on in optimal storage sizing in composite energy storage system in wind micro grid. The energy storage system is composed of battery and fly-wheel, which combines advantages of both sides. Cost function is used as the objective function and the loss of load and the generation spilled are considered during the calculation. We considered the constraint functions from the power, energy aspects and set rules for composite storage system. The optimization for a one-week example has been studied in this paper. After summary and comparison, some conclusions are obtained.

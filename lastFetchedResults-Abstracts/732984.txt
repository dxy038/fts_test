Objectives: The present study examines the relationship between health-related quality of life and physical activity among adults with affective, anxiety, and substance dependence disorders.

Methods: Analyses were conducted among participants in the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey (GHS), a nationally representative multistage probability survey, conducted from 1997 to 1999. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between health-related quality of life and physical activity among subjects with mental disorders.

Results: Affective, anxiety, and substance dependence disorders were associated with substantial impairment in health-related quality of life. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with higher health-related quality of life among persons with mental disorders. Even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, physically inactive subjects reported poorer quality of life.

Conclusions: Physical activity can be considered as beneficial for people suffering from mental disorders. The promotion of a physically active lifestyle is an important public health objective.

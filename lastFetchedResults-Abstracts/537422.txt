Objective
Nocturnal enuresis is a common childhood problem and has various treatments.
This study was carried out to compare oral and nasal vasopressin in the
treatment of nocturnal enuresis in 5- to 12-year-old children who were referred
to the Shahid Beheshti Clinic in 2008.
Materials & Methods
This study included 100 children (62 males and 38 females) with nocturnal
enuresis. One group (50 patients) received 20 mcg nasal vasopressin which
increased up to 40 mcg, depending on the patientsâ€™ response. The other group
(50 patients) received 0.2 mg oral vasopressin which increased up to 0.4 mg.
The patients were followed up for one month after response to the last dose of
drug. Data were recorded in prepared forms and analyzed using Chi-Square
and Fisher Test.
Results
The success rate with oral and nasal method was 80% and 92%, respectively
(P=0.08). Only 2% of the children had complications during the treatment; one
child treated orally developed gastroenteritis and another child treated with
the nasal method developed convulsions (P=1). Sixteen percent of the children
treated with the oral method and 28% of the children treated with the nasal
method had recurrence (P=0.148).
Conclusion
Oral and nasal forms of vasopressin have equal therapeutic effects. However,
oral form of the treatment has fewer serious side effects and is easier to use.
Therefore, the use of oral medicine is recommended.

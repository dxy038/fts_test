Objective(s): To investigate on accuracy of axillary temperature measurement.
Material & Methods: A total of 400 individuals with or without fever attending the Shariati Hospital in Tehran were entered into the study. Oral and axillary temperatures were measured and recorded for each subject.
Results: There were 276 male (66.7%) and 133 female (33.3%) cases in the study. The mean age, oral and axillary temperature were 46.39 (±17.4), 37.05 (±0.51), 36.6 (±0.56) respectively.
Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 98% respectively at two cut off points (36.85 and 37.35 Centigrade).
Conclusion: It appears that the use of axillary temperature measurement is an accurate assessment to detect or exclude fever if used appropriately.

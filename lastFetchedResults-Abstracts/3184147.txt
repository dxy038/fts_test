This paper proposes a NSGA-II based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and applies the proposed algorithm on a novel multi-objective problem for a two echelon serial supply chain. The existing literature shows that the existing benchmark multi-objective algorithms face difficulties in solving problems with more than two objectives. The proposed algorithm in this paper can be used to solve problems with two or more number of objectives. We have also applied a variable-wise mutation in the proposed algorithm. The algorithm has been compared with a well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Non-domination Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than NSGA-II.

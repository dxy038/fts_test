Aiming at VRP in modern military logistics, this paper sets up the multi-objective VRP mathematical model of military logistics in wartime. This model is solved by NSGA II, and improves the dependence on the initial population and the deficiency in the practical application from NSGA II, and has improved the population initialization and intersection in NSGA II algorithm by the introduction of Greedy algorithm. The algorithm is realized by Matlab programming and applied by examples. After the simulation is improved, NSGA II is able to solve the multi-objective VRP of military logistics in wartime.

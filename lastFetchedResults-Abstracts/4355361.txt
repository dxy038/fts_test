This brief proposes a novel multi-objective heuristic. It is a transformation of a mono-objective heuristic into a multi-objective one by addition of an archive and some non dominance computing routines. Performances of the proposed heuristic are demonstrated thru test functions. An application to the optimal sizing of a class AB second generation CMOS current conveyor is presented. Comparison with NSGA-II is given.

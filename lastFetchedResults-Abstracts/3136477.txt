The generalized monopulse procedure is a tool to estimate parameters by maximizing a beamforming-type objective function. It can be applied to angle estimation (classical monopulse), but also to space-time array processing of any dimension. The performance of this procedure is characterized in this paper by conditional means and covariances for all models of target fluctuation (Swerling 0 to 4). From these the performance of all kinds of parameter estimates with the generalized monopulse formula can be calculated. Applications are presented for a planar array with adaptive beamforming and for space-time adaptive processing for broadband interference suppression leading to some interesting conclusions.

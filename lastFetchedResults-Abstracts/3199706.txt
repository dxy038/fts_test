The introduction of distributed generation (DG) onto distribution networks has a significant effect on losses and voltage profile. This effect cannot be characterized as detrimental or beneficial but is dependent on the allocation of DG on each distribution network section. Here the impact of DG on losses has been modeled, facilitating a unique approach to the allocation of DG. This approach has been implemented and tested on sample sections of distribution network and results are presented showing the optimal allocation of DG which improves the efficiency of energy delivery on the distribution network This paper aims to investigate the impact of distributed generation on distribution system losses and voltage profile. The main objective is to reduce the power losses and to increase the voltage profile based on location of DG and size of injection. Using application program ETAP 6.0 and the Manokwari electricity distribution system as case study, the results shows that at certain location, the power injection of DG has decrease the drop voltage from 14,48% to 6,34% and losses from 240,15 kW to 99,39 kW and more economic than without DG installation. The best location of interconnection is 80 km from power grid and injection of 85% DG capacity.

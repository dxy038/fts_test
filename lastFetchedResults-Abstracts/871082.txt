This work is devoted to the study of the existence of an unbounded continuum of
periodic solutions that appear by Hopf bifurcation in non-linear delay differential
equations. Our main objective is to give a theorem that guarantees the appearance
of an unbounded continuum of periodic solutions. Furthermore, the verification of
the hypotheses requires much less effort than the known results in the literature.
In the last section some applications to examples already studied show the power
of the theorem.

The high reliability exhibited by the Sprint long distance network is the result of many interrelated factors. The network utilizes robust architectures, systems, and equipment to provide a reliable transport infrastructure. Redundant equipment, conservative synchronization, protected power, and other factors combine to form a dependable foundation. New architectures and systems are under development to meet the changing demands of customers. This article summarizes SprintÂ´s current network reliability, and emerging demands and technology, and presents possible directions for the future Sprint network. Sprint selected the SONET four-fiber bidirectional line switched ring (4F BLSR) architecture for the vast majority of its transport network architecture. A 4F BLSR architecture requires four fibers, or four optical wavelengths of wave division multiplexing (WDM), to accommodate a work and protect path in each direction around a ring of network elements or add-drop multiplexers (ADMs)

This paper proposes a new kind of constraint handling method for optimization. In the proposed method, a transformation of constraint functions to be another objective function will be discussed in details. With this technique we can transform the constraint problem to be unconstraint multiobjective optimization and use the multi-objective optimization methods to find feasible solutions. The performance of the algorithm is tested on 13 benchmark functions in the literature. The results show that we can find very good solutions by this approach.

This paper presents a novel methodology for the spatial power network planning problem based on the raster map in geographic information systems (GIS). Considering candidate lines and cell linkages, the proposed spatial power network planning model integrates the optimal electric line routing and the power network evaluation, with the objective of the minimum line investment cost. The network connectivity with candidate line routes and the hourly network evaluation for peak power loads are considered to ensure the feasibility of the line path and the security of power systems. The derived mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem by integer algebra techniques. Furthermore, in order to improve the computational efficiency, a tighter MILP formulation with the proposed enhanced line routing constraints is proposed. Numerical case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the spatial power network planning problem.

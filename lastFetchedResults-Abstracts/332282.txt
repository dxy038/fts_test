Objective. The aim of this study was to compare the behavior of two new, low-shrinkage hybrid composites (Aelite LS and Inten-S) with a microfilled (Heliomolar) and a hybrid composite (Filtek Z250), in terms of polymerization contraction stress and microleakage.

Methods. Maximum contraction stress after 10 min was recorded in a ‘tensilometer’, using a C-factor (C) of 2.5 and energy density of 26 J/cm2. For the microleakage test, cylindrical cavities with enamel margins prepared in bovine incisors (4 mm diameter, 1.5 mm depth, C=2.5) were restored in bulk, applying the same energy density used in the contraction stress test. After immersion in 0.5% methylene blue for 4 h, specimens were sectioned twice, perpendicularly, and the highest dye penetration score was recorded. Contraction stress results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA/Tukey's test and microleakage was analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis test. Regression analysis between the two variables was also performed.

Results. Aelite LS showed significantly higher stress than the other composites tested. Inten-S and Filtek Z250 had similar stress levels, statistically higher than Heliomolar. In the microleakage test, a significant difference was observed between Aelite LS and Heliomolar only. Regression analysis showed a good linear correlation between the two variables (R2adjusted=0.811).

Conclusions. The low-shrinkage materials exhibited contraction stress values similar or higher than the hybrid composite. A direct relationship between contraction stress values and microleakage for the composites evaluated was verified.

Significance. The low-shrinkage composites tested did not seem to represent an improvement in terms of reducing contraction stress or microleakage.

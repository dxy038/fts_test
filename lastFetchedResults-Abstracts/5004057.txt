This paper presents real time test results arising from the application of a case based reasoning technique for voltage control of a section of existing UK 11kV network. The test network includes two distributed generation schemes. The objective of the case based reasoning technique is to maintain voltages within statutory limits while also maximizing the DG access to the network. The control algorithm is embedded on a commercially available hardware platform designed for installation in power system substations. The case based reasoning technique employs the following control actions to achieve its objectives: DG real power control, DG reactive power control and transformer tap change control. The voltage control technique is tested during over-voltage conditions and for situations where only partial sensor data is available.

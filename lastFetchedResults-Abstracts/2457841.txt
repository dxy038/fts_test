Introduction & Objective: Sodium arsenite disturbs the differentiation of adult rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) to Osteoblast through oxidative stress. We aimed to inves-tigate the preventive effect of vitamin E, a strong antioxidant, in sodium arsenite toxicity on rMSCs differentiation to osteoblast.
Materials & Methods: rMSCs were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium containing 15% Fetal Bovine Serum and divided into: control, sodium arsenite (20 nM), vitamin E (50 µM) and sodium arsenite + vitamin E for 21 days in the osteogenic media containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. Cell viability, bone matrix mineralization, intercellular and extracellular calcium, alkaline phosphatase activity, DNA damage and cell morphological changes were evaluated. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test and means were considered significantly different at P < 0.05. 
Results:  Cell viability, bone matrix mineralization, calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase activity and nuclei diameter decreased significantly in the sodium arsenite group. The men-tioned parameters increased significantly in cells treated with sodium arsenite + vitamin E to the control level (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic extensions were also observed in the vitamin E group.
Conclusions: Vitamin E reduces sodium arsenite toxicity, increasing osteogenic differentiation in rMSCs.

Existing theory has framed the process of information extraction and agglomeration, also referred to as the knowledge discovery (KD) process, as a series of strategic search decisions, subject to constraints, with the objective of attaining a sufficient level of domain-specific knowledge for use in strategic planning. Supported by the experiences of firms representative of Client, Developer, and Third-party segments of the data mining (DM) community, this work provides an extension to this basic framework. The implications provided suggest a wealth of untapped opportunities in the area of KD research.

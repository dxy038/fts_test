The paper deals with the development of a simple method for the redesign of a recent hybrid adaptive control scheme by using adaptive sampling. The main objective of the proposed technique is to improve the adaptation transients by taking advantage of the knowledge about it goodness in classical (i.e., those nonneeding parameter adaptation) problems concerned with the transient behaviours in terms of acceptable tracking error deviations.

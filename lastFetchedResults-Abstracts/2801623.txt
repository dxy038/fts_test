The interpolation causes the frequency aliasing in intrinsic mode functions (IMF) in bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD). The local orthogonality or the computational complexity of the improved BEMDs can not be met. In this paper, a novel BEMD - local estimation empirical mode decomposition (LEEMD) is proposed. Particularly, the local estimation instead of the interpolation without changing the framework of EMD is proposed to solve the problem. LEEMD will be applied in image fusion based on the proposed background/detail rule. In experiments, the objective and subjective experiments show that LEEMD and its application is effective.

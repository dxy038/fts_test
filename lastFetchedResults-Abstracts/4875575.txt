Design Space Exploration (DSE) is an indispensable part in High Level Synthesis designing methodology. This paper presents a novel accelerated DSE approach for the exploration of cost-performance tradeoffs for multi objective heterogeneous modular Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems using mixed searching approach. The presented method is competent of concurrently selecting the optimal architecture for the system design at the expense of analyzing minimum architecture design alternatives, which is heavily significant for the development of present generation modular VLSI systems with heterogeneous parametric objective. Results of the proposed approach for various DSP benchmarks indicated momentous acceleration in the architecture exploration process compared to another existing approach with multi parametric objective.

The objective of this paper is to develop the constructs for perceived consumer effectiveness; environmental concern and ecologically conscious behavior in assessing their validity and reliability. A survey has been developed and administered with a total sample of 319 achieved across the country. Through extensive review of pertinent literature, five dimensions have been identified that form the component factors of the study. A Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using AMOS 18.0 to check on the construct and identify the model fitness.

The main objective of the present paper is to study the principles and methods of interaction with the other on the basis of anthropological fundamentals of Islam for which logical induction method has been used. There are many approaches to the issue of interaction with others, including civil society, Emmanuel Lévinas’s otherism, and spiritual nonviolence. In contrast, one may introduce moderate otherism on the basis of Islamic teachings. The question that is raised here is: is it possible to offer different principles and methods for interaction with others on the basis of moderate otherism and anthropological fundamentals of Islam? In order to provide answer to this question, in the first place, anthropological fundamentals of Islam have been discussed based on the holy Quran and its exegesis (AlMizan) and some principles and methods have been inferred for suitable interaction with others. Some of the anthropological fundamentals of Islam are: merciful dignity, transcendental love of the Almighty, and rationality. Also some of the principles and methods for interaction with others are: dignifying of human beings, dialogue, philanthropy, forgiveness while in power, openmindedness in dialogue, having mercy and avoiding violence.

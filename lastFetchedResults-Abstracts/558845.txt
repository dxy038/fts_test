Background: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are considered as major occupational health problems and undesirable posture during work is one of the most important causes of such problems. Therefore describing the effect of different levels of musculoskeletal system on health-related quality of life and work absence is essential for preventive strategy.

Objective: In this study the health- related quality of life in personnel of an assembly line of a car manufacturing company who suffered musculoskeletal disorders was investigated and later compared with healthy subjects.

Methods: A case control study was performed on workers of Saipa car manufacturing company who were exposed to musculoskeletal disorders. A total of 165 workers with musculoskeletal disorders and 165 controls were randomly selected. Musculoskeletal disorders were determined using valid and reliable Nordic and SF-36 questionnaires. Data were analyzed using, Chi Square, Odds Ratio, 95% Confidence Interval, and Logistic Regression.

Findings: Comparison of physical indicators of quality of life such as physical pain, general health, physical function, and role limitation due to physical problems with indicators of musculoskeletal disorders showed a significant difference between two groups (P<0/001). Musculoskeletal disorders were higher in those with lower quality of life [P<0.001, CI: 95% (0.32-0.82), OR=0.51)] Conclusion: There was a relationship between the indicator of quality of life and musculoskeletal disorders. Physical conditions and quality of life among workers of assembly line of the car manufacturing company affected the risk of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Improving and optimizing such conditions play an important role in health- related quality of life.

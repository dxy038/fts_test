Deconvolution is one of the most important aspects of seismic signal processing. The objective of the deconvolution procedure is to remove the obscuring effect of the waveletÂ´s replica making up the seismic trace and therefore obtain an estimate of the reflection coefficient sequence. This paper introduces a new deconvolution algorithm. Optimal distributed estimators and smoothers are utilized in the proposed solution. The new distributed methodology, perfectly suitable for a multisensor environment, such as the seismic signal processing, is compared to the centralized approach, with respect to computational complexity and architectural efficiency. It is shown that the distributed approach greatly outperforms the currently used centralized methodology offering flexibility in the design of the data fusion network

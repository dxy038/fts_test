The bidirectional Manhattan street network (BMSN) and the ShuffleNet (SN), four-connected topologies implementing the logical layout of so-called multichannel metropolitan area networks (MANs), are considered. An open issue in multichannel MANs, namely, broadcast service, is addressed. Two different strategies are proposed to deliver broadcast traffic in BMSN and SN, and they are compared on the basis of throughput and delivery delay results, as obtained by developing an analytic model. The availability of an analytic model allows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in large size networks to be investigated

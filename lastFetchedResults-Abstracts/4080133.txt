AS A RESULT of experience in the operation of experimental heat pump systems in Philadelphia, Pa., it has become evident that it is necessary to direct efforts toward improving substantially the annual load factor of electrical service supply to such systems, to overcome the competitive handicaps inherent in utilizing electricity for house heating. The author believes that this objective may be accomplished through the development of economically feasible media for storing heat in sufficient quantities to permit a reduction in the maximum kilowatt demand for electricity of a heat pump system.

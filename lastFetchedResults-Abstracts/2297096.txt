Context and objective: The international community, with establishment
of the international criminal court tried to stop international criminal being
not punished. Intervention of criminal court in the situation in Darfur after its
referral by the Security Council also suggests this.
Methodology: This descriptive- analytic research is library- based.
Findings: Resolution 1593 of Security Council referred the situation in
Darfur to the prosecutor of the criminal and requires states to cooperate with
criminal court to arrest criminals of Darfur case. But one of the problems
facing the court is immunity status of Omar al-Bashir the current president
of Sudan, and government’s cooperation in arresting and delivering him to
the court because of the requirements of the resolution. The resolution has
not explicitly denied Bashir’s immunity, but at the same time, despite some
opposition, doctrines of international law and the articles of association can
consider the resolution as negation of Bashir’s immunity and the basis for
cooperation of governments to arrest and deliver him to the criminal court.
Results: According to Bashir’s prosecution referred to the UN Security
Council and the provisions of article 27 of the statute of the court, the
Government of Sudan and the other member states and non-members of the
association are obliged to cooperate with the international court

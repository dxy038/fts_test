Ad hoc networks are self-organized wireless networks that can be set up in a fully distributed fashion without the assistance of wired centralized infrastructure. Such networks capture a lot of interest among research community and standardization bodies for almost the last decade. For the time being, the evaluation of such application deployed over ad hoc networks is done almost through simulation which did not reflect their real behavior. Our intent is therefore to cope with this shortcoming and to evaluate accurately on a real environment the performance of a video streaming application running in ad hoc networks. This paper presents the results of an experiment, conducted in fall 2006, in the "city of telecoms". The latter is museum which where innovative applications in the area of telecommunication are presented to public. This experiment aims at evaluating for the video streaming application the network performance metrics as the link stability, the packet loss, delay... The objective was to determine the potential suitability and profitability of the deployment of video streaming application over an ad hoc network.

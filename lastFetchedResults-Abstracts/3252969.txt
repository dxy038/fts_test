This paper describes a new design of a rotary voice coil motor (RVCM) which suitable for short angular stroke. Reluctance model of proposed RVCM is discussed. Aimed at the requirement of rotary direct drive valve, an optimization objective function which takes into account the maximum acceleration ability and the magnet circuit is formulated. The design parameters optimization is carried out by the particle swarm optimization(PSO) method. The optimized parameters are validated by the FEM method. It is shown that the new design enhances the maximum acceleration ability which means high frequency response.

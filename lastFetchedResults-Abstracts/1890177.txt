Objective: Orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption (OIIRR) is considered to be
an important sequel associated with orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). OTM after Socket
preservation enhances the periodontal condition before orthodontic space closure. The purpose
of this study is to investigate the histologic effects of NanoBone®, a new highly nonsintered
porous nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite bone on root resorption following OTM.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on four male dogs. In
each dog, four defects were created at the mesial aspects of the maxillary and mandibular
first premolars. The defects were filled with NanoBone®. We used the NiTi closed coil for
mesial movement of the first premolar tooth. When the experimental teeth moved approximately
halfway into the defects, after two months, the animals were sacrificed and we harvested
the area of interest. The first premolar root and adjacent tissues were histologically
evaluated. The three-way ANOVA statistical test was used for comparison.
Results: The mean root resorption in the synthetic bone substitute group was 22.87 ±
11.25×10-4 mm2 in the maxilla and 21.41 ± 11.25×10-4 mm2 in the mandible. Statistically,
there was no significant difference compared to the control group (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: The use of a substitution graft in the nano particle has some positive effects
in accessing healthy periodontal tissue following orthodontic procedures without significant
influence on root resorption (RR). Histological evaluation in the present study showed
osteoblastic activity and remodeling environment of nanoparticles in NanoBone®.

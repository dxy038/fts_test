Blind path identification with the help of RFID technology not only makes the blind can gain feelings of orientation during walking, but also has the knowledge of the exactly location of the street. The main idea is that when a blind man walking on the path which has electronic tags pre-built under the tile of the blind path, those tags activated by radio wave came from the RFID reader sent their identity codes transmitted by the reader to the computer, and after the query of the database, the number of the street, the name of the shop of the current location of the blind will be known immediately, meanwhile, the corresponding voice data will be sent via earphones to the blind in order to get the precise identification. The system is composed of the hardware and software. The hardware includes the electronic tags, reader, MCU, wireless earphone and GSM circuit. The software is consisted of the database that controls the read-write of the tags, the management of the street info as well as the sending of the voice data. Experimental result shows that the system almost can achieve the proposed objective and provide the novel technology support for the blind path construction.

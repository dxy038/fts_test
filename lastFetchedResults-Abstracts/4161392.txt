Six partners from five European countries are cooperating within a R&amp;D BRITE EURAM project named SHIFT (superconducting high-T/sub c/ coils for high field technologies). The objective of this 3-year project is to develop basic technologies for manufacturing magnets producing high fields operating in the temperature range 20-30 K: HTS wires, coils based on bulk parts, coil structures and cooling system. The potential applications are pulsed magnets for power quality SMES and DC magnets for MRI, instrumentation and laboratory use. Specifications and designs of SMES for the voltage sags smoothing application have been performed and will be presented together with SMES designs for flicker mitigation. Main deliverables are the realization of a 6 Tesla demonstration coil cooled by closed cycle refrigeration and the design of a SMES coil for power quality applications. Target performances, conductors, test coil developments and designs are discussed in this paper.

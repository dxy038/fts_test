The objective of the present study to investigate fertility, pregnancy, and delivery in women with biventricular repair for pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (PAIVS). Using a nationwide registry (CONCOR), 37 patients with pulmonary atresia were identified, 6 of whom (aged 21 to 34 years) had biventricular repair for PAIVS. Three PAIVS patients had a total of 5 pregnancies, including 1 abortion and 1 ectopic pregnancy. Besides minor noncardiac complications, the 3 live-birth pregnancies were successful. None of the women reported infertility or irregularities (hypermenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, polymenorrhoea, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea) of their natural menstrual cycle. In conclusion, successful pregnancy in women with biventricular repair for PAIVS is possible, and only minor complications were observed. Infertility and menstrual cycle disorders do not appear to be more prevalent than usual.

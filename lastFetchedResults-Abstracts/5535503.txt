The interior-point filter algorithm (IPFA) is based on a primal-dual interior-point algorithm with a filter set which can be updated after every iteration, and the algorithm will not cycle between two points that alternately decrease the constraint violation and the barrier objective function. The simulation results from IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE 57-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system show that using the algorithm for power system reactive power optimization possesses good robustness and fast convergence.

The objective of this study was to provide population frequency distribution data for non–high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) concentrations and to evaluate whether differences exist by gender, ethnicity, or level of education. Serum levels of non–HDL cholesterol and sociodemographic characteristics were determined for 3,618 black, 3,528 Mexican-American, and 6,043 white women and men, aged ≥25 years, from a national cross-sectional survey of the US population (National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1988–1994). Age-adjusted non–HDL cholesterol concentrations were lower in women than men (154.1 vs 160.4 mg/dL, p &lt;0.001). In women and men, age was positively associated with non–HDL cholesterol in the 25 to 64-year age range, and the slope of the association was steeper for women. For women and men ≥65 years, age was negatively associated with non–HDL cholesterol, and the slope of the association was steeper for men. Black women and men had lower non–HDL cholesterol levels than either Mexican-American or white women and men (women, p &lt;0.02; men, p &lt;0.001, for both ethnic contrasts). Women with less education had higher levels of non–HDL cholesterol than women with more education (p &lt;0.01). These nationally representative population frequency distribution data provide non–HDL cholesterol reference levels for clinicians and investigators and indicate that there are significant variations in non–HDL cholesterol by gender, age, ethnicity, and level of education.

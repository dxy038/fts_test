Objective: To develop a new type of miniature intelligent ventilator, which can be used for the pre-hospitalized and critical in-patients with respiratory failure and in need of first-aid and transport. Methods: The model designed and manufactured by the principle of electro-pneumatic control, with switch of time and pressure, microcomputer chip control, pneumatic circuit, electrical circuit, and integrated design of its structure, enables the miniaturization and integration of ventilating parameter monitoring, alarming, and adjusting of oxygen concentration. Results: The model is now the smallest and most handy electro-pneumatic type with digital display home and abroad. Conclusion: The product being small and light, and able to work long hours, meets the needs of handy and quick manipulation in the course of first-aid and transport, with conventional ventilating mode, monitor and alarm. It fills the blank of this type of product home and abroad. It is very suitable for the pre-hospitalized and critical in-patients with respiratory failure and in need of first-aid and transport, thereby has a great prospect of dissemination and application.

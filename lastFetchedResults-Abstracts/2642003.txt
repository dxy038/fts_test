Introduction: The alignment of information systems with organizational objectives is a key challenge for health care organizations and the key to the success of the organization. The aim of this study was to review the literature on aligning health information systems with organizational objectives by organizations’ chief information officers (CIOs). Methods: A literature review was carried out using Google search engine, PubMed and Science Direct databases. The search strategy included using keywords such as “aligning”, “health information system”, “organizational objective”, “health care organization” and “CIO” to search in journals (full text and abstracts), books, proceeding of conference articles, and scientific documents from 1998 to 2014. An estimated total of 89 articles, books, theses, and proceedings were retrieved of which 35 cases were selected based on their relevance to this issue. Results: Despite introduction of various methods and mechanisms in the literature, all studies agreed on several steps for alignment of information system with organizational objectives. These objectives included understanding the organization, understanding the information technology domain and its capabilities, creating multiple information technology strategies and implementation of strategies by the chief information officers. It was possible to receive feedback and change the strategy of choice at every step. Conclusion: Aligning information systems with organizational objectives is a dynamic process. Achieving this alignment requires a structured process. The most important mechanisms for this alignment include content, timing and personnel linkage in the process by chief information officers.

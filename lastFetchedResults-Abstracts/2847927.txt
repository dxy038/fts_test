In this paper, we investigated the efficient management of operating room in hospitals. We present a stochastic model with the objective of minimizing the operating costs of hospital. The patient preference and stochastic surgery demand are considered in the model, and then a column generation (CG)-based preference algorithm is proposed to solve the issue of surgery block-scheduling problem. By means of a large number of computational experiments we provided an idea of the cost-saving opportunities.

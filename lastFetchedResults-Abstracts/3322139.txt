The problem of the synthesis of dynamic output feedback controllers for linear systems subject to control, state and feedback constraints is addressed. A methodology to compute a compensator that guarantees both the local stability of the closed-loop system and the respect of the constraints is proposed. The used approach consists in solving an optimization problem with LMI constraints and a non-convex objective function. Hence a linearization algorithm is proposed for solving it. A numerical example that illustrates the proposed methodology is also given.

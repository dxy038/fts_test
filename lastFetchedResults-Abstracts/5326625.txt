Human brain is exceptionally complex and simple at the same time. Its extremely composite biological structure results in human everyday behavior. Many people might consider this behavior rather simple than complex. In our research we will concentrate on the ways with which the human brain can process English and other human languages because taken in general sense, the ability to speak English or other natural languages is only serious distinguishing feature that rises humans over the rest of the world making a human an intellectual being. For the purpose of our research we consider natural language as a naturally-formed symbolic system completely independent of these symbolsÂ´ physical nature. This is a little more general than a common natural language definition. The principles of natural language processing in the brain are most important for us if we want to build equally powerful artificial general intelligence. We start with the features of the human brain neurons and neural networks, and step by step create a computer model of the human brain networks that is capable of processing and generating a reasonable speech. The main objective of our research is to reveal how the tiny single neurons working together can produce intellectual-like behaviour that exhibits itself in proper speech comprehension and generation in accordance with current context.

Through the use of multi-objective genetic optimization and radial basis functions fitting, a novel method has been developed which presents to the designer the hypersurface of Pareto-optimal design points. For the first time it is now possible to characterize the design space boundaries of a circuit topology over a broad range of design specifications, all within transistor-level accuracy. This technique is illustrated with the presentation of the design space for two different types of circuits: a Miller-compensated operational transconductance amplifier, and an LC-tank voltage-controlled oscillator.

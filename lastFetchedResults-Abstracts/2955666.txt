Error-free 140 Mbit/s transmission experiments with optically generated millimeter-waves at frequencies at 18 and 60-70 GHz are reported. The millimeter-wave signals depict quartz accuracy and low phase noise &lt;-80 dBc/Hz (@ 1 kHz). For bidirectional transmissions two millimeter-wave carriers one for the radio link to the mobile receiver (down link) and one for the uplink-millimeter-wave mixer in the base station are generated by optical heterodyning.

Some typical digital high-efficiency coding algorithms applied to the different types of digital transmission systems are discussed, and the resultant picture quality degradation is examined. Techniques for bit-rate reduction, which is fundamental to high-efficiency coding, are described, namely interframe prediction and conditional picture replenishment, hybrid coding using the discrete cosine transform, and vector quantization. Pulse-code-modulation noise, coding distortion, and channel coding error are considered. Subjective and objective methods for evaluating coded pictures are described.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

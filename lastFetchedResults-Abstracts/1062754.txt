Four new dimeric spiro-azaplilones, cochliodones A–D (1–4), two new azaphliones, chaetoviridines E and F (5 and 6), a new epi-chaetoviridin A (7), together with five known compounds, chaetoviridin A (8), ergosterol (9), chaetochalasin A (10), 24(R)-5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6-22-diene-3β-ol (11), and ergosterol-β-d-glucoside (12) were isolated from the fungi Chaetomium cochliodes VTh01 and C. cochliodes CTh05. Structures and stereochemistry of the atropisomers 1–3 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 5, 10, and 11 exhibited antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, while 3, 5, 6, 10, and 11 showed antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, 5 and 6 also showed cytotoxicity against the KB, BC1, and NCI-H187 cell lines.

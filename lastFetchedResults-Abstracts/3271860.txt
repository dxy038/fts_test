Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products, which usually provide a large number of feature combinations, a fact that poses a unique set of challenges for software testing. Recently, many SPL testing approaches have been proposed, among them pair wise combinatorial techniques that aim at selecting products to test based on the pairs of feature combinations such products provide. These approaches regard SPL testing as an optimization problem where either coverage (maximize) or test suite size (minimize) are considered as the main optimization objective. Instead, we take a multi-objective view where the two objectives are equally important. In this exploratory paper we propose a zero-one mathematical linear program for solving the multi-objective problem and present an algorithm to compute the true Pareto front, hence an optimal solution, from the feature model of a SPL. The evaluation with 118 feature models revealed an interesting trade-off between reducing the number of constraints in the linear program and the runtime which opens up several venues for future research.

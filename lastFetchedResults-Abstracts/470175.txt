Objective
The objective of the study was to describe our experience with the Objective Structured Clinical Exam during the third-year obstetrics/gynecology clerkship.
Study design
Our 8-station Objective Structured Clinical Exam is described in detail. We analyzed grades from the Objective Structured Clinical Exam for overall distribution, comparing among and between groups by year and among exam sites and correlating with the National Board of Medical Examiners subject exam and the final clerkship grades.
Results
The Objective Structured Clinical Exam is provided at 3 sites, 1 at a technically advanced simulation center. Most students (54.6%) received a grade of A; however, the mean grade from the Objective Structured Clinical Exam at the simulation center (3.41 on a 4-point grade-point average scale) was lower than that at the clinic sites (3.60, P = .005; 3.73, P< .001). Effect of rotation order was identified only in the first year. Grades from the Objective Structured Clinical Exam were positively but weakly correlated with National Board of Medical Examiners subject exam and final clerkship grades.
Conclusion
An Objective Structured Clinical Exam in the obstetrics/gynecology clerkship can be administered with limited resources and provides a valuable assessment method.

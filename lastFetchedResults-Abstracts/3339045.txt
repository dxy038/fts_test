This paper proposes a linear precoding that aims at maximizing the sum-rate in a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. In this scenario some receivers harvest energy while the others decode information at the same time. The sum-rate for information decoding users is considered as the optimization policy where the transmit power constraint and power harvesting per user constraints are taken into account. Since the objective function of the sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex, it is difficult to find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm to find a locally optimal design based on a sequential convex approximation (SCA) method. In this way, the non-convex optimization problem is approximated by a convex program at each iteration. Finally, with the aid of the concept of the Rate-Energy (R-E) region simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvement compared to existing works.

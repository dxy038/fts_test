The objective of this research was to obtain the environmentally optimal design of a building with the following starting conditions: constant constructed surface, constant volume, square floor layout, and a variable number of floors. For this purpose, the study evaluated the impact of CO2 emissions stemming from the energy needed to maintain the building at a constant temperature of 19 °C in winter and 25 °C in the summer. Furthermore, one of the results was the CO2 emissions curve from the manufacturing of the materials used in the construction of the building and the building envelope.

The energy consumed to cool and heat the building was calculated by means of the simplified method specified in the ISO/DIS/13790 standard. The building was thus regarded as a monozone with the consequent simplifications. The matrix method was used to calculate the building’s structure for the purpose of obtaining the CO2 emissions from the concrete and steel needed to construct it. The result obtained was the curve representing the CO2 emissions, depending on building height. The source of these emissions was the energy consumption from heating and cooling as well as from the manufacture of construction materials. The results of the study indicated that the useful life of the building was a very important factor to take into account. The methodology used in this study could be used by building designers to design buildings with an optimal height for the reduction of negative environmental impacts.

This paper introduces a computational methodology developed to extract information about public lighting points. The objective is to give electricity companies exact information about the actual luminaries and bulbs installed on the lighting poles, thus minimizing commercial losses. The developed electronic system, that incorporates hardware and software elements, is discussed, as well as a theoretical background concerning spectrum signature detection and the computational intelligence employed to classify lamp classes and wattages. First experimental results obtained from the devised system are presented.

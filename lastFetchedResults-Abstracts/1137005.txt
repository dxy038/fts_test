J?rgensenâ€™s Love Ya Hate Ya: The Sociolinguistic Study of Youth Language and Youth Identities is a leitmotif anthology using youth language variety, linguistic variety choice, and language variety attitudes in multiple contexts. J?rgensen and the contributing authors provide ample illustrations of quantitative as well as qualitative research analyzing the following as they relate to youth language variety use: social relationships and youth identity, the objective of choosing to remain foreign, the significance of employing differing interactional frames (linguistic practices), vocative and phatic use in youth variety, the poly-lingual tendency of urban youth, and the attitudes surrounding youth language varieties as they vary from the standard.

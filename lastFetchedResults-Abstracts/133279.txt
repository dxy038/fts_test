In this paper, we present a model for layout optimization of water distribution networks for a given reliability. A mathematical concept of reliability is used to measure the reliability of the network. The model starts from a predefined maximum layout including all the possible and useful links. The model is applied for achieving the optimum layout satisfying a predetermined reliability set by the user. This is done via a penalty term included in the objective function. The applicability of the model for the layout optimization of pipe networks with predefined reliability is illustrated by testing the method against a benchmark example from the literature.

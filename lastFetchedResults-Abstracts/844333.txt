Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are stochastic and robust meta-heuristics of evolutionary
computation field useful to solve optimization problems in image processing applications.
Recently, as special mechanism to avoid being trapped in local minimum, the ergodicity
property of chaotic sequences has been used in various designs of EAs. Three differential
evolution approaches based on chaotic sequences using logistic equation for image
enhancement process are proposed in this paper. Differential evolution is a simple yet
powerful evolutionary optimization algorithm that has been successfully used in solving
continuous problems. The proposed chaotic differential evolution schemes have fast convergence
rate but also maintain the diversity of the population so as to escape from local
optima. In this paper, the image contrast enhancement is approached as a constrained nonlinear
optimization problem. The objective of the proposed chaotic differential evolution
schemes is to maximize the fitness criterion in order to enhance the contrast and detail
in the image by adapting the parameters using a contrast enhancement technique. The proposed
chaotic differential evolution schemes are compared with classical differential evolution
to two testing images. Simulation results on three images show that the application
of chaotic sequences instead of random sequences is a possible strategy to improve the
performance of classical differential evolution optimization algorithm.

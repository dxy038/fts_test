Digital cameras usually use a single sensor covered with a colour filter array which samples only one colour at the location of each pixel. Restoring a full-colour image by the demosaicking technique is a key task in the digital imaging pipeline. This study proposes a novel demosaicking approach based on the existing directional filtering and weighting techniques. The contributions of this study are two-fold. First, the authors analyse the advantages and limitations of the existing directional filtering and weighting techniques, and improve the two existing techniques in order to suppress the common demosaicking artefacts. Second, the authors give a new estimated scheme for the reconstruction of the colour components. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the recent six state-of-the-art demosaicking methods in terms of both subjective and objective measures.

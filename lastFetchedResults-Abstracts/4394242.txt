The main objective of this study is to introduce a simple, low-latency and accurate algorithm for real-time detection of P-QRS-T waves in the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. In the proposed method, a method based on signal first order derivative and adaptive threshold adjustment is employed for real-time detection of QRS complex. Also, detection and delineation of P- and T-waves are achieved by correlation analysis conducted between signal and their templates. The algorithm is tested by use of MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and QT Database. The obtained results based on QT database show the sensitivity and positive predictivity of Se=99.63% and P+=99.83%, Se=99.83% and P+=99.98%, Se=99.74% and P+=99.89% for detection of P, QRS, and T-waves, respectively, and Se=99.81% and P+=99.70% for detection of QRS complex based on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database.

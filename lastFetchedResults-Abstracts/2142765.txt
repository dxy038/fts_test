This paper presented a multi-objective indicator system for the performance evaluation of crop production system based on emergy method. Eight emergy indicators were selected to analyze the crop production system in the 31 provinces of mainland China to compare intensive use, scale management, investment density, environmental pressure, output benefit, output density, output per capita, and economic benefit. This paper conducted a comparison of each indicator in different provinces, and divided the 31 provinces into 10 groups by cluster analysis. The results show that: the crop production system among provinces has a significant difference and it is summarized into 10 development modes; with the development of modern agriculture, Chinese crop production system still complies with the inputâ€“output balance; the majority of provinces cannot achieve win-win between economic investment and environmental health; most of the underdeveloped provinces with high productivity may not be able to obtain good economic benefit; there is a significant positive correlation between the scale management degree and emergy output per capita in the crop production system; 10 development modes and policy suggestions are deduced. It is concluded that emergy-based multi-objective indicators can serve as an effective method in the evaluation of crop production system.

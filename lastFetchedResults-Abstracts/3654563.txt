One of the objectives of this paper is to discuss the mathematical requirements that the expansion functions must satisfy in the method of moments (MM) solution of an operator equation. A simple differential equation is solved to demonstrate these requirements. The second objective is to study the numerical stability of point matching method, Galerkin´s method, and the method of least squares. Pocklington´s integral equation is considered and numerical results are presented to illustrate the effect of various choices of weighting functions on the rate of convergence. Finally, it is shown that certain choices of expansion and weighting functions yield numerically acceptable results even though they are not admissible from a strictly mathematical point of view. The reason for this paradox is outlined.

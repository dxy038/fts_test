The idea of the future Internet of Services is to combine several services of numerous service providers to new value-added services or applications. To sell these services on so-called service marketplaces the providers have to ensure both a high quality and a high quality reliability. But how could a provider of a composed service know the quality-reliability of his service without costly tests? This article describes an approach to predict the quality-reliability of service composition based on a three-step algorithm. The algorithm calculates the expected number of service level objective (SLO) violations caused by the compositionÂ´s sub-services. The expected number of SLO violations can be used as metric for the QoS-reliability.

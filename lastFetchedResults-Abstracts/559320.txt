Performing different tillage methods with different tractors can produce an immediate effect because of the varying degrees of physical manipulation. Our objective was to investigate some soil physical properties response to short-term tillage application using different tractors on a fine loamy, mixed, mesic Calcixerollic Xerochrepts soil in Hamadan. Two tillage systems [chisel plow (CP), and moldboard plow (MP)] and three tractors [John Deer (J), Romania (R) and Massey Ferguson ( MF)] were evaluated using a factorial split-plot design with three replications. Within row zone (RZ) and traffic zone (TZ) soil samples were collected from four layers to a depth of 30 cm by the end of wheat growth season, and compared for total porosity (TP), macroporosity (Macro-P), microporosity (Micro-P) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). The results showed that MP significantly increased TP and Macro-P. Tillage plus tractor influenced the TP in the RZ. The TP ranking was  MF > J > R with CP at all the successive layers but this order was not observed with MP. While the impacts of tillage treatments on Macro-P within both TZ and RZ were significant, the change within TZ was not considerable. The Micro-P was also significantly affected within TZ. The Ks and Macro-P were higher within TZ with CP than MP, while Microâ€“P was decreased with CP. It was concluded that the performance of conservational tillage system using MF had beneficial effect on the selected soil physical properties.

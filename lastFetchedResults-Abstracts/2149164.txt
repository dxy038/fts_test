One of the basic applications of passive defense knowledge is to protect cities and citizens against military and terrorist attacks. Therefore, in addition to explaining the types of military and terrorist threats, it is necessary to analyze and identify the most important areas, installations, and centers of the city that are exposed to threats in order that authorities and relevant institutions could deal with the threats through taking passive defense measures.

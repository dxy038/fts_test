The initial state of a design under verification has a major impact on the ability of stimuli generators to successfully generate the requested stimuli. For complexity reasons, most stimuli generators use sequential solutions without planning ahead. Therefore, in many cases they fail to produce consistent stimuli due to an inadequate selection of the initial state. We propose a method, based on machine learning techniques, to improve generation success by learning the relationship between the initial state vector and generation success. We applied the proposed method in two different settings, with the objective of improving generation success and coverage in processor and system level generation. In both settings, the proposed method significantly reduced generation failures and enabled faster coverage.

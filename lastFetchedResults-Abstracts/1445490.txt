Input shapers with time delays have proved useful in many applications related to controls for various oscillatory devices, for example flexible manipulators and cranes. In the paper, a novel approach for designing a zero-vibration signal shaper based on equally distributed delay is proposed. The parameter assessment of the shaper is based on the spectral approach. Various characteristics of the shaper are analyzed and compared with the classical zero-vibration shaper with a lumped delay. The analysis shows that the novel shaper is a slower, but more robust alternative to the classical shaper. Besides, the discrete implementation of the shaper is proposed and tested. It includes zero placement based parameter adjustment with the objective to preserve full compensation of the oscillatory mode by the discrete algorithm.

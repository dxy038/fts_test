This paper proposes an improved frame interpolation algorithm. The forward motion vectors between the previous and the next key frame is gained at first by traditional block matching algorithm. Then we get the backward motion vectors by using the dynamic search range based on the already known forward motion vector. After smoothing the bidirectional motion vectors, we can get more accurate motion vectors which are closer to the true object motion. By bidirectional motion compensation, we can obtain the side information at last. According to the simulation results, the proposed algorithm works better than the conventional one in subjective quality as well as in objective quality, and it is very simple to be implemented on DVC system.

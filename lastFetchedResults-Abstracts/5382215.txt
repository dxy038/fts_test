The relationship between economics and water resources are the core issue to this system in Sheshuihe Watershed, China. Effective analysis of the relationship between the two will make a breakthrough in the modern methods of water resources planning. Any water management system serves a certain area and all the activities within this system constitute a macro-economic system. The relationship between macroeconomics and water resources are complicated, that is, they depend on, while at the same time, restrict each other. Macro-economic growth will affect the growth of water demand. Changes in the economic structure and urbanization will have an impact on the proportion of industrial water irrigation. Various types of pollutants&#8217; emitting will possibly pollute water bodies and cause an enormous reduction of water resources. The size of the investment on the expansion of water supply capacity during economic accumulation and the proportion of sewage treatment not only impact of the investments on other economic sectors, but also directly influence the management in the development and utilization of water resources. Therefore, the study on multi-objective optimization model is prerequisite to water planning management for Sheshuihe Watershed.

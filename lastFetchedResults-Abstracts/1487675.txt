The objective was to examine the relationship of trained panel sensory scores of cooked pork with fatty acid composition, muscle fiber type, and meat quality characteristics from Berkshire pigs. No or few associations were found between the panel sensory scores of cooked meat, especially tenderness attributes, and fatty acid composition; however, intramuscular fat content positively correlated with off-flavor score (r = 0.31). On the other hand, the morphological characteristics of muscle fibers were correlated with panel sensory values. Muscles with smaller cross-sectional area and higher density of fibers were more closely associated with softer, more tender panel scores and a lower number of chews than muscles with larger fiber area and lower density of fibers. The water holding capacity test of filter-paper fluid uptake was moderately correlated with panel scores of softness (r = 0.33), initial tenderness (r = 0.38), chewiness (r = 0.40), juiciness (r = − 0.27), flavor intensity (r = − 0.23), and off-flavor (r = 0.30). Panel sensory values of Berkshire pig meat was moderately related to postmortem meat quality, especially water holding capacity. A more thorough understanding of the relationships between fatty acid composition and muscle fiber type with palatability is needed.

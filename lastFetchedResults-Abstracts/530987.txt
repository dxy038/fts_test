Background: HLA compatibility between transplant donor and recipient is one of the major determinants of transplant outcome. Objective: To determine HLA class I by PCR- Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide Probe (PCR-SSOP) in cord blood donors. Methods: Genomic DNA of 142 cord blood samples registered at the Cord Blood Bank of Iran at Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center, was prepared and HLA class I was determined by the PCR-SSOP. Results: A total of 284 HLA-A alleles was identified of which A*02 and A*24 were the most common. Among 284 HLA-B and HLA-C alleles, B*35, B*51, Cw*4 and Cw*12 were the most frequent alleles in the studied population. Conclusion: Amplification of HLA loci with PCR-SSOP has proved to be a reliable method for HLA-A, -B and -C genotyping.

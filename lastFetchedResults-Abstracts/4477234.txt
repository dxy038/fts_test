The objective of this paper is the development of a concept of problem solving in industrial technology majors from theory to practice. In studying industrial technology subjects, where the rigor is not on mathematics or deep concepts, but problem solution, students are exposed to some classical techniques of industrial engineering, production and operations research, and engineering economics problems. Although some good students "all too often "pick up" problem solving skills through experience or as a bye product of doing exercises". It has been invariably, seen that they never learn the problem solving strategies for efficient and elegant solutions

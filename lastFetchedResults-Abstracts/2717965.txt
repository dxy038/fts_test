This paper presents a novel nonlinear guidance scheme for ground track control of aerial vehicles. The proposed guidance logic is derived using the sliding mode control technique, and is particularly suited for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. The main objective of the guidance algorithm is to control the lateral track error of the vehicle during flight, and to keep it as small as possible. This is achieved by banking the vehicle, that is, by executing roll maneuvers. The guidance scheme must perform well both for small and large lateral track errors, without saturating the roll angle of the vehicle, which serves as the control input for the guidance algorithm. The limitations of a linear sliding surface for lateral guidance are indicated; a nonlinear sliding surface is thereafter proposed which overcomes these limitations, and also meets the criterion of a good helmsman. Stability of the nonlinear surface is proved using Lyapunov theory; control boundedness is also proved to ensure that the controls are not saturated even for large track errors. The proposed guidance law is implemented on the flight control computer of a scaled YAK-54 UAV and flight results for different scenarios (consisting of both small and large errors) are presented and discussed. The flight test results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed guidance scheme.

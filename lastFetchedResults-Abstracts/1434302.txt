An antigen (Ag), CFP-10, found in tissue fluids of tuberculosis (TB) patients may be an ultimate candidate for use as a sensitive TB marker with a sensing method for early simplified diagnosis of TB. In this study, chemical and optical optimizations were carried out using novel immuno-materials for establishment of a self-assembled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical immunosensor system for detection of CFP-10, which is valuable for pre-clinical work, prior to conduct of massive clinical observations. For creation of a simple sensing interface, a monoclonal antibody (anti-CFP-10) was immobilized directly on a gold surface, followed by blocking with cystamine. Orientation and accessibility of anti-CFP-10 were assessed by the selective binding of CFP-10. Recent results indicate that the reusability of the sensor chip adopting the cystamine method was found to be preferable to other immobilization methods. A linear relationship was well correlated between SPR angle shift and CFP concentrations in the range from 100 ng mL−1 to 1 μg mL−1. Modification of the SPR chip with antibody provides a simple experimental platform for investigation of isolated proteins under experimental conditions resembling those of their native environment.

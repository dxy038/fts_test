The channel assignment in cellular systems has the task of planning the reuse of available frequencies in a spectrum efficient way. A classical approach to frequency assignment problems, when applied to the frequency planning of cellular networks, does not enable this task to be performed in an efficient way, since it does not consider the cumulative effect of interferers. We propose a new model for the channel assignment problem in narrow-band cellular networks, which accounts for the cumulative effect of interferers. In this model, the service area is partitioned into regions and the propagation characteristics are assigned by means of the levels received in each region by the considered base stations (BSs). The objective is to maximize the sum of traffic loads offered by regions in which the ratio between the received power and the sum of powers received from interfering transmissions is above a threshold value. We also present an algorithm, based on tabu search (TS) techniques, to solve this problem. This algorithm has been tested on some instances obtained by using a simple radio channel model and on a real world instance

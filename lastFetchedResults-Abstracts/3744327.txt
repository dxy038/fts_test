A dual-fiber low-loss bidirectional optical rotary joint has been developed. It employs GRIN lenses and rhomboid prisms to couple optical signals from two rotating optical fibers to two stationary optical fibers. This optical joint features low coupling loss, small rotational variation, electrically passive operation, wide bandwidth, and bidirectional transmission capability. The operation principles and fabrication procedures are discussed.

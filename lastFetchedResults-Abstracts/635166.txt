The objective of the present study was to study the release and effect of TNT from dumped ammunition. Cleaved artillery shells were placed in static brackish water systems for 5 months, and another 12 months with 5 cm sediment burial. The toxicity was determined in bioassays with crustaceans (Nitocra spinipes and Hyalella azteca) and/or European flounder (Platichtys flesus). The water phase was analysed for TNT using colorimetric method and GC-MS. This study showed a rapid release of TNT to acutely toxic concentrations when the cleaved ammuniton was not covered with sediment under static conditions, but that the release was effectively inhibited by sediment burial of the artillery shells. Hence, at least in a short-term perspective, acute adverse effects of sediment-buried ammunition on aquatic organisms should be greatly reduced.

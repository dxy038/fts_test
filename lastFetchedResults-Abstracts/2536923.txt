Background and Objective: Obesity and body fat percentage seem to be associated with respiratory problems, although the mechanism of this correlation is not very clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 12-week HIIT training on lung function, serum leptin level and lipid profile in inactive obese men.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-two inactive obese men aged 18 to 30 years voluntarily participated in the study and randomly divided into two exercise (n = 11) and control (n = 11) groups. Subjects in the exercise group performed high-intensity interval training for 12 weeks, 3 sessions per week with a heart rate of 70 to 85% HRmax. Serum leptin level, lipid profile and lung (pulmonary) function were measured before and after 12 weeks of HIIT training. All statistical tests (paired sample T-test, Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analysis) were performed and considered significant at a p?0.05.

Results: The results indicated a significant decrease in levels of leptin (p=0.001) and cholesterol (p=0.001) after 12 weeks of HIIT. Also, HDL non-significantly increased and triglycerides, LDL and VLDL were non-significantly decreased after 12 weeks of HIIT training (P > 0.05). In the case of lung function, this type of exercise significantly increased FVC (p=0.003).

Conclusion: In conclusion, 12-week HIIT training decreased cholesterol and serum leptin in obese men and this decrease was associated with increased lung function and profound changes in body fat.

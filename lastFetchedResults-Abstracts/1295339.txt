The crew scheduling problem in the airline industry is extensively investigated in the operations research literature since efficient crew employment can drastically reduce operational costs of airline companies. Given the flight schedule of an airline company, crew scheduling is the process of assigning all necessary crew members in such a way that the airline is able to operate all its flights and constructing a roster line for each employee minimizing the corresponding overall cost for personnel. In this paper, we present a scatter search algorithm for the airline crew rostering problem. The objective is to assign a personalized roster to each crew member minimizing the overall operational costs while ensuring the social quality of the schedule. We combine different complementary meta-heuristic crew scheduling combination and improvement principles. Detailed computational experiments in a real-life problem environment are presented investigating all characteristics of the procedure. Moreover, we compare the proposed scatter search algorithm with optimal solutions obtained by an exact branch-and-price procedure and a steepest descent variable neighbourhood search.

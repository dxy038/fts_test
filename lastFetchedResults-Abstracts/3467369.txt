The study of arrays of magnetic nanowires is of interest for potential technological applications in perpendicular recording media. Magnetostatic interactions between individual nanowires play an important role in the magnetization process of the array. The objective of this work is to theoretically analyze the influence of the symmetry of the geometrical array. It is shown that magnetization reversal in an array with cubic symmetry proceeds in a nearly continuous way, whereas random disposition favors reversal in a single step. Furthermore, the magnetic interactions of nanowires in the array give rise to self-organized collective magnetization that can be ascribed to complex systems described by fractals.

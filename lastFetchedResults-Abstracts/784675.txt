Objective: Several limitations of published bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) equations have
been reported. The aims were to develop in a multiethnic, elderly population a new prediction equation and crossvalidate
it along with some published BIA equations for estimating fat-free mass using deuterium oxide dilution
as the reference method. Design and setting: Cross-sectional study of elderly from five developing countries.
Methods: Total body water (TBW) measured by deuterium dilution was used to determine fat-free mass (FFM) in
383 subjects. Anthropometric and BIA variables were also measured. Only 377 subjects were included for the
analysis, randomly divided into development and cross-validation groups after stratified by gender. Stepwise
model selection was used to generate the model and Bland Altman analysis was used to test agreement. Results:
FFM = 2.95 - 3.89 (Gender) + 0.514 (Ht2/Z) + 0.090 (Waist) + 0.156 (Body weight). The model fit parameters
were an R2, total F-Ratio, and the SEE of 0.88, 314.3, and 3.3, respectively. None of the published BIA equations
met the criteria for agreement. The new BIA equation underestimated FFM by just 0.3 kg in the cross-validation
sample. The mean of the difference between FFM by TBW and the new BIA equation were not significantly
different; 95% of the differences were between the limits of agreement of -6.3 to 6.9 kg of FFM. There was no
significant association between the mean of the differences and their averages (r= 0.008 and p= 0.2).
Conclusions: This new BIA equation offers a valid option compared with some of the current published BIA
equations to estimate FFM in elderly subjects from five developing countries

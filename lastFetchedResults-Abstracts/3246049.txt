Collaboration has been recognized as a significant process that holds the value creation opportunity in supply chain management. Facing uncertain environments, firms have strived to achieve greater supply chain collaboration to leverage the resources and knowledge of their suppliers and customers. The objective of this study is to give a review of the literature that relates to various approaches to improve the performance in the collaborative supply chain. To achieve this objective, we propose the multi-agent models as relational approaches that improve the communication and interaction between agents and to get them to cooperate and coordinate with each others. Although, this paper does not stop at this level but it extends to raise other factors that lead to improve the performance of a company. Among these factors, new information technologies that play, as far as collaboration, an important role in the logistics network. The use of techniques based on information sharing which are supported by information technologies is fast becoming an indispensable tool for designing and managing complex supply chain systems today.

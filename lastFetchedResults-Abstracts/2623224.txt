Almond (P. dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb; syn. P. amygdalus Batsch) is one of the most
important species of Prunus genus and Amygdalus sub species that is grown commercially in
large areas of the world. Since Iranian varieties have been poorly characterized so far, molecular
studies are suitable means in order to identify and characterize the relationship between Iranian
cultivars. Using microsatellite molecular markers is important particularly due to their high
accuracy in studying the genome of the fruit trees. Also, using molecular markers with highpolymorphisms
bands production is necessary in order to determine of distinguish between
different cultivars. The objective of this study was optimization of Random Amplified Microsatellite
Polymorphism (RAMP) marker, which is combination of SSR and RAPD markers, for study of genetic
diversity and relationship among different native and foreign almond cultivars. Genomic DNA was
extracted from young leaf tissues and PCR reactions were done using 100 primers of
microsatellites and 120 RAPD selected primers. Results showed that some of microsatellites loci
similar UDP96003 locus in combination with RAPD primers produced polymorphisms bands
that could show the diversity between different almond cultivars. Also, OPA8 primer produced
the maximum polymorphism bands among all RAPD primers. The best primer combination for
RAMP marker in this research was UDP96003R-OPA8. Also, between different PCR programs
40 C was optimum annealing temperature. Primer combination of RAMP marker and optimized
PCR programs that was obtained in this work, can used for study the genetic diversity of Prunus
genus, construction of linkage map, saturation of available linkage map and finding the markers
linked to special trait

We consider content discovery and provision in wireless networks with infrastructure, where mobile nodes store, advertise and consume contents while Broker entities running on infrastructure devices let demand and offer meet. We refer to this paradigm as match-making, and study its performance in terms of query success probability, i.e., the probability that a content query is successful. To ensure high success probability, we design a credit-based scheme that entices rational users to provide their contents (thus discouraging free-riding behavior), and that guarantees them a fair treatment. Furthermore, through a feedback and banning mechanism, we effectively counter malicious users whose sole objective is to disrupt the system. The performance of our match-making scheme is shown through ns-3 simulations.

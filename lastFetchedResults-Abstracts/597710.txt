The information systems (IS) department is made up of employees in different information technology/information system (IT/IS) skills. Recruitment should therefore use different selection criteria for personnel in different roles. This study used the IT/IS skills examined in past literature as guidelines for recruitment. Expert review and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were then used to analyze the selection criteria used in recruitment for five different IS roles. The five roles were: project manager, systems analyst, database administrator, programmer and systems engineer. The results highlighted the importance of selection criteria by showing that each role differed greatly in the professional skills required. This study can therefore provide human resource departments with fair and objective selection criteria. A practical recruitment strategy can also be designed to reduce the chances of personnel not performing as expected after being employed.

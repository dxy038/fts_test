Due to the superiority of structure, four wheel independent drive electric vehicle (4WID EV) provides great potential for direct yaw control. In the process of driving, its very necessary to detect and suppress the tire skid in real time. In order to suppress the tire skid and achieve reasonable torque allocation, a novel method is proposed to detect the tire state and determine the constraints of torque allocation. ADAMS/Car was used to establish vehicle model for dynamic simulation. VehicleÂ´s ramp steering on the good road and on the road with split adhesion coefficient was simulated respectively, when the initial velocity of vehicle is 60km/h and the slop of ramp steering is 15deg/s. Lateral acceleration, slip angle and yaw rate for the two different roads were studied comparatively. Lateral acceleration, yaw rate and slip angle can be controlled well by independent torque control based on the constraints of torque allocation, which makes it possible for vehicle to move along the objective trajectory.

Distributed Generation (DG) has gained increasing popularity as a viable element of electric power systems. DG as a small scale generation sources located at or near load center is usually deployed within the distribution system. Presence of DG has many positive impacts such as reducing transmission and distribution network congestion, differing costly upgrades, and improving the overall system performance by reducing power losses and enhancing voltage profiles. To achieve these positive impacts from DG installation, the DG has to be optimally placed and sized. This paper presents a technique for DG location and sizing using an computational intelligence based on Evolutionary Programming (EP). The objective of this paper is to minimize the power losses which will also monitor the voltage profile at all the buses. The proposed technique was tested on the IEEE 69 bus radial distribution system. The results obtained by the presented technique are compared with the other technique namely Artificial Immune System (AIS).

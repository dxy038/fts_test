A new hybrid jet impingement/micro-channel cooling scheme is studied numerically for use in high-heat-flux thermal management of electronic and power devices. The device is developed with the objective of improving the temperature uniformity of the cooled object. A numerical model based on the k–ω SST turbulent model is developed and validated experimentally. This model is used to carry out a parametrical characterization of the heat sink. The study shows that variations in key parameters of jet impingement and micro-channel technologies allow for the cooling scheme to obtain a wide range of temperature profiles for the cooled object.

The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of cumulative interference from multiple UWB systems to the downlink of GSM900, GSM-1800, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA. Since indoor environments are focused on, a three-dimensional geometry for the spatial distribution of the UWB devices is considered. To obtain a realistic scenario, a traffic model describing the transmission activity of the UWB devices is taken into account. In this paper, we use a statistical model, i.e. a probability density function (PDF), describing the cumulative interference from multiple UWB devices. With the model, the maximum interference from multiple UWB devices, the maximum acceptable UWB-device density, the minimum distance between UWB devices and receiver are derived in different link budget degradation.

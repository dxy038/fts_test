In the present work, structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of tungsten-bronze structured Ba5SmTi3Nb7O30 ceramics, synthesized by mechanical activation and conventional solid-state reaction processes, have been studied with an objective of comparing the properties of the specimens synthesized by the two processes. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the formation of the compound in an orthorhombic structure by both the processes. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the formation of a fine granular microstructure in the specimen synthesized by mechanical activation process compared to the specimen synthesized by conventional solid-state method. The specimen prepared using mechanical activation process exhibits improved electrical properties with higher dielectric constant, lower dielectric loss and higher resistivity. The effective remanent polarization ( P Â¯ r ) value, d33 value and pyroelectric coefficients are also observed to be higher in the sample synthesized by the mechanical activation process.

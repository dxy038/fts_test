In this study, a multiple-input non-isolated DC/DC converter topology is presented. The proposed multiple-input DC/DC converter is proficient for energy diversification from renewable and storage energy sources individually or simultaneously. It can be operated in buck, boost and buck-boost modes of operation with the capability of bidirectional power flow to achieve desired voltage level on either side. The development of small-signal modelling based on state-space averaging has been discussed. In addition, a power management control scheme for the proposed converter has also been presented. The proposed concept has been investigated through simulation using the MATLAB/Simulink environment and validated experimentally on a laboratory prototype using dSPACE 1103 real time digital controller.

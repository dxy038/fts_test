In this paper, a three-port bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed for grid-interactive photovoltaic (PV) system application. The three-phase topology is suitable for residential power requirement. The control of battery and PV are naturally decoupled. In addition, the port interface with PV is current type which can implement maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and soft switching under wide variation of PV terminal voltage. Finally, simulation and experimental results are proposed to verify the power control in different operation modes.

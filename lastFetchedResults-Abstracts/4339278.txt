In this paper we present objectives and strategies of the NAVELEC research project co-funded by the European GNSS Supervisory Authority with funding from the 6th Framework Programme of the European Community for Research and Technological Development. The project objective is to assess how the European Global Navigation Satellite System related solutions can enhance the operation and control of the European power system over wide areas. Some basic functionalities of the GALILEO system are given first, then we summarize the questionnaire, set at the initial stage of the project, and provide the analysis of received responses from transmission system operators. Two generic strategies to upgrade existing electrical power transmission networks as well as major steps to upgrade underlying infrastructures, are presented.

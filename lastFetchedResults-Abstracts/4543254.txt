Lifetime extension is a key issue of WSNs. The WSN lifetime can be extended K times if the number K of disjoint covers are found. Under the energy condition, another consideration is load balancing for covers to sense targets and transmit data to base station since sensors need to consume the energy to do these tasks. The energy consumption of sensors depends on the number of covered targets. Therefore, this work addresses a 2-objective optimization problem that to find the maximum number of covers for lifetime extension and to minimize the variance in the covered targets of sensors for every cover for load balancing. To resolve this problem, this work proposes three algorithms based on NSGA-II since it has better performance on two or three objectives of multi-objective optimization problems. Experimental results revealed conflicts among the objectives, to extend the lifetime lowered the load balancing of covers.

Photovoltaic is used today as an important source for supplying many applications. The generated power of photovoltaic has low reliability. So a battery used as auxiliary source in presented system. Control of the system has two main objectives. First, photovoltaic is used at maximum power point tracking and second, voltage of DC link be fixed in constant value to obtain objectives Respectively, A Boost and a bidirectional Buck-Boost DC-DC converter is used which the two converters are connected in DC link by common capacitor. Therefore, the system can be called as multi input/output system. The perturbation and observation method is used to maximize power point tracking the photovoltaic. Also a new algorithm is proposed for controlling of the battery which can determine battery operation modes independently of knowing power load. This system simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK software. Simulated results have shown the system will operate correctly and objectives will be obtained.

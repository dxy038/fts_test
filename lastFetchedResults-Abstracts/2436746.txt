In this paper, we focus on the vendor selection problem (VSP) for material supply in large-scale water conservancy and hydropower construction projects, and establish a corresponding model to solve this problem. After stating the problem, we introduce some basic knowledge of level-2 fuzzy sets and the way to transform them to normal fuzzy sets. Then we use the CCP model to handle the bifuzzy objective functions and constraints, based on a series of preparations, we transform the multi-objective integer model under bifuzzy environment into a deterministic model, then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve this problem. The model is illustrated with an actual application to construction material supply.

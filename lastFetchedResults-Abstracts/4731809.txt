Multichannel blind deconvolution has received increasing attention during the last decade. Martone (see Proc. ICC Â´95, p.1505-08, 1995) extended the super-exponential method proposed by Shalvi and Weinstein (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.39, p.504-19, 1993, and Blind Deconvolution New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p.121-80, 1994) for single-channel blind deconvolution to multichannel blind deconvolution. However, the Martone extension suffers from two types of serious drawbacks. The objective of this paper is to obviate these drawbacks and to propose three approaches to multichannel blind deconvolution. In the first approach, we present a multichannel super-exponential algorithm. In the second approach, we present a super-exponential deflation algorithm. In the third approach, we present a two-stage super-exponential algorithm

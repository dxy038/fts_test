Problems of synchronous rectification in a parallel-module DC-DC power converter system are described. Excessive current and abnormal oscillation occur in the parallel system due to the inherent capabilities of the synchronous rectifier (such as bidirectional power flow and the cross-coupled topology of MOSFETs). The abnormal oscillation, which causes an excessive voltage stress, is analyzed and confirmed by experiments

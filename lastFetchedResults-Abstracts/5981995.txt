This paper describes the end-to-end reconfigurability (E<sup>2</sup>R II) research framework and focuses on the current status of the activities inside the consortium. E<sup>2</sup>R II is a partly funded project inside the Sixth Framework Programme of European Community. The E R II project is part of a wider program, started with the E<sup>2</sup>R I project in 2004. In this program, concepts and solutions in order to enable, manage and control the end-to-end connectivity in highly heterogeneous environments are developed, taking into account the different radio access technologies potentially active (2G/3G cellular, 4G/B3G, IEEE 802.xx, broadcast...). The key objective of the E R II project is to devise, develop, trial and showcase architectural design of reconfigurable devices and supporting system functions with the aim to offer an extensive set of operational choices to the users, application and service providers, operators, manufacturers and regulators in the context of heterogeneous systems.

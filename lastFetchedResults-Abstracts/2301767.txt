The main objective of this paper is to investigate and analyse the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupling phenomena and their influences on the repository safety. In this paper, the high-level waste (HLW) disposal concept in drifts in clay formation with backfilled bentonite buffer is represented numerically using the CODE_BRIGHT developed by the Technical University of Catalonia in Barcelona. The parameters of clay and bentonite used in the simulation are determined by laboratory and in situ experiments. The calculation results are presented to show the hydro-mechanical (HM) processes during the operation phase and the THM processes in the after-closure phase. According to the simulation results, the most probable critical processes for the disposal project have been represented and analyzed. The work also provides an input for additional development regarding the design, assessment and validation of the HLW disposal concept.

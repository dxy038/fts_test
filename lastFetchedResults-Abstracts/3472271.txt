A basic objective in the development of a surface current injection technique (SCIT) is to provide an inexpensive, transportable simulator which will allow electromagnetic pulse (EMP) hardness checks of aircraft in the field. The development effort has been conducted as a combined theoretical and experimental study. Detailed solutions for free field scattering problems are obtained from computer models such as the THREDE finite difference code. It has been found that simplified one- and two-dimensional models can be used to provide insight and understanding less easily obtained from more detailed numerical models. These models appear to be especially useful in the study of basic symmetry and polarity requirements which are likely to be employed in any direct injection scheme. In this paper, electrical and mechanical analogs are developed and applied to EMP simulation by direct injection. Predictions of the simplified models are compared to results obtained with the THREDE finite difference code.

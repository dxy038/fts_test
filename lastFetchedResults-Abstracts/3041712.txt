The objective of this work is to present a new method for accelerating MoM computation in antenna arrays. This method is based on a new class of frequency independent entire domain basis functions that are directly obtained from the characteristic modes defined by Harrington and Mautz (IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat., vol. AP-19, no. 2, pp. 622-628, 1971).

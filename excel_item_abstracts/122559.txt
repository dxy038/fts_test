Tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases with high mortality rates especially in developing countries. Drug resistance to tuberculosis is increasing contineously which is significant threat to tuberculosis control programs.There are few effective drugs against mycobacterium tubercolosis. The objective was to examine the resistance to first-line anti - tuberculous agents mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Kashan . In this descriptive study, the mycobacterrium tuberculosis organisms were isolated from 100 sputum positive patients referred to the Kashan Tuberculosis Control Center . Sputum samples were cultured on the lowenstain - jensen medium by standard method, and then the type of isolatate mycobacteriam were determined . 94 mycobacterium tuberculosis strain and 6 mycobacterium other than tuberculosis (MOTT) strains were isolated . The drug resistance test of isoniazid (INH) , Rifampin (RIF) , streptomycin (STM) and Ethambutol (ETH) were applied according to standard methods . The proportion resistant of 94 M.T strains were as follow : 43.6 % (41 out of 94) to RIF alone, 18.1% (17out of 94)to INH alone, 14.9% (14 out of 94) to STM alone , and 3.2% ( 3out to 94) to ETH alone . Resistance to INH+ RIF was 17% with a range of 9.7-24.3%. Due to high prevalence of drug resistance, further analytical study is needed to elucidate the underlying factor for mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance .

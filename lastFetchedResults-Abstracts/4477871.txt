The United State Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) has developed a methodology and model to aid achieving a system operational availability requirement optimally. The ASOAR model was developed in response to a challenge specified within Secretary of Defense Guidance. The objective is to size and fund peacetime stock secondary item inventory to support programmed weapon systems availability rates and operating tempos. Since analytical methodologies to achieve this do not now exist, the Service will develop and institute the ability to size weapon system initial and replenishment secondary item inventories to meet explicit weapon system availability and operating tempo objectives. The ASOAR model is a macro-level analysis tool. It is basically used for system level reliability, availability and maintainability analysis and early-on logistics support analysis (LSA). The ASOAR model uses a top down approach that improves the state-of-the-art in integrating RAM and LSA and in satisfying the Secretary of Defense objective.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

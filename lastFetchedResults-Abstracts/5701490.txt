Many control design constraints may be formulated as semi-infinite constraints. Examples include hard constraints on time and frequency responses and robustness constraints. A useful algorithm for solving such inequalities is the outer approximations algorithm. The standard outer approximations algorithm for solving an infinite set of inequalities &#966;(<e1>x</e1>,<e1>y</e1>)&#10877;0 for all <e1>y</e1>&#8712; <e1>Y</e1> proceeds by solving at iteration <e1>i</e1> of the master algorithm, a finite set of inequalities (&#966;(<e1>x</e1>,<e1>y</e1>)&#10877;0 for all <e1>y</e1>&#8712;<e1>Y</e1> <sub>i</sub>&#8834;<e1>Y</e1>) to yield <e1>x</e1><sub>i</sub> and then updating <e1>Y</e1><sub>i</sub> to <e1>Y</e1><sub>i+1</sub>=<e1>Y</e1> <sub>i</sub>&#8746;{<e1>y</e1><sub>i</sub>} where <e1>y</e1><sub>i</sub>&#8712;arg max {&#966;(<e1>x</e1><sub>i</sub>,<e1>y </e1>)|<e1>y</e1>&#8712;<e1>Y</e1>}. Since global optimization is computationally extremely expensive, it is desirable to reduce the number of such optimizations. A modified version of the outer approximations algorithm which achieves this objective is presented

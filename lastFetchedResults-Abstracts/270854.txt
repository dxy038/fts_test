objective of this paper is the analysis of the dynamics of structural systems with
randomly varying parameters. The formulation and analysis are based on the theory of random
integral equations. The general analysis (including error estimation) is applied to the problems of
harmonic vibration of(i) a beam with randomly varying density and (ii) a uniform beam resting on
a randomly inhomogeneous Winkler foundation. For these applications, the analytical formulae
for the mean and correlation function of the response are illustrated numerically and graphically

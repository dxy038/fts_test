A systematic materials selection procedure for spatially limited, light-weight structural components is derived. The basic strategy is to utilize the available space to its full extent and introduce a free variable that accounts for the shape variation in the interior of the component necessary to meet the requirements as the material is varied. This approach leads to a specific class of objective equations and performance indices. By introducing constraint indices describing the combined demands from spatial limitations and functional requirements the performance indices attain relatively simple mathematical forms, thus facilitating the identification and ranking of viable shape-material combinations.

Offshore software development outsourcing (OSDO) is an emerging business paradigm implemented by many software development organisations. OSDO faces a variety of challenges including temporal, geographical and intercultural differences. The objective of this research is to identify the intercultural challenges faced by vendors in OSDO relationships. A systematic literature review process for the identification of these challenges from vendors´ perspective has been used. The findings reveal `language and language proficiency´, `national culture´ and `organisational culture´ as the critical intercultural challenges for vendors in OSDO relationships. These challenges based on study strategy have been further analysed.

Optimization is one of the important stages in the design process. In this paper the genetic algorithms method is applied for weight and transient dynamic response and two constraints including critical buckling loads and principle strains optimization of laminated composite cylindrical shells. The multi-objective function seeks the minimum structural weight and transient dynamic response. Nine design variables including material properties (fibre and matrix), volume fraction of fibre, fibre orientation and thickness of each layer are considered. In analytical solution, vibration of composite circular cylindrical shells are investigated based on the first-order shear deformation shell theory. The boundary conditions are assumed to be fully simply support. The dynamic response of the composite shells is studied under transverse impulse and axial compressive loads. The modal technique is used to develop the analytical solution of the composite cylindrical shell. The solution for the shell under the given loading conditions can be found using the convolution integrals. An example of simply supported laminated composite cylindrical shells is given to demonstrate the optimality of the solution obtained by the genetic algorithms technique. Results are shown that the weight coefficient of multi-objective function and the type of the constraints have considerable effect on the optimum weight and dynamic response.

In order to investigate the study  of The optimization of lemon verbena (Lippia citriodora) medicinal plant tissue culture, a research was performed during 2010 and 2011 years in the experiment on the bases of Randomized Complete Design (RCD) with five replications in the Garden of Medicinal Plant at the Department of Agricultural, Islamic Azad University of Chaloos, Iran. Our objective was to observe the effect of plant growth regulators in vitro to generate a method of propagation. We collected the mature seeds from the field and germination was carried out into petridishes following surface sterilization with 0.1% HgCl2 for 6 minutes. The cotyledons of germinated seedlings were excised and inoculated on to Murashige and Skoog (MS) media containing different plant growth hormones including 6-benzylaminopurine (IAA), Kinetin (Kn), indole- 3-acetic acid (IAA),  After four weeks of inoculation, shoot regeneration occurred and they attained up to 3.85 cm in MS + IAA (1.0 mg/l). Combination of IAA and Kn accelerated shoot proliferation with an average length of 5.18 cm. Callogenic response was obtained when IAA was supplemented in MS medium.

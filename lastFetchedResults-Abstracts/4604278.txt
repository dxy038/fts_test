The major objective of the design of safe crowded transmitting antenna sites is not only to determine a safe zone around each individual antenna, but also to establish safety areas, both at the antenna site itself and at neighboring areas. The requirement is to ascertain the safety regions by considering the following parameters at each test point (TP) (or area segment): the contribution of N colocated radiating antennas to the total radiation incident at the TP; the radiation pattern of each antenna; the near/far field region of each antenna; most importantly, the different permissible exposure limits (PELs) associated with each operating frequency at the antenna site. Implementation of all the above-mentioned aspects in a suitable computer requires resources that only expert knowledgeable organizations possess. The graphically aided tool presented facilitates the calculation of a "safety zone" for RADHAZ around a crowded antenna site from the knowledge of the "safety ranges" which correspond to the individual transmitting antennas comprising it.

Humic acids are the most active components of soil organic matter and have been shown to have an hormone-like activity thus stimulating plant growth. The objective of this work was to verify the quantitative and qualitative yield responses of the table grape cv. Italia after the application of a humic acid at various phenological stages. The humic acid used in this study has been extracted from a clay soil of the Apulia region and was applied at a concentration of 100 mg L-1 in four different times: pre-bloom (I), full-bloom (II), fruit set (III) and veraison (IV) and in two years, 2007 and 2008. The following parameters were measured at harvesting: berry size, °Brix, pH and titratable acidity. Finally, the °Brix/titratable acidity ratio has been calculated. Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) readings were performed every 30 days up to harvesting time on the leaves of the middle shoots. No statistical differences were observed between the two years for all the parameters examined. The humic acid applied at full-bloom (II) induced a significant increase of berry size (width and weight) and a significant improvement of the other quality parameters (titratable acidity and °Brix/titratable acidity) with respect to the control. This study confirmed that humic acids, if applied at full-bloom, can induce significant increase of qualitative and quantitative parameters in table grape and can find a positive application in an organic and sustainable viticulture.

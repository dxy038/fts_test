Background: Low birth weight (LBW or birth weight  < 2500 g) is one of the most serious health problems in today's world.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate growth parameters of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admitted LBW preterm neonates at corrected ages of 6 and 12 months.
Materials and Methods: In a prospective cohort (follow up) study, all LBW preterm neonates whom were admitted to Shahid Sadoughi Hospital NICU in 2008, followed up for one year and their weight, height and head circumference evaluated at ages of 6 and 12 months.
Results: Twenty four boys and 26 girls with mean gestational age of 31.3±2.7 weeks and mean birth weight of 1480.3±422.8 gr were evaluated. The most frequency of underweight and short stature was seen at the age of six months. Exclusive breast feeding infants had the lowest frequency of underweight at the age of six. Frequency of underweight at the age of six months and NICU stay days were more in neonates with birth weight of less than 1000 gr.
Conclusion: It is necessary to emphasize on the importance of growth assessment of LBW children and proper education of their mothers about nutrition of their children for early and timely diagnosis and management of growth retardation and prevention of subsequent problems

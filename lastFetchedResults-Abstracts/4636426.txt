In this paper a two-stage power electronic interface is presented for Vehicle to Grid applications. A bidirectional full-bridge converter stage supplies regulated DC voltage for two parallel five-level Active Neutral Point Clamped (ANPC) inverters which generate split-phase AC voltage to power a residential load. The AC output voltage of the multilevel ANPC inverters meets the harmonic limits of IEEE 519. A backstepping controller is developed for the converter stage which meets the voltage regulation objective while adapting for variation in the battery input voltage, system disturbances, and an unknown load. Stability analysis and simulation results validate this approach.

Objective: Bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the citation patterns of researchers publishing in the American Journal of Veterinary Research (AJVR). Methods: The more than 25,000 bibliographic references appearing in the AJVR from 2001 to 2003 were examined for material type, date of publication, and frequency of journals cited. Journal titles were ranked in decreasing order of productivity to create a core list of journals most frequently used by veterinary medical researchers. Results: The majority of items cited were journals (88.8%), followed by books (9.8%) and gray literature (2.1%). Current sources of information were favored; 65% of the journals and 77% of the books were published in 1990 or later. Dividing the cited articles into 3 even zones revealed that 24 journals produced 7,361 cited articles in the first zone. One hundred thirty-nine journals were responsible for 7,414 cited articles in zone 2, and 1,409 journals produced 7,422 cited articles in zone 3. Conclusions: A core collection of veterinary medicine journals would include 49 veterinary medicine journals from zones 1 and 2. Libraries supporting a veterinary curriculum or veterinary research should also include veterinary medical journals from Zone 3, as well as provide access to journals in non-veterinary subjects such as biochemistry, virology, orthopedics, and surgery and a selection of general science and medical journals.

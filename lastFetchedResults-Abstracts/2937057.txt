A methodology and integrated system for the optimization of integrated circuits is presented. We propose the method that combines the symbolic analyzer and effective optimization algorithms to shorten the computation time. After selecting a circuit topology, the symbolic simulator SAGA2 is invoked to model the circuit. SAGA2 generates exact analytic expressions which describe the circuitÂ´s behavior. The model is then passed to the design optimization program. The optimization program sizes all elements to satisfy the performance constraints and a user-defined design objective. A forms-based user interface is provided to allow the designer to specify the problem easily. The system had been applied in the filter circuit design

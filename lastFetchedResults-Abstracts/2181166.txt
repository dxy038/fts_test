The gradual evolution of traditional agriculture has caused the agricultural
organizations to employ the more advanced economic and commerce rules of the
present time. These practices require thorough knowledge of finance and
Accounting. To be precise, gaining access to information such as the product
producing cost is vital for the higher management to decide on its future strategies.
In order to provide such data, the establishment of a suitable Product producing
Cost Accounting System seems inevitable. The objective of this research is to
provide an appropriate template for determining the cost of producing nuts crops
(Almond & Walnut) to be employed in Cost Accounting Systems. This will
provide the necessary information for the higher managements of the agricultural
organizations. The material for this paper is gathered by library and field research
methods by learning the stages of nuts crops (Almond & Walnut) producing,
theoretical accounting fundamentals, and Cost Analysis templates of producing
such products. In order to evaluate and verify the suggested findings in this
research, the Delphi method is used and the results are represented to the specialists
for review. A related questionnaire is also provided along with the results to collect
the reviewer's opinions. This process will continue until a common and stable
result is reached.

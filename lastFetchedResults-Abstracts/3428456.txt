The effort to be described had as its objective the development of new techniques to define simplified models of digital integrated circuits suitable for use with the SCEPTRE or similar computer programs. These models were required to account for normal electrical performance as well as performance in an environment of ionizing and/or neutron radiation. Techniques were established to derive models capable of representing both the radiation effects and the first order transient response of the microcircuits as system components for many different kinds of digital integrated circuits. A "black-box" approach was employed to achieve the desired results.

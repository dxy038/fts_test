Bidirectional inductive power transfer systems allow contactless energy transfer between stationary electricity source and movable consumers (both sides) in each direction. By using this system, electric vehicles can operate as moving energy resources, able to inject electrical energy back into the power grid. Fundamentally, a mathematical model is required to design and optionally to control these systems due to their complexity. This paper deals with the dynamic model of a bidirectional-inductive power transfer system as well as with its analysis.

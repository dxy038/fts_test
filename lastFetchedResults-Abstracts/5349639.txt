In this paper, the features of electrical power steering and semi-active suspension systems have been done a more in-depth study. In order to achieve the common objective of improving the ride comfort and handing stability of automobile, an integrated control strategy was proposed to achieve the control of electrical power steering and semi-active suspension systems. In a well on the basis of experimental data, the mathematical model of electrical power steering and semi-active suspension systems were adopted to predict the characteristics of these two systems. In order to achieve the simulation of the integrated control strategy, a PID controller for electrical power steering and an optimum controller for semi-active suspension systems were designed under MATLAB environment, and a vehicle system dynamics model including the electrical power steering and semi-active suspension systems was also established. By automotive ride comfort and handing stability simulation, the integrated control strategy was proved to be effective.

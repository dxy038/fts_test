A new patented project, which is called &#194;&#191;Michelson project&#194;&#191;, is developed by XLIM (French research institute based at the University of Limoges) and the objective of this study is to measure a high electromagnetic field in a selected location. This system requires a simple equipement composed of a target, a receiving antenna, and a system of acquisition. The principle is the one after : the target is illuminated by the incident field which must be measured and diffracts this field in different directions and according to different polarizations. A receiving antenna is placed at a given place and recovers a part of the diffracted field at this location. The purpose is to come back to the incident field which lights up the target from the voltage measured on the receiving antenna output. To obtain the incident field, a global transfer function of this system must be calculated before. Moreover to be able to measure high electromagnetic field, this system has the advantage to disturb less the field in the zone of the measurement, if the dimensions of the target are small. According to the source and so according to the chosen receiving antenna, the Michelson project can measure as well harmonic signals as transient signals.

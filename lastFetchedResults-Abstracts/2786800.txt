Business decision-makers need various decision analyses to meet highly competitive environments. With increasing cost of intensive workforce and lowering marginal-profit products, how to break the limitation of resources and optimally reallocate all of the precious resources is the major issue to create the competitive advantages in the high-technology industry. Moreover, the second industrial upgrading has developed industrial robots in some production processes for providing more value-added production activities. Therefore, this study proposed a new idea of multi-objective programming with changeable spaces (decision space and objective space) named changeable spaces programming extending the concept of De Novo programming. The best production resources reallocation in re-designing the decision space can be considered how to improve the multi-objective of unmanned factory planning in a high-technology firm for achieving aspiration level. This method provides decision analysis planning and not only to reach ideal point but also how achieve aspiration level in resource reallocation/redesign. A numerical example illustrates how to release the trade-offs between industrial robots and a workforce subject to constrains of the wafer manufacturing and how stage by stage to improve each objective for closing aspiration level in objective space. Computational results are demonstrated supporting the proposed model is easily implemented with flexible effort in practical.

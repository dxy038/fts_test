Due to its exceptional efficiency and performance a number of todayÂ´s global organizations and alliances recognized and embraced new and constantly developed H.264/A VC compression method designed for a broad range of video applications. This article describes advantages of H.264/AVC in mobile communication systems with limited bandwidth. Due to very efficient compression method H.264/AVC enables and provides transport of high quality video on low data rates. In order to demonstrate these abilities we made a comparison of H.264/AVC coding technique with MPEG-4 ASP (advanced simple profile) coding technique currently used in mobile systems. Quality measurement and assessment of encoded video test sequences was performed with peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), video quality metric (VQM) and structural similarity (SSIM) objective quality measurement methods. Results showed and confirmed great efficiency and performance possibilities which will make H.264/A VC ubiquitous coding technique of multimedia world in time to come.

Passive millimeter-wave image are heavily blurred due to the low-pass filter effect of antenna and the influence of noise. Aimed the problem, an improved method using partial differential equations applied to passive millimeter-wave image high-resolution is proposed. Based on nonlinear bidirectional Laplace filter algorithm, a new passive millimeter-wave image enhancement is proposed. For different characteristics regions of image, using different strategies for processing. Experimental results show that the new method can improve the quality of passive millimeter-wave image and reduce the noise more effectively compared with the original algorithm.

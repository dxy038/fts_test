Keyword advertisements are now widely employed to produce new profits on the web portal. Most common formats of the advertisement are single or double line of textual information but some advertisements are formed with multiple lines of keywords. We investigated the effects of the number of rows (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rows) and columns (1, 2, 3, 4 columns). The search time to find proper advertisement on the web site was measured as objective performances. Subjective evaluations (ease to search, aesthetics, familiarity, overall satisfaction) were also examined. The experimental results of the study showed usersÂ´ objective and subjective performance are usually best when the web site is simple. Web designers and owners can improve or efficiently design online keyword advertisement based on the results of this study.

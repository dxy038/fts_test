Presents the design of a bidirectional 800 kb/s transceiver the enables data transmission for T1 services over unconditioned telephone wire facilities. The transceiver transmits a 4-level PAM line code (2B1Q) and uses a baud-spaced sampled receiver. The DSP-based transceiver utilizes a custom CMOS VLSI 64-tap LMS adaptive filter chip to provide echo cancellation and decision-feedback equalization. Error-free full-duplex transmission is achieved over 16 kft. of 24 AWG cable or 12 kft. of 26 AWG cable

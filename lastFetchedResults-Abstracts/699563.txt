As increasing water shortages continue, water re-use is posing new challenges with treated wastewater becoming a significant source of non-potable water. Rapid detection strategies that target waterborne pathogens of concern to industry are gaining importance in the assessment of water quality. This study reports on the ability to recover spiked Cryptosporidium and Giardia from a variety of industrial wastewater streams of varied water quality. Incorporation of an internal quality control used commonly in finished water-enabled quantitative assessments of pathogen loads and we describe successful analysis of pre- and part-treated wastewater samples from four industrial sites. The method used combined calcium carbonate flocculation followed by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. Our focus will now aim at characterising the ambient parasites isolated from industrial wastewater with the objective of developing a suite of highly specific platform detection technologies targeted to industrial needs.

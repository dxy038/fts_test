Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is now widely used by industry to detect broken rotor bars and abnormal airgap eccentricity in a wide range of induction motors. The objective is to identify current components in the current signature pattern that are only a function of shorted turns and are not due to any other problem or mechanical drive characteristic. The results indicate that MCSA can diagnose shorted turns in mains and inverter fed induction motors.

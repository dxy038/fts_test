This paper adopts the assumption that cellular, broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and digital video broadcasting (DVB) systems can be co-operating components of a composite-radio infrastructure. It is believed that through the composite radio concept, operators will be enabled to offer efficient, in terms of cost and QoS, wireless access to broadband IP-based services. The exploitation of this infrastructure calls for the application of computational intelligence (CI) technologies for the development of appropriate, sophisticated service and network resource management functionality. In this context, this paper identifies and addresses the important problem of service configuration and distribution in a composite radio environment (SCD-CRE). The problemÂ´s objective is to determine the best way to accommodate a demand volume, with which the composite radio infrastructure is faced. The pro finds the QoS levels that can be offered, and the networks that can support the demand at the selected QoS levels. The paper includes a first approach to the definition, mathematical formulation, and solution of a version of the SCD-CRE problem. Results indicating some of the capabilities of the SCD-CRE are also presented. Further application fields for CI technologies are indicated, in the area of the necessary reconfiguration of the managed, radio and fixed, network segments.

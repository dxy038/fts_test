Serial dilutions of essential oils were made in 96 well microtiter plates. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Inhibitory zone diameter were assessed by Microdilution broth and Disc diffusion agar techniques, MIC50, MIC90 and MFC were also determined.
Results: Minimum inhibitory concentration 90(MIC90) essential oils of Thymus vulgaris, Petroselinum crispum, Cuminum cyminum and Bunium persicum were respectively 25, 72, 412, 130 Âµg/ml and Minimal Fungicide Concentration (MFC) were 48, 146, 62, 280. Inhibitory zone diameters were 28, 20, 12, 15 millimetres.
Conclusion: In this evaluation essential oils of Thymus vulgaris, Petroselinum crispum, Cuminum cyminum and Bunium persicum showed suitable antifungal effects against growth of standard strain of Candida albicans.

A multi-objective programming model is proposed in this paper for the operation of an electronic market enabled multi-supplier and multi-customer supply chain with uncertain variable costs and demands. In this supply chain, suppliers can provide many kinds of product to different customers directly or through electronic market. Uncertain variable costs are described as symmetrical and limited intervals; uncertain demands are described as a scenario set with certain probability. The operation model is constructed by using the robust optimization methods based on interval analysis and scenario analyses. In a numerical example, the solutions of the model can all ensure the robustness of the operation of the supply chain effectively when demands are uncertain, variable costs are uncertain, and demands and variable costs are all uncertain.

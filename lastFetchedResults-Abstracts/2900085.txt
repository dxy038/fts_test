Software outsourcing partnership (SOP) is mutually trusted inter-organisational software development relationship between client and vendor organisations based on shared risks and benefits. SOP is different to conventional software development outsourcing relationship, SOP could be considered as a long term relation with mutual adjustment and renegotiations of tasks and commitment that exceed mere contractual obligations stated in an initial phase of the collaboration. The objective of this research is to identify various factors that are significant for vendors in conversion of their existing outsourcing contractual relationship to partnership. We have performed a systematic literature review for identification of the factors. We have identified a list of factors such as ´mutual interdependence and shared values´, ´mutual trust´, ´effective and timely communication´, ´organisational proximity´ and ´quality production´ that play vital role in conversion of the existing outsourcing relationship to a partnership.

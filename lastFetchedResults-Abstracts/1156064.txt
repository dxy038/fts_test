Parameters design and characteristics optimization of a split-phase single-phase induction motor is proposed in this paper using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO considers the motor efficiency as objective function and five performance related items as constraints. The main advantages of the proposed technique are; its simple structure and its straightforward verification of maximum efficiency of induction motor for a given output power. The PSO algorithm was implemented on a test motor and therefore, a code has been provided under MATLAB software. The results show that the PSO method gives more suitable design optimization against conventional methods.

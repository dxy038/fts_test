Standardised and interoperable management solutions are an objective for the next generation of cloud to autonomically provision and configure resources in a manner generically applicable across platforms and applications. Cloud interoperability is desirable in spite of platforms having variable management requirements and applications having various resource demands. In this paper, the resource footprint of an application, Wisekar, developed at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi is explored, alongside consideration of its scalability with increasing volumes of requests. The limiting network resource in this deployment is bandwidth, which restricts the extent to which memory and CPU resources can be consumed, regardless of the number of application requests sent to the server. Definition of resource consumption relationships between attributes while servicing application requests leads to recommendations on server and network loading which optimises the overall utilisation across all. This results in an average footprint across CPU, memory and network of 0.85 (max. of 1).

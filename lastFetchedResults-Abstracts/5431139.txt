A decentralized rate control algorithm is proposed to decide mobile stationsÂ´ transmit rates for the reverse CDMA link. This decentralized algorithm outperforms the traditional proportional-fair algorithm in the micro-cellular environment especially, such as Manhattan street structure. In macro-cellular environment, the traditional proportional fair algorithm performs better, but the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to it. The objective is to maximize system throughput under the fairness restriction and minimize the forward link overhead. The proposed algorithm could reduce the system interference apparently and utilize the scarce radio resources more efficiently. The enhancement of system throughput is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and system level simulations

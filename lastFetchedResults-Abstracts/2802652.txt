In this paper, based on double auction and cell membrane optimization, a novel cloud resource management scheme is proposed with the economic methods adopted and the characteristics of resources and market in cloud environment considered. In the proposed scheme, the resources are priced by double auction, and the best solution for cloud resource allocation is got by cell membrane optimization algorithm to optimize the objective value. Three evaluation criterions are introduced to estimate the proposed resource allocation scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is both feasible and effective.

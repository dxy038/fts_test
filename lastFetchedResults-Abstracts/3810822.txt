Although the impulse insulation level of a power apparatus is specified under the standard 1.2&#215;50-&#956;s voltage wave, the apparatus seldom encounters such a voltage wave in the field. A wealth of knowledge exists on the behavior of air gaps under nonstandard lightning impulse voltages. The objective of the Task Force was to compile a bibliography on the nonstandard lightning impulse voltages and review the present state of research. This paper reviews the present status of research including the behaviour of air gaps under transient voltages, and the generation and measurement of fast-front impulse voltage waveforms

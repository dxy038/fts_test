The principle of the converter topology is based on a matrix linking each input phase to each output phase by a bidirectional power switch. However, the symmetry of the matrix is one of the advantages of matrix converter which allow the power flow in both directions and thus directly operate in four quadrants. This work presents an investigation on the performance of a wind-based chain of a double-fed asynchronous machine. The first analysis concerns the control strategy for the LMSE modulation. The simulation tests are performed using Matlab Simulink and the results are presented and analyzed.

This paper highlights a method of using open-source CAD (Computer Aided Design) software and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) in the manufacturing of building assembly systems. With the increase use of CAD/CAM technologies, and internet access on a global scale, we investigate open platforms to improve global production of modular systems and tackle fundamental building manufacturing systems for global application. This paper, examines a method of producing designs from conception to manufacture, using custom algorithms written in open-source CAD software. This system is geared primarily for the construction of buildings using moldable composite materials for housing developments in urban and rural regions in developing countries. The objective of this research is to create a system that is flexible for influencing and incorporating culture, design preference, and geographical innovation. A cradle molding device for manufacturing assembly systems was developed for producing block assemblies from moldable composites such as concrete, cob, and poured earth.

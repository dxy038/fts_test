This paper explains the origins of the Bioenergy Network of Excellence (NoE) “Overcoming Barriers to Bioenergy”. It outlines the reasoning behind the project’s overall objective of covering the entire bioenergy chain from biomass feedstock to end-products. One of the network’s other aims was to integrate partner activities scientifically and practically in such a way that it could continue beyond the period of European Community financial support. The consortium consisted of eight key bioenergy R&amp;D institutes in Europe. The work programme structure had three stages:1.
itial phase was identification of barriers to increase use of bioenergy in Europe, which included both technical and non-technical barriers. During this stage, barriers were analysed in terms of business opportunities. It was believed that by analysing case studies and industrial projects, common barriers can be identified.

cond phase was to address RTD goals and how to remove the barriers. A common strategy to overcome the barriers was considered. The target was to activate and carry-out jointly executed research projects. The integration structure could be established based on these projects.

 final phase, the integration structure and a legal framework was considered with regard to the partners’ present organisations and new EU initiatives concerning future network activities.

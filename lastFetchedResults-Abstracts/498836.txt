The present research has benefited from sociological and psychological theories, and is based on the principle that the more interaction between police and drivers, the more interaction between drivers and police, the more traffic regulations are obeyed.

Materials and Methods: The research is of applied type and the method used in it is survey. The research theories are also developed and formulated in the light of theoretical and experimental principles including five theories: social interactions, communicating with the public, force tool, considering the public's desires, and using reward and punishment system. Data was gathered from 50 traffic police staff selected through cluster random sampling in Shahrak-e-Azmayesh (Driving Test Complex), and 250 drivers were selected through simple random sampling in five zones in north, south, east, south and central part of Tehran.

Findings: The findings indicate that the more social interaction police have, the more loyal the public toward traffic regulations are. In other words, there is direct relationship between not using aggressive attitude toward the public and people's obeying traffic regulations. Moreover, persuasion and punishment system among traffic police staff can enhance level of their proper interaction with the public.

This paper presents general algorithms for solving redundancy optimization problem for non series-parallel networks. Using closed form expressions for star-delta and delta-star conversions, the exact system reliability expression (objective function) is written down in a straightforward manner. The Box method has been employed to get the optimal continuous solution. The integer solution is obtained by a modified Box method and Branch and bound technique. The scheme is illustrated with an example. The parametric method is used throughout

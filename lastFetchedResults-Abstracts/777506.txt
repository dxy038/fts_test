Artificial neural network (ANN) based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm makes use of the advantages of ANNs
such as noise rejection capability and not requiring any prior knowledge of the physical parameters relating to PV system. This paper
proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized ANN-based MPPT algorithm implemented in a stand-alone PV system with direct-coupled
induction motor drive. The major objective of this design is to eliminate dcâ€“dc converter and its accompanying losses. Implementing offline
ANN in DSP needs optimization of ANN structure to obtain an ideal size. GA optimization was used in this study to determine
neuron numbers in multi-layer perceptron neural network. Another objective of this work is to prevent the necessity of the trade-off
between the tracking speed and the oscillations around the maximum power point. Hence, varying step size is used in MPPT algorithm
and PI-controller is adopted for simple implementation. Simulation and experimental results have been used to demonstrate effectiveness
of the proposed method.

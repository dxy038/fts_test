The issues involved in the design of energy-efficient high-performance irrigation pump induction motors operating under typical field conditions are highlighted. Various factors deserving consideration, from the predesign survey to the final design stage, are discussed in detail. By resorting to optimisation techniques, suitable objective functions were evolved to arrive at an improved design, which is constrained by industrial practices and performance requirements. The new design is compared with the standard design, and its salient features are discussed to suggest useful guidelines

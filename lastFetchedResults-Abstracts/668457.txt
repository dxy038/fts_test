Poor delivery and distribution water in irrigation canals will cause the discontent of farmers, disrespect of equity in water delivery and increase operational losses. Therefore optimal water delivery scheduling will increase performance condition network, considerably. With the spread of computers and mathematical methods, it is possible that develop simulation and optimization mathematical models for optimal operation. In this study, Ants Colony System (ACS) optimization algorithm is used for development optimal water delivery in BP14 canal of Fumanat irrigation network in west of Gilan province. This canal has a length of 6852 meters with a trapezoidal cross section and capacity of 2.5 m3/s and land cover area of 2100 ha. The optimal delivery schedule canal is derived for two cases; single objective, canal capacity minimization and two objective including minimize canal capacity and delivery time. Comparison of the research with results obtained from Genetic Algorithm (GA) showed that ACS algorithm to GA in single objective state resulted in less canal capacity (90 l/s) and more irrigation schedule complement duration (10 hours). Also, the number of upstream gate regulations and water delivery deficiency obtained 1 and 0.04 percent, respectively. In two objective state, ACS determined less canal capacity (105 l/s) and more irrigation schedule complement duration (41 hours).

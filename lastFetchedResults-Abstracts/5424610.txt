In order to improve students´ motivation, SIEM (systematical information education method, which uses the learning theory based on cognitive psychology) is proposed. Through the application of SIEM to the goal of prompting computer programming education in the Java course, an evaluation of students´ motivation as reflected in passage of time as well as through other qualitative measures has been performed over the past three years. When used to evaluate the influence of the time factor on students´ motivation, it can simultaneously be used to analyze the factors inherent in the educational method that improves students´ motivation and it is expected that SIEM can also be applied as an effective assessment to be used to help professors improve a class. In this paper, we describe the background of the development of the SIEM assessment standard, objective evaluations of the class that uses SIEM, the expected educational effects of SIEM, and the relationship between SIEM and e-learning technology.

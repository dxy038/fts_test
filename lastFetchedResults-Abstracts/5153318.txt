This paper presents a new video compression technique which is based on adaptive vector quantization of multiwavelet coefficients. Three types of redundancies that are common in video sequences are spatial, temporal and psycho visual redundancies. In this work, the spatial redundancy is minimized using multiwavelet transform, temporal redundancy is minimized using Kite Cross Diamond Search motion estimation algorithm, and the psycho visual redundancy is minimized using adaptive vector quantization technique. The objective of the paper is to develop a low bit rate video coder with acceptable visual quality. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with wavelet based video coder. Simulation results show that multiwavelet based adaptive vector quantization gives better coding performance than wavelet based adaptive vector quantization scheme.

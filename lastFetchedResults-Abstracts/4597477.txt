The authors report on a series of full-scale photometric simulation studies conducted to examine the luminous environment within work stations used in typical office environments. The objective of these experimental studies was to develop explicit geometric relationships between a visual task and a lighting layout that maintains visual quality and minimizes power required. A broad range of ceiling integrated general and task lighting systems were examined in terms of their ability to maintain contrast and illuminance across the work plane. For each lighting system studied a range of furniture systems was employed to determine potential obstruction effects as a function of orientation and position in respect to a particular lighting layout. Experimental data expressed in terms of luminance contrast and illuminance across the task plane show the importance of developing and specifying explicit geometric relationships between a visual task and a lighting system layout. Data illustrating the variations in lighting quality as a function of geometry and task configuration are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

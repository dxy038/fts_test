The main objective of this paper is to establish a model of identification and assessment of utilization benefit of flood resources in order to provide decision basis and utilize flood resources more effectively. Therefore, a new benefit identification method with function-demand coupling is proposed. Taking the whole water system as the research object, the method constructs a functional index system in terms of function and effect, and a demand index system with respect to receptivity and demand of water supply areas. Then, by coupling supply and demand, utilization benefit of flood resources can be identified. Based on the identified benefit, the paper builds an integrated assessment model which can be used to value the quantifiable benefit of economy and eco-environment in money terms based on market price, and explores evaluation on social effects expressed in a degree score through the fuzzy optimization model based on entropy weight, Degree Score Method (DSM) is raised here by the author. The models have been tested by the Baicheng Project. From the results, it is clearly that there is remarkable economic, eco-environmental and social benefit of flood resources utilization. Therefore, making full use of the limited water, especially flood water resources, is regarded as an effective means to solve the problems of fresh water shortage and eco-environmental degeneration in this region. Consequently, flood resources utilization plays a dominant role in the sustainable development process of the region.

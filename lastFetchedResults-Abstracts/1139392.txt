A new high pressure homogeniser going up to 350 MPa was used to produce fine emulsions stabilised by methylcellulose for food applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of homogenising pressure on emulsifying and stabilising properties of methylcellulose, a food macromolecule extensively used as stabiliser in emulsions. Oil droplet size distributions of the emulsions were measured by laser-light scattering; rheological properties were characterised with a coaxial cylinder rheometer; and stability was evaluated by heating of the emulsions. Influence of homogenising pressure on interfacial properties (adsorption kinetics, interfacial tension and rheological behaviour) of the polymer was also studied at different pressure treatments. The results showed significant modifications in the structure and the texture of emulsions with increasing homogenising pressure. Homogenised methylcellulose solutions showed weaker thickening and stabilising properties compared to the one of the native methylcellulose.

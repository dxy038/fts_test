Liquidâ€“liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction followed by gas chromatography (GC) or high-performance liquid chromatography are traditional herbicide residue determination methods for environmental samples. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a solventless, fast, and sensitive alternative herbicide residue extraction method that can be applied to numerous environmental matrices. The objective of this paper was to review SPME literature regarding extraction theory, extraction modes, fiber types, and method optimization in conjunction with present and future SPME applications for herbicide determination in environmental samples.

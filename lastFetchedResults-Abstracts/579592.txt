Background and Objective:  In any research work, the tools used to approach the designed project goals should be evaluated. The purpose of the present study was to obtain validity and reliability of the questionnaire of student ratings of teaching in Ahvaz JundiShapur University of Medical Sciences. 
Subjects and Methods:  The questionnaire of student ratings of teaching was evaluated in a descriptive study. In this study the views of 70 expert faculty members and 5420 completed questionnaire by students were used.  To investigate the reliability, two methods of split-half and internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) were applied, and the validity was determined by three aspects of construct validity (factor analysis), concurrent validity and content validity. The Data were analyzed by SPSS-15 software.
Results: The factor analysis revealed 2 factors as tutor capability and expert teaching, which could explain 67.69 % of the total variance. The concurrent validity coefficiency was determined as 0.538 for the first 14 questions in comparison to question number 15. Within content validity the coefficient of all items was determined as 0.920. The internal consistency of questions showed a high correlation of all 15 questionnaire items. The Cronbachâ€™s alpha was 0.947 % and split-half reliability was 0.884%. 
Conclusion: It is concluded that student ratings questionnaire with a reasonable degree of validity and reliabilitycould be accounted as a suitable tool to evaluate the University teaching conditions.

The objective of this work was promote oxidation of β-glucan from oat bran with hydrogen peroxide at different concentration levels (0.3%, 0.6% and 0.9% H2O2) and reaction times (30 and 60 min), and evaluate the physicochemical and functional properties of isedoxidised β-glucan with in-vitro tests. An increase in carbonyl and carboxyl groups and alterations in swelling power were verified in the oxidised β-glucan. The cholic acid binding capacity increased in the oxidised β-glucan; however, the fat binding capacity was not affected. After chemical digestion, the available glucose of the oxidised β-glucan was increased. Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide decreased the viscosity, hardness, adhesiveness and gumminess of the β-glucan gels. More studies are necessary to determine the effect of the oxidative treatment of β-glucan on its technological properties in food products, and biological properties should be examined with in-vivo studies.

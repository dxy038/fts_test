One of the issues in designing a mobile network with MR-HA bidirectional tunnel is to solve the route optimization problem in the nested mobile networks. Since the aggregated hierarchy of mobile networks becomes a single nested mobile network, in order to forward packets to the nested mobile network nodes, multiple levels of bidirectional nested tunnels are required. However, the multiple levels of bidirectional tunnels lead to an undesirable overhead. We propose a hierarchical mechanism that allows direct packet tunneling between HA and MR without nested tunnels.

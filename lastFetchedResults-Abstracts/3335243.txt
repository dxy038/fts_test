In this paper, we investigate the hardware implementation of four different, but similar, lightweight block ciphers: PRESENT, Piccolo, PRINTcipher and LED. The purpose of this paper is to present a common platform which integrates these four ciphers into one system using a shared datapath, with the objective of reducing the area below the total sum of area consumed by the individual ciphers. The structure and implementation of the platform is clearly stated in the paper with the target technology being the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA.

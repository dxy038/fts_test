The radio waves propagates through the earth atmosphere will be attenuated due to presence of the atmosphere particles such as water vapor , water drops and the ice particles. Meantime the atmospheric gases and rain will absorb the scatter the radio path consequently degrade the performance of the link. This paper presents comparative studies on different rain attenuation prediction methods for terrestrial microwave links point to point for tropical regions. Basically the models described in this paper include those of the ITU-R, revised Moupfouma, revised Silva Mello.el model and Lin model. The objective of these studies is to show the most suitable rain attenuation prediction model for the Malaysian tropical region. Various reduction factor models are also discussed for the particular models being considered. This paper will help provide useful information for researchers to make good considerations in rain attenuation predictions for a terrestrial link operating frequency at 15GHz in a Tropical Region. Suggested model been discussed to help researchers to make good consideration in their studies.

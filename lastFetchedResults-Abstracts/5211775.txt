Low level microwave radiation effects on biological systems and its potential benefits for medical applications is a recent research field. Irradiation of biological systems with low level microwaves causes functional disturbances in the biological tissues resulting in the permeability of cardiac cell membrane. This property of microwaves can be employed for treating cardiac arrhythmia. The objective of this paper is to introduce a remote non invasive microwave system for heart beat stimulation and regularization. A microwave system for generating pulsed microwaves at a frequency of 2.45 GHz providing a power level of 10 mW and a rectangular patch antenna as a microwave radiator are designed and simulated.

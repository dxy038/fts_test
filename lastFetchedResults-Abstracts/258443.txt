The influence of multiple learning contexts and problem solving guidance on the acquisition of applicable knowledge and subjective learning outcomes in complex learning was investigated. Using a 2 Ã— 2 factorial design, 60 economics students from a vocational school were confronted with one of four conditions when learning with a computer-based simulation of a company (factor 1: learning context [uniform learning contexts versus multiple learning contexts]; factor 2: problem solving guidance [unguided problem solving versus guided problem solving]). No single learning condition was superior with regard to all learning outcomes. Multiple learning contexts in combination with problem solving guidance turned out to be the most suitable learning condition when objective learning outcomes were taken into consideration. The problem solving guidance procedure, however, led to a rather pessimistic self-evaluation of learning outcomes. The problem of self-evaluation of learning outcomes in complex learning is discussed, and remedies are proposed.

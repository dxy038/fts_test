Due to the strict government regulations on environmental protection, the conventional criteria of operation of generating units at minimum cost is not sufficient for deciding the dispatch strategy. It is necessary to consider environmental issues in the problem definition. Conventional optimization techniques do not work well with such complex bi-objective optimization tasks with conflicting goals and are not suitable for on-line use due to increased computational burden. This paper proposes a Levenberg Marquardt neural network (LMNN) for the combined economic load dispatch problem. Test results of system with 3 generating units are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

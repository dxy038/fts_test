A novel approach based on probability and randomization has emerged to synergize with the standard deterministic methods for control of systems with uncertainty. The main objective of this paper is to provide a broad perspective on this area of research known as “probabilistic robust control”, and to address in a systematic manner recent advances. The focal point is on design methods, based on the interplay between uncertainty randomization and convex optimization, and on the illustration of specific control applications.

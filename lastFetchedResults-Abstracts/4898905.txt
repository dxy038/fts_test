In this paper presented the effects of calcination time and sintering temperature on the properties of CaCu<sub>3</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-Electroceramic material of CaCu<sub>3</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was prepared by modified mechanical alloying technique that covers a several processes, which are preparation of raw material, mixing and ball milling for 5 hours, calcination, pellet forming and sintering. Objective of this modified technique is to enable the calcination and sintering processes in future carried out in shorter time and lower temperature. XRD analysis result shows that single-phase of CaCu<sub>3</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was completely formed by calcination at 750degC for 12 hours. Meanwhile, grain size of sintered sample at 1050degC for 24 hours is extremely large in the range of 20-50 mum obtained from FESEM images. The dielectric constant value of 14,635 was obtained at 10 kHz by LCR meter in the sintered sample at 1050degC. However, dielectric constant value of sintered samples at 900 and 950degC is quite low in the range of 52-119 only.

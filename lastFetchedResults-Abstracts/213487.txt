Background and Objective: According to the fact that neonatal infection is a challenging diagnosis field, several studies have tried to test sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests, This study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin (PCT) as a single early marker of neonatal sepsis.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 150 neonates admitted to NICU and neonatal ward in Shahrekord Hajar hospital were enrolled. A full workup including blood cultureand other tests and PCT was conductede. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for PCT was determined.
Results: It was found out that 8 patients had definite infection, 15 patients had possible infection,and 127 patients had no infection. Although PCT was not able to significantly differentiate
between those with definite and possible infections (p>0.05), but thereÂ· was a significant difference for frequency of abnormal PCT between non-infectious patients and other patients. Sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values of PCT was 87.5%, 87.4%, 30.4 (Yo , 99.1%, and 87.41% respectively.
Conclusion: Beside the limitation of the sample size, the satisfactory diagnostic characteristics of PCT highlight it as a good measure for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Further studies are essential
to be carried out.

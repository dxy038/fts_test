The knowledge of pause and commencement and its relationship with interpretation is significant in two ways. Firstly, the knowledge of pause and commencement in its mental and investigative sense is basically one of the Quranic sciences having a direct relationship with interpretation, which is revealing divine intents.
Secondly, the knowledge of pause and commencement, in the objective and applied field, is one of the important techniques of recitation that has a direct relationship with understanding and conveying the meaning of the verse. This mutual relationship between pause and commencement and interpretation is to such an extent that in many cases, various interpretations are the main cause of differences in positions of pause and commencement. 
Likewise, difference in determination of positions of pause and commencement sometimes results in different meanings or interpretations of the verses. Itâ€™s obvious that divine intent is only one of the various interpretations. Thus, knowing the correct interpretation of the verse and reciting in such a way that leads to that divine intent is necessary. However, some of the reciters of the holy Quran perform unsuitable pause and commencement on the basis of an unsupported interpretation. In many cases, these pauses and commencements not only fail to convey the complete meaning, but also give a meaning contrary to divine intent. This kind of pauses is called Taassuph pause.
Investigating the interpretations of certain instances of Taassuph pause, the present article seeks to distinguish the preferable view from its rivals based on adequate evidence. Thus the position of pause could be rightly recognized and the pause leading to a better and more complete meaning could be preferred.

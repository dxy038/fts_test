Objective: To review existing data on nutritional requirements of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants (those who weigh < 1000 g and 1000â€“1500 g at birth, respectively), and the effects of diseases on these nutritional requirements.
Data sources: A literature search was conducted on applicable articles related to nutritional requirements of preterm ELBW and VLBW infants and the effects of diseases in these infants on their nutritional and metabolic requirements.
Data synthesis: The literature was analyzed to determine nutritional requirements of preterm ELBW and VLBW infants, to select the most common diseases that have significant and important effects on nutrition and metabolism in these infants, and to make recommendations about diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to nutritional problems as affected by diseases in ELBW and VLBW infants.
Conclusions: Many diseases unique to preterm infants, either directly or by enhancing the effects of stress on the metabolism of such infants, provide important changes in the nutrient requirements. The overriding observation from all studies, however, is that ELBW and VLBW preterm infants are underfed during the early postnatal period and that this condition, combined with additional stresses from various diseases, increases the risk of long-term neurological sequelae. The value of achieving a specific body composition and growth weight is less certain. There remains a critical need for determining the right quality as well as quantity of nutrients for these infants.

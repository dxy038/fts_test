The present work deals with the development and control of a converter to drive piezoelectric actuators. In order to maximize the field in the piezoelectric ceramic important voltages are needed. To fulfill such requirements with a limited input voltage a bidirectional buck-boost converter is proposed. The converter is controlled by means of a sliding mode control strategy. The converter is validated by means of simulations.

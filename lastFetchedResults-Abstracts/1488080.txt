The aroma composition, the microbial composition and the sensory profile were measured in sliced saveloy samples packed in modified atmosphere (MA). The main objective was to identify aroma compounds with potential as chemical markers to identify the sensory changes of saveloy. The 60 aroma compounds isolated from the saveloy samples by dynamic headspace extraction and measured by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to model the sensory attributes sour&amp;old odour and meaty odour using partial least squares regression (PLS). 2- and 3-methylbutanal, 2- and 3-methylbutanol, acetoin and diacetyl were found to have the highest impact on both sour&amp;old odour and meaty odour of the samples. The results show that these four aroma compounds have high potential as chemical markers for the sensory shelf-life of sliced and MA-packed saveloy.

While characterizing OMUX filters at atmospheric pressure, electrical breakdown can occur involuntarily and damage the equipment. The phenomenon of breakdown was studied and our objective was to propose a multi-physical modeling, in order to predict the critical input power which can generate such a microwave breakdown. In this paper we present the microwave breakdown threshold at several frequency bands and we propose a solution to relax the microwave breakdown threshold.

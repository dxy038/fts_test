In this paper, we study a scheduling problem on identical parallel machines, in which a processing time and a due date are given for each job, and the objective is to maximize the number of just-in-time jobs. A job is called just-in-time if it is completed exactly on its due date. We discuss the known results, show that a recently published greedy algorithm for this problem is incorrect, and present a new quadratic time algorithm which solves the problem.

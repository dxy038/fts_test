Background and objective: Unfortunately, the prevalence of multidrug resistance including aminoglycoside resistant enterococci in hospitalized patients especially with nosocomial infections cause tropical problems. The role of this research is the study of antibiotic resistance in this group of patients.

Materials and methods: Fifty isolates of Enterococccus faecium from hospitalized patients were studied. To determination of antimicrobial susceptibility, disk diffusion method was done for ten common used antibiotics. The PCR test was performed for detection of aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistant genes.

Results: All of isolates showed multidrug resistance. All of them were resistant to ampicillin and 96% were resistant to gentamicin. PCR test confirmed these results. Additionally, all of isolates were susceptible to linezolid and synersid.

Conclusion: The tropical changes are necessary for these results. The usage of linezolid and synersid are suggested for these infections.

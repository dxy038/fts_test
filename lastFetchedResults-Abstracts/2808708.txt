Image enhancement is a well established field in image processing. The main objective of image enhancement is to increase the perceptual information contained in an image for better representation using some intermediate steps, like, contrast enhancement, debluring, denoising etc. Among them, contrast enhancement is especially important as human eyes are more sensitive to luminance than the chrominance components of an image. Most of the contrast enhancement algorithms proposed till now are global methods. The major drawback of this global approach is that in practical scenarios, the contrast of an image does not deteriorate uniformly and the outputs of the enhancement techniques reach saturation at proper contrast points. That leads to information loss. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, no non-reference perceptual measure of image quality has yet been proposed to measure localized enhancement. We propose a fast algorithm to increase the contrast of an image locally using singular value decomposition (SVD) approach and attempt to define some parameters which can give clues related to the progress of the enhancement process.

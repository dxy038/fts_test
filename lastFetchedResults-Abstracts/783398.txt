Objective To describe the evolution of
antidepressant use in primary care in the Valencian
region (Spain) from 2000 to 2004 and to analyze the
effects of reference-based price and generic drugs
introduction on drug utilization and cost saving.
Methods Retrospective observational study in primary
care using sales data collected from antidepressant
group (N06A), corresponding to the period
2000â€“2004. Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants
per day were obtained as consumption data. Cost
and cost/DDD rate evolution was related to reference
price system implantation. Results Antidepressant
utilization progressively increased by 44.0% from 30.3
DDDs/1000 per day in 2000 to 43.5% in 2004. Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) comprised 77%
of the total consumption where paroxetine, sertraline
and fluoxetine were the most used drugs in 2004. The
proportion of relative use and cost of fluoxetine declined
after a reference price and the introduction of
generic competitors were put into effect in 1999; cost/
DDD was reduced by 1.8. Third-generation antidepressants
showed a fast rising rate i.e. venlafaxine
utilization multiplied by 2.2; this drug with the higher
cost/DDD was not subjected to the reference price
system. Reduction in citalopram utilization was
related to a replacement by its recently marketed
enantiomer escitalopram. Conclusions In 2004, reference
price policy and the implementation of generic
drugs reduced the antidepressant cost by DDD.
However, antidepressant expenditure increased since
2000 due to a continued growth in consumption
(SSRIs and novel agents) and a displacement of prescriptions
to drugs that were not included in the
reference price policy.

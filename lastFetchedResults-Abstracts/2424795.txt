The development of new diesel combustion modes characterized by low combustion temperatures, to minimize the NOx emissions, has caused a noticeable change in the diesel sprayâ€™s structure and in the NOx chemistry, gaining relevance the N2O and the prompt routes in detriment of the thermal mechanism. Therefore, to accurately predict the NOx emissions, the detailed chemistry and physics must be taken into account, with the consequence of increasing the computational cost.

thors propose in the current study a new predictive methodology associated to low computational cost, where detailed chemistry and simplified physics are considered. To diminish even more the computational cost, the chemistry was tabulated as a function of temperature and oxygen excess mass fraction (parameter which effectively couples the equivalence ratio and the EGR rate). This tool has been developed with the objective of being applicable in continuously varying temperature and mixture fraction conditions (the diffusion diesel spray context) and was validated with the Two-Stage Lagrangian model (TSL-model) and with real engine measurements.

sults in both validation scenarios reflect a high degree of accuracy making it applicable, at least, to perform qualitative predictions. By extension, it is expected to perform similarly in continuously varying temperature conditions (i.e.: homogenous charge compression ignition diesel combustion modes) which are less demanding computationally speaking.

With low voltage applications as the main objective, SOI technology has made rapid and substantial progress in recent years. This paper describes the current status of SOI technology with emphasis on analysis of dynamic retention characteristics in low voltage DRAMs, countermeasures regarding the floating-body effect in low voltage region, and reliability issues in state-of-the-art SOI substrate technology

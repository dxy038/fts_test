Composite Web services are often long-running, loosely coupled and cross-organizational applications. They always run in a highly dynamic environment. For the applications and environment, advanced transaction support is required to ensure the quality of reliable execution. Towards composite service adaptive mechanism unavailable for lacking transaction support, this paper proposes a self-healing model for Web service reliable execution, which is an integration of flexible compensation service in selection and reselecting in execution. In order to make the composite service healing itself as quickly as possible and minimize the number of reselections, away of mining cascading scope of replacement in advance by considering full multi-relation among transaction Web services is proposed in this paper. Further more, a new comprehensive, objective QoS-driven service replacement model with compensation support is presented, and the self-healing algorithm is proposed. Experiments show that the model guarantees business process reliability.

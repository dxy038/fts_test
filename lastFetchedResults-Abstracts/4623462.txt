The objective of our research is to build a statistical test that can evaluate the sensitivity of a portfolio selection model with fuzzy data. The central point and radius are used to determine the portfolio selection model and we make a decision for the best return by a fuzzy statistical test. Empirical studies are presented to illustrate the risk of the portfolio selection model with interval values. We conclude that the evaluation by the fuzzy statistical test enables us to obtain a stable expected return and low risk investment with different choices based on the risk level k, which is taken for the risk level.

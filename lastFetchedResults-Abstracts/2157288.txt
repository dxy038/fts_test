Background and Objective: Chronic renal failure can eventually lead to various complications such as impaired sleep quality of patient, so; the adequacy of dialysis in these patients is very important .This study was done aimed to determine the effect of continuous care model on sleep quality and dialysis adequacy of hemodialysis patients in Jahrom.
Materials and Method: In this clinical trial study, 40 patients in hemodialysis ward were selected through simple random sampling in Motahari Hospital in Jahrom in 2013. To survey the quality of sleep, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and to measure the adequacy of dialysis, the formula kt/v was used. For applying the continuous care model, patients were divided into 5 groups and for each group, 4 to 6 training sessions were held during the 4 weeks. Sleep quality and dialysis adequacy were measured during four stages; 1 month and immediately before intervention, immediately and 1 month after intervention. Data analysis was done through SPSS16 and using the independent t-test, repeated measures analysis and Pearson’s correlation coefficient.  
Results: The mean score of sleep quality was significantly higher before the intervention (9.96 ± 1.87) in compare to after (9.07 ± 2.19) the intervention (p = 0.002). Also; the mean score of dialysis adequacy was improved immediately after the intervention (1.13± 0.3), but it decreased again one month (0.97 ± 0.31) after the intervention (p = 0.034).  
Conclusion: The implementing of continuous care model caused an improvement in sleep quality, but there was no positive effect on dialysis adequacy. It is recommended that the nurses implement this model in caring of other patients through doing further research in this area.

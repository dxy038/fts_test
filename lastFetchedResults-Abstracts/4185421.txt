The objective of this paper is to develop an intelligent computer system with some deductive capabilities to conceptually cluster, match and rank pages based on predefined linguistic formulations and rules defined by experts or based on a set of known homepages. The conceptual fuzzy set (CFS) model will be used for intelligent information and knowledge retrieval through conceptual matching of both text and links (here defined as "Concept"). The selected query doesn\Â´t need to match the decision criteria exactly, which gives the system a more human-like behavior. The model can be used for intelligent information and knowledge retrieval through Web-connectivity-based clustering.

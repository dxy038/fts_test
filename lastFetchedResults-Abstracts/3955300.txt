This paper proposes two effective numerical methods to solve the optimal problem of contrast enhancement for the coherent and incoherent cases, respectively. For the coherent case, the objective function of the optimal problem is transformed into a bilinear form. Then a numerical method is presented by using the idea of the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique (SUMT). For the incoherent case, a cross-iterative method is proposed for solving the optimal problem of contrast enhancement, based on the formula of the optimal contrast polarization state in the matched-polarized channel. Both the proposed methods are convergent and straightforward for programming. In addition, the proposed methods can be used for the bistatic radar case because in this paper, it is unnecessary to restrict the symmetry of the scattering matrix and the Kennaugh matrix. For showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the authors give three examples. The results of the calculation are completely identical with other papers´, showing the validity of the proposed methods. In these three examples, if the receiving polarization state is independent of the transmitting´s, the power ratios may be much larger than those in the cases of the co-polarized, the cross-polarized, and the matched-polarized channels, showing the importance of the considered models. In addition, the computation costs are estimated by these illustrative examples, illustrating that the proposed methods are very effective

For the first time, we propose and experimentally demonstrate millimeter-wave (mm-wave) generation in the E-band (71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz) based on photonics generation technique. We also experimentally demonstrate a bidirectional full-duplex optical/wireless integration system in the E-band with 1.5-m wireless delivery, in which 2- and 2.5-Gb/s on_off keying (OOK) signals are independently carried by 74- and 84-GHz mm-wave carriers and can be implemented error-free transmission in two opposite directions at the same time. Furthermore, there is no obvious difference whether distributed feedback (DFB) laser (with linewidth less than 5 MHz) or external cavity laser (ECL) (with linewidth less than 100 kHz) is used.

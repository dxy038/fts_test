In order to develop high precision, large travel, heavy thrust linear piezoelectric motor, a marching type linear piezoelectric motor based on the piezoelectric stack was proposed. The operating principle of the motor was presented, the structure of the motor was designed, a prototype was made and the experimental studies were carried through. The experimental results showed that within a certain range of frequency the amplitude of the motorÂ´s stator driving foot was linear to the driving voltage, and the maximum amplitude was 2.9 &#956;m. The maximum non-load velocity of the motor was 796 &#956;m/s, the maximum output thrust of the motor was 4.8 N. The expected design objective has been successfully obtained.

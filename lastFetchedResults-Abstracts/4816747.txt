The objective of this paper is to briefly present the statistical analysis of a new propagation experiment carried out by ONERA in Toulouse from the 19.7 GHz beacon of the Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite. A beacon Earth station, a profiling radiometer and a rain gauge were deployed and 2 years of beacon data have been collected, processed and analysed. This paper presents the statistical results obtained in terms of Cumulative Distribution Functions of rain rate, beacon total attenuation and fade dynamics. Then, the rain attenuation time series channel model ITU-R P.1853 will be compared to the measurements.

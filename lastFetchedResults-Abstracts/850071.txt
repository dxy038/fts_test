Objective(s): The role of non-nutritive sucking during gavage as a nutritional intervention is well established in feeding performance and feeding skills in preterm infants. However, conflicting results on the impact of this intervention on weight gain has been reported in the infants.
Method: In a double blind clinical trial, 64 preterm infants, who hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), were randomized into intervention or control group (32 infants in each group). Mothers in experimental group provided oral stimulation by pacifier during the first ten minutes of tube feeding, three times a day. Infants in control group received standard routine care. To eliminate the potentially confounding effect of maternal presence, mothers in control group were present during the gavage feeding. Infant weight without clothing was measured daily by a trained person before the morning feeding in two groups and then weigh gain were compared.
Results: Despite the same caloric intake by two groups, infants in pacifier sucking group had greater daily weight gain (10.9 vs. 3.2 g , P=0.01).
Conclusion: With regards to positive effect of pacifier sucking, the application of this intervention is recommended for neonates admitted to NICU.

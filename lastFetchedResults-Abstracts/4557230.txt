Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack is one of the primary techniques employed in computer based hacking. MITM attack can successfully invoke attacks such as Denial of service (DoS), DNS spoofing and Port stealing. MITM attack is particularly suitable in a LAN environment, Where it is typically performed through ARP poisoning. MITM attack of every kind has lot of surprising consequences in store for users such as, stealing online account userid, password, stealing of local ftp id, ssh or telnet session etc. This paper emphasizes on different types of MITM attacks, their consequences and feasible solutions under different circumstances giving users options to choose one from various solutions. ARP spoofing and its effect in a LAN environment is studied in detail to achieve the stated objective.

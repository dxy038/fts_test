This paper explores the application of constructal design to tree-shaped networks for cold storage. The objective is the maximization of ice production per unit volume, for specified operating conditions (temperature difference, pressure drop, storage time, construction material). Constructal design starts from the smallest scale (elemental volume) and proceeds toward larger and more complex assemblies of elements. Two geometries were optimized at the smallest scale: ice production on parallel plates and on parallel cylinders. The cylindrical geometry offers a greater ice production density. At the next larger scale, the ice production was maximized on arrays of tubes assembled as ‘Z-shaped registers’. The optimization of geometry yielded the spacing between tubes, and the tube diameter and length. The road toward larger and more complex assemblies, and the emergence of dendritic flow architecture are discussed.

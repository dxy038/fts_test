In an era when computing systems are approaching towards mobility, smaller size, and the area of computer applications are becoming wider and broader, embedded Internet control facilitates the control of useful devices with the tremendous opportunity of the Internet, ad hoc networks, mobile telecommunications, etc. Embedded Internet control also facilitates the development of low cost systems, which are normally feasible for the requirements of Third World countries. In this paper the objective of the described project was to develop a security system for office or home doors, which could be controlled in embedded Internet technology. The approach is to design the required sensor and actuator, client and server, and thereby enable the control through the mobile phone. The paper extends the use of F-Bus protocol in Nokia 3310 mobile phones to send and receive SMS form servers

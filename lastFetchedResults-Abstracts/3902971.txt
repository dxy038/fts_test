The objective of this Letter is to develop new techniques for enhancing the compression of still images. The features of the proposed algorithm include: (i) zero mapping, which exploits the inherent self-similarity of wavelet coefficients at different scales, (ii) adaptive scanning, and (iii) data packing. Our algorithm outperforms both JPEG and the embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) algorithm

This study proposes an effective method of network reconfiguration to reduce power loss and enhance the voltage profile by the improved mixed-integer hybrid differential evolution (MIHDE) method for distribution systems. This research aims to recognize beneficial load transfers so that the objective function composed of power losses is minimized and the prescribed voltage limits are satisfied. The proposed method determines the proper system topology that reduces the power loss according to a load pattem. Mathematically, the problem of this research is a mixed-integer combinatorial optimization problem well suited to the application of MIHDE.

With governments throughout the world being increasingly under pressure to be more responsive and effective, there has been a great deal of interest in employee involvement with job. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the correlation of locus of control and job involvement in public sector organizations of Iran. Previous studies revealed that locus of control may be related to job involvement. The author conceptualizes job involvement along three dimensions to better explore the correlation of variables. Data were collected from 200 public employees working in Kerman Township of Iran. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. Results suggested that in public organizations, the majority of respondents are characterized as having internal locus of control. It is also indicated that while locus of control is directly related to job involvement, it is correlated to just two facets of job involvement: job importance and spending time on the job; but not related to the third facet: importance of success. The results highlighted some culturally induced practices which contribute towards the employees' perception of success on the job.

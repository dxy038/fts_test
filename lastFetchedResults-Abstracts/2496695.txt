One of the factors that distinguish the city from other human settlements is the physical dimension that always absorbs significant attention of managers, urban planners, residents and visitors and quality of it has an important role in quality of resident’s life. The lack of program and immethodical development, especially in big cities, caused current physical quality failed to meet the needs of residents and many criticisms has risen about this subject; Ahvaz city is an example for this matter. The objective of this research is to investigate and analysis of physical space of Ahvaz city and also capabilities and weaknesses of that space for providing residents’ requirements. Research method is descriptive-analytical with qualitative approach. The article was written in holistic scale and relies on the theory of main structure of city. In order to reach the objectives of the research, after primary reviews, three hypotheses developed: 1. diversity is the most important capability of physical space of Ahvaz city, 2.lack of inconsistency is the most important weakness of it and 3.the physical space of the city has conformity with modernism more than other schools. Then, required data about literature of subject gathered from library studies and by selecting a set of criteria from reviewed criteria, using survey observation and library data, some examples of capabilities and shortages of Ahvaz physical space investigated. The result shows the diversity is the most important capability of the physical space of Ahvaz and environmental factors, inconsistency and the lack of universality in the city are the most important problems of physical space of it. In total, the identity of city is strong and it is weak in environmental criteria and also in discipline. Physical components of city have relative conformity with modernism school.

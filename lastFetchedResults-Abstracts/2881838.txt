The objective of the Personalized Web Tasking (PWT) workshop series is to develop a community interested in the overlap between web services (as interoperable and easily composable components) and configurable personalizable applications. On the one hand, the core web-service community focuses primarily on enabling/supporting the processes around building distributed systems using services as the basic building blocks. On the other hand, user-centric communities have long been interested in enabling end users to customize their own experience using web resources, context-aware computing, and adaptive software, among others. PWT 2014, held during the IEEE World Congress on Services, focused on the overlap between the two areas, and brought together international researchers examining research relevant to this overlap.

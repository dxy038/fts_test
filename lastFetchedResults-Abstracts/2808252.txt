When the urban mass transit vehicle lost external power supply, the train can be propelled by on board storage battery to the next station. Such novel scheme plays an important role in the emergency rescue. However, the operation speed and distance in emergency traction mode is restricted by the capacity of on board battery. This paper is subject to research of the optimization control of storage battery emergency traction of urban mass transit vehicle. Firstly, the system architecture and characteristic in emergency traction mode are analyzed. Then dynamic efficiency optimization control and energy conservation scheme will be thoroughly researched. Finally, coupled electrical-mechanical mathematic model and optimization control of the emergency traction will be developed, simulation results will be given out according to different optimized objective.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SunShot Initiative launched a three-year R&amp;D program called Solar Energy Grid Integration Systems &#8212; Advanced Concepts (SEGIS-AC). The objective is to fund projects that develop technologies in power electronics (e.g. reactive power control, voltage ride-through, advanced anti-islanding, ACPV modules) that reduce the overall photovoltaic (PV) system costs, allow high penetrations of solar energy onto the grid, and enhance the performance, reliability, and safety of the grid with large deployment of PV systems. In addition, projects funded under this funding opportunity will demonstrate the feasibility of these technologies in the field with partnering utilities and lessons learned will be disseminated among the entire solar industry. This paper reports the overall progress made thus far with highlights on some of the major achievements under the program.

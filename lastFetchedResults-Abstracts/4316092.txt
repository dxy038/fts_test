Researching on gas discharging system on heading laneway in coal mine is extremely urgent since gas exploring accident takes loss immeasurable. In order to satisfy normal ventilation function and exceeding limited gas discharging function, a double model fuzzy control model using MATLAB language in the Simulink dynamic simulation tools is established. Each includes four-input and single-output. In view of the impact of the four inputs on the output effects is different and mutual coupling exists among four inputs, it is crucial to determine weight of input signal respectively. Analytical Hierarchy Process and BP neural network are adopted to calculate weights. Moreover, an integrating method is presented to utilize advantage of subjective judgment and objective analysis fully. On this basis, gas discharge system experimental platform which combines TMS320LF2407DSP and IPM is build. Experimental results and field test results show that the control system has ability of adaptability on-site, good adjust speed performance, easy to maintenance and energy-saving.

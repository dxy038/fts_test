Objective
This study evaluated whether high amylose cornstarch (HAS) could prevent adverse physiologic effects induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) in the gut of rats.
Methods

Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided with a low amylose cornstarch (LAS) diet or a 50/50 mixture of LAS and HAS diets for 4 wk; each of these diets was supplemented with 0 or 2 g of DCA per kilogram of diet. Therefore, there were four groups.
Results

Cecal content pH was lower in rats fed the HAS diets compared with rats fed the LAS diets (P < 0.05). Bifidobacteria number in cecal contents, cecal pools of acetate, butyrate, and total short-chain fatty acids were highest in rats fed the HAS diet; moreover, the HAS/DCA diet resulted in increased Bifidobacteria growth and short-chain fatty acid production numerically compared with the LAS/DCA diets (P = 0.06). Production of prostaglandin-E2 in colonic mucosa was highest in rats fed the LAS/DCA diet, and the intake of HAS significantly decreased prostaglandin-E2 levels (P < 0.05).
Conclusions

In this study, DCA may have inhibited fermentation in the large intestine and increased prostaglandin-E2 production, and concurrent administration of HAS and DCA may have decreased the adverse effects on the gut induced by DCA.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is a major diabetes complication. Arterial resistance index (RI) may predict deterioration in kidney function. This study was designed to compare renal arterial RI in different stages of renal function according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine level and proteinuria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study on 81 diabetic patients in three groups (Without albuminuria, with microalbuminuria, with macroalbuminuria), pulsatile Doppler ultrasonography was performed to measure intra-renal arterial resistance index and find the association of this parameter with features of diabetic nephropathy. Data was analyzed using SPSS (ver. 16).
RESULTS: Serum creatinine, GFR and proteinuria were significantly different among three groups. RI was highest in the group with macroalbuminuria and the difference among three groups was statistically significant. (P value < 0.001) RI was correlated with serum creatinine, GFR and proteinuria.
CONCLUSION: Higher RI correlates with higher proteinuria in diabetic patients

This paper proposes a method for a bidirectional power flow analysis based on sequence operations. In view of problem that the stochastic flow produced by distributed power access distribution network and the change in load caused the possible problem of overload. Firstly, using the serialization method to describe the random variation of distribution network system that contains the distribution power; Secondly, combining with the circuit state transition model, make a risk evaluation at the changes of the uncertainty efforts leading to both the positive and negative of the branch remaining available margin probability distribution, to identify the sensitive or dangerous lines; Finally, make a optimized decision with the safe operation of the distribution network. IEEE 34-bus system is just proved its correctness and effectiveness.

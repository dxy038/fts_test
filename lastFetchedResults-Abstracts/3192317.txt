In this paper goal, the comparison certainty and uncertainty information to determine the optimal place and capacity distributed generation resources in distribution network. Load uncertainty and desired voltage range has been modeled using fuzzy data theory. The objective function includes loss reduction, improvement of profile index and voltage stability index with their relevant constraints, voltage constraints and transmittable power from the line. Load variation has been shown for three different time durations (peak, offpeak and average). PSO technique has been used to optimize the objective function while Max-Min method has been applied to select the answer. Results produced from the proposed model have been provided on a 33 bus system of IEEE.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of change in infant birth weight between pregnancies on the outcome of a trial of labor for women whose first cesarean delivery was performed for dystocia.
Study design
Secondary analysis of 7081 patients with 1 previous cesarean delivery and no other deliveries after 20 weeks' gestation, undergoing a trial of labor with a singleton gestation. Cases were classified as dystocia if the listed indication for the cesarean delivery in the first pregnancy was failed induction, cephalo-pelvic disproportion, failure to progress, or failed forceps or vacuum. Outcomes of the trial of labor were correlated with fetal size relative to birth weight in the initial pregnancy for those women whose initial cesarean delivery was for dystocia and those with other indications.
Results
For the cohort being studied (n = 7081), dystocia was the indication for the first cesarean delivery for 3182 (44.9%). Trial of labor resulted in vaginal delivery for 54% of patients whose first cesarean delivery was performed for dystocia, compared with 67% for those with other indications (P< .01). For those whose first cesarean delivery was for dystocia, trial of labor success was correlated with birth weight differences between the pregnancies, with only 38% delivering vaginally if the trial of labor birth weight exceeded the initial pregnancy birth weight by more than 500 g. Using logistic regression and adjusting for other potential confounding factors, the odds of success decreased by 3.8% for each increase of 100 g in birth weight in the trial of labor relative to the first birth weight.
Conclusion
For women with previous cesarean delivery for dystocia, increasing birth weight in the subsequent trial of labor relative to the first birth weight diminishes the chances of successful vaginal delivery.

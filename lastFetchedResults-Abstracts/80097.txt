The issue of monitoring aircraft performance during takeoff has been repeatedly considered in the last 50 years. This has been in response to concern over the low safety margins associated with this phase of flight and the lack of adequate objective performance-related information available to the crew during the takeoff maneuver. Two major difficulties, however, have to date inhibited the successful introduction of an instrument providing such information on the flight deck, namely, the provision of a reliable quantification of actual performance during the takeoff maneuver and the provision of an adequate display. This paper focuses on the former issue and evaluates the accuracy of a predictive performance monitoring algorithm developed at Cranfield University. The major hurdles that are associated with takeoff performance monitoring are briefly discussed, and the results of flightbased tests using data from large jet-transport operations presented. These results, which confirm a robustness that warrants the application of the algorithm in real-time performance monitoring, are also compared with those of an earlier flight test program using a twin turboprop aircraft.

The new H264 video coding standard can achieve considerably higher coding efficiency than previous standards by extending the notion of bidirectional prediction. Unfortunately, this improvement requires heavy computational loads to select the best mode in the sense of rate-distortion tradeoff. In this paper, we propose to apply an accurate estimation of the bit rate in order to accelerate the rate-distortion optimization. experimental results indicate that substantial gains in time processing are achieved.

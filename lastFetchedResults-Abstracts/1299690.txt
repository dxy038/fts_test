Background and Objective: Faculty members’ performance in administrative services to higher education and society is considered in their academic promotion criteria. This study assesses the reasonability and attainability of these indicators according to the faculty members' views in Iranian Medical Universities in 2011-2012. 
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed in 13 medical universities in Iran. Using stratified sampling, 350 faculty members were selected. A researcher-made questionnaire was used to assess the attainability and reasonability of service indicators considered in promotion with a scoring scale of 1-5. Mean and standard deviation of scores for each indicator was calculated. 
Results: The total mean scores of 11 service indicators for reasonability and attainability were 32.18(±12.11) and 39.37(±11.58) out of 55 respectively. The highest reasonability scores belonged to “being administrator of research projects”, “administrating activities in Educational Development Center (EDC)”, and “managerial activities in different levels”. The highest attainability scores were given to “administrative activities in scientific journals”, “being administrator of research projects”, “administrating activities in Educational Development Center (EDC)”, and “effective work in scientific associations”. 
Conclusion: Faculty members did not rate service indicators considered in promotion as much reasonable, but believed that they were somehow attainable. Revision of these indicators to make them more relevant to the responsibility values is recommended. Also developing management skills and providing appropriate partnership opportunities for faculty members’ service tasks, and facilitating their cooperation with scientific journals and associations, might improve the attainability of these indicators.

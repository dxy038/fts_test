Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate compliance with recommended infection control (IC) practices by dentists in Canada in 1995. Design: A mailed survey of a stratified random sample of dentists (N = 6444), with 3 follow-up attempts. Weighted analyses included multiple logistic regression to identify the best predictors of “excellent” compliance (18 items). Results: The adjusted response rate was 66.4%. Respondents reported use of an IC manual (52%); postexposure protocol (41%); biologic monitoring of heat-sterilizers (71%); hepatitis B immunization of dentists (91%: of these 72% had post-immunization screening; natural immunity 3%) all hygienists (78%), and all other clinical staff (70%); handwashing (before treating patients 76%, after degloving 63%); always wearing gloves (95%); changing gloves after each patient (97%); masks (82%); protective eyewear (82%); protective uniform (48%); puncture-proof container for sharps (94%); recapping needles with scoop technique/device (60%); flushing waterlines (55%); heat-sterilizing handpieces (94%; after each patient 77%); high-volume suction (92%) and “excellent” compliance (6%). Significant predictors of “excellent compliance” included attending continuing education about IC (≥10 hours, odds ratio [OR] = 6.3; 6-10 hours, OR = 3.3), treating 20 to 29 patients per day (OR = 2.8), being women (OR = 2.7), and population of city in which practice is located (>500,000, OR = 2.5). Conclusion: Improvements in IC are necessary in dental practice. The introduction of mandatory continuing education about IC may improve compliance with recommended IC procedures, which is important because of concerns related to transmission of bloodborne pathogens and drug-resistant microorganisms.

This paper presents a new framework for the day-ahead reactive power market based on the uniform auction price. Voltage stability and security have been considered in the proposed framework. Total Payment Function (TPF) is suggested as the objective function of the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) used to clear the reactive power market.
Overload, voltage drop and voltage stability margin (VSM) are included in the constraints of the OPF. Another advantage of the proposed method is the exclusion of Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC) concerns from the reactive power market. The effectiveness of the proposed reactive power market is studied based on the CIGRE-32 bus test system.

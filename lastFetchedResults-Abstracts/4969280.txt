Based on the literature review on the analysis of regional low-carbon economy, the article puts forward LYQ analysis framework to analyze regional low-carbon economic development to revise the unmatched defect of objective function and low-carbon economy, and on the basis of this constructs LYQ regional model. Therefore, we get the conclusions: Industrialization is the economy development phase which our country now is undergoing, industrial low-carbonization is strategic emphasis of low-carbon economy, Compared with population standard, industrial output is suitable for regional low-carbonization, energy-saving is the key to industrial low-carbonization, Due to the locked effects of the technology to the capital, if we practice the policy refinement and technology improvement, then energy saving can be more easily to be achieved compared with energy structure improvement and industrial structure adjustment.

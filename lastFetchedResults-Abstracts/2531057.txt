Objective: Obesity is a major health problem. Nowadays approximately one-third of the&nbsp;world population suffer from obesity which is frequently accompanied with serious medical&nbsp;and emotional problems. Three main evidence-based options exist for the treatment of obese&nbsp;individuals: lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. The purpose of&nbsp;this study was to determine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment in treating of&nbsp;patients with obesity.
Methods: Three women with body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more were selected by&nbsp;purposive sampling method to take a part in an A-B single subject design with follow up.&nbsp;Patients responded to the multidimensional body-self relations questionnaire-appearance&nbsp;scales (MBSRQ-AS), Binge eating scale (BES) and Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES) at 3&nbsp;stages of baseline (pre-treatment), treatment (2nd, 4th , 6th , 8th, 10th, and 12th sessions), and follow&nbsp;up. In addition, weighing of patients was carried out at beginning of each session. Data were&nbsp;analyzed by graphs and improvement rates.
Results: Results showed that therapy was effective in weight loss, reduction of binge eating,and maintaining of weight loss. It also increased body image satisfaction but failed in selfesteem&nbsp;improvement.
Conclusion: The cognitive-behavioral treatment was effective in treating of obese patients.&nbsp;This treatment outcome data are consistent with cognitive-behavioral treatment of obesity&nbsp;proposed by other scientists.

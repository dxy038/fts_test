Background: There is growing evidence that damage to spermatozoa by reactive oxygen species
(ROS) play a key role in male infertility.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to assess the antioxidant status of seminal plasma by
measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase
(SOD) in men with asthenozoospermia, asthenoteratozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia
compared to normozoospermic males, and their correlations with seminal parameters.
Materials and Methods: 46 men with seminal parameters abnormalities divided in three
categories: asthenozoospermic (n=15), asthenoteratozoospermic (n=16) and
oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (n=15), according WHO criteria, participated in the study. The
control group consisted of 25 males with normozoospermia. Catalase activity was measured by
Aebi spectrophotometeric method. Commercially available colorimetric assays were used for
measuring SOD activity and TAC.
Results: TAC evaluation showed significantly lower values in the total case group (n=46) versus
control group (1.05±0.04 mmmol/ml vs. 1.51±0.07 mmol/ml, p < 0.05). Catalase activity also
showed significantly lower values in the total case group (n=46) versus control group (14.40± 0.93
U/ml vs. 21.33±1.50 U/ml). But this difference was not significant for SOD activity (5.31±0.56
U/ml vs. 6.19±0.83 U/ml). Both catalase activity and TAC in asthenozoospermic,
asthenoteratozoospermic, oligoasthenoteratozoospermic subjects were significantly lower than
normozoospermic males, but SOD activity did not show a significant difference between these
groups. Both catalase activity and TAC showed a positively significant correlation with
progressively motile sperms and normal sperm morphology, but these correlations with SOD
activity were not significant.
Conclusion: Decreasing seminal plasma antioxidant status especially catalase activity and TAC
may have significant role in etiology of sperm abnormality.

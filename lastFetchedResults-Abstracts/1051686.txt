Background: Heller defined familism as a specific from of social organization where the interests of the family group prevail over those of the individual family members.
Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reliability and construct validity of Familism Scale in undergraduate students of Ahvaz Teacher Training Centers.
Methods: 332 students (156 male and 176 female) of teacher training centers that were selected randomly using the multi-stage sampling method and completed Familism scale and 16 items of cohesion subscale of Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-2). 
Results: The factor analysis using the principal components analysis and orthogonal rotation (varimax) showed three factors (familial support, familial honor, and subjugation of self for family). Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficients were for the whole scale 0.73, for extracted factors 0.55 to 0.82, and Concurrent validity coefficient of Familism scale with FACES-2 was 0.21 (P?0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis of three-factor model with one modification index provides a parsimonious fit. 
Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that the present scale is a valid and reliable measure for evaluating familism dimensions in students.

Introduction: Resonance frequency analysis (FRA) offers a clinical, noninvasive measurement of stability and osseointegration of
implants. The RFA values are represented by a quantitative unit called the Implant stability quotient (ISQ) on a scale fromI to 100.
The objective of the present study was to measure the stability of Astra tech and IT! dental implants during the healing period and
determine the factors that affect the ISQ.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial study, approved by ethical eommittee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, ]4
healthy subjects candidate for dental implants were randomly divided into two groups. Group one received 15 Astra tech and group
two received 15 m dental implants. ISQ was used for direct measurement of implant stability on the day of implant placement and
first, third and sixth month after implant placement. Data were analyzed by srudent-t test and ANOVA and Spearman Rank
Correlation Test through SPSS 11.5 with 95% confidence interval.
Results: The mean ISQ of Astra Tech implant at third and sixth month were significantly greater than ITI implant (P=O.OO I and
P=O.OI8. respectively). Statistical analysis showed higher ISQ values for mandible than maxilla (P=O.ool). Bone quality significantly
affected ISQ value and implant diameter was significantly correlated to implant stability (P=O.02).
Conclusion: Our results showed that Astra tech implants had significantly greater ISQs in third and sixth month than ITl implants.
Furthermore, bone quality, implant surface texture (implant system) and diameter can affect implant stability and time ofloading.

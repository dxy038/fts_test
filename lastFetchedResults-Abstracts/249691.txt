This paper is concerned with the minimization of functionals of the form
 
 (b) f(h; T(b; h)) d (b)
where variation of the vector b modi es the shape of the domain   on which the potential problem,
∇2T =0, is de ned. The vector h is dependent on non-linear boundary conditions that are de ned on
the boundary  . The method proposed is founded on the material derivative adjoint variable method
traditionally used for shape optimization. Attention is restricted to problems where the shape of   is
described by a boundary element mesh, where nodal co-ordinates are used in the de nition of b.
Propositions are presented to show how design sensitivities for the modi ed functional
 
 (b) f(h; T
(b; h)) d (b) +
 
 (b)  (b; h)∇2T(b; h) d (b) can be derived more readily with knowledge of the form
of the adjoint function   determined via non-shape variations. The methods developed in the paper are
applied to a problem in pressure die casting, where the objective is the determination of cooling channel
shapes for optimum cooling. The results of the method are shown to be highly convergent

The objective for this study was to investigate whether the postural control adaptation during galvanic stimulation of the vestibular nerve were similar to that found during vibration stimulation to the calf muscles. A method for adaptation analysis was used to analyze the evoked changes of posture, stimulus responses and the motion dynamics. The adaptive adjustments of postural control were similar during galvanic and vibratory stimulation, which suggests that the adaptation operate in the same way independent of the receptor systems affected by the disturbance. There was however a difference in the dynamic feedback properties of the measured responses.

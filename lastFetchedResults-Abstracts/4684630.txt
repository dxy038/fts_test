Nickel-cadmium batteries are capable of accepting much higher recharging currents than supplied by conventional NiCad chargers. Sealed lead-acid batteries are still the most widely used batteries for powering electric wheelchairs. This paper presents a rapid charger with the capability of charging nickel-cadmium cells of combined voltage rating 24 V and with VA ratings of 7, 14, 21, or 28 Ah. The objective is to offer an alternative electric wheelchair power pack requiring a less than one hour recharge time interval

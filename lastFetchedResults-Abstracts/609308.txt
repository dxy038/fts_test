Objective: It has been suggested that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression plays an important role in radiation-induced injury to the spinal cord. This study assesses the radioprotective effects of N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin) through its modulation of VEGF expression after  localized irradiation of the cervical spinal cord.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we divided 192 male rats into four groups: 1. control (n=48); 2. rats that received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of melatonin (n=48); 3. rats that received an IP injection of melatonin 30 minutes prior to cervical spinal cord gamma irradiation [dose: 22 Gy; (n=48)]; and 4. rats that received an IP injection of vehicle prior to spinal cord irradiation (n=48). The changes in VEGF expression were assessed
using real-time RT-PCR
and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Samples for

light
microscopy
were
stained
with
hematoxylin
and
eosin
(H&E).
The
differences
among

the
groups were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test followed by Tukeyâ€™s

multiple comparisons test.
Results: Up-regulation of VEGF expression was observed from 8 to 22 weeks after 
irradiation (p < 0.05). Paralysis and other radiation-induced myelopathy manifestations
developed within 22 weeks after irradiation. VEGF expression in the melatonin

pre-treatment
group
significantly
down-regulated
in
the
20
th
 and 22
 weeks after irradiation
compared to the radiation-only group.

nd
Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that modulation of VEGF expression by melatonin administration may increase the survival rate of irradiated animals.

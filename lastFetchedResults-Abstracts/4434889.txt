In this paper we report on the progress of our research regarding the effects of high magnetic fields in the development of an intact living organism, the nematode Ceanorhabditis elegans. The objective is to observe details of possible changes in morphology and neurobiology during the development process. Results obtained so far with fields up to 14 Tesla failed to show any statistically significant alterations.

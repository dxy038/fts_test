The paper provides an update on the status and plans of the deployment of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) in Europe. It presents the multiple deployment activities throughout the continent as well as the achievements in areas such as standardisation, certification, safety, trials, monitoring etc. The deployment of ADS-B and WAM in Europe is progressing fast. Initial operational implementations of WAM already exist, whilst the first ADS-B operations are expected at local sites of Non Radar Airspace in 2011. Furthermore, a large number of European ANSPs will deploy ADS-B and WAM systems from 2012 onwards, ensuring the availability of ground infrastructure. Several hundreds of aircraft are already certified for ADS-B in Non-Radar Airspace. In parallel, the expected approval of the Single European Sky (SES) Implementing Rule on Surveillance Performance and Interoperability (SPI IR) by the European Commission in the course of this year will enable the widespread aircraft equipage for other ADS-B applications and will thus accelerate the implementation of ADS-B ground Surveillance applications in Europe from 2015-2017 onwards. In addition, a major objective will be achieved in 2011 with the initial operations of Airborne Traffic Situational Awareness (ATSAW) applications over N. Atlantic. The significant progress achieved will enable important benefits for the ATM Network and establish the Surveillance foundation for the SESAR Programme, including the deployment of future more demanding ADS-B applications.

In this paper, we document the face detection competition that we have organized in conjunction with the ISDA 2010 conference. The objective was to compare different face detection engines performance on new unpublished datasets. We believe researchers can benefit from this competition by identifying strong and weak areas in their algorithms relative to others. We have also identified, based on the results, the common areas of improvement necessary for real life scenario applications.

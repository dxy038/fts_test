The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and complications following lavage and drainage of the lateral compartment (LC) of the equine guttural pouch (GP) using a modified Garm’s technique (MGT). In an ex vivo study (study 1), six cadaver heads were examined to assess the anatomical limits of the surgical approach and whether vital structures might be damaged. This was followed by an in vivo study (study 2) in which a lavage/drainage tube was placed for 3 days into each LC of four standing horses using the MGT. In both studies, the procedure offered direct access into the LC and indirect access into the medial compartments of the GP. In study 1, the MGT provided a rostroventral point of access allowing drainage of the LC, with no obvious iatrogenic damage. In study 2, the MGT permitted lavage of the entire GP in three healthy horses and one horse with mild GP empyema. The only major complication was development of emphysema of the lateral wall of one LC, with secondary collapse of the mucous membrane. The time for secondary wound healing was 12–14 days. The MGT can be performed safely in standing horses and may be of value in providing access for lavage and drainage in horses with mild GP empyema.

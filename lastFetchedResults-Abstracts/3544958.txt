Two ASTM procedures for estimating the transmission of water vapor through polymer films are compared: ASTM Standard D-1653, Standard Test Methods for Water Vapor Transmission of Organic Coating Films, and ASTM Standard E-96, Standard Test Methods for Water Vapor Transmission of Materials. Both have been identified as recognized methods for estimating performance. The objective is to ascertain whether the results yielded by the two methods should be comparable to one another.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

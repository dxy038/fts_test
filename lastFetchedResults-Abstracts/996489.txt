Dithione was used as chelator in the flow injection-knotted reactor separation and pre-concentration system coupled to flame atomic absorption spectrometry to determine trace amounts of Cu, Cd, Zn, Co in biological standard samples. Peak height was used for quantitative purpose. Alkali and alkaline earth elements, which could not chelate with dithione were separated from the objective metals; competition between trace metals were avoided for the strong chelating ability of dithione. Compared to diethyldithiocarbamate and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC), dithione was used for multi-element detection with lower chelator concentration and better analytical performance. Concentration factors of 23.4–69.3 were obtained using dithione, with the detection limits of 1.06–2.56 μg/l. The system developed was used to determine trace metals in certified biological reference materials of human hair, pig liver and sea prawn after routine digestion, the results obtained agreed well with the certified values, relative standard deviations of the determinations were at the range of 2.10–3.02%.

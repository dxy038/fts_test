Political and economic arguments underlie the focus on cellulosic ethanol production as a preferred process for meeting future renewable fuel demand. Cellulosic ethanol production requires large volumes of the biomass input, adding logistical challenges to the feasibility of the technology. The objective of this research is to evaluate the profitability of a field-to-refinery model developed to identify optimal harvest, storage, transportation, pretreatment, and refining activities for a study area in Northeastern North Dakota. Sensitivity analysis indicates profitability of the ethanol complex is marginal under current prices and anticipated technologies. However, increases in ethanol prices and reduced conversion costs to produce ethanol from herbaceous crop residues suggest future viability of the process. Finally, development of a viable livestock feeding industry using some or all of the AFEX-pretreated crop residue increases the profitability of harvesting crop residues for further use.

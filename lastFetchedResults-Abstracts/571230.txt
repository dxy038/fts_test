Background and Objective: The purpose of the present research was to examine the effect of practice type (physical, mental and mixed practices) on static and dynamic balance in elderly women at an age range of 60-75 years with no history of falling. 

Materials and Methods: Statistical sample of this research study included 45 none falling elderly women at an age range of 60-75 years that were randomly divided into three experimental groups. In this research, the Sharpened-Romberg test (with eyes open and close) was used to measure the static balance and Timed-get up and Go test was used to measure the dynamic balance. In pre-test phase, the mean of three trials of dynamic and static balance tests performance was recorded for all participants. All participants were practiced in 6 sessions according to defined protocol, then, they were participated in post-test that was similar to pre-test. The data were analyzed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post hoc test at a significant level of p < 0.05. 

Results: The obtained findings showed that regarding performance (mental, physical and mixed), a significant difference exists between the static (with eyes open and close) and dynamic balance in post-test. Result of Bonferroni post hoc showed that mixed group has a significant difference versus the other groups (p < 0.05) and subjects in the former group had a better performance than other groups. Furthermore, the performance of physical practice group was better than mental practice group (p < 0.05). 

Conclusion: According to the results of the present research, it could be concluded that for improvement of static and dynamic balance in elder women, practice method in specific programs is recommended.

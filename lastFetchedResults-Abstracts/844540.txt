This paper is concerned with the global stability characteristics of a system of equations
modelling the dynamics of continuous-time bidirectional associative memory neural networks
with impulses. Sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of a unique equilibrium
and its exponential stability of the networks are obtained. For the goal of
computation, discrete-time analogues of the corresponding continuous-time bidirectional
associative memory neural networks with impulses are also formulated and studied. Our
results show that the above continuous-time and discrete-time systems with impulses preserve
the dynamics of the networks without impulses when we make some modifications
and impose some additional conditions on the systems, the convergence characteristics
dynamics of the networks are preserved by both continuous-time and discrete-time systems
with some restriction imposed on the impulse effect.

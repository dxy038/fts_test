Objective: Crocin, the carotenoid isolated from saffron, has numerous medicinal properties which include anticancer and antioxidant activities. Some antioxidants, such as carotenoids, can act as pro-oxidants at higher dosages and therefore induce tissue damage. In this situation antioxidant defense systems in the liver activate to prevent tissue damage. This study investigates the possible toxic effects of crocin on the liver of normal rats.
Methods: Normal rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 was treated with normal saline as the control and groups 2 to 4 were treated different doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg crocin intraperitoneally once a week for four weeks. Animals were killed one week after the last injection. Serum profile of the rats that included ALT, AST, ALP, urea, uric acid and creatinine, as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx), GSH content, and lipid and protein oxidation by measurement of MDA and protein carbonyl levels were assessed in the liver. In addition, we conducted histopathological examinations of the liver specimens.
Results: We studied different crocin concentrations that have been used to treat various diseases. There were no significant changes in serum parameters, GSH, MDA, protein carbonyls and activities of CAT and SOD at the different crocin concentrations. Histopathological examination did not show any changes in the liver. Only the higher dose (200 mg/kg) decreased GPx activity which might be reversible over the long-term.
Conclusion: Crocin, at the studied doses showed no toxic effects on the rat liver.

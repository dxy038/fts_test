The concept of a complex large system of mineral resource exploitation was advanced from the system theory viewpoint. On the basis of the integrated techniques of qualitative and quantitative analysis, the multiple objective intelligence-integrated methodology for decision-making on mineral resource exploitation was investigated and its integrated model was also formulated. The mineral deposit model, expert system model for mining method selection and the artificial neural network model for prediction economic index, as well as the programming model, acted as the core of this system, while the multiple goal programming model served as the top of the model. An intelligent system to assist the programming of decision-making on mineral resource exploitation for operating mines was developed by means of the systematic combination of optimization technology with an artificial neural network, an expert system, computer-aided design and operations research (OR). The structure of an integrated intelligent system for decision-making on mineral resource exploitation was described. In addition, forecast and simulation, as well as optimization, were integrated. The system's preliminary application was illustrated with an example.

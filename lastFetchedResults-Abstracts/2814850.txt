The objective of this paper is to focus on two-dimensional (2-D) analog linear systems. The potential of many 2-D concepts in analog domain have not been explored properly. Techniques of MDLT, in general, and 2DLT in particular, make it possible to characterize a large class of nonlinear analytic systems and the entire analog linear time-varying (LTV) systems and circuits including the entire communication networks. In this paper the development of a bifrequency theory for autonomous dynamic systems is outlined. The paper complements contents of existing literature more than duplicate.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a serious worldwide health threat, killing almost 3 million people per year. Other mycobacterial species, especially Mycobacterium avium, are emerging pathogens in the immunocompromised population, most notably AIDS patients. These nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment, and naturally resistant to many disinfection procedures. Treatment options are limited, and no new antibiotics have been developed against mycobacteria since the 1970s. There is a desperate need for new biocides and antibiotics to prevent and treat mycobacterial infections. A small aromatic compound library has been screened for effectiveness in growth inhibition or killing of mycobacteria. Four species, representing the M. tuberculosis complex, the slow-growing NTM, and the rapid-growing NTM were used. Active compounds had minimal inhibitory concentrations as low as 12.5 Î¼g/mL, with the active component being a quinone. The primarily bactericidal activity observed represents a unique mechanism of action. A fluorescent assay involving M. smegmatis expressing gfp was analyzed as a rapid assay for predicting inhibitory activity, but failed to predict activity well. Our compounds may have significant utility as soluble biocides against mycobacteria and other hardy nosocomial pathogens.

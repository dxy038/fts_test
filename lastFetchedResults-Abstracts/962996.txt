
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Seizure is a transient brain dysfunction due to abnormal electrical discharges of some cortical neurons. Clinical manifestations of seizures depend on the types of involved neurons. Seizures are the most cause of admitted patients to hospital emergency. Etiology of seizures is important in managements of these attacks. So, the purpose of this study was to survey the etiology of seizure in cases admitted to emergency department.
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on all patients with a diagnosis of seizure admitted to emergency department of Roohani hospital during 2009-2011. Semi structured questionnaires in three sections, including primary causes (epilepsy, cerebrovascular lesions, head trauma and brain tumor), secondary causes (poisonings, infections, metabolic disorders and electrolyte disorders) and other causes (pseudosizures, drug withdrawal and unrecognized etiology) were completed for all of patients from their files. Then data was analyzed.
FINDINGS: Among all of 213 patients 138 (64.8%) were male and 75 (35.2%) were female and the mean age of patients was 38.5+ 20.8. The  most prevalent cause of seizure were epilepsy in 77 (36.1%),  idiopathic in 45 (21.1%)  and the other causes were poisoning ( 11.8%), cerebral vascular lesions (9.8%), non-real seizure (8.4%), brain tumor ( 3.3%), electrolyte disorders (2.8%), brain trauma (0.9%), metabolic disorders (2.8%), and the other (2.3%).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the most common cause of seizure in these patients was epilepsy. The causes such as cerebral vascular lesions, poisonings and non-real seizure in our study was higher than other studies. So, continuous control of epileptic patients will be effective to decrease occurrence of seizure.

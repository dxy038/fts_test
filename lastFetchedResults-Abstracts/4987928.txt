The penetration level of distributed generation (DG) has increasing day by day due to restructuring in electricity market. This paper discusses the sizing and sitting issue of single DG placement in radial distribution network. The main objective of this paper is to minimize active power loss and improve voltage profile of overall system. This paper presents three optimization techniques - Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Craziness based particle swarm optimization (CRPSO) and Gravitational Search algorithm (GSA) for optimal placement of distributed generators. The methods are tested with two IEEE standard test cases, 12-node radial distribution network and 69-node radial distribution network, and the results obtained by three algorithms are comparable.

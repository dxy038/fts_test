Phase-to-phase clearances often are increased in the design of overhead lines to minimize flashovers caused by galloping of ice-coated conductors in regions where that occurs. A collection of reports of the observed galloping behavior of operating lines has been analyzed with the objective of formulating improved guides for selection of increased clearances. Results of the analysis show the effects on galloping amplitudes of such line design parameters as span length and tension.

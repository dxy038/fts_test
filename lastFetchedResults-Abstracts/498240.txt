Increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to a demand for new agents that could be used to decrease the prevalance of disease. Cumin can be a good option for this purpose. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chemical and organic fertilizers on quality and antibacterial activity of cumin essential oil. Seeds were treated with different fertilizers during sowing. The essential oil was prepared by water distillation and analyzed by GC/Mass gas chromatography. The antibacterial activity was determined by disk diffusion method. Results indicated that A2 treatment increased the quality of essential oil by increasing the amount of B-pinene. The cumin essential oil showed significant antibacterial effects and Gram positive bacteria showed more susceptibility than gram negative ones. As a result, the cumin essential oil could be a good substitute to eliminate bacteria .

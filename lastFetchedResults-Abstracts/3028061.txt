In this paper, a multi-object optimization based on a progressive quadratic response surface method (PQRSM) and a time stepping finite element method (FEM) is proposed. The new PQRSM and FEM are able to decide optimal geometric and electric variables of the switched reluctance motor (SRM) with two objective functions: torque ripple minimization and average torque maximization. The result of the optimum design for SRM show an improved performance of motor and a relationship between torque ripple and average torque.

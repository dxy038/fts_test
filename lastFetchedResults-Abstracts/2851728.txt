This paper provides a summary of recent experimental work in electrohydrodynamic (EHD) conduction pumping of dielectric liquid, done by the authors and others in the Multi Scale Heat Transfer Laboratory at WPI. The primary objective of all experiments was to gain a fundamental understanding of interaction of flow fields and electrical fields in the presence and absence of phase change (liquid-vapor) and presence and absence of gravity. This fundamental research has led to development of potential applications in electrically-driven heat transfer enhancement. Meso- and micro-scale EHD conduction pumps were studied as mechanisms for flow generation in single- and two-phase heat transport systems. In addition, EHD conduction pumping was studied as a technique to augment pool boiling and liquid film boiling heat transfer. An analytical model was developed to characterize the influence of an electrical field on pool boiling critical heat flux. Most recently, two experiments were conducted on board a parabolic flight to study EHD conduction-driven liquid film boiling and micro-scale, single-phase flow in microgravity.

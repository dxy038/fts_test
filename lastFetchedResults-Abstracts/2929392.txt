Alternative approaches to providing one-way 1.5-Mb/s transport for video and enhanced data services to the home via fiber or copper distribution facilities are investigated. The dedicated downstream 1.5-Mb/s signal is sufficient for MPEG-1 or VCR-quality compressed video. In addition to a 1.5-Mb/s signal, a bidirectional low-speed control channel is required (e.g., for channel selection or interactive video). The emphasis is on the evolution of loop access systems originally installed for POTS (plain old telephone service) Consequently, both the high-speed data and control signals must be added in a manner consistent with the simultaneous provision of POTS over an existing installed infrastructure. In addition to exploring a class of technology options, the associated incremental increase in the installed first cost is determined

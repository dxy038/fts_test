In the framework of Fuzzy Cognitive maps theory, we propose a novel classify algorithm, which is totally different from the traditional classify algorithm. The novel classify algorithm has three main advantages: Firstly, the procedures of the proposed algorithm are more transparent and understandable, and the classify results have shown the relationship between attributes. Secondly, the predefined distance function and objective function are not required, and any parameters need not be given in advance. Last, the proposed algorithm doesnÂ´t have a heavy calculation load. To evaluate the performance of the proposed LS-FCM classify algorithm, we consider three well-known benchmark clustering problems-Iris data, Wine data and Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer data.

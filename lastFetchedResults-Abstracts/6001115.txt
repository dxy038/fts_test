Objective: Investigate a method for establishment of liver metastasis model in rabbits with cirrhosis. Methods: Fifty new Zealand long-eared male adult rabbits were administered with CCl<sub>4</sub>-olive solution and drinkable white spirit to induce hepatic cirrhosis model. Body weight change, mortality, and false lobe formation rate were dynamically observed in rabbits in the experimental group in different periods. After hepatic cirrhosis model was successfully induced in 12 weeks, the rabbits were inoculated with VX2 tumor cells for 6 weeks by injecting such cells into spleen, and then liver metastasis incidence was observed. Results: After being induced for 12 weeks, the body weight increased slowly in rabbits of the experimental group; hepatic cirrhosis was successfully induced, with 80% of false lobe formation rate. After being inoculated with VX2 tumor cells for 6 weeks, the liver metastasis incidence was approximately 100%. During the experiment, the mortality of experimental rabbits was 20%. Conclusion: It may successfully induce hepatic cirrhosis model with CCl<sub>4</sub>, and establish liver metastasis model in rabbits with cirrhosis by injecting VX2 tumor cells into spleen.

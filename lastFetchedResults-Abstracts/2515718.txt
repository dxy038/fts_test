Hydraulic analysis of water networks contains determination of the distribution rate in each pipe and head of network nodes. Nowadays using meta-heuristic algorithm Simulated Annealing is increasing in solving complex engineering problems according to capabilities. Purpose of this study hydraulic analysis of water distribution network based on simulated annealing and comparing the results according to statistical indices: AE and RMSE with numerical methods: Hardy Cross, Newton-Raphson, Linear theory, Gradient and Epanet software. To determine the ability of a variety of methods to simultaneously continuity equation and energy loss network, the Objective Function is used. At the end amount of Objective Function Simulated Annealing for two loops network is 0.00016 and assessing index results indicates its accuracy in reaching problem solutions. These results prove efficiency of this method towards the other conventional methods. According the assessment can recommend Simulated Annealing as a new method and reliable in designing and analysing pressurized water networks.

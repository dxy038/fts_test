The RACE project R1030, ACCESS, has the objective to demonstrate an optimum implementation of a broadband fibre based customer access connection (CAC) with respect to cost, functionality, flexibility and technology. It was decided to assume a CAC based on digital transmission, four broadband channels downstream per customer and one or four upstream channels, electrical multiplexing for codirectional signals and WDM for bidirectional signals and use of one standard single mode fibre per customer. The transmission speed is 622 Mb/s downstream and 155 Mb/s upstream and a direct detection technique is used. The authors describe achievements in three main areas of the work: system aspects, optimization of the transceiver, and the passive optical network

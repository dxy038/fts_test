This paper demonstrates a new approach in solving problems with capacity issues within a cement factory in Libya using the Witness simulation package that enables the development of discrete and continuous simulation model to simulate these processes. The model aims to support the implementation of management systems in Supply Chain Management and the introduction of Just-In-Time systems. In order to carry out the above, research has been carried out into processes of SCM and J.I.T. The developed Simulation model is based on Libyan Cement industry, exploring supply chain management (SCM) and Just IN Time (JIT) system from start to end of the processes. Therefore, the aim and objective of investigating supply chain management and applying JIT to the cement factory using simulation at the very stage has been successful and has exercised with the simulation scenarios 1,2 and 3. This was achievable simply based on many assumptions as addressed above and with the help of the witness software that executes duties with the aid of input and output rules that need to be applied accordingly.

Biodiesel (BD) producing from various vegetable oils and animal fats are encouraging alternative fuels to diesel engine because of similar properties compared with standard diesel. The main objective of this review study is to detect influence on engine performance alteration when used BD blends to the diesel engine. The Brake Specific Fuel Consumption value significantly increasing when BD engine speed increases, but the brake thermal efficiency decreased with increasing ratio of the BD in the fuel blend. The average efficiency reduction percent was 12.8 % resulted from various reference studies. Most of the literature review reported a slight reduction in engine power and torque especially with increase of BD volume percent in the diesel blends. And also BD blends shows higher cylinder pressure compared to that of standard diesel. Many experimental results showed that the ignition delay of BD was shorter than the standard diesel fuel at the all engine speeds. The heat release rate for standard diesel is the lowest among most of BD blends.

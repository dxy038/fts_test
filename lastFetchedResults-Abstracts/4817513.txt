This paper presents a generalized approach for determination of optimal location of a FACTS device. A recently developed optimal unified power flow controller (OUPFC) is considered for the analysis. Two objectives, viz., reduction in the total system real power loss and reduction in the real power flow Performance Index considered during the optimal location of the device. In order to evaluate the performance, the parameters such as magnitude and phase angle of the inserted voltage, magnitude of shunt current and phase angle of phase shifting transformer (PST) of OUPFC are optimized. In this work, the effect of change in generation on placement of OUPFC has been investigated considering static operating conditions. The objective function is differentiated with respect to the parameter of OUPFC to be optimized in turn. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on IEEE 5-bus and 14-bus systems. Results of the proposed algorithm are compared with results available the literature.

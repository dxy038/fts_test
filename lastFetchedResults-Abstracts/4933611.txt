The paper deals with the automatic planning of robotic cell layout using multiobjective optimisation technique. The genetic algorithm developed allows one to reduce computing efforts by &#8220;growing&#8221; the required Pareto-optimal set from a small number of initial Pareto-optimal solutions that are located at the nodes of a rough grid. Various simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach for different objective functions

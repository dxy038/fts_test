The objective of the research is to provide an overview of social responsibility campaigns developed by corporations from Romania. Thus, we propose to identify in our analysis the most attractive areas for the development of social campaigns made by the companies. Meanwhile, the study aims not necessarily achieve a ranking of active companies in CSR from Romania and especially to identify the companies that developed the most campaigns. The research methodology is based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of case studies available on the website www.responsabilitatesociala.ro. Thus, in our analysis we have pointed out that the most social responsibility campaigns are conducted in the social domain and the fewest were developed in sport or human rights areas. Another relevant aspect of the research concerns the massive involvement of multinational companies in this field, but followed by the Romanian companies.

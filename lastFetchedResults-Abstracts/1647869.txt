Impacts in forced dynamic systems lead to non-smooth vibrations, showing a scenario of bifurcations. Mechanical and numerical modelling is known for rigid body systems with distinct points of contact. In contrast, continuous systems can have a line of possible contact. As an example a vibrating beam with a delaminated layer will be considered. The objective is to establish a finite element formulation for stationary nonlinear oscillation arising from the evolution of impacts along the contact line between the delaminated layer and the remaining beam. The objectives are focussed on the choice of the unknown values of a set of parameters that mainly describe energy dissipation. AÂ calibration of these parameters can be achieved by experimental results and by investigation of a minimal mechanical model.

We performed a user evaluation in a science centre to uncover the impact of emotion and enjoyment on the perceived Quality of Experience. In an evaluation with 60 students, we assessed data from the use of an installation and relate Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scales and other subjective and objective data using the partial least square methodology. We present interpretations for how participants, winners, and losers of a quiz game in the science centre experience their visit.

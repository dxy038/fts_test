The speech quality delivered by a 3G network is determined by many factors, including speech and channel coding, the design of the device, and signal processing algorithms and their interactions. This paper examines the key speech quality issues in 3G networks, describes the basics of objective speech quality measurement, and highlights its application in 3G planning, procurement, optimisation and network monitoring.

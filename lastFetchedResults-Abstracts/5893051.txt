The necessity of near-field evaluation in wireless product development will strongly grow in the coming years, since far-field evaluations provide insufficient information for analyzing and optimizing the performance of transmitters operating in complex environments. The objective of this paper is to review the latest progress in near-field measurement technology and to discuss future needs

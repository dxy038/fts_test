In this paper we develop a confidence measure that can determine if a given set of samples is suitable for inclusion in the reconstruction of a higher resolution dataset. The confidence measure is formulated as a weighted combination of two well defined objective functions. We discuss the scope of the confidence measure and the two key factors that affect it: (i) non-uniformity of the samples and (ii) error in temporal registration. We also present a greedy iterative rank-based method that uses the confidence measure for reconstruction from multiple sample sets. The proposed method is evaluated with real video, audio and MRI data.

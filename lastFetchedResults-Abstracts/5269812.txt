This contribution addresses the control design for the three-spacecraft formation flying interferometry mission Pegase. The operational mode considered is the high-precision nulling phase. The control design has as major objective the minimization of the standard deviation of the controlled outputs, e.g. the optical path difference. The payload performance demands are shown to be fulfilled in spite of sensor and actuator noise. Furthermore, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed, capable of designing decentralized H<inf>2</inf>-suboptimal controllers. These controllers consist of a set of individual closed loops on board the different spacecraft which only use locally available measurements, forces and torques. This approach reduces communication bandwidth and enhances robustness concerning faulty communication links. Finally, the performance loss due to decentralization is investigated.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) followed by oral nifidepine tocolysis in women with preterm labor between 32 0/7 and 34 6/7 weeks' gestation reduces neonatal hospital stay.
Study design
Fifty-four women between 32 0/7 and 34 6/7 weeks with preterm labor were randomized to receive either MgSO4 and oral nifidepine (n = 24) or no tocolysis (n = 30). All women received betamethasone and prophylactic antibiotics. The primary outcome was total neonatal hospital stay. Data were analyzed using Chi-square and Mann Whitney U test.
Results
The 2 groups had similar mean cervical dilation and gestational age at enrollment. There were no statistically significant differences in total neonatal hospital stay (5.8 ± 7.2 days; median of 3 days in the no tocolysis vs. 7.5 ± 8.6 days; median of 3 days in the tocolysis group), rate of preterm delivery (57% vs. 75%) or need for oxygen supplementation (7% vs. 21%, p < 0.23). The neonatal complications were similar in each group.
Conclusion
Tocolysis after 32 weeks gestation does not reduce neonatal hospital stay.

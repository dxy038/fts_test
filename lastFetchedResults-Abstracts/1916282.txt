BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Feeding intolerance is a common phenomenon in the NICU. Nursing care is a key factor in increasing the survival, health and development of premature infants. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of Kangaroo mother care on feeding tolerance in preterm infants.
METHODS: This cross over clinical trial study was performed on 100 (28-32 weeks) infants in Al-Zahra Teaching and 29 Bahman Hospitals in 2012. The infants were randomly selected and divided into two groups. The infants of first group were placed in the position of kangaroo mother care and supine position at twice of first gavage and subsequent gavage, respectively. The infants of second group were placed vice versa at twice of first and second gavage. Then the gastric residual volume was measured one and two hour/s after each feeding and three measures of abdominal distention, vomiting and defecation were examined and compared in both groups. (IRCT: 201209254613N9)
FINDINGS: Statistically, there was no significant difference between two groups in terms of demographic variables, weight, gestational age, the volume of gavaged milk, chronological age. Percentage of gavage residual volume average in the first position of kangaroo mother care (10/86±9/26) was lower than the supine position (28/55±21/39) (p?0/001) and the number of babies who had ?25% gavage residual volume in the supine position were larger than kangaroo mother care position.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the kangaroo mother care position was effective on the feeding tolerance of preterm infants. If the infants are in kangaroo mother care position, they can benefit from not only the kangaroo mother care but also the positive impact on the functioning of the digestive system.

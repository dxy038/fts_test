Due to the establishment of a regulation authority, German system operators have to face similar regulation methods and standards concerning costs and reliability, as they are already established in several European countries. For this reason, they have to ensure reasonable use-of-system charges while providing an appropriate level of reliability of supply. However, correlations between reliability of supply and network costs are still insufficient established. For this reason, the research objective of this study comprises the analysis and quantification of correlations and dependencies between reliability of supply, network costs and significant influencing parameters. The impact of significant influencing parameters, comprising the area to be supplied as well as individual planning and operation strategies, on correlations between reliability of supply and network costs have to be quantified. Furthermore, structural characteristics affecting reliability of supply have to be identified. With results of this study system operators as well as regulation authorities will achieve a more efficient adjustment of supply reliability and network costs for individual distribution networks.

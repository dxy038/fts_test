Background and Objective: Previous studies showed that basement membrane pattern is structuraly different in SCC and BCC tumors. BSCC is an epithelial malignant tumor with two histopathologic pattern similar to SCC and BCC. This study was aimed to compare the basement membrane pattern in SCC , BCC and BSCC tumors . Materials and Methods: In this laboratory study, the medical files of patients from central pathology department of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran from year 2000 to 2003 were evaluated. Seven sample sections with pathologic diagnosis of SCC, BCC and BSCC were selected and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E ), Periodic acid schiff (PAS) and Reticulin stains. In the next step, the sections were evaluated by two separate pathologists for basement membrane pattern.

Results: In the staining by H&E, PAS and Reticulin, the basement membrane of normal epithelium was continuous and thick. The basement membrane of invasive part of SCC was not continuous with H&E, PAS and Reticulin. On the other hand the epithelial mass in deeper part of lamina propria had a continuous and sharp basement membrane. With H&E , PAS and Reticulin the basement membrane of BCC was continuous and sharp. Basement membrane of BSCC was continuous and sharp in the staining by PAS, H&E and Reticulin.

Conclusion: The BSCC basement membrane was similar to BCC by application of PAS and Reticulin stains.

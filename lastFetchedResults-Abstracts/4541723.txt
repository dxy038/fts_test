The application of pyroelectric detectors to infrared imaging is reviewed, with emphasis on progress over the last several years. It is noted that pyroelectric detection represents a significant technology for infrared imaging in the 8-14-&#956;m atmospheric window. Detector materials of interest include Ba<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>TiO<sub>3 </sub> PbSc<sub>1/2</sub>Ta<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, PbZr<sub>1-x </sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and PbTiO<sub>3</sub>. The first two materials typically operate near the phase transition temperature, with DC bias applied. Lead (zirconate) titanates are poled and operate without bias well below their transition temperature. A principal objective of work on pyroelectric imaging has been to produce low-cost infrared cameras which are capable of delivering television-quality images and which operate near room temperature without requiring costly cooling systems. Good progress has occurred toward achieving this objective. Efforts to produce hybrid detectors employing reticulated barium strontium titanate ceramics are discussed

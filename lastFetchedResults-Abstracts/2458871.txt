The design and implementation of a corba (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) system has been evaluated to control and remotely operate experiments through an internet/intranet connection. The main objective of this framework is to share an experiment in a multi-user environment, possibly running over a supervisor administration. This should be done in a scalable and extensible framework for data acquisition, independent of conditions such as network infrastructures, operating system or data exchange protocols.

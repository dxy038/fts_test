It is shown in this paper how a straightforward solution to the regression problem can be obtained for continuous variables on a general-purpose analog computer. The linear case (least squares straight line) is thoroughly described. A specific nonlinear problem, that of estimating the parameters of a missile trajectory, is also described. The regression equations are derived and analog computer circuits for the solution are drawn. It is also shown that the steepest descent technique for parameter optimization is essentially the same technique as the classical statistical methods of multivariate regression analysis, but that significant analog computer circuit simplification occurs in using the steepest descent technique applied directly to the objective function.

Background and Objective: The adipokines or adipocytokines are cytokines secreted from adipocyte tissue including Vaspin and chemerin. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of intense aerobic exercise on vaspin and chemerin level changes in female Spraw dawly rats.
Materials and Methods: Among the Spraw Dawly rats available in the laboratory of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, 35 samples were selected and divided into control (15 rats) and experimental (20 rats) groups. The necessary controls were conducted in terms of nutrition, sex (female) and age (two months old). For 8 weeks, the training group rats performed a high-intensity exercise in accordance with the training program, consisting of running on a treadmill 5 times a week. This exercise was carried out progressively and in compliance with the principle of overload. The data was analyzed using independent t-test by SPSS (version 16). In order to determine the relationship between the study variables, Pearson's correlation coefficient was utilized.
Results: The research findings suggest that physical exercise reduces vaspin protein levels (P < 0.0001) and increases serum levels in chemerin (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion: It was found out that the response of adipokines in female rats to intense exercises (for 8 weeks) is different; though, it cannot be claimed that all of them exhibit increasing or decreasing effects. The response is probably influenced by the duration or the intensity of the exercise.

During the Archimedes II campaign in November 1985 (conducted and sponsored by JRC ISPRA) different DFVLR-instruments were flown, an X-band SLAR, an elementary L-band SAR, and microwaveradiometers at 32 and 90 GHz. The objective of these measurements was to evaluate the possibility of detection, localization, and qualification of oil pollution with microwave sensors. Examples of measurement results obtained are presented. As a main result, it can be stated that all of these microwave instruments are valuable and necessary tools for oil pollution detection andoil collection systems.

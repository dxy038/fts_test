ItÂ´s necessary to discuss an approach of chaotic synchronization based on exponent stability, because exponent stability is a type of more superior asymptotic stability. To realize chaotic synchronization with better synchronization capability, a theory of exponent stability was introduced, and a chaotic synchronization approach based on exponent stability of the chaotic synchronization error system was discussed. Because not all the states of the objective chaotic system are measurable in the application of chaotic synchronization, so an approach of state observer based on exponent stability for chaotic synchronization was presented on the basis of the bounded property, which makes the chaotic synchronization error satisfy exponent stability, and the capability of chaotic synchronization be improved while the chaotic systems arrive at chaotic synchronization. Based on theoretic analysis, simulation results had verified the capability of the approach based on exponent stability for chaotic synchronization is satisfying. When application in the fields of chaotic secure communication etc, the approach will have a perfect application prospect.

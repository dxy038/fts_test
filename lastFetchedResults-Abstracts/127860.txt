Objective: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the reliability of ankle musculature latency, peak and time of activation measurements on a tilting platform (APS) to sudden external frontal perturbation under different conditions.
Design. The latency, peak & time of activation of 10 healthy and 10 patients with functional ankle instability(FAI) was examined in an methodological study.
Materials & Methods: The latency, peak and time of activation after sudden inversion of the ankle were determined by APS and surface EMG.
Results: The range of ICC Values for latency of Peroneus Longus(0.71-0.97) ,Tibialis Anterior(0.75-0.99),Peroncus Brevis(0.83-0.99)and Soleus(0.97-0.99) were obtained.These values for peak of activation of Peroneus Longus(0.81-0.99),Tibialis Anterior(0.9-0.99),Peroncus Brevis(0.64-0.99), Soleus(0.98-0.99)and for time of activation of Peroneus Longus(0.89-0.99)Tibialis Anterior(0.71-0.99)Peroneus Brevis(0.91-0.99)and
Soleus(0.69-0.99) were calculated.
Conclusion: Determination of The latency, peak and time of activation was proven as a reliable measurement method.

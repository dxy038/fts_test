Anthracnose disease of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris),
caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is
responsible for extensive yield losses worldwide. This
pathogen is known to vary greatly in its pathogenicity.
Control strategies include chemical control and,
mainly, the development of resistant cultivars, taking
into account the population structure of C. lindemuthianum.
The objective of this study was to investigate
the pathogenic and genetic diversity and population
structure among C. lindemuthianum isolates collected
in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. When these isolates were
inoculated on 12 differential cultivars, a total of 10
races were identified within a series of 48 isolates collected
in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Races 65, 81 and 73
were the most frequent races and occurred in most of
the regions. This study also detected race 337, which
had not been reported previously in the literature.
Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis
performed on the same 48 isolates revealed great
genetic diversity, clustering the series into five groups
at a maximum similarity value of 89.6%. There was
no clear relationship between the loci sampled by
RAPD markers and the pathogenic characterization.
Analysis of molecular variance showed that 96.06% of
the variability was contained within regions and 3.94%
among regions, indicating a high exchange of genetic
material among the regions of the State. Most of
the variability was detected within races (75.24%). The
pathogenicity and RAPD assays corroborated
the broad genetic diversity of the pathogen and the
results have been useful in breeding for resistance to
anthracnose.

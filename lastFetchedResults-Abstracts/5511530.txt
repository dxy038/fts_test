Tire-road friction characteristics are deeply interlaced with all vehicle safety oriented control systems, as road conditions strongly affect the control schemes behavior. The main objective of this work is the real-time estimation of the wheel slip value corresponding to the peak of the tire-road friction curve, so that a reliable information on its current value can be made available to the ABS system upon activation. The proposed strategy is analyzed and tested both in simulation and on data collected on an instrumented test vehicle.

Background & Objective: Libraries are among main parts of universities as libraries of high
quality lead to improvement in education and research within universities and the society. Assessing
quality of services in educational systems is important to improve quality of provided services. This
study was conducted to assess the quality of services provided by the central library of Kerman
University of Medical Sciences from the faculty members and students' point of view.
Methods: In this study, 200 faculty members and students of Kerman University of Medical
Sciences were chosen using stratified random sampling. The data was collected using LibQUALHM
standard questionnaire after its validity and reliability were confirmed
Results: Our findings showed that the mean score of general satisfaction of the central library's
provided services was 6.13 out of 9. Among the three aspects of library service quality, information
control was the most satisfactory factor (5.98) which was followed by efficacy of services (5.96)
and the library's atmosphere (5.89). Faculty members were more satisfied with the central library's
provided services in all aspects compared to students, although this difference was not significant.
The most frequent referral to the central library and using references was once a month.
Conclusion: Although the findings of this study were suggestive of faculty members and students'
relative satisfaction of provided services, improving quality of services necessitates better and more
organized planning. Improvement of library service quality can lead to promoting faculty members
and students" scientific level in universities of medical sciences, medical knowledge, and medical
education.

In recent years, much research effort has been made aiming to alleviate and smooth the power fluctuation induced by the wind farm due to its intermittent nature. The integration of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) including battery energy storage system (BESS) and super-capacitors energy storage system (SCESS) has been considered one of the appropriate solutions to meet the technical challenge of power stabilization in power grid consisting of distributed renewable generations. In this paper, we presented a control strategy on managing the HESS to stabilize the power fluctuation in a real-time fashion without the need of predicting wind speed statistics. By the use of low-pass filter with varied time constants to obtain the power stabilization objective, the suggested approach is implemented by distributing the tasks of SCESS and BESS through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed control strategy is assessed through a set of simulation experiments and the result demonstrates its the effectiveness in stabilizing the power fluctuation of wind farms.

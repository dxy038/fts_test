The objective of the Low-Power FM Radio Receiver contest, held during the IMS 2008 in Atlanta, was to "design, construct, measure, and demonstrate an FM radio receiver with low dc (battery) power consumption driving simple earphones/ear buds." It was further specified that "the LPFMR\Â´s performance shall be measured while receiving an FM stereo signal from a local FM station with a peak audio output power of 4 mW per channel. The performance is based solely on the input power, which shall be computed as the dc supply voltage times the dc supply current."

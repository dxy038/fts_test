The ability to control cell proliferation/differentiation, using material surface, is a main goal in tissue engineering. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attachment, proliferation and differentiation to the osteoblastic phenotype of human marrow stromal cells (MSC) when seeded on poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) thin films before and after irradiation with 10 keV He+. The polymeric surface was characterized as surface chemical structure and composition, roughness and morphology on the micro- and nano-scale, wettability and surface free energy parameters. MSC were obtained from patients undergoing routine hip replacement surgery, expanded in vitro and cultured on untreated PCL and He+ irradiated PCL films for up to 4–5 weeks in osteogenic medium. He+-irradiation led to slight smoothening of the surface and different nanoscale surface chemical structure, while surface free energy resulted unchanged in comparison to untreated PCL. The results from biological testing demonstrated that early attachment and further proliferation, as well as osteoblastic markers, were higher for MSC on He+-irradiated PCL. In conclusion, the change of PCL surface properties induced by ion beam irradiation is confirmed to enhance the adhesion of MSC and support their differentiation.

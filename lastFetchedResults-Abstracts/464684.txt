OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to incorporate a wide range of operative laparoscopic techniques to complete a type III radical hysterectomy with aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy. STUDY DESIGN: A type III radical hysterectomy with bilateral aortic and pelvic lymph node dissection was separated into eight component parts: (1) right and left aortic lymphadenectomy, (2) right and left pelvic lymphadenectomy, (3) development of the paravesical and pararectal spaces, (4) ureteral dissection, (5) ligation and dissection of the uterine artery, (6) development of the vesicouterine and rectovaginal spaces, (7) resection of the parametria, and (8) resection of the upper vagina. The adequacy of the component parts was determined and documented on video. RESULTS: Complete aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy and a type III radical hysterectomy were performed by operative laparoscopy. Argon beam coagulation and countertraction facilitated pelvic and aortic lymph node dissection, including removal of nodal tissue lateral to the iliac vessels. Ureteral dissection with resection of the cervicovesical fascia (”the tunnel”) was completed with right-angle dissectors, vascular clips, and argon-beam coagulation. Resection of the cardinal and ureterosacral ligaments was successful by use of Endo-GIA stapling instruments (United States Surgical Corporation, Norwalk, Ct.). CONCLUSION: A complete pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy and type III radical hysterectomy were performed laparoscopically. This approach could potentially decrease morbidity historically associated with radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy performed either abdominally or vaginally. Only prospective randomized trials will allow for the evaluation of potential benefits associated with this surgical technique. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;174:1763-8.)

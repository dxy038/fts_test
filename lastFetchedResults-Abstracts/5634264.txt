Trough history, the mankind has had the need to communicate between them along great distances, with the objective of to share variety of information. The industry has required this communication too, and, for this reason, since many years ago have been developed different protocol to be used in control and monitoring industrial processes. However, in almost all industrial companies the use of wired o of this communication, what can be a limiting. For this reason in this document we will show an innovative system that uses a wireless communication between the industrial processes with the different sensors and the central of monitoring. Also, this system involves a serial server device, which allows monitoring the process for anywhere, via internet through a graphical interface.

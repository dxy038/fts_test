TodaysÂ´ MPSoC applications are requiring a convergence between very high speed and ultra low power. Ultra Wide Voltage Range (UWVR) capability appears as a solution for high energy efficiency with the objective to improve the speed at very low voltage and decrease the power at high speed. Using Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) devices significantly improves the trade-off between leakage, variability and speed even at low-voltage. A full design framework is presented for UWVR operation using FDSOI Ultra Thin Body and Box technology considering power management, multi-VT enablement, standard cells design and SRAM bitcells. Technology performances are demonstrated on a ARM A9 critical path showing a speed increase from 40% to 200% without added energy cost. In opposite, when performance is not required, FDSOI enables to reduce leakage power up to 10X using Reverse Body Biasing.

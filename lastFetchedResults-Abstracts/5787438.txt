Flip chip technology has been heavily focused on developing and refining the next generation of flip chip assembly and reliability; yet, little attention has been paid to the environmentally conscious aspects of manufacturing and high process throughput. Pending legislation restricting the use of lead in Europe and Japan and environmental concerns have forced flip chip technology to address new ways to meet safety and environmental requirements for the materials and processes used during assembly. The focus of this work is to implement advanced lead-free solder interconnect technology with halogen-free high density microvia substrates and define a systems-level low-cost flip chip material and process technology minimizing environmental impact. The ultimate objective is to ensure that environmentally friendly materials are selected, along with acceptable process technology for all materials as well as for the flip chip assembly

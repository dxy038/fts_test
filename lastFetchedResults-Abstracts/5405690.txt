In this paper, a Genetic-AIS (Artificial Immune System) algorithm is introduced for PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller tuning using a multi-objective optimization framework. This hybrid Genetic-AIS technique is faster and accurate compared to each individual Genetic or AIS approach. The auto-tuned PID algorithm is then fused in an Immune feedback law based on a nonlinear proportional gain to realize a new PID controller. Immune algorithm presents a promising scheme due to its interesting features such as diversity, distributed computation, adaptation and self monitoring. Accordingly, this leads to a more effective Immune-based tuning than the conventional PID tuning schemes benefiting a multi-objective optimization prospective. Integration of Genetic-AIS algorithm with Immune feedback mechanism results into a robust PID controller which is ultimately evaluated via simulation control test scenarios to demonstrate quick response, good robustness, and satisfactory overshoot and disturbance rejection characteristics.

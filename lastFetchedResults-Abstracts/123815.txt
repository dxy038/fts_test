Introduction: Bone transplant can be used to repair bone defects for bone grafts, alograft, autograft and synthetic bonegraft can be mentioned. Autograft is the idea transplant. But due to complication and limitation in rate of bone and difficulty providing alograft, using synthetic bonegraft in repairing bone defects are becoming popular.
Objective: The aim of this survey was to evaluate resulted outcome of artficial bone transplant in treatment of bone diseases.
Materials and Methods: 62 patients with bone defects who needed bone graft during one year, under went Nova Bone graft. Follow-up data were analyzed according to graft failure and bone formation.
Results:6 patients out of 62 faile to form calcium after 20 weeks of follow-up(9.7%). There were no other complications (infection and noninfection)
Conclusion:Using SBG (including Nova Bone) has been advocated recently due to several problems in cluding Allografts and Autografts.
Favorable results (90.3% calcium formation) in Patients with Nova Bone grafts (alone or in combination with auto & Allograft) Propose the regular use of it for patients need bone grafts

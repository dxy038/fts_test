In the framework of the European blanket development programme a number of ceramic breeder materials have been considered for the DEMO blanket concepts under development in the period 1992â€“1994. Candidate materials have been irradiated in the HFR Petten in a series of experiments codenamed EXOTIC. The objective of the latest series, EXOTIC-7, was to reach target and peak lithium burn-ups, representative for so-called DEMO end-of-life conditions. Further objectives were to investigate the burn-up effects on the mechanical stability and on the tritium release characteristics of the candidate ceramic breeder materials. In pile performance and results of the post irradiation examinations are discussed for metazirconates and orthosilicates, materials now considered as candidates for both ITER and DEMO blankets.

Bilevel programming has been proposed for dealing with decision processes involving two decision makers with a hierarchical structure. They are characterized by the existence of two optimization problems in which the constraint region of the upper level problem is implicitly determined by the lower level optimization problem. Focus of the paper is on general bilevel optimization problems with multiple objectives at the upper level of decision making. When all objective functions are linear and constraints at both levels define polyhedra, it is proved that the set of efficient solutions is non-empty. Taking into account the properties of the feasible region of the bilevel problem, some methods of computing efficient solutions are given based on both weighted sum scalarization and scalarization techniques. All the methods result in solving linear bilevel problems with a single objective function at each level.

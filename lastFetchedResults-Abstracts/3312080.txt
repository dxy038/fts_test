A real-life application faces various kinds of inherent uncertainties which occurs simultaneously. To find solution, formulating real world problem into mathematical programming model is challenging. Uncertain parameters in a problem model can be characterized as vagueness, ambiguous and random of the information. Such uncertainties make the existing multi-objective model incapable of handling such situations. Thus, in this paper we present the multi-objective decision model from the perspective of possibilistic programming approach to scrutinize the uncertainties in the decision making. The proposed concept can be used to build model for multi-objective problem which is exposed with various types of uncertainties. We include an illustrative example to explain the model, and highlight its advantages.

In this paper, a new resource-dimensioning concept based on both the allowable noise rise and traffic statistics is presented. The soft blocking probability based on the outage probability with the assumption of the Poisson arrival and exponential services time are first derived. To have a consistent view on the traffic engineering (dimensioning), the relationship between outage probability, soft blocking probability and hard blocking probability is discussed. Results indicate that in a CDMA system, resource dimensioning based only on the outage probability and Erlang-B model is not sufficient to ensure the objective of achieving a blocking probability target. Two soft-blocking based dimensioning methods, which combine the consideration of the noise rise and traffic statistics, are proposed for resource dimensioning of CDMA systems.

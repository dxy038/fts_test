For sometime we have been developing a system to measure parameters of the vibratory patterns of the vocal cords from ultra high speed (&#8764; 5000 frames/sec) laryngeal films. Previously, we have reported only glottal area measurements, comparing results from our automated system with those obtained by a TV system and by hand measurements using a planimeter and computer based sonic pen. In this paper we report on numerous other vocal cord vibratory parameters measured automatically from films of normal larynges. We are also making similar measurements from films of individuals with laryngeal diseases and other laryngeal malfunctions, but these latter results are not reported here. The objective of this research is to contribute data relevant to a theory of vocal cord motion and to develop aids for the hearing impaired.

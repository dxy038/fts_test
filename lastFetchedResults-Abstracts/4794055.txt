The GTD and FDTD methods are used to calculate the electric field distributions in the region between a metallic plate and three dipole antennas. The metallic plate has the dimensions of 125 cm by 35 cm and the length of each dipole antenna is 10.5 cm. Three dipole antennas have a separation of 25 cm each and stand vertically at a distance of 37.5 cm from the metallic plate. The simulation results of the electric field distributed on the x-y planes located between the metallic plate and antennas at 900 MHz, are presented. It is found that the results obtained by the FDTD and GTD methods are in good agreement. The objective is to understand the interference between antennas and electronic systems on navigational devices

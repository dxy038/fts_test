Objective: For the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we have developed a rapid and simple whole blood panel test for the detection of human heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) using one-step immunochromatography.
Methods and Results: We have developed a whole blood panel test for rapid detection of human H-FABP using a one-step immunochromatography technique. The result of this panel test was not affected by the other contents of the blood such as bilirubin, hemoglobin and others. Furthermore, no cross-reactivity of the antibodies was found with other cardiac markers or other tissue-type FABPs. The result of this panel test was similar to the diagnostic cut-off value, 6.2 ng of H-FABP per mL of serum which was evaluated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Conclusion: We have developed a simple one-step immunochromatography technique to detect H-FABP in whole blood sample. Further studies are required to identify the value of this point-of-care testing (POCT) as a diagnostic marker for AMI.

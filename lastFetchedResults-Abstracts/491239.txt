Health Systems aim to improve health by delivering health care services. But
sometimes in low-income countries, people become poor when they use
these services. So, it is required to analyze the experience of health system
financing in the selected countries and develop strategies to improve the
efficiency of health system financing.
The objective of the paper is to identify the main determinants of health
care expenditures in 10 DEeD countries over the period 1998-2004. The
major determinants of health care expenditures which are theoretically
identified comprise the total government revenue earned from health care
system, social security expenditures on health, Out-of-pocket expenses on
health, and the ratio of ex ante payments of private sector on health over the
total health expenditures.
The stylized facts of the study shows the principles of equity-base health
policy planning are notification of financing mechanisms in health sector,
identity of financing model according to the county socioeconomic
conditions, financial capacity, infrastructure, capability of implementing
selected policies, political responsibility and accountability for these
policies. The findings of estimates confirm that family health care expenditures are
affected by total Government expenditures on health, Social security
expenditures on health, Out-of-pocket expenditures on health, and the ratio
of ex ante payments of private sector on health over the total health care
expenditures. These results are used to propose some new financing
mechanisms to fmance health expenditures in Iran. The evidence shows that
the following approaches will generate new financial resources and increase
the effectiveness of the health policy, and improve justice in the Iran's health
system:
• Financing health care expenditures through taxation and more
specifically imposing progressive tax rates
• Designing and implementing of comprehensive information system
• Determining health service prices based on actual costs
• Designing and implementing effective strategies to target the health
care subsidy's system to the poor and vulnerable populations
• Improving the private and public sectors' cooperations in delivering the
health care services
• Increasing transparency of the private and public financial contribution
in the health care system
• Organizing the charity activities in health sector and monitoring their
resources and expenditures

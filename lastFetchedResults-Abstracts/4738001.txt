This paper analyzes the impact of transceiver impairments on outage probability (OP) and throughput of decode-and-forward two-way cognitive relay (TWCR) networks, where the relay is self-powered by harvesting energy from the transmitted signals. We consider two bidirectional relaying protocols namely, multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol and time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol, as well as, two power transfer policies namely, dual-source (DS) energy transfer and single-fixed-source (SFS) energy transfer. Closed-form expressions for OP and throughput of the network are derived in the context of delay-limited transmission. Numerical results corroborate our analysis, thereby we can quantify the degradation of OP and throughput of TWCR networks due to transceiver hardware impairments. Under the specific parameters, our results indicate that the MABC protocol achieves asymptotically a higher throughput by 0.65 [bits/s/Hz] than the TDBC protocol, while the DS energy transfer scheme offers better performance than the SFS policy for both relaying protocols.

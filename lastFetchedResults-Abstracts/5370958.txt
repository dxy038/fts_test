The paper deals with the objective to show a dedicated system engineering approach to developing new ISR capabilities. To illustrate this system engineering approach, ATACCS development will be used as an example. ATACCS is an automated tool that assists development of time critical intelligence products. ATACCS optimizes the operational effectiveness of ISR platforms and assists intelligence analysts and ISR battle planners by providing automated decision aids. ATACCS provides multi-sensor cross cueing, sensor data fusion, and Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) capabilities. The system correlates Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) information.

Traditionally, routing is considered solely as a network layer problem and has been decoupled from application layer objectives. Although such an approach offers simplicity in the design of the protocol stack, it does not offer good performance for certain applications such as video. In this paper, we explore the problem of how to perform routing with the objective of optimizing application layer performance. Specifically, we consider how to perform multipath routing for multiple description (MD) video in a multi-hop wireless network. We formulate this problem into an optimization problem with application performance metric as the objective function and routing and link layer considerations as constraints. We develop a formal branch-and-bound framework and exploit the so-called reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) in the solution procedure. We show that this solution procedure is able to produce a set of routes whose objective value is within (1 - e) of the optimum. We use simulation results to substantiate the efficacy of the solution procedure and compare the performance with that under non-cross-layer approach.

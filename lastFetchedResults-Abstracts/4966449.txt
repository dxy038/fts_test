This paper is focused in a mobile ad hoc network, where, the nodes can be in/out of it at any time. Furthermore, the interaction of processes running on different nodes result in the creation of new tasks, named as coordinated tasks. The execution of these new tasks requires the on-line reconfiguration of the nodes. Such reconfiguration involves the scheduling of new processes. In this work, this reconfigurability issue is solved by using a hierarchical two-level scheduler. The scheduler is one of the components of coordination triggered protocol (CTP). The objective of CTP is to enhance the nodes capacity to associate by their own to perform coordinated tasks. The scheduler and the CTP protocol are covered here.

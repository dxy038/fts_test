Realization of policy makers’ desired ideals and long-term objectives requires the employment of appropriate policy tools. Followed by studying theoretical bases of policymaking tools, it is clear that each researcher’s classification of policy tools depends on policymaking environment and their specific objective in policy clarification and no specific classification covers all policy tools. In current survey, more than 67 reliable essays and books in the policy instruments literature are identified and different clusters with qualitative meta-synthesis method were considered. Validating this selected framework with purposeful interview with elites in the field of science and technology and carrying out five case studies on policy documents were confirmed. The mentioned framework merges supply side policies, demand side policies and framework policies. By looking at the outcomes, the unbalance of supply and demand side of national policies can be inferred.

Most of the algorithmic engineering design optimisation approaches reported in the literature tends to focus on quantitative (Q<sup>T</sup>) formulation of the problem and ignore the related qualitative (Q<sup>L</sup>) issues. These Q<sup>L</sup> issues can be very important in real world problems, and by combining Q<sup>L</sup> evaluation with Q<sup>T</sup> knowledge can deliver more robust solutions. This paper presents a three objective design optimisation of long product rolling within Q<sup>T</sup> and Q<sup>L</sup> search space using a simplified method to address the membership function values within the optimisation framework. The study shows how Q<sup>L</sup> issues can be incorporated into optimisation framework to achieve near optimal solutions for multi-objective problems.

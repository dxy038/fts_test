Software test recently becomes large-scale and complicated artifact as software itself. Research and practices has to be boosted such as test architecture. In this paper first we mention TDLC: Test Development Life Cycle, which includes test requirement design phase and test architecture design phase instead of test planning from engineering view. Second we discuss concepts of test architecture and propose NGT: Notation for Generic Testing, which is a set of concepts or notation for design of software test architecture. Viewpoint is discussed as a key concept of test architecture representing a group of test cases and test objective. And this paper gives an example of test architecture model. Finally this paper shows possibility that viewpoint diagram will be a platform of test architecture design technology such as test design patterns, test architecture style, variability analysis of product line engineering and so on.

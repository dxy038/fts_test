A new method of power quality synthetic evaluation based on relative intensity entropy and local variable weight is presented in the paper. This method firstly uses the relative intensity entropy theory to extract the weights of the individual power quality indicators, and then does synthetic evaluation to the power quality data combined with the method of local state variable weight to amend the index weights, and gives the assessment point levels of their power quality. This new evaluation method embodies the gradual change of objective evaluation index weights with indicators values, and could do incentives and penalties to some weights of internal indicators. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper is more suitable for power quality evaluation, and has more practical significance.

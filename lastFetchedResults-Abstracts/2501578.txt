<div><div><div><p>Local inflammatory processes in the gastric mucosa are followed by extensive immune cell infiltration, resulting in chronic active gastritis characterized by a marked infiltration of T(h)1 cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+T-cells Objective. To investigate the correlation between CD4+/CD8+ T-cells in gastric mucosa with endoscopic appearance in chronic gastritis with or without <em>H.pylori </em>infection. Prospective, cross sectional study is performed in a chronic dyspepsia population in July-November 2009 at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The update Sydney system was used to analyze the gastroscopy appearance. Biopsy specimens were stained with HE-stain and IHC-stain. Data were analyzed by t-test, Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation test. Number of 88 consecutive subjects are enrolled the study (50% male; 50% female), age 46Â±15 years; 25% <em>H.pylori </em>positive. The expression of CD4+ and CD8+ were higher in <em>H.pylori </em>negative subjects, but only the CD4+ was significant (<em>P</em>=0.011). A significant correlation was found between CD4+ and CD8+ in both subjects (r(Hp+)=0.62 and r(Hp-)=0.68; <em>P</em>&lt;0.05). The expression of CD4+ and CD8+ in <em>H.pylori </em>positive showed a significant correlation with gastric lesions (r(CD4+)=-0.60; r(CD8+)=-0.42 ; <em>P</em>&lt;0.05), only erosion showed a significant difference in both subjects. A positive correlation was found between CD4+ and CD8+ infiltration in both subjects with or without <em>H.pylori </em>infection, and a negative correlation was only found between gastric lesion with CD4+ and CD8+ infiltration in <em>H.pylori </em>subject.</p></div></div></div>

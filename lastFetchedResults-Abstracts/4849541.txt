The primary objective of this paper is consideration of the several methods, permitting quick and easy mapping of the sensors position during near field measurements. Measured fieldÂ´s data (amplitudes and phase) in high resolution image reconstruction experimental devices must be mapped in the computer Cursor Position (CUP). The main goal is construction of a high-speed device for measurement and recording to the amplitude and phase information of the reflected electromagnetic wave over a two-dimensional surface appropriate to the exact space coordinates.

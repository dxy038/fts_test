Real-time simulation of Power Electronic Converters (PECs) allows a first realistic validation of their digital controllers and avoids experimental constrains (cost, damage risks, reliability ...). However, to increase the realism of validation, the real-time model has to reach a high level of accuracy. This objective is balanced by, among others, the computational time ensured by the used digital technology. This is one of the main reasons why Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices are preferred. The proposed paper summarizes the hardware FPGA design of PECs real-time model. The Associate Discrete Circuit (ADC) modeling technique is used for each power switch. To make the necessary functional validation, the Matlab/Simulink SimPowerSystems based model has been taken as a reference design. The proposed case study consists of a H-bridge DC-AC converter that supplies an AC load with a sinusoidal back-EMF. The corresponding FPGA-based real-time model is validated at open loop condition and at closed loop with a digital current controller. In addition to functional simulation results, real-time Hardware In the Loop (HIL) simulation results are provided.

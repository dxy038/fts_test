A large-area curtain loudspeaker was fabricated in this paper. The objective of creating a large-area projection screen which possessed functions for excellent visual image scattering and sound radiation was successfully created. Our novel sound generating techniques were shown to be suitable for futuristic audio systems which may include implementation in smart living spaces, theaters, showrooms, conference rooms, etc. Our experimental results show that the sound volume, frequency bandwidth and sound quality generated from our free-form electret-based loudspeakers are excellent for music enjoyment considering its new novel shape and size.

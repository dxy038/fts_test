In this paper, six different modifications of the Double-Flash power plants are proposed. These modifications are named “interstage heating” and consist of additional heat exchangers properly located in the system. The six interstage heating designs are analysed, optimized and then compared to an optimized Double-Flash reference power plant. The objective function is the power plant specific output (kJ/kg), and the design variables are the separator temperatures (°C) and the split fraction. Optimizations are performed for a wide range of reservoir temperatures (i.e., from 140 °C to 240 °C). Results show that interstage heating processes may increase the specific output of the plant by about 5%, decrease the liquid content in the low pressure turbine by about 50%, and decrease the required cooling capacity of the plant by about 10%. On the other hand, the analysis showed that the new designs proposed have negligible influence on the high pressure turbine liquid content or on the silica saturation coefficient.

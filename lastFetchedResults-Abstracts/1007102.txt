The objective of the present work is the numerical simulation of the thermal and fluid dynamic fields in the cabin of an executive aircraft. A transient analysis is conducted on three-and two-dimensional models of an executive aircraft cabin and a comparison of the two approaches is provided. In the model, a global thermal conductance was considered to take into account both the external environment and the fuselage material. The results, provided in terms of graphs and contours, refer to the three-and two-dimensional models with inclined top inlets with respect to the vertical direction of an angle of 45Â°. A good qualitative agreement between the results of the two and three-dimensional models is detected.

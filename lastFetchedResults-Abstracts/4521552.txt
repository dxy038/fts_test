Research in the field of VLSI digital signal processing (DSP) involves study of algorithms and architectures for VLSI implementation of signal and image processing algorithms, theory of architectures and design methodologies, and computer aided design of VLSI DSP systems which can meet the area-speed-power demands of applications using available technologies. The objective in design and implementation of VLSI DSP systems is to reduce the area and power while meeting the speed requirements of the real-time applications. Although about one and a half decades old, this field is still in its youth. The challenges in meeting the speed-power demands of new applications leads to innovations in theory of architectures. At the same time use of old techniques in new applications allows us to further generalize and extend known principles. Because of these continuing advances and because of lack of text books in this field, it remains difficult to educate practicing engineers and graduate students in this field. This paper presents can overview of two ten-week quarter courses offered at the University of Minnesota to train graduate students in this field

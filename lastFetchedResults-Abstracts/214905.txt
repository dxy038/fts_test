Objective- The true incidence of congenital cardiovascular malformations is difficult to determine
accurately, partly because of difficulties in definition. About 0.8 percent of live births are
complicated by a cardiovascular malformation. Hypoxia and cyanosis, the common complications
of all cyanotic disease, may be life-threatening in severe forms. Today, the trend is towards the
total surgical correction of these anomalies in early life. As the accomplishment of this strategy in
various parts of the world is not possible, palliative procedures like systemic-pulmonary shunt
have retained their importance.
Methods- Data were collected from the files of 180 patients, for whom systemic-pulmonary shunt was
performed by a single surgical group at our center between March 1992 and May 2006. Our aim
was to determine the outcome of shunt operation in terms of success rate, morbidity, and
mortality.
Results- The median age and weight of the patients was 24 months and 10.5 kilograms, respectively.
There was a spectrum of underlying cyanotic heart diseases. The main operation was the modified
Blalock-Taussig shunt (90%). The mean value of oxygen saturation was 62% pre-operatively,
which rose to 85% after surgery. We found a 77.9% success rate, 6.7% mortality rate, and 8.7%
morbidity rate.
Conclusion- There was no significant correlation between the predictive factors and success of
operation. Lower age and weight of the patient, small size of the pulmonary artery, and urgency of
operation predicted the operative mortality

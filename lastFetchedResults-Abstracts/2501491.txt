Objective: In vivo and in vitro stem cell differentiation into endothelial cells is a promising
area of research for tissue engineering and cell therapy.
Materials and Methods: We induced human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate
to endothelial cells that had the ability to form capillaries on an extracellular matrix
(ECM) gel. Thereafter, the differentiated endothelial cells at early stage were characterized
by expression of specific markers such as von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2, and CD31. In this experimental model, the endothelial
cells were transplanted into the groins of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice.
After 30 days, we obtained tissue biopsies from the transplantation sites. Biopsies were
processed for histopathological and double immunohistochemistry (DIHC) staining.
Results: Endothelial cells at the early stage of differentiation expressed endothelial markers.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, in addition to DIHC demonstrated homing of
the endothelial cells that underwent vascularization in the injected site.
Conclusion: The data clearly showed that endothelial cells at the early stage of differentiation
underwent neovascularization in vivo in SCID mice. Endothelial cells at their early
stage of differentiation have been proven to be efficient for treatment of diseases with
impaired vasculogenesis.

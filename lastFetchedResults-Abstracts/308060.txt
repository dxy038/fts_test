Hyaluronan is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix with important roles in cell and tissue functions. Hyaluronan content is often elevated in cardiovascular diseases, such as mitral valve disease and atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of endogenously produced hyaluronan dynamically cultured three-dimensional model of collagenous tissues. Collagen gels containing excess HA and hyaluronan synthase (has) overexpressing cells were grown in a cyclic strain environment to simulate cell-mediated matrix organization. Cyclic strain caused a significant elevation in the collagen fibril density, cell number, and hyaluronan content of the resulting collagen gels compared to those grown under a static strain regimen. The material behavior of collagen gels containing has overexpressing cells was also notably weakened compared to controls. Transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed that proteoglycan distribution was influenced by both strain and has overexpression. The results were also dependent on the specific has isozyme overexpressed. This investigation helps to identify the mechanism by which hyaluronan acts in vivo to alter tissue material behavior in cardiovascular diseases such as myxomatous mitral valve disease and atherosclerosis.

This demonstrator illustrates the performance of our designated intra-frame video codec for low-resolution visual sensors. The encoder of the presented compression system runs on a low-power visual sensor, which captures stereo frames of 30&#215;30 6-bit gray-scale pixels. A laptop computer is connected using a serial connection and runs the decoder in real-time, displaying the resulting visual quality, frame-rate and compression efficiency in terms of bits per pixel. Additionally, a software environment is available to the user for further evaluation of the compression performance of the codec. The user can manipulate the control parameters of the codec at will. The objective and subjective quality of the decoded video and their evolution depending on the complexity of the scene, as well as the chosen settings of the codec, are monitored in real-time.

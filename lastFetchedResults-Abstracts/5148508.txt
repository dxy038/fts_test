This paper deals with the application of modeling of mobile radio channels in aquatic environment. The development of wireless communication can be extremely difficult due to the aggressiveness of the air and aquatic environment. Indeed, the main objective of this work is to improve the quality of transmission over a mobile radio channel and a channel of water through sets of technical coding and modulation in order to obtain an ideal channel using the simulation communication system that is an effective and quick means to highlight performances and conception of the main difficulties of these last, using a simulation tool "matlab / simulink".

Facial aging simulation and animation are aspiring goals and challenging tasks because the growth and aging processes greatly influence the facial shape and its structure. The face structure, the size of the bones, and the skin texture change, the skin fattens or sags, wrinkles appear and even muscular activities change in terms of intensity. This paper proposes a novel facial animation algorithm with two techniques integrating such items. These techniques discuss the facial deformation based on the face anthropometry theory and simulates wrinkles with what we call the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) quotient image technique. Given some neutral face F, the idea is to capture two characteristics of F with advancing years. The first is the geometric deformation details like skin texture given in F after passing years. The second is the anthropometric data change that developed in the face anthropometry measurements theory. Then, together with a warping technique we map these characteristics to any other particular personÂ´s face in order to generate more expressive and convincing facial senility. The original contribution and advantages of this paper compared with the other proposed methods are that, the proposed techniques are simple to implement, reliable in that they require only one source image without needing to collect a lot of images and their computations are fast enough for an interactive environment. Experimental results demonstrate our approach with a variety of facial aging animations

In this study, a nominal characteristic trajectory following (NCTF) controller for point-to-point (PTP) positioning systems is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The NCTF controller consists of a nominal characteristic trajectory (NCT) and a compensator. The objective of the NCTF controller is to make the object motion follow the NCT and end at its origin. Therefore, the NCT is used as an intended object motion and the compensator is used to make the motion of the controlled object follow the NCT. The NCTF controller is designed based on a simple open-loop experiment of the object and no information except the NCT is necessary for controller design. The effectiveness of the NCTF controller is evaluated and discussed through simulations and experiments using an experimental rotary positioning system. The effect of the design parameters on the robustness of the NCTF controller to inertia and friction variations is evaluated and the influence of saturation on the positioning performance is examined. Moreover, the effects of the saturation on the positioning performance and robustness are compared with those of conventional PID ones. It is proved that the NCTF controller is much more accurate and robust to inertia and friction variations than the PID controllers, even if the saturation occurs.

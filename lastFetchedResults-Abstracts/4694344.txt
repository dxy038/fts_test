The complexity of current day embedded systems is steadily on the rise due to innovative content consumption applications. Embedded systems have to be adaptable and scalable to meet the unique resource demands of such applications to deliver satisfactory performance. Effective sharing of system resources by content consumption applications is imperative for user satisfaction. In this paper, we address the challenge of coming up with a design for an efficient scheduler for Multiple Application and Multi-threaded polymorphic embedded system with user satisfaction as its objective function. Randomly generated application graphs serve as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the proposed polymorphic scheduler framework. We also discuss the impact of our scheduler on the user satisfaction of a multimedia application as a real world case study. The performance enhancements obtained using the proposed greedy polymorphic thread scheduling algorithm are demonstrated by comparison against classical approaches such as First Come First Serve(FCFS) and priority scheduling schemes.

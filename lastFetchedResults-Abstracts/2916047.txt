Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) performance management is concerned with the network management and control functions that relate to the quantitative behaviour (performance) of ATM networks. An important objective of performance management is to ensure that the network is able to maintain required quality of service (QOS) levels efficiently. The requirements for service integration and a guaranteed high QOS imply that a high level of performance management capabilities must be embedded in the network. The author discusses specific, important aspects of ATM performance management and describes current thinking within the BT (British Telecom) on these subjects

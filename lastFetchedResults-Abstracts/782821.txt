Objective of this paper is to describe the challenges associated with the implementation
of the control programme of Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus infections in goats in South
Tyrol, Italy. From 2007 to 2010, a total of 72,714 goats older than 6 months were serologically
tested by means of an ELISA for the presence of Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus
antibodies. Seropositive animals were culled. In total, 2576 goats were found to be positive
in 2007, 657 goats in 2008, 329 goats in 2009 and 196 goats in 2010. Prevalence of
seropositive animals decreased from 14% in 2007 to 1% in 2010. Prevalence of herds with
seropositive animals decreased from 32% in 2007 to 6% in 2010. The programme did not
disturb the future of the local breed ‘Passeirer Mountain Goat’, although the quality of the
breed was considered to have decreased, as the highest rates of infection were recorded
in herds with high pedigree goats. Price of animals for slaughter decreased by 50%, due to
the surplus of available animals. Trading activities had nearly stopped, as only few herds
were fulfilling the requirements of the programme regarding movements of animals to
markets. All possible results of the serological test should be explained to farmers, in order
to maintain their confidence in the programme and their cooperation

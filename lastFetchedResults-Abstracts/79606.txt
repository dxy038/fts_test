The objective of the present work was to detect and analyze wheezes by means of a highly Asensitive time-frequency algorithm. Automatic measurements were compared with clinical auscultation for forced exhalation segments Afrom 1.2 to 0 liters/second (l/s). Sensitivities between 100% and 71%, as a function of flow level related to wheezing Asegments detection, were achieved. Time-frequency wheeze parameters were measured for the flow range from 1.2 to 0.2 l/s. Wheezes Awere detected in both analyzed groups; asthmatics (N=16) and control subjects (N=15). Significant differences between Agroups were found for the mean number of wheezes detected at basal condition (p=0.0003). Frequency parameter differences Awere also significant (0.0112<P<0.0307).All. these parameters were also studied after applying a bronchodilator drug (Terbutaline) Significant differences between patient groups were found when studying the changes in the number of wheezes for each patient (p = 0-0195). Finally, limited bandwidth  parameters. wbich measure the bronchodilator response, were also studied.

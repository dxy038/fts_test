The authors propose and demonstrate a bidirectional subcarrier-multiplexed self-healing ring network for code-division multiple access (CDMA) personal communication services (PCSs). This network is capable of restoring functionality automatically in the event of fibre failure by monitoring the power of the RF signals. The results show that the restoration was achieved within 50 &#956;s for a 9.3 km ring network

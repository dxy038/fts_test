The aim of the paper is to present a novel method for solving radial electrical distribution networks. The proposed method involves only the evaluation of simple algebraic voltage expressions without any trigonometric functions. Thus, computationally, the proposed method is very efficient and requires less computer memory storage as all data is stored in vector form. In this paper, the proposed method is tested in IEEE 12-bus system and IEEE 33-bus system. The main objective of the proposed work is to solve a distribution network through novel approach.

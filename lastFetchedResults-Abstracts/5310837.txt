The current standard approach for developing robot software applications is to use middleware for robotics. Protocols and paradigms have been set by the available middleware. However, not all of them share a common interface, resulting in difficulties when developing robot applications using software developed for different platforms. Even inside the same platform similar issues arise when software elements inside it are made by different developers. The research objective is to propose and define an Intelligent Cross-Platform Interface (ICPI) that enables data sharing among software elements from different developers, as well as data from different middleware platforms. Such interface is to be complemented by additional modules residing inside it to enhance the functionality. In this article one of the modules is discussed, this module is for the administration of data and software in a robot application. The Administration by Roles module is presented to act as the manager module of the ICPI, the module enables the categorization of software elements and their related data.

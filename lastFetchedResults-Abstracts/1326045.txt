This paper reviews the nature of detailed design process and discusses the implementation of a knowledge-based system (KBS) founded on a protocol analysis study. The main objective is to discuss the features of a knowledge-based modeling approach, kNOwledge-based modeling for detailed DESign process (NoDes). This approach was first used for the development of the wind, which is an interactive KBS for the synthesis of window parts. We take the wind as an exemplary prototype implementation to demonstrate the abilities and performance of our knowledge-based modeling approach. Besides knowledge analysis and simulation of task execution, this paper also argues the efficiency of the object-oriented programming approach in the system implementation.

Since the solar array is the most expensive component of a photovoltaic system, appropriate sizing for a particular application should be a major concern of the designer. The principal objective of this research is to explore the effect of the load profile on the sizing process of the solar cells array (SCA), and as a function of time. It is possible to quantify and determine the load classes that accomplish this. This paper proposes a novel technique in which an accurate optimum design of the solar cell array (SCA) can be attained. It depends on an hour-by-hour approach with different daily load profiles. Previous SCA sizings have not used this approach. In order to address this problem, it is necessary to use the hourly variation of the load demand and the daily insolation curve of all the months for a specific site. The load demand is classified as industrial, residential, hospital, commercial and miscellaneous. All of these are assumed to have distinct load profiles. Thus, a new approach has been proposed to solve the problem hour-by-hour taking the most common load profiles for the investigation. A generalized mathematical model has been developed for the SCA size as a function of time, month, the SCA tilt angle and load profile (as expressed in load factor).

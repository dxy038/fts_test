This paper presents a MATLAB-based fault analysis of Power Systems with Graphical User Interface (GUI). The objective of the paper is designing a user friendly Graphical User Interface as an educational tool that helps students who are new to the power system area and studying fault conditions of electrical power systems. There are commercial programs and customized toolboxes developed for education and research but most of them are not user friendly and visualization capacities are low. This paper is intended to fill this gap for fault analysis. User can choose or add the system he/she wants to work on and display the bus voltages and fault currents. This GUI lets users change the faulted phases and buses and at the same time observe the changes in the system operation under fault conditions. This interface is developed under MATLAB 7. This paper will report the structure of the current development.

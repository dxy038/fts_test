The objective of this paper is to propose an approach for smart distribution transformer (TR) management to help implement emergency demand response (DR) at a TR. In this paper, a DR algorithm embedded in a multiagent system is presented. The proposed algorithm ensures that an instantaneous power demand at a TR is kept below a certain demand limit during a DR event while the impacts of demand restrike are minimized. At the same time, homeowners´ goals of securing critical loads, mitigating comfort level violation, and minimizing appliance´s compensation time during a DR event are taken into account. To validate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DR algorithm, a case study of a TR serving three homes is demonstrated.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the inactivation induced by ultra high pressure homogenisation (UHPH) of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13565 and Staphylococcus carnosus CECT 4491 inoculated into milk and orange juice considering the effect of inlet temperature of the sample (6 and 20 °C) on the lethality values and on the production of sublethal injuries. Samples of UHT whole milk and UHT orange juice were inoculated at a concentration of approximately 7.0 log (CFU/ml) and pressurized with a dual valve UHPH machine at 300 MPa at the primary homogenising valve and at 30 MPa on the secondary valve. Viable and injured bacterial counts were measured 2 h after UHPH treatment and after 3, 6, and 9 days of storage at 4 °C for milk, and after 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days of storage at 4 °C for orange juice. The inlet temperature, the food matrix and the kind of strain influenced significantly (P < 0.05) the lethality level, which was higher for S. aureus in whole milk at an inlet temperature of 20 °C. No sublethal injuries were detected after treatments. The change over time of viable counts for both strains showed a very strong decreasing tendency during the storage at 4 °C for orange juice, while the strain S. carnosus showed a low decreasing tendency and greater resistance when inoculated in milk and pressurized at 6 °C.

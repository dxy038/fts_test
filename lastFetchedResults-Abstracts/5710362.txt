This paper proposes a multi-objective, highly generalized and efficient control framework for a virtual character performing various physical interactions in a dynamically simulated world. The framework comprises 1) a generalized inverse dynamics that determines joint forces satisfying multiple objectives considering priorities, unactuated joints and inequality constraints about contacts, 2) a generalized stabilizer available in various contact situations based on the long-term momentum stabilization and 3) a motion primitive network for realizing composite motions by modularizing and interconnecting motion functions. By applying the proposed framework, various interactions with a virtual humanoid, such as basic reflections and carrying objects, are realized in real time with a tactile sensation through the two-armed multi-fingered haptic device we developed.

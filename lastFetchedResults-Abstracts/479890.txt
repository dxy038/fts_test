Background and Objective: Serum HDL cholesterol concentration may be affected by different factors. One of this factors is the race of each person. Therefore we studied HDL – cholesterol reference range in different ethnic groups in Ahwaz by regard to age and gender.
Subjects and Methods: Serum samples were drown from 601 males and 617 females  randomly. This population was divided into main groups according their ethic (i.e Lor, Arab and Persian ). Each group was subdivided on the basis of age to three Subgroups (1-15,16-54and  > 54 years). Serum HDL – cholesterol was determined with colorimetric method. All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 17.0).
Results:Mean HDL – cholesterol Concentration in age subgroups of females was statistically different. (P < 0.0001).While in males it was not apparent relationship between mean concentration Of HDL – Cholesterol concentration in age subgroups (P=0.630). In male subgroups, mean HDL-cholesterol was significantly different (P < 0.05). Lor individuals had the highest and Arab individuals had the lowest mean HDL-cholesterol concentration. But in females such relationship was not seen. (P=0.743). 
Conclusion: In male group the reference range of HDL-cholesterol is affected by race and in female group the reference range of HDL-cholesterol is affected by age.

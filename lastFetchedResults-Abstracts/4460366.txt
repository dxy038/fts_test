The research objective of this work is to realize multimodal human-robot interaction based on light-weight Chatterbot system. The dialogue system is integrated into SIGVerse system with immersive multimodal interfaces to achieve interaction in an embodied virtual environment. To validate the feasibility of the proposed design, the actual AIML implementations are described to illustrate (a) Gesture Inputs, (b) Emotional Expressions, (c) Robot Interactive Learning, and (d) Interactive Learning towards Symbol Grounding in multimodal human-robot interaction.

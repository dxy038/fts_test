In this paper, a report is released in relation to an example of the application of the genetic algorithm based on a local evaluation rule where attention is paid to a region in a communication circle from an access point taking up an access point layout problem in the wireless LAN construction as an objective. When the optimum solution is probed by means of an evaluation function taking up the whole entity of the LAN, a circuit becomes unstable in a specific service area even if a solution is the quasi-optimum solution as the whole entity of the system in case that attention is paid to the individual clients, there might be a possibility that an area not necessarily successful in realizing high-quality service is in existence. In this paper, it is explained that the method hereby proposed can first of all obtain the quasi-optimum solution taking up the whole entity of the wireless LAN system, as with the case that an evaluation function taking up the whole entity of the system as an objective is applied. At the next stage, it is explained whether there is a possibility that a solution for practical use where clientsÂ´ communication situation is considered in a service area will be obtained.

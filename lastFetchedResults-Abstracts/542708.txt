BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Varicocele is cited as one of the most common treatable causes of male factor infertility. Diagnosis of varicocele is based on physical examination and also sonography and venography. The aim of this study was to assess the consistency rate of clinical grading of varicocele and venous diameter in sonography. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 85 patients with symptoms of scrotum pain and fullness and infertility who referred to private office. Physical examination was performed on patients and the grading of varicocele was recorded. In sonography, their venous diameter in vasalva maneuver was measured by radiologist. Then sonography findings were compared with clinical grading. FINDINGS: In this study a sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 64.9% in sonography were compared to physical examination, and positive predictive value was 68.6% and negative predictive value was 93.8% (p=0.000) and also there was a significant relationship between existence of reflux and increasing of grading of varicocele in physical examination with increasing of venous diameter. Mean venous diameter was 2.1±0.55 mm, 2.7±0.52 mm, 3.31±0.38 mm and 3.8±0.45 mm in cases with no clinical varicocele, varicocele grade 1, varicocele grade 2 and varicocele grade 3, respectively (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, we can estimate grading of varicocele with knowing of venous diameter in sonography, and also sonography as an appropriate test for screening of the patients can be used.

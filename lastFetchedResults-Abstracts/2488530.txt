This paper presents a set of multi-objective programming problems in a rough
environment. These problems are classied into ve classes according to the location of the
roughness in the objective functions or the feasible set. We study the class in which all of
the objective functions are crisp and the feasible region is a rough set and, in particular,
discuss the properties of the complete and ecient (Pareto optimal) solutions of rough
multi-objective programming problems. In order to obtain these solutions, we need certain
theorems, which we derive. Finally, we illustrate our results by examples.

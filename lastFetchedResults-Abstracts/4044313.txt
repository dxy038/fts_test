The link layer is one of the key differentiating functions in a DVB-H receiver. In order to differentiate between silicon solutions, manufacturers can choose between basic or advanced link-layer implementation concepts, resulting in modest or excellent data retrieval performance, respectively. Hence, objective performance evaluation, which proves the quality of the link layer implementation, is an essential step to validate product robustness. This paper presents techniques for validation and verification tools to evaluate the DVB-H link-layer robustness. The proposed techniques for robustness testing are capable of generating both regular and extreme signal conditions. Furthermore, we also discuss an efficient analysis tool required to inspect (1) the IP-based output data, (2) Service Information and (3) Program Specific Information of the link layer. Simulation results for improved link-layer performance presented by the tools are validated from a newly developed silicon implementation<sup>1</sup>.

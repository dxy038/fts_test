The objective of this project is to design a domain-independent framework that allows rapid development of applications customized for specific user needs. We see three major components in the design: (1) persistent storage management, (2) computational logic and execution environment, and (3) methods for orchestrating computations. Recent developments in industry and academia have made available solutions for persistent storage management and distributed execution of computational tasks (e.g., the .NET and the Websphere infrastructures). This project builds upon these efforts; it permits the specification and instantiation of scripts for orchestrating the execution of several computational tasks. The orchestration script specifies what computations to perform and when; but no information on how to perform the computations.

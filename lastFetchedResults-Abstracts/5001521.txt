This study paper presents a new robust multi-criteria optimization method that employs the Taguchi method to design and analyze an ultra-thin centrifugal fan. The objective of this study is to obtain the maximum volume flow rate, static pressure, and minimum noise of a fan. The proposed approach utilizes a combined orthogonal array and computational fluid dynamics method to simulate the internal flow field of the ultra-thin centrifugal fan. This study employs signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance to determine the Pareto-optimal robust design solution. The operation section of the optimized fan P-Q curve design is almost 30% larger than the original design. This research also identifies the optimal design parameters that affect the cooling performance of the centrifugal fan. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this approach.

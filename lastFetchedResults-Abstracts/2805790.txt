Yogyakarta does not have any non renewable energy sources such as liquid fossil fuels, coal and natural gas. Consequently, these energy resources must be supplied from other provinces. This study purposed to evaluate the existing energy demand and supply in Yogyakarta and to predict the supply and demand by empowering the use of renewable energy which meets the objective of the energy mix and energy elasticity of less than 1. The objectives of energy mix for renewable energy based on KEN and KED scenarios were 17% and 9.28% respectively in 2025. This study used a model of LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System) version: 2011.0.0.40. Based on KED scenario, the energy demand in Yogyakarta showed that the highest energy user sector was the transportation and the household sectors. To achieve the objectives of the elasticity ratio of energy, first by decreasing the energy consumption in transportation and electricity sectors. Transportation sector consumed 53.49% of energy but only contributed 10.69% added value to GDP. Utility sector (electricity, water and gas) used 36.41% of energy consumption, but the value added to GDP was only 0.91%. The second step was to increase economic growth in the commercial sector and agriculture. Commercial sector was the highest contributor to GDP at 23.90% but used only 4.25% of energy. The agricultural sector could provide an added value of 18.59% to GDP, but only used 0.50% of energy. With existing resources, renewable energy generation in 2011 accounted for only 0.88% of total load. In 2025 the renewable energy generation is expected to contribute to the energy mix by 5%.

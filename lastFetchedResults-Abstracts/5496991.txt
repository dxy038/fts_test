This paper presents the authorsÂ´ experience in the application of AI technique to optimal power flow (OPF) planning. The purpose of an OPF function, as a fundamental tool of an energy management system (EMS), is to schedule the power system controls to optimize an objective function while meeting defined standards of security and quality of supply. The development of new optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms, as well as the implementation of object oriented approaches, provides a conceptual framework for innovative software environments with a unified modular structure to include computational optimization and intelligent functions. This approach was used for the development of the GANOS software environment, where power management experts and AI technique developers experiment with the innovative algorithms and their interactions

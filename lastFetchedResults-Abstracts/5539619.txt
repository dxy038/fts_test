Summary form only given.For the investigation of ultrafast processes, it is a widely used method to create a dynamic grating by two intersecting pump pulses and measure the intensity of a probe beam diffracted off this transient grating as a function of its delay. In this contribution, we suggest an alternative setup to create dynamic gratings by ultrashort light pulses. It utilizes a reflecting microscope objective for imaging of an optical transmission grating onto the sample. In this system, the period of the created grating in the sample call be easily changed by changing the demagnification of the objective. We chose a reflective objective in order to eliminate the chromatic aberration.

Monocrystalline solar cells are the oldest, most efficient and dependable ways to produce electricity from the Sun, and these cells are temperature sensitive. This paper studies the relatively new method of cooling Monocrystalline solar cell with the arrangement of Thermoelectric cooler (TEC) at the back of the solar cell. The objective of thermoelectric cooler and cold plate arrangement is to maintain the operating temperature of solar cell. The experimental results are quite significant and efficiency enhancement is observed. The steady state thermal analysis of the model is done in ANSYS Fluent 6.3.26

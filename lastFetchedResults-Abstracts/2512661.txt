<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the potentiality of OVCARâ€“3 cell line of ovarian adenocarcinoma as a xenograft model for ovarian adenocarcinoma in nude mice.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> The cell line isolated from advanced human ovarian adenocarcinoma, were inoculated to eight nude mice and two months later. Established tumors were transferred to pathology laboratory to be prepared by H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemical staining with CA125 antibody.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Study of H&amp;E slides showed advanced adenocarcinoma. The CA125 Tumor marker was also positive in tumoral tissue.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Established tumors showed excellently the characteristics of ovarian adenocarcinoma. This model can be used to evaluate new treatment strategies.</p>

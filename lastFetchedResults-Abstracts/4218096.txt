0-1 integer programming model of steel making scheduling was presented. Boolean algebra was applied to restrict the search space of particle swarm optimization to 0-1 space. As for the difficulty of constraint problem of 0-1 integer programming, a cooperative particle swarm optimization(CPSO) algorithm was proposed, which embody two particle swarms, oneÂ´s goal is to minimize the objective function, the other is to meet the constraint condition. Two particle swarms cooperate to solve the 0-1 integer programming problem. The CPSO algorithm has been applied to solve the steel making scheduling problem successfully.

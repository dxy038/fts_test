In emerging electric power systems, due to increased loading or due to severe contingencies often lead to situation where system no longer remains in the secure operating region. Under these situations, it is primary objective of the operator to apply control action to bring the power system into the secure region. FACTS devices can play a very important role in power system security enhancement. Due to high capital investment, it is necessary to locate these devices optimally in the power system. In this paper, a real power flow performance index (PI) sensitivity based approach and the line outage distribution factor has been proposed to decide optimal location of Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) and Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) to enhance the security of the power system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller has been tested on modified IEEE 30 bus system using Power World Simulator Software Version 12.0.

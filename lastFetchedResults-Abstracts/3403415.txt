The suitability of different scanning formats and upconversion algorithms for improved definition television (IDTV) applications is evaluated. The properties of different scanning formats are discussed. State-of-the-art interlaced-to-progressive conversion algorithms are introduced. Algorithms were evaluated with subjective testing methods, and the results are compared with objective measures

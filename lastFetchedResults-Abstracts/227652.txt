Optimal inverter substation planning is solved by minimising the overall cost of power
consumption and inverter investment for mass rapid transit power systems with immune algorithm
(IA). The objective function and constraints are expressed as antigens, and all feasible solutions are
expressed as antibodies in the IA simulation process. The diversity of antibodies is then enhanced
by considering the proximity of antigens so that the global optimisation during the solution process
can be obtained. It is found that energy regeneration, which results from the braking operation of
train sets approaching the next station, can be restored effectively by the optimal planning of
inverters using the proposed immune algorithm.

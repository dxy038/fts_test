The global control objective of a CSTR for nitrogen removal is to maintain the process at its nominal steady-state despite disturbances of influent ammonia and physical constraint of the actuator. The control problem can be expressed in terms of stabilization and disturbances attenuation of a linear system by a dynamic output feedback controller under input constraints. A solution to this H<sub>2</sub> problem is proposed, based on quadratic stabilizability theory and using linear matrix inequalities

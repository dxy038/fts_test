In a recent comment on the paper by Aronson and McNulty (2009) about “Appropriate experimental ecosystem warming methods by ecosystem, objective, and practicality”, Amthor et al. (2010) state that infrared lamps do not warm open-field plots by the mechanism expected with global warming. While this statement is correct, in the aftermath of their comment, confusion exists about how warming with infrared heaters can be related to global warming. This comment illustrates how infrared heating at “constant temperature rise” relates in a quantitative way to anticipated global warming. Amthor et al. (2010) also state that changes in vapor pressure gradient from leaf to atmosphere are an issue with infrared heating, but this problem can be minimized with supplemental irrigations in controlled amounts. Therefore, “constant temperature rise” infrared warming experiments with supplemental irrigations are a viable T-FACE (temperature free-air controlled enhancement) that can be used in combination with CO2-FACE to produce conditions more representative of future open-fields than can be done with chambers with their many known artifacts.

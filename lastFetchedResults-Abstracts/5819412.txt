Objective: To observe the effect of LongChai decoction-containing serum (LCD-CS) on the secretion of HBsAg, HBeAg and cell cycle in HepG2.2.15 cells. Methods: MIT assay was used to detect the viability of HepG2.2.15 cells after treatment of LCD-CS for 48 h. The content of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2.2.15 cell culture supernatant treated with LCD-CS for 48 h or 96 h was detected by ELISA. Effect of LCD-CS on cell cycle of HepG2.2.15 cells for 48 h was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: LCD-CS could cause the morphological changes of HepG2.2.15 cells and exert significantly antiproliferative effects; The cell viability of LCD-CS decreased significantly compared with the blank serum group (*P&lt;;0.05, **P&lt;;0.01); LCD-CS significantly inhibited the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg, compared with the blank serum group(* P&lt;;0.05, ** P&lt;;0.01); LCD-CS made cell cycle arrest at the GO/G1 phase, and blocked cell proliferation. Conclusion: LCD-CS had effect of anti-HBV in vitro.

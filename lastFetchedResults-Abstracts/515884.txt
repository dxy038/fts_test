Background and objective: Few studies have shown the role of oxidative stress in gestational diabetes mellitus. Increased oxidative stress and antioxidant defense dysfunction could be one of the etiologic factors in gestational diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate levels of salivary antioxidants in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus and their comparison with non-diabetic pregnant women.

Materials and Methods: In this semi-experimental study that was done in 2009-2011 in Hamadan, 5 cc unstimulated saliva from 35 gestational diabetics and 35 non-diabetic pregnant women with an age range of 25-40 and BMI of 25-40 was collected. Enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase, uric acid and total antioxidant capacity were measured with special kits by spectrophotometric method. Data were analyzed by t-test using SPSS program.

Results: Activity of superoxide dismutase in gestational diabetes mellitus was significantly lower than control group (p < 0.001). Total antioxidant capacity changes was not significant and uric acid changes was also the same as total antioxidant capacity level and was not significant (p=0.663). 

Conclusion: Antioxidants deficiency and altered response to elevated levels of oxidative stress seems to have a role in pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus.

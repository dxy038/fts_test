The thermoacoustic engine micro-cycle is of great importance to the thermoacoustic phenomenon. By taking an exergy efficiency criterion as the objective, the performance of a thermoacoustic engine micro-cycle model with heat transfer loss was analyzed by using finite-time thermodynamics. The analytical expression about the exergy efficiency is derived. The relations between the exergy efficiency and the oscillating temperature, the exergy efficiency and the heat efficiency, as well as the exergy efficiency and the sound work output rate relation of the micro-cycle are investigated by numerical examples. The results obtained herein can provide some theoretical guidance for the design of a real thermoacoustic engine.

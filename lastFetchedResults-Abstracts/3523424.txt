The prime objective of the study was to develop distribution-system planning models which can be used by distribution-system planners to determine optimum expansion patterns or alternatives by selecting: optimum substation locations, i.e. sites; optimum substation expansions; optimum substation transformer sizes; optimum load transfers between substations and demand centres; and optimum feeder routes and sizes to supply the given loads, i.e. demands, subject to a number of constraints, to minimise the present worth of the total costs involved. The results indicate that the developed optimisation models can be very valuable tools in planning distribution systems

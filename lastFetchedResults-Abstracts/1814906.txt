 A methodology is presented in this paper to find optimal location and dosage of chlorine
injection in water distribution networks. The objective is to minimize the chlorine consumption while keeping
the residual chlorine at each node within the standard range. Unfortunately because of wrong water quality
management in water distribution networks in many parts of the world, many problems such as bacterial
growth or formation of by-products occur in these systems. In this paper with integrating two models,
hydraulic model of EPANET2 with ability of quality simulation and optimization model of Genetic Algorithm
(GA), the best locations for chlorine injection and its optimum dosage in the water networks are obtained. To
evaluate the presented method, two test examples are studied. The results of this study show the reduction in
total consumed chlorine in the system obtained by chlorine injection in optimal locations with optimum
dosage, in comparison with other researches.

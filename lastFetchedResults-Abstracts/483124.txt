Resource Leveling and Allocation are two basic categories for project management. The objective of resource allocation is to schedule activities so that a particular resource does not exceed a specific limit in any given project time period, while holding the project duration to a minimum. The Resource leveling problem arises when there are sufficient resources available and it is necessary to reduce the fluctuations in the pattern of resource usage. In this paper GA algorithm was used to solve the resource leveling problem which, in turn, is a multi objective and NP- hard problem. The solution was applied in coating section of Iranian Offshore Engineering Construction Company and the results were desirable. The results of research, which were obtained from the field survey, show genetic algorithm will solve this problem well and generate optimum or sufficiently enough solution.

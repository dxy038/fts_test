Presents a general solution to the contouring problem of industrial robot arms, under the constraints of assigned Cartesian velocity and joint torque/acceleration. The proposed solution is an off-line trajectory generation algorithm and, therefore, it possesses significant industrial implications, as no hardware changes are needed for its implementation. According to the proposed method, the maximum utility of joint torque/acceleration is guaranteed to be bound to the assigned velocity constraint. In the proposed method, a realizable trajectory is generated from the objective trajectory and its delay dynamics are compensated for by using a forward compensator. The proposed method has been experimented with using a Performer MK-3s (PMK-3s) industrial robot arm, and optimum contouring has been realized

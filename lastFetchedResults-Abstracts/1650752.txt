Nowadays, the performance of critical assets in the industrial and urban sites depends on network-based systems. With respect to this fact that an infrastructure (as a complex system) consists of several assets, it is clear that assets play a vital role in daily performance of the urban systems. This study developed a novel model to analyze the interdependency of critical assets in an industrial system. The most famous conventional method regarding the interdependency of the assets (Leontief) were considered, which suffer from some weaknesses. However, the new model was extended with new abilities. In the proposed model, the assets were classified into two states: resource and demander. The objective of this model is to estimate the interaction of assets using an innovative Operation Research (OR) framework in order to simulate the mechanism of dependency of assets. To obtain the criticality of assets, a new term entitled by “centrality” was introduced to select and to rank the assets. A notional example was provided to illustrate the application of the proposed model.

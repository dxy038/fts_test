The objective of this work is to develop an accurate Battery Model (BM) and Capacity Model (CM) to study the performance of vehicle-to-grid interaction. Using BM and CM, the amount of capacity fading is analyzed while the power is stored in the battery or transferred to the grid. The BM is developed for Li-ion battery based on the Electrical Equivalent Circuit (EEC) and the CM is proposed based on processed energy for different charging/discharging rate. The proposed model is simulated using MATLAB Simulink environment and the parameters are optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach to compare the results with manufacturerÂ´s catalogue data. The obtained battery characteristics are in close agreement with the measured (manufacturer catalogue) characteristics.

Environmental considerations are receiving an increased amount of attention in both the residential and industrial sectors. In order to achieve a reduction in emissions of harmful substances to the air, water and land to meet national targets, industrial chemical producers must explore new avenues to reduce the impact that they have on the environment.

ing an optimization approach applied to an eco-park network allows for energy and materials to be conducted between network nodes in a manner that reduces emissions by utilizing process co-products and reduces the environmental and economic costs associated with transportation of feedstock and products.

l case eco-park is modelled in GAMS software to show the economic and environmental feasibility of this type of network and the approach to this type of problem. A dual-objective function is created in order to address the environmental concerns of the government and public while continuing to address economic factors presented by processing facilities. Exchanging materials and energy to reduce the life-cycle impact of the products allows for cost savings for the processor as well as reducing the emissions associated with the product; therefore, this type of arrangement is beneficial for producers as well as for society as a whole.

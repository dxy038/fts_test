In this paper we address an inverse scattering problem whose aim is to discuss the CPU time for recovering a perfectly conducting cylindrical object buried in a slab medium. First, we use Fourier-series or cubic- spline methods to describe the shape and reformulate the inverse problem into an optimization one. Then we solved it by the improved steady state genetic algorithm (SSGA) with different crossover rate and simple genetic algorithm (SGA) respectively and compare the cost time in finding out the global extreme solution of the objective function. It is found the searching ability of SSGA is much powerful than that of the SGA. Numerical results are given to show that the imaging problem by using SSGA is much better than SGA in time costing.

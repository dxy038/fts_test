The objective of this work is to supervise the states evolution of patients affected by facial paralysis leading to recovery. Modeling facial nerve stream trajectory data seems to be an essential step leading to perform our purpose. In fact, it permits representation unification and facilitates data querying in order to ensure recovery surveillance and the disease understanding. Moreover a visualization algorithm is proposed to track facial nerve stream in order to observe recovery progress and to identify the occurrence of conduction problem preventing it.

This paper argues that objective and subjective evaluation should be applied simultaneously to evaluate scientific journal. Moreover, the evaluation is often made by groups and inevitably contains evaluatorsÂ´ subjective judgments. Accordingly, this paper develops a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria group evaluation and statistics method which considers objective and subjective evaluations, i.e., bibliometric measures and peer review opinions simultaneously. A model is established to achieve maximum group consensus. To determine the criteria weights, this paper applies an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator and to obtain the evaluator weights, a fuzzy distance-based method is used. Thereafter, this paper uses TOPSIS method to aggregate the objective and subjective ratings. Finally, a practical case study is presented.

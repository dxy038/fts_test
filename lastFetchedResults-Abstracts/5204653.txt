In this paper a new hybrid multiresolution human visual system and statistically based image coding scheme is presented. It decorrelates the input image into a number of subbands using a lifting based wavelet transform and employs a novel statistically based coding algorithm to code the coefficients in the detail subbands. Perceptual weights are applied to regulate the threshold value of each detail subband that is required in the coding process. The baseband coefficients are losslessly coded. To evaluate the performance of the coding scheme, it was applied to a number of test images with and without perceptual weights. The results indicate significant improvement in both subjective and objective quality of the reconstructed images when the perceptual weights are employed. The performance of the proposed technique was also compared to JPEG and JPEG2000. The results show that the proposed computationally efficient coding scheme outperforms both coding standards at low compression ratios, while offering satisfactory performance at higher compression ratios

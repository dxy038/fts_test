The current objective of this robotics research study is mainly to develop a cheap and not cumbersome systems for special applications. A PROMIS (Pprime RObot for Minimally Invasive Surgery) system is designed with this philosophy. The developed system is composed of master, slave and control system for collaborative operation between the surgeon and the robot. A parallel robot haptic device is used as master to teleoperate a serial robot with three degrees of freedom (dof). The advantage of this method is the possibility of coupling master and slave with non-matching kinematics through a kinematic transformation. The developed control system architecture is presented in this paper. The control architecture was designed to control the teleoperation system where the master and slave robots do not have homothetic kinematics. Finally, the viability of the developed control is demonstrated by the experimental results.

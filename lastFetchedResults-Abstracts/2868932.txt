Given a short query audio clip, the goal of audio retrieval is to automatically fetch all similar clips from a given audio database. Different from traditional audio similarity which is mainly based on priori knowledge of objective reality, this paper proposes to use a more subjective method to measure the perceptual similarity between audio clips. These perceptual features focus on usersÂ´ personal experience, which can be very helpful for audio retrieval across different databases. In addition, indexing and audio matching methods are introduced to speed up the retrieval process. Experimental results on four different datasets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches..

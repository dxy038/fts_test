A fixed-beam frequency-tunable coplanar stripline (CPS) antenna array using the phase reversal technique and varactor diodes tuning is presented. The antenna array is composed of plurality of half-wavelength CPS sections interconnected by phase reversing crossovers. These crossovers have two functions: they serve as the radiators (small dipoles) of the array and also provide their own required in-phase excitations for broadside radiation. Two microstrip-to-CPS transitions for excitation of the balanced input/output antenna array are implemented and compared. A six-element array is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, with 9.3 dBi of gain for bidirectional radiation and 12.5 dBi of gain for unidirectional radiation using a back reflector. Moreover, shunt varactor diodes are incorporated along the CPS structure to achieve frequency tuning through a bias voltage control while broadside radiation patterns remain fixed. The return loss and the radiation patterns at several frequencies are presented, and up to 50% tuning range is obtained. The proposed antenna array is simple and uniplanar with small lateral size, high radiation efficiency and high directivity. In addition, it uses a very simple biasing circuit with high DC-RF isolation. Its balanced input/output makes it suitable for RF system integration and active integrated antenna design.

Cyclical texture profile analysis (TPA) parameters measured using a star-shaped probe with two cycles of 80% penetration and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) were compared as predictors of objective tenderness and subjective sensory characteristics of rib steaks from 52 beef loins. The TPA parameters of hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness were negatively correlated (P&lt;0.05) with trained panel sensory characteristics of initial tenderness (r=−0.64, −0.41, −0.62, respectively), amount of connective tissue (r=−0.57, −0.27, −0.55, respectively), overall tenderness (r=−0.68, −0.39, −0.64, respectively) and overall palatability (r=−0.56, −0.37, −0.53, respectively). These sensory characteristics were also negatively correlated (P&lt;0.05) with WBS (r=−0.61, −0.49, −0.60, −0.56, respectively). Stepwise regression analysis generated prediction equations that included the TPA parameters of hardness and adhesiveness, which accounted for 47, 36, 51 and 38% of the variation in initial tenderness, amount of connective tissue, overall tenderness and overall palatability, respectively. Prediction equations using WBS accounted for 37, 24, 36 and 31% of the variation in initial tenderness, amount of connective tissue, overall tenderness and overall palatability, respectively. Hence, TPA explained more of the variation in subjective sensory tenderness of the rib steaks than WBS.

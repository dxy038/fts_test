Wireless mesh networks (WMN) enables the expansion of communication networks and broadband services. This expansion allows the use of applications like streaming multimedia in P2P (Peer-to-Peer). P2P-TV and WMNs share similar features like self-organization and decentralization in dynamic network environments and multi-hop transmission. In this context quality measurement has become essential due to actual QoS (Quality of Service) parameters lack of user experience metrics. In order to evaluate QoE in P2P streaming over WMN, we use a Pseudo Subjective Quality Assessment (PSQA) taking the advantages of both subjective an objective approaches. The experimental testbed is implemented using PeerStreamer (P2P video streaming application) running over virtual machines, and the IEEE 802.11s NS-3 model as network layer connected through the NS-3 emulation mode.

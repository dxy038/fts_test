Studies were conducted for 8 years to determine the effect of fire on solute losses from abandoned fields found on the slopes of the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain. Solute release played a key role in loss of materials from eroding slopes and may account for up to 60% of these losses. The objective of the research was to examine long-term solute losses caused by fire that occurred during the first month following burning. After this initial surge caused by the increase in surface runoff, the loss of solutes was very low during the 8-year study period. Calcium was the major element lost. The measured effect of fire on solute release was negligible in comparison to other semiarid and humid environments.

From its humble beginnings in 1996 to address an industry need for closer cooperation among Test Houses worldwide, to overcome wasteful duplication of testing and assessment in the Ex Field at that time, IECEx has emerged to become an essential compliance assessment tool for all industries worldwide where flammable or combustible materials are used, stored or transported that present a risk of fire or explosion. Situations where flammable substances in the form of gas, vapour, dust, fibres, or flyings are used, processed, stored or transported in quantities considered to present an explosion hazard have been labeled as &#8220;Hazardous Locations&#8221;, &#8220;Hazardous Areas&#8221;, &#8220;Explosive Atmospheres&#8221; and so on but one common symbol for such is &#8220;Ex&#8221; Ex is not an industry of its own but rather a facet of just about every industry known to mankind. Whether it be Transportation including aerospace, Furniture manufacture, Automotive Manufacture + Repair, Production of Pharmaceuticals, Food processing, the Grain industry, the Coal Mining industry and of course Oil and Gas, Petrochemical and Chemical, all of these utilize flammable substances in quantities that may give rise to an explosive concentration being present, either continuously, during normal operation or due to abnormal situations. IECEx is the International System solely dedicated to providing Internationally recognized Certification Schemes as verification of compliance with International Standards. IECEx now operates three Separate International Certification Schemes covering a large number of industrial sectors addressing Equipment, Service Providers and Competent Persons. The United Nations via its UNECE concluded its project, to consider a Common Regulatory Objective covering Ex Equipment, Services and Persons, of the past few years, to determine that use of International Standards such as those produced by IEC TC 31 and supported by Certification under the - ECEx system demonstrates worldÂ´s best practice for ensuring safety in the Ex related fields.

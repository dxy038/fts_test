The objective of this work is to apply a new microphysical parameterization for fog
visibility for potential use in numerical weather forecast simulations, and to compare the results with
ground-based observations. The observations from the Fog Remote Sensing And Modeling (FRAM) field
which took place during the winter of 2005 – 2006 over southern Ontario, Canada (Phase I) were used in
the analysis. The liquid water content (LWC), droplet number concentration (Nd), and temperature (T)
were obtained from the fog measuring device (FMD) spectra and Rosemount probe, correspondingly. The
visibility (Vis) from a visibility meter, liquid water path from microwave radiometers (MWR), and inferred
fog properties such as mean volume diameter, LWC, and Nd were also used in the analysis. The results
showed that Vis is nonlinearly related to both LWC and Nd. Comparisons between newly derived
parameterizations and the ones already in use as a function of LWC suggested that if models can predict
the total Nd and LWC at each time step using a detailed microphysics parameterization, Vis can then be
calculated for warm fog conditions. Using outputs from the Canadian Mesoscale Compressible
Community (MC2) model, being tested with a new multi-moment bulk microphysical scheme, the new
Vis parameterization resulted in more accurate Vis values where the correction reached up to 20 –50%.

In this paper, we propose a distributed call admission control scheme for multiservice OFDMA system. In our proposed call admission control (CAC) scheme, a cell dynamically adjusts optimal new call and handoff acceptance ratios by three steps. First, exchange numbers of calls in handoff area with its adjacent cells. Then, dynamically allocate resource for different types of traffic. Finally, use a Markov queue model and a bidirectional iterative search method (BIS) to calculate the new call and handoff acceptance ratios to obtain a near-maximal network utility which depends on both packets delay and the number of ongoing calls. Simulation results show the performance gain of the proposed scheme.

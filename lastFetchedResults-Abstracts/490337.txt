The question of the influence of Ibn al-'Arabl on Mowlavi has, even though it has occasioned an immense debate, not been properly addressed. The scholars entering the debate are divided into two groups: those who agree and those who disagree that Mowlavi was influenced by Ibn al-'Arabl. Expressing a moderate view, William C. Chiuick, in his groundbreaking work on Rumi and Ibn al-'Arabl, takes a fresh historic and objective look at the debate, showing the type and extent of these influences. This paper is an attempt to explain and expand on Chinick's views and his methodological analysis of the question.

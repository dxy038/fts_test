This paper discusses the impact of coordinated charging of electric vehicles for a peak shaving objective, through an online coordination algorithm, on low voltage grid constraints. The results for uncoordinated and coordinated charging are compared to assess the effect on the peak power demand. Furthermore, an unbalanced load flow analysis is performed on a real low voltage grid to assess the impact on the nodal voltages. The simulation results show a positive impact of coordinated charging for both the peak shaving objective and for voltage deviations. The results show that the coordination algorithm obtains effective results, while only needing a limited amount of communication, measurements and predictive knowledge.

<p><strong>Background: </strong> The  Mississippi  Aphasia  Screening Test (MAST) is a brief screening test for assessing the expressive and receptive language abilities in patients with  aphasia.  The  objective  of  the  study  was  to develop and validate the Persian version of the MAST (MASTp) as a screening test for language disorders in patients with post-stroke aphasia.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> This study used a cross-sectional design to cross- culturally   adapt   the   MASTp   following   the guidelines for the process of cross-cultural adaptation of measures. A total of 40 subjects (20 patients with post-stroke aphasia  and  20  healthy subjects)  were included. The MASTp was tested for floor or ceiling effects,   internal   consistency   reliability,   intra-rater reliability, discriminative validity, and factor structure.<br /><strong>Results: </strong> There  were  no  floor  or  ceiling  effects  for MASTp  total  score.  The  MASTp  yielded  values  for internal consistency reliability that were not adequate (Cronbach’s alpha 0.64 and 0.66 for test and retest, respectively. The  intra-rater reliability of  the  MASTp within a 7 day-interval was excellent for total score (ICC agreement =  0.96) and  both  expressive  index (ICC = 0.95) and receptive index (ICC agreement = 0.98). here were statistically  ignificant differences in MASTp total scores and both indexes between patients and healthy subjects suggesting the discriminative validity of the MASTp (P &lt; 0.001). Factor analysis revealed a 3- factor solution, which jointly accounted for 72.06% of the total variance. Additional factor analysis suggested 6-item MASTp as a unidimensional measure.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  The  MASTp  is  useful  as  a  valid  and reliable screening tool for evaluation of language abilities in Persian speaking patients with aphasia after stroke.</p>

The objective of this paper is to make a review of the current status of the PolSARpro v4.0 Software (Polarimetric SAR Data Processing and Educational Toolbox), developed under contract to ESA. The objective of this current project is to provide Educational Software that offers a tool for self-education in the field of Polarimetric SAR data analysis at University level and a comprehensive suite of functions for the scientific exploitation of fully and partially polarimetric multi-data sets and the development of applications for such data. The PolSARpro v4.0 Software establishes a foundation for the exploitation of Polarimetric techniques for scientific developments and stimulates research and applications developments using PolSAR and PolInSAR data.

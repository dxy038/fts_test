This paper describes the Orthogonal Muxing Frame Compatible Full Resolution (OM-FCFR) technology that provides efficient compression and reconstruction of full resolution stereoscopic video while maintaining compatibility with stereoscopic AVC Frame Compatible (FC) bitstreams. The OM-FCFR is a dual-layer coding system and is built upon the MVC Stereo High Profile of the AVC. Orthogonal muxing is used to design the enhancement layer video signal. A &#8220;Reference Process Unit (RPU)&#8221; is employed for creating the inter-layer reference picture that can serve as a good prediction for an enhancement layer picture. Simulation results show that significant improvement over the frame compatible solution is achieved in both subjective and objective evaluations. This technology was submitted as a proposal in response to the call for proposals (CfP) on MPEG Frame- Compatible (MFC) enhancement technology issued by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 (MPEG) and the specification was adopted as the working draft for the MFC standard and AVC Amendment 5.

This paper proposes an effective sizing strategy for distributed battery energy storage system (BESS) in the distribution networks under high photovoltaic (PV) penetration level. The main objective of the proposed method is to optimize the size of the distributed BESS and derive the cost-benefit analysis when the distributed BESS is applied for voltage regulation and peak load shaving. In particular, a system model that includes a physical battery model and a voltage regulation and peak load shaving oriented energy management system (EMS) is developed to apply the proposed strategy. The cost-benefit analysis presented in this paper considers factors of BESS influence on the work stress of voltage regulation devices, load shifting and peaking power generation, as well as individual BESS cost with its lifetime estimation. Based on the cost-benefit analysis, the cost-benefit size can be determined for the distributed BESS.

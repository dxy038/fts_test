A strategy for fully utilizing switch resources, namely the buffers and links in a banyan network is proposed. A new switch model called the fat-banyan switch is introduced with the objective of achieving high performance at minimal cost. The fat-banyan switch model is a unifying model for the design and analysis of dilated banyan switches. The dilated banyan network forms a special case of the fat-banyan model. By keeping the number of input and output links of a switching element to be variable, the fat-banyan switch achieves a lower order of complexity than the dilated banyan. Further the fat-banyan switch is superior to the buffered-banyan switch in terms of reduced delay and higher throughput. The performance of the fat-banyan under independent uniform traffic pattern is analyzed

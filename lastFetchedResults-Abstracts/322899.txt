Clustering is regarded as a consortium of concepts and algorithms that are aimed at revealing a structure in highly dimensional data and arriving at a collection of meaningful relationships in data and information granules. The objective of this paper is to propose a DNA computing to support the development of clustering techniques. This approach is of particular interest when dealing with huge data sets, unknown number of clusters and encountering a heterogeneous character of available data. We present a detailed algorithm and show how the essential components of the clustering technique are realized through the corresponding mechanisms of DNA computing. Numerical examples offer a detailed insight into the performance of the DNA-based clustering.

Objective: The aim of this study was to reduce ocular artefacts in single trial event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded in normal and in dyslexic children.
Methods: ERPs were recorded during passive and active reading of centrally presented alphabetic letters and non alphabetic symbols. EEG was recorded from 10 EEG locations using the 10â€“20 system. Diagonal EOG from the right eye was also recorded. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied in order to reduce ocular artefacts: the first or the second principal component (PC) was subtracted when the correlation coefficient between the component and EOG was greater or equal to 0.9 or 0.95, respectively. Performance of the method was tested on simulated and real data, on both single and averaged trials, varying EOG amplitude and artefact transmission characteristics.
Results: Applying the method to real recordings from normal and dyslexic children, we obtained a significant increase in the number of useful trials. In normal children we retrieved 41.0% of the rejected trials in passive and 39.1% in active reading. In dyslexic children 36.7 and 32.2% of the rejected trials in passive and active reading could be included in the respective averages.
Conclusions: The method allows an increase in the number of trials suitable for averaging, a great improvement in ERP quality and a reduction in the recording time.

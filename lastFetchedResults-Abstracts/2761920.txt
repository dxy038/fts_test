In this paper, a novel spatial error concealment (EC) algorithm is proposed. Under the sequential recovery framework, pixels in missing blocks are successively reconstructed based on adaptive linear predictor. The predictor automatically tunes its order and support shape according to local contexts. The predictor order and support shape are determined using Bayesian information criterion, which is able to strike a balance between the bias and variance of the prediction errors. The flexibility of the order-adaptive predictor is able to recover more important features or structures. A novel scan order based on the uncertainty of each pixel is also proposed to alleviate error propagation problem. Compared with the state-of-the-art EC algorithms, experimental results show that the proposed method gives better reconstruction performance in terms of objective and subjective evaluations.

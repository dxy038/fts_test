Spatial and temporal parameters of gait have clinical relevance in the assessment of motor pathologies, particularly in orthopaedics. A new gait analysis system is proposed which consists of (a) an ambulatory device (Physilog®) including a set of miniature gyroscopes and a portable datalogger, and (b) an algorithm for gait analysis. The aim of this study was the validation of this system, for accuracy and clinical applicability. Eleven patients with coxarthrosis, eight patients with total hip arthroplasty and nine control subjects were studied using this portable system and also a reference motion analyzer and force plate. The small differences in the stance period (19±31 ms), stride length and velocity (0.4±9.6 cm and 2.5±8.3 cm/s, respectively), as well as thigh and shank rotations (2.4±4.3° and 0.3±3.3°, respectively), confirmed good agreement of the proposed system with the reference system. In addition, nearly the same accuracy was obtained for all three groups. Gait analysis based on Physilog® was also in agreement with their Harris Hip Scores (HHS): the subjects with lower scores had a greater limp, a slower walking speed and a shorter stride. This ambulatory gait analysis system provides an easy, reproducible and objective method of quantifying changes in gait after joint replacement surgery for coxarthrosis.

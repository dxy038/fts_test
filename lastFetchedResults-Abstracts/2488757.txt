Objective: Worldwide, diabetes mellitus (DM) is an ever-increasing metabolic disorder.
A promising approach to the treatment of DM is the implantation of insulin
producing cells (IPC) that have been derived from various stem cells. Culture conditions
play a pivotal role in the quality and quantity of the differentiated cells. In this
experimental study, we have applied various culture conditions to differentiate human
umbilical cord matrix-derived mesenchymal cells (hUCMs) into IPCs and measured
insulin production.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we exposed hUCMs cells to pancreatic
medium and differentiated them into IPCs in monolayer and suspension cultures.
Pancreatic medium consisted of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium Nutrient
mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) medium with 17.5 mM glucose supplemented by 10 mM
nicotinamide, 10 nM exendin-4, 10 nM pentagastrin, 100 pM hepatocyte growth factor,
and B-27 serum-free supplement. After differentiation, insulin content was analyzed by
gene expression, immunocytochemistry (IHC) and the chemiluminesence immunoassay
(CLIA).
Results: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed efficient expressions
of NKX2.2, PDX1 and INSULIN genes in both groups. IHC analysis showed
higher expression of insulin protein in the hanging drop group, and CLIA revealed a
signi?cant higher insulin production in hanging drops compared with the monolayer group
following the glucose challenge test.
Conclusion: We showed by this novel, simple technique that the suspension culture
played an important role in differentiation of hUCMs into IPC. This culture was more efficient
than the conventional culture method commonly used in IPC differentiation and
cultivation.

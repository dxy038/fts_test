A bidirectional wavelength reconfigurable optical network is proposed. A remote pumped Erbium doped fiber amplifier and high-reflectivity tunable fiber Bragg gratings (TFBGs) are used in this wavelength reconfigurable fiber module. 10 Gb/s per channel over 20 km fiber span is used to verify the metro-network-range system performance. The power penalty is less than 1 dB when compares to the back to back transmission, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and interband crosstalk are larger than 30 dB.

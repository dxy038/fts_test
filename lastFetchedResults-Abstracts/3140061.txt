In this paper, we consider a transportation network with emission charge and congestion toll on each link. All users in this network are classified by value of time and value of emission. They choose travel route in the logit-based stochastic manner. In order to illustrate that link tolls are economic, efficient, and theoretically feasible, we present a multi-modal multi-objective traffic network equilibrium model. By using the theory of variational inequalities, an analytic expression of composite toll based on type of vehicles is derived, which supports the user equilibrium in line with the system optimum. In the end, an example is given, furthermore, its numerical results show that there is a valid toll pattern which can reduce the total pollution and improve the total social welfare.

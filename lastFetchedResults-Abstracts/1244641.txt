In the present study, electrospraying was used in drug particle-production. The objective of the research was to establish whether electrospraying can be carried out in reduced pressure in order to improve the drying process of the droplets. By this method, it is possible to produce drug particles relatively uniform in size, crystallinity and porosity. Drying the droplets in a reduced pressure is a more sensitive way to remove the solvent from the particles than, for example, the addition of heat. The efficiency of this drying method and particle morphology were studied using SEM, DSC, and XRD. Another objective was to workout whether the size of the produced particles can be estimated by a simple method. The maximum particle size was defined theoretically and compared to experimental results with good agreement.

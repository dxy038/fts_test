Different modeling approaches for an isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter are investigated to be used in analysis and simulation of a hybrid electric ship. The models are verified by comparison with simulation results of detailed switching model in PLECS software. The advantages and disadvantages of different modeling methods are discussed. A unified model for both buck and boost modes is proposed for current control applications, using the preferable method. Finally, the simulation results of an energy storage system are presented, employing the proposed unified model in a hybrid electric ship simulation.

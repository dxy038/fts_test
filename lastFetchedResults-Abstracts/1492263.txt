The paper presents an analysis of the optimal design of cold-formed beams with generalized open shapes under pure bending, uniformly distributed loads, concentrated loads and axial loads with constant bending moment. The optimization problem includes the cross section area as the first objective function and the deflection of a beam as the second one. The geometric parameters of cross sections are selected as design variables. The set of constraints includes global stability condition, selected forms of local stability conditions, strength condition and technological and constructional requirements in a form of geometric relations. The strength and stability conditions are formulated and analytically solved using mathematical equations. The optimization problem is formulated and solved with help of the Pareto concept of optimality. The numerical procedure, based on the Messac normalized constraint method, include discrete, continuous and discrete-continuous sets of design variables. Results of the numerical analysis for different loads of beams with monosymmetrical cross section shapes are presented in tables.

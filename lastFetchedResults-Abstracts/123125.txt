Job security is considered from two points of view: subjective and objective. In an organization, objective view is considered with threatening factors; as thought subjective view regards senses and feelings (for the lack of any obstacle in employment - at present and future).
Individual organizational, and environmental factors play a vital role in job security. Job security in extremes, too high or too low, results in low performance and dysfunctional.
Different strategies, approaches and procedures are provided by which one can impose a better control on factors, weaken the threatening factors and improve the attitudes, as a result, employees might be enabled to challenge the threatening factors.

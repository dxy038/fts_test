The main purpose of the Tribunal for Administrative justice is to control the magisterial deeds as well as power for the protection of Human Rights.One of the main approaches to help to reach this pivotal objective is the execution of the rule of law and officials` accountability to people. Complete achievement of the above-mentioned points is possible only through formation of a Legal Government.  The establishment of such legal government would be impossible unless people have access to fair courts to voice their objections against all executive and ministrative organization of the State for their behavior any action and multi-lateral supply of judicial security. Based on what has been surveyed discussed up to now, in this article, by studying books, articles, investigation of the public judicature, the Tribunal, and interview with some judges, and officials in charge and the amount  executive accountability of the government to the execution of rule of law, the officials` cooperation, answer this question: Does the procedure of tribunal, by consideration of peoples` objections, lead to some references such as governmental council and legislative assembly the development of Human Rights? this article tries to compare the reflection of the decisions and votes of the Tribunal of Justice. The result of such comparison shows that despite the Legislative Assembly`s incomplete definition of government and legitimate restrictions which have been gradually put out by the enactment of laws in the Assembly for the Tribunal of Administrative Justice, and also, the court's disregard for the International Humans Rights Charter to which Iran has joined and has to follow according of article No.9 of Iranian civil law, still we see that the verdicts of the public judicature and the tribunal for the protection and support of the peoples` rights have been increasing, and it has been able to help the development of human rights. Meanwhile, the election of other mentioned authorities shows opposite results.

This paper develops necessary and sufficient conditions for analyzing the schedulability of fixed priority algorithms on resources with limited priority levels. We introduce the degree of schedulable saturation (S<sub>max</sub>) as an objective function. A multimedia task set is used to demonstrate how S<sub>max</sub> can be used to optimize the grouping of tasks to priority levels

By coming up with his own philosophical hermeneutics, Gadamer seeks to show that for human being, understanding is always rooted in tradition and prejudice. Enjoying a solid bond with the historicity of mankind, tradition makes understanding and knowledge conditional. Therfore, the authority of tradition prevents understanding from being realized in an absolute,objective way free of subjectivities and prejudices of the understanding subject. However, the question is if Gadamer devotes and room to freedom in the process of understanding as he accepts tradition. Does freedom provides us with an opportunity to free ourselves from the authority of tradition and our prejudices in  understanding? Or the understanding an imposing process which always keeps us within the limits of tradition? This paper represents an effort to answer this question from Gadamerâ€™s viewpiont.

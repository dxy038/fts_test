     The objective of this paper is to evaluate Leaf Area Index at Robinia Pseudoacacia. in affrostration area of about 89 hectares located in the northern part of Malayer was selected as the study region. The leaf area index was determined by direct method and by collecting all the leaves from the 20 samples (from medium diameter of each diameter class) and measuring the mean leaf area, the crown cover area of each sample was calculated. To determine the soil properties and its relation with the leaf area index, samples from the depth of 0 - 10 and 10 - 30 cm were selected. Physical and chemical properties of soil samples were determined in the laboratory. As a result, the leaf area index of Robinia Pseudoacacia species was 3.78. which the diameter class increased, the Leaf Area Index increased too. The significant relations were statistically observed between the slope and Leaf Area Index. Considering the stand and soil characteristics, the aboveground biomass, diameter at breast height, height, percentage of nitrogen, organic carbon and silt showed the maximal correlation with the leaf area index.

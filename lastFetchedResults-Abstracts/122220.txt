Background : Diastolic dysfunction is considered as an etiologic factor in congestive heart failure (CHF) and must be diagnosed from systolic dysfunction.
Objective : To determine the incidence of diastolic dysfunction in CHF and to study variable factors such as age , sex , and heart rate on doppler echo parameters. Methods : Through a descriptive and random sampling study, 105 patients including 55 females and 50 males with HF were studied by two dimensional , Mmode and pulse doppler echo. Ejection fraction (EF) and diastolic parameters including E and A waves , E/A ratio , DT and IVRT were measured and recorded.
Findings : The prevalence of diastolic dysfunction was 52% and systolic dysfunction (EF< 40%) was 48%. Age increase had a negative effect on diastolic function and caused decrease of E/A ratio. Increased HR caused decrease of E wave , increased of A wave and E/A ratio was inversely related to heart rate. Sex had no significant effect on diastolic function .
Conclusions : Pulse doppler echo is a very useful method for accurate and early diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction which enables early treatment and follow up.

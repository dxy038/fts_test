This paper is intended to provide insights into the application of the GRP model. A repairable system model for the case of realistic maintenance, the so-called general renewal process (GRP), was introduced by allowing the goodness of repairs to be modelled from as-good-as-new (i.e. ORP) to same-as-old (i.e. NHPP). This is sometimes referred to as better-than-old-but-worse-than-new repair assumption. The modelling of a realistic repair activity depends on a number of factors including overall age of the component, number of repairs, effectiveness of the repair, skill of the technicians, etc. The objective of this paper is to provide general insights into the behaviour of the GRP model and application. Observations concluded that at a low number of renewals there is little difference between the two models. However, as the number of renewals increases the difference between the two models becomes significant due to the variation in the underlying virtual age equations of the two models.

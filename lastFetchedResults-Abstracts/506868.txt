Background and Objective: In recent years, most developed countries have aimed at reducing the cesarean rate through education and other interventions. In our country, however, despite all efforts, the cesarean rate remains very high. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of educational intervention based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on choosing delivery mode in pregnant women, who were referred to the Rasht Health Centers.
Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study included 72 pregnant women referred to various Health Centers in Rasht in the spring and summer of 2010. After a pre-test by using a valid and reliable questionnaire for both groups, specific training was provided for the intervention group based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. At the end of the pregnancies, post-test were performed in both groups and the results were analyzed by SPSS-13 software.
Results: The results indicate that there were significant differences in the mean knowledge, evaluations of behavioral outcome, attitude (P =0.000), perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and behavioral intention (P  <  0.05) among pregnant women in the test group compared with the control. There was a significant difference in behavior between the two groups (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: The results show that maternal educations in the field for persuasion of normal delivery had been effective. Therefore, we recommend implementing training programs based on Theory of Planned Behavior, in order to persuade pregnant women for normal delivery and decreasing the rate of the cesarean section.

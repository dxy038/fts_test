A novel harmonic-balance (HB) optimization technique for single-frequency oscillators and broadband voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) is introduced. The objective function is evaluated by a Newton-iteration-based HB analysis, and an exact algorithm for the computation of the gradient is implemented. The optimizable performance in the VCO case includes the linearity of the tuning characteristic. An example of application of the proposed method is presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Recently, building robot has become the current trend for the teaching and learning the subject of science in elementary and secondary education. The objective of this paper is to propose a teaching approach for programming language by the application of weblog on robot building. It is hoped that such an approach may make learning more enjoyable as well as effective and may further motivate students in future experiments. A study of teaching computer program in high school with VPL-based tool to construct robots was presented. Students formed in team to build robots and write program to perform the specified task. The result shows that students have achieved good results in terms of learning motivation.

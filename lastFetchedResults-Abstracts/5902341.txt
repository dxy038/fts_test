In the collaborative learning environment, there are various kinds of information, such as faces of students and learning materials, and the interface which shows these information effectively is required. If the information is provided effectively, students would communicate with others smoothly and progress the learning efficiently. When we study in the group, we tend to focus on what we are interested in or what we thought to be important in order to get meaningful information efficiently. Therefore, our objective is to construct a user-oriented interface which reflects preferences or characteristics of individual students and only provides meaningful information for students. In this paper, the authors propose factors that are needed as the interface of collaborative learning in order to support effective and smooth learning. Then, they introduce the example of user-oriented interface in which students are able to focus on a particular student in the group during the discussion.

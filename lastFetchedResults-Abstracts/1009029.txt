A hyperelastic constitutive law is proposed to describe the mechanical behaviour of 3D layer to layer angle interlock composite reinforcements. The objective of this model is to simulate shaping of thick textile preforms for RTM processes. After the identification of the independent deformation modes of initially orthotropic reinforcements, a strain energy potential is built up based on strain invariants representative to those modes assuming an additive composition of them. The parameters of the proposed constitutive model are identified using standard and specific mechanical tests performed on a 3D interlock material. Then, the model is validated on forming simulations on a single curve and double curve shapes. Three point bending tests on thick interlock reinforcements have been analysed experimentally and numerically. The specific transformation of cross sections is depicted by the proposed hyperelastic model.

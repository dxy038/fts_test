In order to reduce the local environment impact, the improved methods of optimal scheduling small hydropower are discussed and the sustainability optimal scheduling models which composed of optimal objectives and constraints are presented. The controlled reservoir releases for hydropower generation which based on float coding is used as the decision variable of the model and the reserved minimum flow and reservoir water level as special constraints. The controlled reservoir water level compared with maximal energy output during the period of dispatching is considered as objective. An improved PSO, resilient particle swarm optimization (RPSO), is adopted to the optimization. In RPSO, the velocity of a particle is not dependent on the size of distance between the individual and the optimal particle but only dependent on its direction. An adaptive scheme is adopted to adjust the magnitude of the velocity resiliently. A simulation operation of RPSO Matlab program for a factual small hydropower plant show that the sustainability optimum scheduling models and the technology based RPSO is viable and efficient. RPSO performance was compared with PSO and APSO on the same case, the results show that RPSO performed better.

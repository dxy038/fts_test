TodayÂ´s life and industry are closely dependent to the electrical energy. This dependency in future will be more intensive, especially due to appearance of electric-dependent vehicles in the societies overriding conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles. Electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEVs) carry storage devices (usually electric batteries) to store their electrical energy demand. Their batteries have charging and discharging capabilities. Emergence of EV/HEVs in cities amounts to addition of considerable large electrical loads to the electrical grid. On the other hand, extra energy in these vehicles when not needed is considered as a promising source of energy that could be harvested and utilized to support the grid. Power electronic converters (PECs) as electric interfaces have the capability to manage the power flow between EV/HEVs and the grid. In this work, a novel multi input (MI) bidirectional DC/DC converter/capacitive storage hybrid system (MIBHS) including MI Buck-Boost PEC (MIBB-PEC) and capacitive storage system is proposed that is able to handle with several EV/HEVs in vehicle to grid (V2G) and Plug-In modes of operation. Switching strategies are proposed to operate the converter in Plug-In and V2G modes. Steady state practical model of the converter is derived, and two algorithms based on power management strategy in forms of flowchart diagrams are presented. Then, probabilistic situations in terms of Plug-In and V2G EV/HEVs are investigated. Finally simulations are run in PSCAD/EMTDC.

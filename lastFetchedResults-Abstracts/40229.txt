Suspended solids mean cells residence time (MCRT) and temperature are two key parameters for designing Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) wastewater treatment processes, as an alternative for achieving year-round nitrification. It has been demonstrated from both full-scale and bench-scale studies that IFAS can accomplish year-round nitrogen removal and denitrification in aerobic zones in winter when operated with suspended growth MCRTs less than the critical MCRT for nitrifiers, thus avoiding increasing reactor or clarifier volumes. The objective of this study was to investigate the performances of IFAS systems that were operated at relative high MCRT compared to nitrifier washout MCRT and low temperature for biological nutrient removal. The comparison between two IFAS systems with Accuweb media in both the anoxic and aerobic zones, and a conventional three zone biological nutrient nemoval (BNR) system was conducted at 10(degree)C with a 10 day MCRT using the UCT/VIP configuration for both systems and feeding with Blacksburg domestic wastewater. Influent flow was split 50% to the first anaerobic reactor and 50% to the first anoxic reactor to enhance denitrification in one of IFAS systems and the conventional BNR control system whereas 100% of the influent flow was fed to the first anaerobic reactor in the other IFAS system. The data from this investigation indicated that the performances of the control and IFAS systems were insignificantly different under the experimental operating conditions for both biological nitrogen and biological phosphorus removal except for IFAS with integrated fixed film media in the anoxic zone and when 50% of the influent was added directly to the first anoxic reactor.

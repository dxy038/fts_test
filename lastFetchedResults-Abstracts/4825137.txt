The objective of this study is to provide an innovation in pyrolysis technology to the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from biomass solid wastes. A fixed-bed fire-tube heating pyrolysis reactor system has been designed and fabricated considering all of the process parameters and present engineers challenge. The available agricultural waste-jute stick in Bangladesh has been pyrolyzed in the internally heated fire-tube heating reactor system under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The effects of operating temperature on the yields of product liquids were investigated. Characterization of the whole pyrolysis liquids obtained at optimum operating conditions has been carried out including physical properties, elemental analyses and GCV. The results show that fixed-bed fire-tube heating pyrolysis is a good option to obtain bio-oils from biomass solid wastes.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of raloxifene on leptin and insulin-like growth factor–I levels and their relation with the biochemical markers of bone metabolism in postmenopausal women.
Study design
Sixty-four women were given 60 mg/d raloxifene for 6 months. Serum leptin, insulin-like growth factor–I, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, osteocalcin, and collagen type I cross-link C-telopeptide levels were measured before and after the treatment. The patients were grouped as obese (body mass index, ≥25 kg/m2) or non-obese (body mass index, <25 kg/m2).
Results
The mean basal leptin level was significantly higher (P< .001), and the mean cross-link C-telopeptide level was significantly lower (P = .001) in obese patients. Raloxifene therapy increased leptin levels (P< .001) and decreased insulin-like growth factor–I, alkaline phosphatase, and cross-link C-telopeptide levels significantly (P< .001). There was a strong negative correlation between leptin and cross-link C-telopeptide (r = −0.703; P< .001). Insulin-like growth factor–I was not correlated with any parameter.
Conclusion
Raloxifene increases serum leptin levels while decreasing bone resorption in postmenopausal women.

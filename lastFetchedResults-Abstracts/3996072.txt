This paper presents an optimal dynamic code assignment (DCA) scheme using orthogonal variable-spreading-factor (OVSF) codes. The objective of dynamic code assignment is to enhance statistical multiplexing and spectral efficiency of W-CDMA systems supporting variable user data rates. Our scheme is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the number of OVSF codes that must be reassigned to support a new call. By admitting calls that would normally be blocked without code reassignments, the spectral efficiency of the system is also maximized. Simulation results are presented to show the performance gain of dynamic code assignment compared to a static assignment scheme in terms of call blocking rate and spectral efficiency. We also discuss various signaling techniques of implementing our proposed DCA scheme in third-generation wideband CDMA systems.

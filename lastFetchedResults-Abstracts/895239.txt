Objective (s): The Islamic Republic of Iran has experienced a dramatic decrease in fertility rates in the past three decades. Despite extensive research in the field of demography and fertility, many previous studies have been conducted based on quantitative methods and frequently criticized especially in the micro level. Since the qualitative research will provide a much deeper understanding of the decision-making processes, this study was conducted to understand and properly describe the decision-making process of childbearing in Kermanshah city.
Methods: Adopting the grounded theory approach, this study was started with a purposive sampling and continued with theoretical sampling with maximum variation in terms of age, gender and number of children. In-depth interviews were carried out with 20 married women and 14 married men. The constant comparative method was used to analyze the data.
Results: Individuals perceived certain needs in their lives. If a person believed that childbearing would reduce or fulfill these needs, then the childbearing demand will develop. Attitude to childbearing consequences and perceived norms were reasons for perceived childbearing needs. When the childbearing need was formed, a person plans to have or not have a child based on perception of capability in controlling current life conditions and in raising the child. If the person perceived that he/she could control the above conditions, “childbearing intention” was developed and if he/she considered the degree of control to be inappropriate, he/she would employ the strategy of childbearing avoidance and display the appropriate behavior according to this decision-making process. 
Conclusion: We found that child bearing is not an accidental phenomenon; rather, it is a rational choice. The childbearing decision-making is a process on the basis of satisfying some needs.

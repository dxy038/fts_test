The research carried out in this paper involve the development of a global strategy that should link nationals marine transport administration, owners, operators and ship managers, to an optimized marine trade network that ensures finance income balance and rationalizes marine transport to import-export realistic needs. Given a mathematical model for production costs and sales, it is proposed in principle to maximize the return on investment by establishing the trade-off between advertising expensive, production run length, and so on. The objective function is the exploitation cost versus efficiency and is to be optimised by the gradient method into a global outer loop. The described strategy schedule some optimisation methods in an inner loop, which are being applied in accordance to the needs defined by means of the performance criteria so as to get competitive results in a real case study

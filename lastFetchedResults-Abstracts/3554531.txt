The paper presents a new method for load-flow analysis which is particularly appropriate for very large power systems. The objective has been to reduce the computation time for the analysis of a given system by tearing the network into a number of independent subsystems. The subsystem programs may be executed in parallel, resulting in a considerable time saving for on-line system control. The main advantage of the new algorithm is that the computation efficiency of the main or co-ordinating program is significantly improved. Results are presented which indicate that, for average to very large systems, the net solution time using the suggested technique is less than half of that required by a centralised decoupled method to achieve the same accuracy.

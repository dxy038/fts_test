Objective: Triage procedure is one of the most important aspects of emergency departments as it has an undeniable role on the management of patients. It includes 5 categories based on the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) according to the condition of severity. For better decision making and management, it is important to have skillful and experienced nursing staff. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a one-day workshop on participants in terms of their triage knowledge improvement.
Methods: This is a pre- and post-test trial study. In this study all the nursing staff of Sina hospital participated. The workshop was conducted in a single day for 6 hours. During the one-day workshop, topics such as emergency triage and hospital triage were covered according to START and ESI. In order to evaluate triage knowledge, each participant completed a pre-test before the workshop, and a post-test after the workshop (15 questions). Data were analyzed with SPSS 15.0. Paired t test was applied for data analysis.
Results: Fifty-five nurses with the mean age of 35.72 Â± 7.35 participated in the workshop. The analysis of the data, using paired t test based on the pre-test and post-test results, did not show any significant differences (P  >  0.05). 
Conclusion: This study suggests that a one-day workshop is not really effective and reliable for triage knowledge improvement. We propose longer planned workshops in order to train more skillful staff.

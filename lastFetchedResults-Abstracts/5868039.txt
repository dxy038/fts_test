Today, international mobile roaming (IMR) is experiencing changes both in terms of technology and business models. Traditionally, voice and SMS have been the only services offered to roaming users with no possibility of accessing destination content (content offered in the visited country). However, with recent advances in technology, new and advanced multimedia services are emerging in the mobile market, creating opportunities for new and existing players in the IMR market and thereby increasing the need for service roaming. Often, implementation of technology and availability of services are dependent upon the existence of sound business models which create value for all the players involved. The paper conducts a feasibility assessment of service roaming by identifying some of the main business issues and its current approach towards roaming users and services which can act as hindrance to the successful implementation of service roaming. Mobile TV is considered as an example service case to illustrate the challenges involved and possible solutions. All the discussions in this paper are based on the GSM family of mobile technologies. However, the same issues are relevant for any other mobile technologies. The overall objective of this paper is to provide a critical analysis of service roaming by taking into consideration the ground realities of the international mobile roaming industry and market.

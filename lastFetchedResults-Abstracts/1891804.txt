The objective of this study was to ascertain the changing educational needs of community nurses, midwives and health visitors in relation to the teaching, supervising and assessing of pre-and post-registration students. A questionnaire was sent to all education institutions providing community nursing experience in England (Whittaker et al. 1997), which allowed identification of three centres for in-depth study. Questionnaires were sent to practitioners (community nurses and midwives, health visitors and school nurses), their managers, and teachers of community courses in the three centres: 314 were returned. Eight semi-structured interviews were undertaken with volunteers in each of the study centres (n = 24). Extensive demands are being made on community staff to provide learning experiences for students on a wide range of courses. Practitioners reported that in order to fulfil their teaching and assessing functions they needed continuing education in matters which would assist them to provide research-based practice and education, teaching and assessing in the community and personal skills, for example assertiveness and counselling. Less than a quarter of practitioners were undertaking continuing education courses. However, opportunities for further academic study varied enormously and most practitioners had to study in their own time at their own expense.

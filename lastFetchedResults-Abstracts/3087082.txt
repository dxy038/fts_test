An inter-layer prediction scheme with two base layers and a new concept of auxiliary layer are introduced in this paper. The scheme achieves a good balance among all layers for the combined coarse granular scalability and spatial scalability. The objective is to improve the coding efficiency of layers with higher resolution. Meanwhile, a price based scheme is proposed to determine the auxiliary layer. With the proposed scheme, a new element of price can be integrated into scalable video coding which in turn justifies the necessity of scalable coding

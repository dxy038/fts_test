Our objective is the conception of an original wireless telemetry system to transmit high rate of EEG/SEEG signals in a hospital. At first, an experimental device is realized in order to characterize the indoor propagation at 2.45 GHz. We lay down the attenuation-distance law, quantify the fading and verify their statistics. In order to determine the impulse response, especially the delay spread, we simulate the correlation method. Then, we discuss the efficiency of space diversity, and the advantage of using directional antennas

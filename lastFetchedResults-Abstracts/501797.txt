Locating is one of the main important issues in the activities of Economic Institutes.

Location based science have been determined after presenting the relevant optimum methods and techniques. Locating has been one of the major activities of economic institutes .After implementing the scientific methods, banking as an economical activity, is used to maximize the services and efficiency as well as to minimize the costs.

Automatic teller machines (ATMs), as an electronic technology, have accomplished a part of this goal during the last years.

The current research as an applied research, through using multi criteria decision making analysis approach, analytic hierarchy process method and spatial analysis has produced a new frame work for locating ATM machines in Tehran Municipality, district No. 10. with respect to the great expenses of installing ATM machines, the objective of the current research would be presenting a method for selecting the most appropriate place in order to increase the efficiency and services of such machines.

The criteria for decision making were derived based on the similar studies performed in the other countries and also based on the opinions of experts and managers of Keshavarzi Bank and by implementing the spatial modeling and combination of information, the ideal installation places were identified. At the end, by employing the goal programming model, the cost and profit of each proposed place were calculated and the most appropriate installation points and also the number of machines were determined to cover the demands at the under studied area.

The objective of this study is to characterise K-band (20 GHz) space-Earth propagation conditions at Kjeller, Norway. A brief literature study of propagation impairments for communication via geostationary satellites in Norway has been carried out. An experiment designed for beacon measurements and a first year of measurements are described. The satellite Astra 4A was selected for the beacon studies. The receive functionality is implemented utilising a spectrum analyser, having the ability to track weak attenuated signals and to simultaneously provide relative noise floor estimates. A temperature stabilised low noise block converter was selected for the experiment. Software for logging signal strength was developed, including also logging of meteorological variables such as precipitation. The experimental set-up works well and produces estimates of meteorological variables, signal level and relative noise floor. As expected there are large variations in measured monthly rain intensity and attenuation statistics. The measured yearly averaged rain intensity and attenuation distributions are comparable to the predicted ones at time percentages of around 0.01.

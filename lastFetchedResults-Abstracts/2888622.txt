In this study, it is aimed to obtain Patella T-Reflex kinesiologic parameters on spasticity patients by using image processing methods and thereby extracting objective data for the evaluation of spasticity patients. For this reason, the movement of Patella T-reflex response to knee joint was recorded with the help of a camera after three LED markers placed on the knee joint. For the correctness of the pattern of the movements, data were compared with two-axis goniometer of Biometric Ltd company and thereby it was shown that the reflex patterns are identical. Thereon, using the software we have developed, the Patella T-reflex kinesiologic parameters were calculated and data were obtained for objective evaluation of the Spasticity patients.

The first objective of this paper is to present a new transmission line model which, not only realistically describes the interconnect transmission lines in monolithic integrated circuits but can also be used to study limitations associated with losses, reflections and discontinuities. The second objective of the paper is to assess the use of superconductors as interconnect material in future IC technology by studying ultrafast propagation in a realistic interconnect example selected from the practical prototype shown. The results identify the features of present VlSI IC technology which may be the problem in the picosecond regime

MultiSat WebService is a space borne service concept primarily to support, extend or substitute information services for mobility and traffic purposes. It allows the determination of traffic data from space on a global and near-real-time scale. Main objective is to provide a profitable service for mobility and traffic management. A market survey being made shows that space borne online information services may be viable. The service provides the possibility to receive pre-processed, near-real-time Earth surface data with E-commerce compatible methods. The system design gives the opportunity to freely configure the space system according to customers needs. The MultiSat infrastructure design features a satellite constellation with imaging synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical payloads combined with low-rate communication especially established to support this service. Also included is a scalable, fault tolerant, multi-computer system. The development cycle focuses on an airborne demonstration of the service idea as a first milestone. The MultiSat WebService concept is being created and designed by a consortium consisting of German Aerospace Center (DLR), Technische Universitat Dresden and Fraunhofer Gesellschaft FIRST and presented here as a visionary feasibility study.

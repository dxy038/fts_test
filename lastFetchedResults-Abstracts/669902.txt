Wind and solar energy technologies offer clean and renewable energy sources, and are essential
components of sustainable energy future. The current paper presents a new methodology for size
optimization of stand-alone Wind/PV energy systems. The principal objective of this study is to
maximize the electricity match rate between demand and supplies, able to accomplish the energy
requirements of a given load distribution, for a specific site. Mathematical models of hybrid
components are exploited to estimate the total output power using solar radiation, temperature
and wind speed data, collected on the site of Zabol, located in Sistan and Baluchestan, Iran. Then, a
new methodology has been proposed which can obtain the optimal size of each hybrid component.
The objective functions are considered based on supply/demand match evaluation criteria,
minimizing the inequality coefficient (IC) and also maximizing the correlation coefficient (CC),
simultaneously. The elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), which is one of the
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), have been employed for a hybrid stand-alone
renewable energy power system (Wind/PV) to find the optimal size of each components. The
Pareto-optimal solution is obtained in order to have higher-level decision. The designers can select
the best configuration among the Pareto set which fits their desire.

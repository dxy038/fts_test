Objective: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a Go/NoGo task were investigated to elucidate the electrophysiological basis for executive and inhibitory control of responses.
Methods: We studied Go/NoGo ERPs in 13 healthy subjects during a modified continuous performance test using high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. We measured peak latency, amplitude, and topographic distribution of the components, and analyzed the neural sources using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography.
Results: There were no differences between the Go and NoGo conditions in the latency, amplitude, scalp topography, or the electrical source localization of the P1 and N1 components. The N2 component was seen only in the NoGo ERP, and its source was located in the right lateral orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. The NoGo-P3 component had larger amplitude and longer latency, and was more anteriorly localized than Go-P3; Go-P3 was located mainly in the medial part of the parietal cortex, whereas the NoGo-P3 activity was observed in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the lateral orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate areas play critical roles in the inhibitory control of behavior and that both hemispheres are involved in inhibitory cognitive function.

In this paper a distributed topology control for stationary and mobile ad hoc networks is described. A topology control algorithm is aimed at maintaining connectivity in a mobile network while minimizing power consumption under the MinMax objective. The algorithm is proactive so that the network connectivity is guaranteed at any time instant. In regard to the topology of the graph induced by the power assignments to the network nodes, the most common objective and the objective considered in this paper is that the network be connected

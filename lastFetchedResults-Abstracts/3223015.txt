We propose Model Predictive Torque Control (MPTC) with pulse width modulation (PWM) for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) drive systems. MP-TC requires solving a Constrained Finite-Time Optimal Control (CFTOC) problem in real-time on embedded computational hardware. We demonstrate that the CFTOC is locally convex, which allows us to use standard numerical optimization techniques. In particular we use the fast-gradient algorithm. It is combined with the warm-starting and early termination technique for being able to solve the CFTOC on conventional embedded control hardware in real-time. The main control objective is to track a reference torque. Moreover, a d-axis current reference is set for Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) tracking and can be extended to include field weakening. We empirically demonstrate that our fast-gradient algorithm can be executed in real-time on embedded hardware. Furthermore we show that the MP-TC controller provides superior performance to the standard proportional-integral torque control on an experimentally validated software-in-the-loop platform.

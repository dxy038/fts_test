We show through numerical simulations that the use of distributed amplification together with dispersion management can permit single-channel speeds of 40 Gb/s over transoceanic distances while maintaining 100-km spacing between pumping stations. We achieve this performance by using a bidirectional pumping scheme and optimizing the dopant density such that the peak-power variations over each fiber span remain below 0.4 dB. The required pump power is less than 80 mW for a dopant density of 200 ions/&#956;m<sup>3</sup>.

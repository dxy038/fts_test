Guard channel scheme (GCS) plays a significant role in providing the desired quality of service (QoS) in cellular networks. The GCS scheme, which mainly focused on the tradeoff between new call blocking probability and handoff call blocking probability cannot solve the problem of congestion in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose an integration of dynamic pricing with guard channel scheme in order to alleviate the problem of congestion, where the price is adjusted dynamically based on the current network conditions. This is the main objective. The second objective, is to investigate the difference between uniform and non-uniform traffic conditions for cellular network and to compare the performance of our approach with the corresponding results of GCS, where pricing is not involved

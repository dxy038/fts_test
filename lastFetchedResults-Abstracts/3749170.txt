This paper proposes a generalized varying-domain optimization method for fuzzy goal programming incorporating multiple priorities. According to the three possible styles of the objective function, the varying-domain optimization method and its generalization are corresponding proposed. In contrast to the previous method, the proposed method can make that the higher priority achieving the higher satisfaction degree. In this way, the decision-maker can get the optimal solution as well as guarantee the priorities of the multiple objective optimization problem. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method by three illustrative examples and a practice application.

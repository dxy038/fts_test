Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is widely used control technique to extract maximum power available from the solar cell of photovoltaic (PV) module. Since the solar cells have non-linear i-v characteristics. The efficiency of PV module is very low and power output depends on solar insolation level and ambient temperature, so maximization of power output with greater efficiency is of special interest. Moreover there is great loss of power due to mismatch of source and load. So, to extract maximum power from solar panel a MPPT needs to be designed. The objective of the paper is to present a novel cost effective and efficient microcontroller based MPPT system for solar photovoltaic system to ensure fast maximum power point operation at all fast changing environmental conditions. The proposed controller scheme utilizes PWM techniques to regulate the output power of boost DC/DC converter at its maximum possible value and simultaneously controls the charging process of battery. Incremental Conductance algorithm is implemented to track maximum power point. For the feasibility study, parameter extraction, model evaluation and analysis of converter system design a MATLAB/Simulink model is demonstrated and simulated for a typical 40W solar panel from Kyocera KC-40 for hardware implementation and verification. Finally, a hardware model is designed and tested in lab at different operating conditions. Further, MPPT system has been tested with Solar Panel at different solar insolation level and temperature. The resulting system has high-efficiency, lower-cost, very fast tracking speed and can be easily modified for additional control function for future use.

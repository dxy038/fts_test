Background:
 The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of fluorochrome microscopy (FM) with Ziehl-
Neelsen (ZN) staining in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB).
Patients and methods:
 In this study, 920 consecutive patients suspected of having pulmonary TB, referred to TB
laboratory, provincial office of health care, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, recruited and a total of 2760 sputum
specimens were collected from them. All samples were smeared and stained using both Ziehl Neelsen and auraminphenol
methods as recommended by WHO. All positive smears by fluorescent microscopy were over-stained by ZN
technique for confirmation. The sensitivity of ZN staining was also evaluated in different contamination conditions.
Results:
 A total of 102 out of 920 study subjects had pulmonary TB, of them 68 (66.66%) patients were smear positive
by either staining method while others were smear negative. The proportion of positive smears detected was 51% and
57% for the ZN and auramine phenol staining methods, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value and negative predictive value were 51%,100%,100%, 94% and 57%,100%,100,95% for the ZN and auramine
phenol staining methods, respectively.
Conclusion:
 FM is more sensitive than ZN for diagnosis of TB. However, since FM is more sensitive and rapid, using
this method in clinical laboratories with large specimen numbers is recommended.

Objective: The objectives of this study were to measure patient satisfaction with the results of hysterectomy and to determine factors associated with dissatisfaction. Study Design: A total of 1299 women who underwent hysterectomy at 28 hospitals in Maryland were interviewed before and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the operation. Results: At 12 and 24 months after the hysterectomy 95.8% and 96.0%, respectively, reported that the hysterectomy had completely or mostly resolved the problems or symptoms they had before surgery; 93.3% and 93.7%, respectively, reported that the results were better than or about what they expected; 85.3% and 81.6%, respectively, reported that their health was better than before the hysterectomy; and 87.9% and 93.1%, respectively, reported being totally recovered. The factor most strongly and consistently associated with patient reports of negative outcomes was readmission because of a postdischarge complication. Conclusion: Postdischarge complication necessitating readmission plays an important role in patient dissatisfaction with the results of hysterectomy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1440-7.)

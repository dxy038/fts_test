Field spectrometry as a field of remote sensing, dealing with determination of spectral characteristics tries to provide the spectral libraries for different objects. The first objective of this study was to prepare and investigate the significant differences between the spectral signature of water samples with different amount of chlorophyll a (Chl a) of Anzali wetland in 15 cm depth. This was carried out using a full range spectrometer during the spring 2013. The second objective of this study was to discriminate the spectral signature of water samples with different amount of chlorophyll a (Chl a) of Anzali wetland in 30 cm depth. A total of 500  water sample spectral curves of illuminated and shaded samples  were acquired of 80 water samples with different amount of chlorophyll between 2.07 and 23.9 (mg/lit. Following the measurements, chlorophyll and total phosphorus of the samples were extracted in laboratory. After quality control and noise remove, the spectral fingerprint of the samples was prepared along 400-900 nm. In order to investigate the spectral reflectance differences, one important index related to chlorophyll a of water were calculated and statistically analyzed. We conclude that three band model in 15 cm depth of water samples has the most relation (r=0.963) with chlorophyll a content. This result has been proved by statistical results obtained by chlorophyll and total phosphorus data in lab. We could conclude that the best wavelength region for spectral separately of eutrophication of turbid water is depend on different factors such as depth of water and amount of sediments of water.

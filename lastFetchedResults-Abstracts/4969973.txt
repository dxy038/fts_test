Summary form only given as follows. For contour control of industrial mechatronic servo systems, objective trajectory data have been directly used as taught data for the input of the mechatronic servo systems. By using the conventional method, the control performance deteriorates. To improve the control performance of the mechatronic servo systems, a modified taught data method is proposed. The method only modifies the taught data from the objective trajectory. The characteristics of the mechatronic servo system behavior controlled by the proposed method is analyzed in the time domain and in the frequency domain, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by experiments of contour control of an actual industrial robot arm as a mechatronic servo system. The experimental results show that, by using the proposed method, the following trajectory of the mechatronic servo system pursues the objective trajectory with high accuracy. The proposed method can be effectively and easily applied to contour control problems without any change of the hardware of the mechatronic servo systems.

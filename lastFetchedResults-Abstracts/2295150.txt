Optimization design is the most important key technique of Air-breathing Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV). To improve the design level and get better integrated performances of HCV, this paper researches the integrated optimization design method of waverider hypersonic cruise vehicle. In the optimization design, Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) is selected as the optimization algorithm, and the shape parameters of aircraft are as design variables. Some performances, such as aerodynamics, aeroheating, radar cross section (RCS), airframe/scramjet integration, and volume of airframe, trimmed characteristic, static stability and maneuverability at cruise phase are selected as the objectives. When the optimization process finishes, the Pareto front side is got, in which many Pareto solutions whose integrated performances are more excellent than basic configuration are found. According to the design idea, we choose a Pareto solution from the Pareto front side as the recommended shape configuration for further research. To validate the aerodynamics of recommended configuration, wind tunnel test is done. And the comparison results show that the optimization design is successful.

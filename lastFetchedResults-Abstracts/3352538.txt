Objective of this work to show experimental possibility for observe of miniature sprites and blue jets in plasma of a pulse discharge initiated by runaway electron beam under the high pressure of air and nitrogen and to study influence of electrode geometry on appearance of mini sprites and blue jets. The runaway electrons preionized diffuse discharge (REP DD [1]) in an inhomogeneous electric field was investigated. The glowing formations similar to sprites and blue jets observed during the discharges in the upper layers of atmosphere were registered during REP DD under the pressure of air and nitrogen up to 0.7 MPa. In the Fig. 1 the examples of sprites and blue jets [2], and mini blue jets and mini sprites see are presented.

Micromachined sensors to detect surface stress changes associated with interactions between an immobilized chemically selective receptor and a target analyte are presented. The top isolated sensing surface of a free-standing silicon plate is prepared with a thin Au layer, followed by covalent attachment of chemical or biomolecule forming a chemically-selective surface. Surface stress changes in air are measured capacitively due to the formation of an alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Detection of biomolecular binding in liquid samples is measured optically using the streptavidin-biotin complex and a <i>M.</i> <i>tuberculosis</i> antigen-antibody system used for clinical tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis.

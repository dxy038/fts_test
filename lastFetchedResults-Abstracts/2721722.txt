Consider a 2&#215;2 Gaussian interference channel system in a frequency flat environment. We aim to derive sufficient conditions under which frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is optimal, in the objective of sum-rate maximization under power budget constraints of individual users. Two types of conditions are obtained. Briefly, the former one states that the normalized interference channel gain has to be large enough. The corresponding formula can be further extended to K&#215;K (K&gt;2) multi-user scenario. The latter one is that the power budget has to be large enough, even if the normalized interference channel gain is small.

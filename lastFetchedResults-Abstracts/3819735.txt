A method is proposed for the synthesis of digital filters having approximately the desired linear phase frequency responses. A mathematical optimization problem is formulated from the synthesis objective, and a theorem from the theory of <e1>l</e1><sub>2</sub>-approximation is used to convert the optimization problem such that it can be solved by the linear programming technique. The method is successfully applied to the synthesis of a digital FIR equalizer for a given analog antialiasing filter

Introduction & Objective: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is caused by obligatory intracellular parasite of genus Lieshmania. The disease is reported from more than half of Iran's provinces. Various species of sand flies are vector of the disease. Determination of vectors and gaining knowledge about them are important for devising of control program. 
Materials & Methods: This survey was performed as a cross-sectional study in order to determine the vector(s) of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Damghan district during 2008-2009. Sand flies were collected from indoors and outdoors by sticky traps twice in month from April to November. Head and last abdominal segments of the samples were removed and mounted in a drop of Puriâ€™s medium and identified. The rest of the sand flies' bodies was subjected to DNA extraction for molecular detection of Leishmania parasite by Nested PCR using specific primers of minicircle kinetoplast DNA
Results: Totally, 6110 sand flies in 8 species were collected. P. papatasi had high density (46.7%). Examination of 280 female sand flies by Nested PCR showed that 28 sand flies (10%)include 24 specimens P.papatasi (85.7%) and 4 specimens P.caucasicus(14.3%)were found naturally infected with L.major. The highest rate of infected sandflies were observed in rodents burrow (42.9%). Maximum rate of sand fly infection was in September (89.3%). 
Conclusion: With respect to high density of P.papatasi and isolation of L.major from it, this species was the main vector of the disease. Detection of L.major from P.caucasicus shows that this species was the secondary vector in rodent burrow. The highest rate of sand leis infected was in September, so personal protection in this month is very important and necessary. Regarding to the high density of vectors and high infection rate of them taking actions to decrease the sand fly abundance and prevention of human biting are suggested.

Some applications of FACTS devices prove them to be proper and eective
instruments for controlling the technical parameters of the power systems. Applying a
suitable objective function to optimal placement of FACTS devices plays a very important
role in economic improvement of a power market. In this paper, an eective method has
been presented for optimal placement of FACTS devices in order to increase the voltage
stability and to decrease the losses, considering the investment cost of the FACTS devices
and the total fuel cost of the power system. Therefore, the Harmony Search Algorithm
(HSA) is applied in this paper for simultaneous locating as well and for determining the sizes
of both the series and parallel devices (SSSC, STATCOM) in a multi-objective structure.
Since the optimization is multi-purpose, a fuzzy system is used in order to nd the best
solution. The eectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the modied
30-bus IEEE test system. Comparing the results achieved by the suggested algorithm with
those of the PSO and GA, the proper eciency of the presented algorithm will be enforced.

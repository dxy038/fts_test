Objective This study characterizes the positive relationship
between daily temperature and bipolar disorder in a
cohort of Taiwanese psychiatric inpatients.
Methods Meteorological data, provided by the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) of Taiwan, were interpolated to
create representative estimates of mean diurnal temperatures
for 352 townships. Psychiatric inpatient admissions
enrolled in the national health-care insurance system were
retrieved from the 1996â€“2007 Psychiatric Inpatient Medical
Claim (PIMC) dataset. The generalized linear mixed
models with Poisson distribution were used to evaluate the
relative risks of mean diurnal temperature with respect to
increased admissions for bipolar disorder, while adjusting
for internal correlations and demographic covariates.
Results Increased relative risks of bipolar disorder
admissions were associated with the increasing trends of
temperature over 24.0  C (50th %), especially for adults
and females. The highest daily diurnal temperatures above
30.7  C (99th %) had the greatest risks of bipolar
hospitalizations.
Conclusion Understanding the increase of bipolar disorder
admissions occurring in extreme heat is important in
the preparation and prevention of massive recurrences of
bipolar episodes.

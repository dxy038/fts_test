The rapid increase in the power generation from various emerging wind and solar projects are proving to be highly beneficial and eco-friendly. But adding a new renewable resource onto an existing transmission network has become a challenge. The existing transmission network should be in a position to accept the newly generated power, when a renewable source is integrated onto it. This paper explains the simulated results of various Series Compensated FACTS devices by which the enhancement could be carried out there by considering the Installation of new transmission lines as a final resort for integrating the renewable sources. An assessment carried out in this sequence to enhance the power transfer capacity to facilitate the renewable penetration will prove to be an efficient approach. The various ways for enhancing the power transfer capacity of a transmission network to enhance the power flow is totally a different concept. The application discussed in this paper is yet another concept of enhancing the power transfer capability of a transmission network by the various techniques mentioned above strictly for integrating renewable resources. Initially couple of Real Time Scenario were discussed where Series FACTS Devices had been installed on the Lines only to Increase the Power Transfer Capability for accommodating more Renewable Energy Resources. Apart from this, the main objective of this paper is to present the simulation results of a Standard 5 Bus Test System. The Series Connected FACTS devices are connected for increasing the Power transfer capability of the lines that would give more spacing for the Renewable Energy Devices like PV Solar and Wind to be integrated.

We consider the problem of selecting an optimal system from among a finite set of competing systems, based on a &#8220;stochastic&#8221; objective function and subject to a single &#8220;stochastic&#8221; constraint. By strategically dividing the competing systems, we derive a large deviations sampling framework that asymptotically minimizes the probability of false selection. We provide an illustrative example where a closed-form sampling law is obtained after relaxation.

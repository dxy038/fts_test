The objective of the paper is to propose a safety assessment model and metrics for the road transportation system in metropolitan cities. The hazards and mishaps are identified with respect to different environmental factors, possible scenarios and likely events that cause road accidents. In system safety, the semantics of each contributing entities are formally specified to analyze the effect on the risk of the entities like the passengers and properties. The periodicity or occurrence frequency of each and every event is considered as a main factor where the multi-set of objects which are interacting at random time intervals that cause road accidents. The safety assessment and safety metrics are proposed based on the chance of an escape from an accident or the possibility of say head injury and probability of fracture. A survey was conducted among different sections of people to identify the possible reasons and their remedies, and based on the survey results, a probabilistic reasoning is applied to determine the hazard rate.

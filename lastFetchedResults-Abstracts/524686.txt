Background/Objective: The status of pelvic supporting organs and possible related factors in a population of Iranian women, 18 – 68 years of age, were studied in primary health care centers. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 3,730 women were visited in three primary health care centers. The status of their pelvic supporting organs was measured according to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system. Stages of prolapse were evaluated for trends in terms of various variables, using the Pearson χ2 statistical test. Demographic and obstetric factors were tested for potential confounding variables with logistic regression analysis. Results: The mean age was 36 (range: 18 – 68) years. The overall distribution of pelvic organ prolapse was as follows: stage 0, 47%; stage 1, 23.1%; stage 2, 18.3%; and stage 3, 11.6%. Based on logistic regression analysis, age ≥50 years, menopause, gravidity >3, parity >3, number of vaginal deliveries >3, history of operative delivery, history of vaginal delivery without episiotomy, and home delivery were found to be independent risk factors for development of pelvic organ prolapse. Conclusion: The overall rate of prolapse was 53%, with most subjects having stage 1 or 2. Several factors influence development of pelvic organ prolapse.

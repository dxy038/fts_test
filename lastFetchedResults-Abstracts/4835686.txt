Nowadays, several optical space-borne systems with high resolution, high temporal revisit frequency and constant viewing angles are preparing to be be launched: Ven&#956;s, Sentinel-2, etc. The usefulness of these data will be limited due to for instance cloud coverage over the scene. Image fusion techniques with other satellite products of even higher revisit frequency will dramatically promote the usefulness of the data. Therefore, our objective is to find the proper image fusion technique to adapt these new missions. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is one the techniques we implemented. During our research, this technique is modified to fit the parameters of our data, and the result shows an obvious improvement.

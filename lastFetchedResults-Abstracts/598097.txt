Nowadays, knowledge management (KM) is viewed as the "Third Millennium's Paradigm." Social, along with scientific and economic realms, are most affected by knowledge-related developments. Knowledge management is in many ways the catalyst to man's entry into the post-industrial society. The present article sheds light on knowledge management from a social capital perspective. A number of questions are thus dealt with: Is knowledge objective and measurable? Can it be learned or is it experiential? Can the readiness of organizations in the implementation of knowledge management systems be measured? Can a knowledge management implementation readiness tool be offered? The findings of this study show that knowledge management is the prevailing paradigm of the modern age. Moreover, answers to the foregoing questions are offered. And finally, a KM readiness evaluation model with due focus on social capital is offered as a measurement tool.

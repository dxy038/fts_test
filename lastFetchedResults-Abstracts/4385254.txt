The precise control of rail pressure in gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines is considered as an important issue. This study presents a novel approach for rail pressure control of GDI engines. The control objective is to make the rail pressure track a given reference. Different from the existing non-linear controller design methods, the proposed method can be formalised as a triple-step procedure: (i) a steady-state control is deduced, playing the similar role of the map-based control strategy widely used in automotive control; (ii) a feed-forward control is derived concerning the variation of the tracking reference; and (iii) the previous two steps result in an explicit and affine expression of the tracking error dynamics, based on that a non-linear error feedback can be easily designed for enhancing the closed-loop performance and rearranged into a state-dependent PID. The structure of the designed non-linear controller is concise and is comparable to those widely used in modern automotive control. In addition, this procedure provides a concise design process so that the derivation of the control law is simplified and straightforward. A guideline of the control parameters tuning is given based on robustness analysis. Finally, the simulation results in the environment of AMESim with a realistic common rail injection system model show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

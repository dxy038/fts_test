This paper presents a performance assessment of rotary end milling at the tangential contact. With this shape of the contact, process has been more stable. At the last decade due to the fact that cutting tools have a quenching problem, Turn-milling has been developing in manufacturing technology for processing hard steels, where in both the workpiece and the tool are given a rotary movement simultaneously. Thus, cutting edges have a time for quenching. The objective of present work is to investigate process of tangential turn-milling for machining of workpieces with in the normally available range of speed and feeds to explore its advantages. The investigations have been laid mainly on surface roughness and timing process. The experiments have been conducted for tangential turn-milling of mild steel workpiece.

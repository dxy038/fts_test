Evolutionary algorithm is time-consuming because of the large number of evolutions and much times of finite element analysis, when it is used to optimize the wing structure of a certain high attitude long endurance unmanned aviation vehicle(UAV). In order to improve efficiency it is proposed to construct a model management framework to perform the multi-objective optimization design of wing structure. The sufficient accurate approximation models of objective and constraint functions in the wing structure optimization model are built when using the model management framework, therefore in the evolutionary algorithm a number of finite element analyses can be avoided and the satisfactory multi-objective optimization results of the wing structure of the high altitude long endurance UAV are obtained.

factors affecting the deployment of knowledge management
in Agriculture Bank of Qom Province. It was a causativerelational
study in terms of data collection. Also, it was a field
study, non-experimental in terms of variables control. Sample
size was estimated by Morgan table and the data were collected
by a questionnaire. The statistical population included manager,
experts and assistants of Agriculture Bank in Qom Province including
250 people. Sample size was calculated (n = 152) by
Morgan table. The reliability was estimated by a pretest with
20 questionnaires filled out by a statistical population similar

advice was taken care of about modifying or replacing some
questions. Finally, Cronbach's alpha was estimated for the questionnaire
to be 0.81. To achieve research objectives, the
descriptive statistics of frequency, mean, variance, and standard

regressions were conducted by SPSS Statistical Software
Package. Results revealed the significant relationship of
knowledge management deployment with organization culture,
knowledge sources, organization memory, and information
technology at the one percent level with modified determination
coefficient of 0.632. In other words, 63.2% of the variation of

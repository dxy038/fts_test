Supplier selection is naturally a complex multi-objective problem including both quantitative and qualitative factors. This paper deals with this issue from a new view point. A quantity discount situation, which plays a role of motivator for buyer, is considered. Moreover, in order to find a reasonable compromise solution for this problem, at first a multi-objective modeling is presented. Then a proposed fuzzy compromise programming is utilized to determine marginal utility function for each criterion. Also, group decision makersâ€™ preferences have taken into account and the weight of each criterion has been measured by forming pair-wise comparison matrixes. Finally the proposed approach is conducted for a numerical example and its efficacy and efficiency are verified via this section. The results indicate that the proposed method expedites the generation of compromise solution.

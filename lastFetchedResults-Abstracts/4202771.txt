A short term and long term evolution of mobile systems can been foreseen. Second generation systems can be developed to support more services into generation 2.5. Secondly generation 3 systems will be introduced that support wide band data services. For wide band data, new air interfaces must be developed considering backward compatibility with generation 2 systems. The CODIT (code division testbed) project is a research project within the European RACE II program that has the objective to explore the potential of CDMA as an access method for such third generation mobile telephone systems. The main activities of the project has been to establish an advanced system concept based on CDMA and to validate the concept by simulations and analysis. A possible scenario year 2005 is presented in the paper

Background: Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease with a distinct histopathological form referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Evidence has indicated that a local renin-angiotensin system is present in distal lung parenchyma. Expression of the component of this system is present in a number of fibrotic lung diseases. In this study, we assessed the association of Insertion/Deletion (I/D) polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in IPF.
Materials and Methods: By using semi-nested PCR, we determined the I/D polymorphism of ACE gene in 23 paraffin-embedded open lung biopsy specimens from patients having clinical and imaging findings of IPF and pathologic diagnosis of UIP at National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (NRITLD). Afterwards, we compared the results with I/D polymorphism of ACE gene in a healthy control group (n- 88).
Results: The frequency of I allele was 71.7%( 33 out of 46) and the frequency of D allele was 28.3% (13 out of 46). The frequent genotype was I/D (56.5 %) which was statistically significant comparing with healthy group (27.3 %). We had no D/D genotype . There was a difference in the distribution pattern of ACE genotype between patients and controls (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our study revealed an association between carriage of I allele and I/D genotype in IPF.

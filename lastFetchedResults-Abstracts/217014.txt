Three groups of rectangular beams, comprising of sixteen specimens with various
amounts of torsional steel reinforcement were tested under pure torsion.
Evaluating the effects of various steel torsional reinforcement ratios on the torsional
behaviour of the strengthened beams was the objective of this investigation.
Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheet wrappings consisted of different configurations
including anchored U-wrapping and full and strip wrappings. The total steel
ratios, including longitudinal and transverse reinforcements considered in this study
were 1.56%, 2.13%, and 3.03%, respectively. This study indicates that the CFRP contributions
to the torsional strength of the strengthened beams, having identical volumetric
ratio of CFRP reinforcement are quite dependent on the total amount of torsional
reinforcements. The above mentioned CFRP contributions will increase as the steel torsional
reinforcement is increased. Experimental results show that increasing the steel
reinforcement by 37% and 94%, increases the CFRP contribution to torsional strength
by up to 54% and 91% for strengthened beams with one CFRP ply; and by up to 60%
and 111% for strengthened beams with two CFRP plies, respectively. In this experimental
work, the effect of the number of CFRP plies is also investigated. It is found that the
increase in CFRP contribution to torsional strength concerning the beams strengthened
by one ply and two plies of CFRP sheets is close for various steel reinforcement ratios,
when compared to increasing the total amount of steel reinforcement.

Philosophy has gone through fundamental cyclic changes and metamorphosis during the recent decades. One of the metamorphoses is the manifestation of post â€“structuralism. In this paper, realism and objectivism are introduced as ways of getting out of noncritical deadlock in the post structural philosophy. Critical realism approach of Putnam and Basker is investigated in the first stage of this research, then it is tried to defend social objective by applying the principles of critical realism extracted from the philosophy of natural sciences. Acceptance of experimental and applied outcome of a scientific theory has been interpreted mainly in two ways. Realists believe that there is a phenomenological belief based on the existence of external universe and theoretical conformity behind any experimental sufficiency of any theory. Anti- realists, in contrast, argue that experimental c criteria are the only necessary condition for examining the validity of theory. This article confirms critical realism approach to be a better model of explaining the social identities and political philosophy. Thus, believing in social objectivity, political philosophy is better equipped to provide political critic and defend political ideals.

This paper proposes a study and a comparison between two efficient and relatively recent vehicle control dynamics strategies, namely, the non linear Flatness control strategy and the LPV/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control strategy. The first one concerns a controller based on the differential algebraic flatness of non linear systems and an algebraic non linear estimation applied to commercial vehicles. The second one is a LPV/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> (Linear Varying Parameter with the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm) control using a stability monitoring system to achieve the vehicle dynamics control objective. These two strategies use Active Steering and Electro-Mechanical Braking actuators and aim at improving the vehicle stability and steerability by designing a multivariable controller that acts simultaneously on the lateral and longitudinal dynamics of the car. Simulations are performed on a complex nonlinear full vehicle model, the same driving scenario is applied for the two control strategies. The model parameters are those of a Renault Me&#769;gane Coupe&#769;, obtained by identification with real data. Promising simulations results are obtained. Comparison between the two proposed strategies and the uncontrolled vehicle show the reliability and the robustness of the proposed solutions, even if one is developed within the linear control framework while the other one is a non linear control approach.

Objective: To establish standard values for tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs).
Methods: We examined SEPs following left tibial nerve stimulation in 65 normal subjects of various ages, and performed multiple regression analysis using height, age, (age-20)2 and gender as predictor variables. We objectively selected the latency or interval parameters with less intersubject variability as the standard parameters for evaluation.
Results: Among 3 cortical bipolar derivations investigated, the Cz′-Cc lead gave a more constant and stable P38 component than the Cz′-Fz or Ci-Cc lead. The latencies of the N8o (N8 onset) of the popliteal potential, P15 (P15 peak) in the contralateral iliac crest-ipsilateral greater trochanter lead, N21, N30 and P38o/P38 in the Cz′-Cc lead, as well as the intervals between these components were selected as standard parameters. P15 was easily identified in all of the subjects and is expected to be a new parameter to evaluate the proximal segment of the tibial nerve. The amplitudes of P15 and the other components were also evaluated. We present nomograms for the normal limit values of each parameter.
Conclusions: We present a thorough set of standard values for tibial SEPs where the subject factors were fully considered, and which is easily applicable to clinical practice.

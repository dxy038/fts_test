The primary objective of the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey recommended SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) Mission is to measure the water elevation of the global oceans, as well as terrestrial water bodies (such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands), to answer key scientific questions on the kinetic energy of ocean circulation, the spatial and temporal variability of the worldÂ´s surface freshwater storage and discharge, and to provide societal benefits on predicting climate change, coastal zone management, flood prediction, and water resources management. In this paper, we present the overall concept of the SWOT mission, as well as the scientific rational, objectives and development status of the technology items currently under development.

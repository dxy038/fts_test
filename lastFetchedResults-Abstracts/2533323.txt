The objective of this study was to assess the etiology, diagnosis, treatment methods, surgical findings, postoperative results and necropsy findings of seventeencases of thoracic traumaby evaluating medical records. A car accident, falling down, stabbing and bites were identified asthe causes of trauma. Diagnosed pathologies in the cases included pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, lung lobe collapse or eventration, rib fractures, etc. The treatment methods employed in these cases were medical therapy, thoracocentesis, tube thoracostomy, lateral intercostal thoracotomy, median sternotomy and thoracic wall revisions. Atelectasis, rupture, laceration or contusion of the lung lobes, pulmonary artery rupture, rib fracture and etc. were the surgical findings. Overall,seven dogs and four cats recovered completely. Two dogs were euthanized due to other pathologies including multisegmental lumbar fracture, paraplegia and postpneumonectomy syndrome. Three dogs and a cat died during treatment management. The necropsies revealed that the animals had pulmonary artery and tracheobronchial ruptures. The cat also had sudden onset cardiac arrest during surgery. In conclusion, cases with thoracic trauma should be assessed closely and managed with the necessary emergency and surgical procedures.

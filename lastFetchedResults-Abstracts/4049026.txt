A local cartilage injury can trigger development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (OA). Surgical methods have been developed for repairing cartilage injuries. Objective and sensitive methods are needed for planning an optimal surgery as well as for monitoring the surgical outcome. In this laboratory study, the feasibility of an arthroscopic ultrasound technique for diagnosing cartilage injuries was investigated. In bovine knees (n = 7) articular cartilage in the central patella and femoral sulcus was mechanically degraded with a steel brush modified for use under arthroscopic control. Subsequently, mechanically degraded and intact adjacent tissue was imaged with a high frequency (40 MHz) intravascular ultrasound device operated under arthroscopic guidance. After opening the knee joint, mechanical indentation measurements were also conducted with an arthroscopic device at each predefined anatomical site. Finally, cylindrical osteochondral samples were extracted from the measurement sites and prepared for histological analysis. Quantitative parameters, i.e., reflection coefficient (R), integrated reflection coefficient (IRC), apparent integrated backscattering (AIB), and ultrasound roughness index (URI) were calculated from the ultrasound signals. The reproducibilities (sCV %) of the measurements of ultrasound parameters were variable (3.7% to 26.1%). Reflection and roughness parameters were significantly different between mechanically degraded and adjacent intact tissue (p &lt;; 0.05). Surface fibrillation of mechanically degraded tissue could be visualized in ultrasound images. Furthermore, R and IRC correlated significantly with the indentation stiffness. The present results are encouraging; however, further technical development of the arthroscopic ultrasound technique is needed for evaluation of the integrity of human articular cartilage in vivo.

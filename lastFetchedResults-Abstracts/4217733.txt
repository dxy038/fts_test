Reverse logistics for solid wastes has close relation with the environment. This paper develops a multi- objective mathematic model for design of the reverse logistics network for solid wastes. The objectives are defined to minimize both total cost of construction and negative impact on people produced by treatment facilities for solid wastes. Solving the model, the locations , numbers and capacities of treatment facilities and the allocation of waste generation sites to treatment facilities can be determined. So, a reverse logistics network can be designed. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm employing the problem-specific heuristic knowledge is presented. The Pareto optimal solution set obtained by the algorithm is shown to be useful for the decisionmaker. Finally, the model has been applied to a practical example in China.

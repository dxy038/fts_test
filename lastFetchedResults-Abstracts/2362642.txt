The methodology of natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis has been applied to the study of alkyl and cycloalkyl radicals with the objective of finding relationships between donor/acceptor computed stabilization energies and isotropic Fermi contact couplings (HFCs). A linear correlation was found between computed β-C–H hyperfine coupling constants and 2nd order perturbation energies, i.e. hyperconjugation. A linear correlation was established between HFCs and the complete range of cos2 θ of dihedral angles defined by the orbital axes of 2pC-radicals with vicinal β-C–H* bonds. The dominant spin transmission mechanism is attributed to hyperconjugation with smaller contributions from spin polarization.

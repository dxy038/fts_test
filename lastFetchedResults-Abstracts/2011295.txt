A simple numerical method for evaluation of parameters (constants) of Bender equation of state for pure fluids is proposed. The minimisation of the objective function leads to a set of linear equations. The method employs experimental data on state behaviour (p–ρ–T) of fluid phases, vapour–liquid equilibrium data (saturated vapour pressures and orthobaric densities), second virial coefficients, and the coordinates of the gas–liquid critical point. Results of the tests using data for two fluids (methane and n-pentane) are presented.

The paper presents a new objective metrics of blocking artifacts visibility in MPEG compressed video sequences. The metric estimates a local visibility of the block grid by analyzing the discontinuity of a pixel intensity trend across the block edge and by comparing it against pixel activities within blocks. Application of the local blockiness metrics for adaptive control of low-pass filtering provides significant reduction of coding artifacts without blurring of image details. The results of our experiments show the high efficiency of the proposed approach.

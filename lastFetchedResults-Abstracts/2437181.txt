Objective of the Safety and Environmental Assessment of Fusion Power (SEAFP) [1]is to `assess the safety and environmental features of fusion on the basis of the conceptual studies of tokamak power reactors which incorporate safety and environmental features likely to ensure public acceptance and take into account the operating requirements of utilities'. The fusion reactors for commercial use are expected to enter in operation in several decades, therefore the assessment shall be as relevant as possible with respect to further development in physics and technology. The reactor has been conceived for monitored and filtered release of radioactivity to the environment during normal operation equivalent to a small fraction of the natural exposure; to avoid radioactivity release to the environment for all in-plant accidents and conceivable ex-plant accidents; to avoid disruption of community life outside the plant perimeter even in the case of rupture of confinement barriers, in particular by non-anticipated plant initiators. Consideration of possible fault conditions is an integrated part of the design of the main components and their associated support systems. the overall philosophy proposed is that all faults should be contained within an individual system regardless of the initiation fault or external action.

It is fundamental work for objective tongue inspection to accurately segment tongue body from original image. This paper presents a new color tongue image segmentation algorithm based on HSI model. The original image was converted to HSI space firstly. Then it was segmented by threshold value of hue and intensity component before it was converted to binary image. Finally the sequential algorithm was used to quickly mark the connected area and morphologic method was applied to fill little holes in the tongue body area. Experimental result shows it is a fast algorithm with good segmentation effect.

The paper first presents the measured results of the dependency of the angle of arrival (AOA) and delay profile on terminal locations when a base station is placed on the roof top of a building in a street cell. Then, it is shown that an adaptive antenna employing pattern control in the vertical plane can enlarge the cell size with the same delay reduction as an ordinary tilt antenna. In addition, the influence of a bidirectional pattern in the horizontal plane, which can further enlarge the cell size, is investigated, and a suitable antenna configuration for placing the base stations at a high location is proposed.

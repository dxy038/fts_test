Objective:: The aim of the current study was to study the relationship between stressors, coping strategies and stress symptoms in parents of deaf student. Method: To obtain the stated goal two hundred parents (100 mothers, and 100 fathers) of deaf students haven been selected by means of cluster sampling and the following instrument were used to collect data: Questionnaire of Resource and Stress- Short Form (Friedrich, Green berg, & Crnic, 1983), Ways of Coping (Lazarous, & Folkman, 1984) and Stress Symptoms Indicators (Seyyed khorasani,1998). Analysis of data using correlation coefficient, multiple regression, and "t" test have been accomplished to address the stated questions. Results: Analysis of data revealed that there was a significant correlation between sources of stressors (familial factors, temperament of the child, and physical limitations) and stress symptoms (in behavioral, cognitive, affective, and physiological domains) in parents of deaf children. Moreover, data revealed that using emotionally oriented coping style increased stress symptoms in parents, whereas, utilizing problem oriented coping strategies reduced psychological stress of the parents. In addition, comparison of mothers and fathers revealed that fathers were higher than mothers in reaction to stressors, and showing behavioral symptoms of stress (i.e. aggression, and other hostile behaviors) fathers also were higher in using emotionally oriented coping strategies. Discussion: Utilizing problem oriented coping strategies can reduce stress symptoms in parents of deaf children.

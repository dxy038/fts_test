Recent surge of micro machine and nanotechnology, especially finding of carbon nanotube, has drawn a lot of attentions. A field dealing with how to handle parts and structures in micro-scale or nanoscale is called micro-manipulation or nano-manipulation, respectively. A lot of research works have been done in this field and some of the research outcomes are already in market for commercial use. Objective of this study is to present a potential solution to some of the problems that conventional micro manipulation systems suffer from, by providing a variety of sensing instruments as well as operation methods. User can choose a desirable combination of feedback signals and operation method according to a task nature, a cost, a data transmission bandwidth and so on. Providing users with these choices not only helps prevailing micro manipulation systems but also makes research coordination or production coordination from different sites much easier.

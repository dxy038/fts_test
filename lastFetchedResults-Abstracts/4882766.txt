In this paper, we describe a novel method of keyframe setting in video coding: fast adaptive keyframe selecting. The method analyzes video contents and decides keyframe setting dynamically and adaptively. Utilizing information generated by motion-estimation, our method involves only a little additional computing cost. Our method can improve both objective and subjective quality compared with traditional keyframe setting. It can be applied to any motion-estimation based video compression. We tested the method on not only standard test sequences but also real movie sequences proving that it gives valuable results.

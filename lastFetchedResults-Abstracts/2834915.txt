In this paper, the dynamic power allocation problem over the multiple-access channel (MAC) against overhearing of eavesdroppers is investigated with the objective to maximize the usersÂ´ secrecy rate under transmitted power constraints. Lyapunov drift approach is applied to derive the sub-optimal solution for this inherent non-convex optimization problem. Convergence condition and performance of the developed algorithm are investigated. Simulation results indicate that it outperforms the difference- of-two-convex-functions (DC) programming with much less computation time, and its achieved secrecy rate is close to the global optimum solution.

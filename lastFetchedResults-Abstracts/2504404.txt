Background: Preeclampsia is a disorder unique to pregnancy and has long been recognized as an important contributor of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. It is suggested that cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-?) have an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and may cause generalized endothelial dysfunction.
Objective: The aim of this study was comparison of maternal serum TNF-? in severe and mild preeclampsia versus normal pregnancy.
Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 37 women with preeclampsia (17 mild and 20 severe preeclampsia) and 41 normotensive pregnant women with similar gestational age at third trimester of pregnancy. All the preeclamptic cases had blood pressure ? 140/90 mmHg, and proteinuria ? 300 mg in a 24-h urine sample. Maternal serum TNF-? concentration was compared in all of them.
Results: The level of TNF-? concentration was not statistically different between the studied groups. No significant correlation was found between preeclampsia and control group as they were compared in the view of maternal serum TNF-? concentration.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that serum TNF-? is not significantly associated with preeclampsia.

In this paper, we propose a gait generation concept for rehabilitation, in which GaitGen, a gait pattern generator is introduced. The concept of GaitGen will be explained. GaitGen aims to provide objective gait planning for rehabilitation. Gait-related studies have been carried out for the validation and enhancement of GaitGen. Motion capture system has been used for gait database collection. An established equation of normalized gait parameters has been studied via GAITRite. The paper ends with a summary of results, findings, and future works.

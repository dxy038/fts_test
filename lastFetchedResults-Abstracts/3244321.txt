Major objective for the Thermal power generation is to minimize fuel consumption by allocating optimal power generation from each unit and to maintain emissions within the environmental license limit subject to equality and inequality constraints. The objectives considered in this paper for minimization i.e. cost and emission are of conflicting nature, therefore weighting method has been applied to convert multiobjective optimization problem to a scalar optimization. The weighting method assigns different weights to each objective function based upon their importance. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been applied to find the best comprised solution. The equality constraints have been handled by exterior penalty method. Fuzzy cardinal approach has been used for the evaluation of the best solution. In order to show the effectiveness, the proposed approach has been tested on three test systems. Numerical results obtained from the proposed approach are compared with different techniques.

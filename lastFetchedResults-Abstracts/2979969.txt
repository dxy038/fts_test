A method with a genetic algorithm (GA) to quantize filter coefficients is proposed. The proposed method searches a population of the quantized filters for the optimal quantized filter which retains the frequency characteristic of a reference filter, by using the GA. In order to establish this method, we decide how to execute the following GA procedures: representation of strings; fitness (objective function); reproduction; crossover and mutation. The experimental results are included to verify that the proposed method can obtain the filter with better frequency characteristic than ones which the traditional quantization methods, such as to round off, round up, and round down, provides

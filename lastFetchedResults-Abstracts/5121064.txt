The objective of this paper is to describe specific properties of transmitting and receiving impulse antennas that distinguish them from conventional antennas. It demonstrates the impact of impulse antenna matching, dimensions, configuration and Joule losses upon the quality of ultra-short drive pulse conversion to electromagnetic ultra-short pulses and vice versa. General recommendations are given with regard to impulse antenna design.

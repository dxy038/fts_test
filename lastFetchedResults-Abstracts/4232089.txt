This paper describes the design of a sound system used in human-robot interaction. Its objective is to play sounds synchronized with a main system (another application or a robot) to increase emotional or gestural impact. This synchronization is possible using a generic sound model composed of a states/transitions graph and different sound effects applied instantaneously. For each system, a different sound graph can be built. Every element of the graph is also a sound. This model enables a dynamics sound system. The main system communicates with this sound system by sending different messages using a network.

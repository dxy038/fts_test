In computer vision applications, analysis of shading information requires a proper model of light reflection from object surfaces. To overcome the shortcoming of the most often used model and to extend the reflection model for computer color vision, an examination is made of the light reflection problem using the bidirectional spectral-reflectance distribution function (BSRDF) to specify both incident- and reflected-beam geometries. It is shown that the product form can still be retained for a polychromatic light source under two lighting conditions: the light source is collimated; or the spectral factor and the geometric factor can be separated for both the light source and the BSRDF of the surface. The reflection model is then applied to the formulation of a neutral-interface-reflection model, which is tested experimentally. The results show the adequacy of this type of model for surfaces of some material compositions, e.g. plastics, plant leaves, painted surfaces, orange peels, and some glossy cloth, but not for others, e.g. colored paper and some ceramics

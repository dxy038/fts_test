Most algorithms separate multicast routing and wavelength assignment (MC-RWA) as two individual issues to study. In this paper, the problem of MC-RWA is addressed both separately and concurrently for sparse splitter and wavelength conversion in WDM networks. In the former case, the routing algorithm is VS-based on auxiliary graph model, and a new cost formula is proposed. The WA algorithm considers the main factors as the maximum number of destinations that wavelength &#955; can reach in the tree, the number of reachable wavelength conversions, and the wavelength cost ratio. In the case of concurrent MC-RWA, the algorithm is based on the generic layered auxiliary graph, and performs R and WA concurrently. The main objective is to improve the resource utilization and minimize the blocking probability. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have a better performance when compared to existing optimal algorithms.

It has been shown that the resolution of DPWM can be dramatically increased by either constant on-time modulation or constant off-time modulation as compared to that for constant frequency modulation. However, the switching frequency increases dramatically for constant on/off-time modulation method under heavy/light load conditions. The objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid control technique with constant on/off-time control for DC/DC converter in order to reduce the switching frequency and switching losses. It will be shown that the proposed technique can significantly reduce the switching frequency of converter and thereby improving the efficiency up to 2%.

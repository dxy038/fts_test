The optimal scheduling of hydrothermal power system, either on long term or on short term basis, is basically non-linear programming problam with non-linear objective function and a mixture of linear and non-linear constraints. The existing solution techniques are based on orienting the problem so that methods of unconstrained minimization are applicable with the constraints being taken care of indirectly. The present work describes a direct method which treats constraints as limiting surfaces or subspaces and the solution is autanatically restricted within the limiting subspaces.

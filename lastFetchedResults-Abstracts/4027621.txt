An investigation is conducted to develop an integrated model for electronic equipment design and to propose a solution method for the generated multi-attribute optimization problem. An integrated system model that incorporates all domain specific knowledge is developed that can track dependencies among the domains under study here. The overall multidisciplinary optimization problem as defined by the objective function, constraint set and design variables are formulated, and nonlinear solution methods are employed. To present the optimal solution for the electronic equipment design, the influence of several design-related functions on the objective function is examined. Additionally, the influence of weighting functions on the value of each individual function is determined. Finally, a multiattribute analysis is performed and the influence of each domain on the overall system is studied. First order and detailed optimization analysis are conducted to understand the sensitivity of each engineering field on the overall design. It is evident that not all the engineering fields are equally important in the design optimization. An amplifier, located on a shelf in a frame, used in the industry was utilized for a case study.

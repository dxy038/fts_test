An inverse field problem is formulated from measurements of the multipole content of a superconducting dipole model magnet. Solving this problem by means of mathematical optimization methods leads to coil block displacements due to manufacturing tolerances. The optimization procedure consists only of an algorithm for finding the minimum value of an unconstrained objective function as there are no linear constraints to be considered. The displacements of the coil blocks found by the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm after about 1200 function evaluations applying the least squares objective function are shown

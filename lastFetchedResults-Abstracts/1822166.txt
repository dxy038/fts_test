Objective
 compare individuals with self-reported bruxism and non-bruxist individuals in terms of maximal bite force (MBF) and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) primary assessment parameters and (ii) to examine the relationship between MBF and tooth wear in these subjects.
als and methods
-nine bruxist subjects and 29 healthy controls were enrolled. MBF measurements were carried out by the use of bite force recorder. Tooth wear indices, maximal mouth opening, maximal lateral excursions and maximal protrusions were measured for every subject.
s
d tooth wear index scores were significantly higher in bruxists (p values &lt;0.05) compared to non-bruxists. MBF and tooth wear index scores were found to be significantly correlated in the bruxist group (r = 0.79, p = 0.00). Less significant correlation was observed in the non-bruxist group (r = 0.38, p = 0.04). No differences in masticatory clinical examination parameters were identified between the groups.
sion
tudy is the first to show that MBF can increase in bruxist individuals and that the increase in MBF are correlated with tooth wear in bruxist subjects. Further studies regarding the possible role of MBF in bruxism are to be done.

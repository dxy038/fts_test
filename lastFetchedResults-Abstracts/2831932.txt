In communication network management, reasonable billing strategy can control congestion effectively, so as to ensure the network resources be used rationally and optimization. This paper proposes a novel virtual billing based network performance assessment system and evaluation model, meanwhile gives the evaluation algorithms based on AHP and artificial neural network. Tests prove that the evaluation model can better combine the subjective and objective indicators, to give a clear performance for communication security assessment.

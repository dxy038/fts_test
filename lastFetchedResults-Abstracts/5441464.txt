This paper describes a college-university partnership program, namely the tech scholar learning community, formed by the Division of Engineering Technology at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan and the Schoolcraft College in Livonia, Michigan. The objective is to increase the number of academically and economically disadvantaged students who transfer from community colleges to baccalaureate programs. The strategies adopted to improve transfer rates are presented, and the criteria for selection of the target students and the factors affecting the transfer of the target group are discussed.

Introduction & Objective: Chrome (Cr) is one of the carcinogen trace elements that its role in cancer induction is documented in many studies. In spite o this, there are limited studies about the relationship between chrome and bladder cancer. So we decided to study the serum concentration of Cr in patients with bladder cancer in comparison with healthy individuals.
Materials & method: During this case control study, 51 patients with bladder cancer and 58 normal subjects, after matching in age, sex and smoking habits with case group, were selected. Blood samples were collected from each cases. Serum level of Cr was measured in all samples by using the Flameless Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Finally data were analyzed, using student t test.
Results: Mean age of participants was 62.74 ± 14.63 years in control group and 58.2 ± 9.8 years in case group. Mean of serum Cr concentration was 128.82 ± 16.99 ng/L in bladder cancer patients and 121.93 ± 16.67 ng/L in control group. The difference in Cr level of serum was significant between two groups (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Results of this study indicated the high level of Cr in the serum of bladder cancer patients. Performing of some strategies in reduction of environmental contaminations, finding the contaminated sources and modifying them, can be useful, for reduction of serum level of Cr, especially in high risk groups.

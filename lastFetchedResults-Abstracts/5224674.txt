Based on the information of the type, capacity and priority of important load in an area, taking a distribution network under the condition of various faults for case study, this paper studies service restoration of the distribution network with distributed generation, using distributed generators (DG) to decrease the area of load shedding, and ensure the reliability and quality of the voltage for important consumers concerning the economy aspect in various fault conditions. First, in the theory aspect, the service restoration strategy of distribution system supported by distributed power is treated as a nonlinear optimization problem. The objective function of the nonlinear optimization problem is to maintain the power supply to the loads with high priority as much as possible and also giving consideration to the minimization of active power loss and, in the mean time, satisfy the constraint of stable operation of the distribution network. A special calculation method is raised to cope with abnormal power flow which is easy to occur when DG is connected to the distribution network. Second, the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is used to solve the model. At last, the service restoration method is verified by 13-node benchmark, and the simulation results demonstrate the validity of the method.

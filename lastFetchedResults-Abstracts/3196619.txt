Receding horizon control is a kind of optimal feedback control, in which the control performance over a finite future is optimized. The control of fluid dynamics is a challenging problem that arises in many fields. The objective of this study is to provide a novel framework of designing a receding horizon controller for thermal fluid systems. The method proposed here is advantageous for its applicability to a wide class of optimization problem of thermal fluid systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulation.

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as a component of solar radiation plays a major role in different
applications dealing with plant canopies, biomass production and microalgae growth. The amount of PAR energy
depends upon location, time of the year and atmospheric conditions. Understanding the PAR and its availability is
very essential for modelling biological growth system. The objective of this study is to estimate PAR for latitudes
ranging from 9° to 34° and for the entire year based on hourly and monthly average of the daily global radiation
(Hg). Based on the estimated data, a power regression model showing the relationship between PAR and Hg is
presented for six Indian latitudes. The ratios of hourly sum of PAR to Hg and monthly average of hourly global
radiations (Ig) vary smoothly with significant seasonal variations and are influenced by several other local climatic
conditions. The power regression equation between PAR and Hg obtained are as follows: (a) For 9° latitude,
PAR = 0.040 (Hg)0.924, R2 = 0.970, (b) 14° latitude, PAR = 0.029 (Hg)0.952, R2 = 0.894, (c) 19° latitude, PAR = 0.256 (Hg)0.748,
R2 = 0.721, (d) 24° latitude, PAR = 0.159 (Hg)0.775, R2 = 0.896, (e) 29° latitude, PAR = 0.052 (Hg)0.886, R2 = 0.830 and
(f) 34° latitude, PAR = 0.016 (Hg)1.013, R2 = 0.768.

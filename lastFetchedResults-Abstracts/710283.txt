Study Objective:
To determine which type or types of childhood abuse are associated with adolescent pregnancy and other adverse health outcomes.
Design:
100 females between the ages of 12 and 24 years of age, attending either an adolescent/young adult clinic (for ages 12 to 24), or teen obstetrics clinic (for ages 13 to 18) at an urban academic medical center, were recruited to participate in an interview study during their clinic visit. The clinician or research assistant used a 186-item structured interview form to record answers to detailed questions on abuse, in addition to traditional questions about the patient's feelings on home, education, activities, drugs and depression, sex and suicide (HEADS).
Results:
32% of subjects reported a history of sexual abuse, 29% reported physical abuse, and 46% reported past emotional abuse. The frequency of any past abuse was significantly higher in girls who had ever been pregnant (29 of 50, 58%), compared with “never pregnant” girls (19 of 49, 38%)( P< .05). A past history of physical abuse (P = .04), but not sexual or emotional abuse, was significantly associated with pregnancy as a teen. Other factors significantly correlated with teen pregnancy were: frequent alcohol use, older age, and Mexican-American or African-American ethnicity. Past history of abuse was significantly correlated with depression, suicidal thoughts, absent father, school failure, alcohol and tobacco use, and delinquency.
Conclusions:
A history of past physical abuse is strongly associated with adolescent pregnancy, and questions about all types of abuse should be routinely asked of adolescent patients.

Abstract
Introduction: Furfural is a toxic chemical with a lot of production and consumption resources. The most important consumer industries include oil and petrochemical industries, oil refineries, rubber and plastics, and paper industries. Thus, furfural would exist in the effluents of such industries.  
Objective: The removal of Furfural from industrial wastewater using cyclic biological reactor (CBR).
Materials and Methods: In this study, the removal of furfural from wastewater using a developed biological method as a modification of conventional sequential batch reactor (SBR) was assessed. Wastewater containing furfural was injected into the biological reactor and the effect of various important operational parameters such as furfural concentration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on reactor performance in furfural removal mineralization was evaluated. 
Results: The CBR is capable of removing more than 98% of furfural and 76% of equivalent chemical oxygen demand (COD) at organic loading rate up to 2.38 g/L.d in the optimum hydraulic retention time of 12.1 h. The overall average furfural and COD removal during CBR operation periods were 97.7% and 82.1%, respectively. 
Conclusion: As the results show, the method introduced in this study can be used more effectively, compared to other methods, for the treatment of furfural present in the industrial wastewater.

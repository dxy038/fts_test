This paper investigates the use of embedded energy storage within wind turbines to provide frequency support to connected AC systems. An energy storage device with a bidirectional dc-dc converter connected to the dc link of a fully rated converter based wind turbine is proposed. Different control methods for emulating inertial response to reduce both the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir are proposed for variable speed turbines. The energy storage is used to smooth the transition of the wind turbines rotor from deceleration to acceleration after inertial response. Matlab/Simulink simulations based on a simple power system have demonstrated the frequency support effect of the proposed methods.

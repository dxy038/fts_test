This paper discusses the inverter ratings of Brush-less Doubly-Fed Machine (BDFM) adjustable speed drive (ASD) or generator (ASG) systems. Based on the per phase equivalent circuit model, the ratings of the two inverters in a bidirectional converter are evaluated individually. An approach to minimise the total inverter rating is presented, taking into account power factor constraints of the power grid. The effects of speed deviation and control winding excitation on the inverter ratings are discussed. Predictions of inverter ratings are presented with experimental verification. A design example is also provided in which the total inverter rating is minimised for a practical BDFM based ASG system.

This paper focuses on the selection of the mobility anchor point (MAP) in hierarchical mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) environment. An enhanced speed estimation method is provided in this paper to reduce the estimation error. Furthermore, the concept of abstract MAP (AMAP) node is proposed so that the frequency of inter domain handoff can be effectively reduced and the load among MAP nodes can be more balanced in HMIPv6. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined through exhaustive simulations. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve the desired objective.

The objective of this work is the development, implementation and validation of a Kalman filter to estimate the orientation and displacements of submarine systems. In order to achieve this objective, the use of an adaptive-hybrid Kalman filter is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is determined through simulations and experiments in real time. The results have demonstrated that the algorithm has good performance and is computationally efficient, which makes it a good candidate to be implemented in real-time control systems.

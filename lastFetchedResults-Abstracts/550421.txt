Objective: In this study, the ability of identify of first phoneme words and nonwords and other variables were analyzed in 5 to 6 year-old Persian- speaking children in Tehran. Method: This study was descriptive-analytic. 100 normal and 5-6 year-old Persian-speaking children (50 girls and 50 boys) were compared. The tasks were included 24 words and nonwords in first situation. The validity and reliability of tasks were computed by CVI, ICC, SEM and the comparisons of words and nonwords and other variables were computed by paired sample t-test and the comparisons between girls and boys were studied by independent sample t-test. Results: The results showed that these sections had appropriate validity and reliability. Scores mean of fricative and voiceless consonants and target phoneme in first syllable of words were significantly more than stop and voiced consonants and target phoneme in second syllable words (p<0.05). Scores mean of first phonemes of words and nonwords was significantly different (p<0.05). Also, the mean scores of girls and boys were not statistically different (p=0.78). Conclusion: There are many variables that influence on the ability of first phoneme identifies of words. The identify of first phoneme of words was easier than those of nonwords. Although, scores mean of girls was more than those of boys, but this different was not significant. These tasks are good measures for assessment of identify of first phonemes of words and nonwords in children.

The scheduling problem of reservoir hydroelectric station during the flood season caused major concern in academia and industry many years. Due to the uncertainty of flood, the schedule strategy should guarantee the enough flood prevention capacity of hydroelectric, meanwhile, a certain water head should also be kept in order to guarantee the power generation efficiency. Therefore, itÂ´s a challenging to design the strategy of optimal scheduling for hydroelectric in flood season. This paper in response to this objective, online algorithm will be applied here to analysis optimal strategy, which manages the reservoir scheduling in terms of online strategy and competitive analysis. Then the evidence from Ankang reservoir are collected to test the competitive ratio of online strategy. The result and model of the study in this paper have guiding significance and reference value to decision makers facing the similar situation.

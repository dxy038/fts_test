The objective of this study is to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of discrete plate finned-tube heat exchangers with large fin pitches. Thirty-four heat exchangers were tested with variations of fin pitches, the number of tube rows, fin alignment, and vertical fin space. The j-factor of the discrete plate finned-tube exchanger was analyzed as a function of coil geometry and then compared with that of the continuous plate finned-tube heat exchanger. For fin pitches of 7.5–15 mm, the j-factors of the discrete plate finned-tube heat exchangers were 6.0–11.6% higher than those of the continuous plate finned-tube heat exchangers. Two separate correlations for the j-factor were developed for the inline and the staggered fin alignment in the discrete plate finned-tube heat exchangers to predict the measured data within a relative deviation of 2.9%.

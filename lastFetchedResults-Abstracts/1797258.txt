Cellulose was doped with elemental boron and heat-treated up to 2600 °C with the objective of optimizing the B doping conditions to increase crystallinity and oxidation stability of the carbons. Heat treatment and the incorporation of B increase crystallinity of the carbons, as expected. But B doping at 2600 °C does not show any catalytic effect of substitutional B on graphitization or an increase in oxidation-resistance. It seems to be that B doping at 2300 °C can maximize the effect of substitutional B on graphitization and oxidation-resistance, and heat treatment at higher temperature is not necessary.

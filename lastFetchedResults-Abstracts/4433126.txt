This paper proposes a dc-dc-ac three-phase four-wire converter in order to interface dc and ac variables allowing bidirectional power flow. The direct application of this converter is in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system and interfacing dc microgrid with a three-phase utility grid. Such a power electronics solution guarantees: (i) full controllability at both dc and ac converter sides, (ii) high level of integration with a reduction of one power switch and its drive circuits, and (iii) implementation of two functions using a unique power conversion stage. Despite proposing a new power converter solution, this paper presents its PWM strategy as well as a suitable control approach. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis.

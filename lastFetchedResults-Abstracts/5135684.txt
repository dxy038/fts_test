The VXlplug&amp;play Systems Alliance was formed on September 22, 1993 with the objective of increasing ease of use for end-users of VXI technology. The alliance members share a common commitment to end-user success with open, multivendor VXI systems including both hardware and system-level software. The member companies intend to accomplish major improvements in ease of use by defining and implementing standard frameworks for system-level issues beyond the scope of the baseline VXlbus Specifications. These standard frameworks give end users true "plug&amp;play" interoperability. To achieve this vision, the VXlplug&amp;play Systems Alliance has assembled a variety of working groups to address issues such as: technical support, software and hardware installation, fixturing, instrument driver architecture and design, and soft front panels. This paper describes the goals of the Instrument Driver and Soft Front Panel Working Groups, and the hierarchy, model, and other requirements of VXlplug&amp;play instrument drivers and soft front panels

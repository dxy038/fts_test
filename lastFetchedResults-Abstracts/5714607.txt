The suitabilities of two different class-D power ampli er architectures for I-bit bandpass &#916;&#931; D/A converters operating with RF signals are compared. The objective is to nd out which architecture provides the best ef ciency. The architectures considered are H-bridge voltage-mode class-D ampli er and transformer-coupled voltage-mode class-D ampli er. These architectures are compared by APLAC simulation using a &#916;&#931; modulated signal and by measuring discrete component GaAs MESFET realisations.

A proposal to achieve a dynamic analysis of decision systems in enterprises is presented. Starting from the Decision System GRAI modeling (G. Doumeingts, 1984), the consideration of the use of the human resources in decision making and the characterization of the decision system by means of parameters of quality is proposed. The objective of the Dynamic GRAI Model is its simulation for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of the system regarding its temporary parameters (horizons and periods of planning) and the pursuit of the evolution of the total quality of the decision system. An information system for the storage of the necessary information (DGRAIS) and a simulator (DGRAISIM) are presented, unified in a re-design tool (DGRAI)

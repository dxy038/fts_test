Objectives Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is the most common kind of dementia in the old age, and its incidence&nbsp;increases with age. Previous studies have shown that cytokines are proteins that play an important role&nbsp;in inflammation, and their level changes in inflammatory diseases. Since Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is an inflammatory&nbsp;disease, cytokines may influence the occurrence of this disease. IL16 is a cytokine whose role has&nbsp;been proved in many inflammatory diseases. This gene is one of the coding genes of cytokines of the&nbsp;inflammatory process. It may be responsible for inflammatory pathology seen around old age plaques in&nbsp;Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It can also associate with the pathology of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Therefore, the aim&nbsp;of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 polymorphisms of gene IL16 (rs1131445 and rs4072111)&nbsp;on the risk of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in the Iranian population.
Methods & Materials In this study, the intervention group consisted of 144 individuals who were diagnosed&nbsp;with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease by psychologists based on a clinical test (DSM-IV), and the control group&nbsp;included 173 healthy individuals with no psychological disorders. DNA was extracted by salting out technique.&nbsp;The PCR response was conducted (for replicating the mentioned pieces) for any polymorphism in&nbsp;optimized conditions by using designed primers. The product of PCR was first checked for the confirmation&nbsp;of accurate function of PCR using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Next, the PCR product&nbsp;was dissected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method with intended confining enzyme,&nbsp;and then the genotype of the samples was determined by PAGE. Individual genotypes were determined&nbsp;using the PCR-RFLP method. Statistical analyses were done using OpenEpi 2.3.1 and SPSS 11.5.
Results The study of allelic analysis between the control and intervention groups by considering the confidence&nbsp;interval (CI=90%) and significant level (0.05) for rs1131445 showed that the C allele had no significant&nbsp;association with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (P=0.656). The TC genotype did not show any significant difference&nbsp;with TT genotype (P=0.614). However, the study of allelic analysis for rs4072111 polymorphism&nbsp;between 2 groups showed that the relationship of T allele with the disease is significant, and this allele&nbsp;has a protective role in creating the disease (P=0.008). In addition, TC genotype as a protective status&nbsp;showed a significant association with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (P=0.007).
Conclusion The existence of polymorphism in some genes of the inflammatory pathway could make people&nbsp;susceptible to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. The genetic changes in DNA sequence of gene IL16 could result&nbsp;in changes in cytokine product or its function. The association between rs4072111 and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&nbsp;supports the presumptions and shows a probable role of this polymorphism in Alzheimer disease.&nbsp;Besides, the association between rs1131445 and Alzheimer disease cannot be proven due to the small&nbsp;number of samples (Power: 8.23%).

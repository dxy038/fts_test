This paper addresses the general issue of optimal kinematic design of parallel mechanisms. Optimal design is one of the most challenging issues in the field. To solve the design problem ideally, the difficulties that one should solve can be summarized as: (a) reducing the number of design parameters; (b) specifying the bounds of each parameter reasonably; (c) defining a parameter design space, in which the optimal kinematic design can be implemented logically; (d) providing all possible optimal results. This paper proposes an optimal kinematic design methodology, which is referred to as Performance-Chart based Design Methodology (PCbDM), for parallel mechanisms with fewer than five linear parameters. Some steps in this methodology are also helpful for the objective-function based optimal design. The results of this paper will be very useful in developing the computer-aided design system for parallel mechanisms. The proposed design methodology can be also applied in serial and parallel robots or any other mechanisms.

Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play pivotal
roles in many biological processes such as regulating skeletal muscle development where
alterations in miRNA expression are reported during myogenesis. In this study, we aimed
to investigate the impact of predicted miRNAs and their target genes on the myoblast to
myocyte differentiation process.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on the C2C12 cell line.
Using a bioinformatics approach, miR-214 and miR-135 were selected according to their
targets as potential factors in myoblast to myocyte differentiation induced by 3% horse
serum. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was undertaken to confirm the differentiation process
and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the expression
level of miRNAs and their targets.
Results: During myoblast to myocyte differentiation, miR-214 was significantly downregulated
while miRNA-135, Irs2, Akt2 and Insr were overexpressed during the process.
Conclusion: miR-214 and miR-135 are potential regulators of myogenesis and are
involved in skeletal muscle development through regulating the IRS/PI3K pathway.

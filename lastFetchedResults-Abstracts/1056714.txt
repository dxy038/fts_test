Five new alkaloids, hirsutellones Aâ€“E, were isolated from the insect pathogenic fungus Hirsutella nivea BCC 2594. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and X-ray crystallography. Hirsutellones displayed significant growth inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra.

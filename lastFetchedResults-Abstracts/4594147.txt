India is a democratic country. Democracy is the government by the people and of the people. Hence access to information and transparency needs to be ensured in a democracy for a citizen to understand the functioning of the government. In India, the Right to Information Act (RTI) fulfills this objective. To bring in social accountability and transparency in the functioning of the Indian government, the Right to Information Act (RTI) was formulated in 2005.. Governments across the globe are adopting ICTs (Information and Communications Technology) to channelize the organizational processes through internet. ItÂ´s an attempt by the government to make processes more accessible to the citizens and to gain public participation. Since these sites are crucial for citizen-government interaction, transparency, interactivity, accessibility and usability are four elements that play a major role in determining the effectiveness of the site.

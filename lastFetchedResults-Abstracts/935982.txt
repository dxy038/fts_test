Objective

To assess any relationship between serum sodium changes and seizure occurrence in children aged 2 months to 5 years with hypernatremic dehydration.

 

Materials & Methods

This cross-sectional study was performed on 63 patients aged 2 months to 5 years from 20 March 2006 to 15 March 2012 at Ghaem Hospital and Dr. Sheikh Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. Patients were divided into 2 groups: case group with hypernatremic dehydration and seizure occurrence, and control group with hypernatremic dehydration and no seizures.

 

Results

The mean age of patients was 10.38 (2-48) months. Thirteen patients had seizures, 11 out of them, before admission and 2 during hospital staying. Serum sodium level at admission in those 2 patients with seizure occurrence after hospitalization was 169 (158-180) mmol/L, and in 50 patients without seizure was 162.8 (148-207) mmol/l. Also, the rate of decrease of serum sodium levels in these 2 cases within the first 12 hours after admission was 1.12, and in those without seizure was 0.54 (mmol/L/hour), and it was 0.47 and 0.53 (mmol/l/hour) after 24 hours of admission, respectively. Severe dehydration was seen in 38.5% of cases and 14% of controls.

 

Conclusion

There was not any relationship between changes in serum sodium level and seizure occurrence in children with hypernatremic dehydration.

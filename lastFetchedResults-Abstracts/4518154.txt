The distribution network planning is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problems, this paper uses investment cost, loss of network, reliability and the environmental effect and so on as multi-objective functions to establishment mathematics model. The traditional of particle swarm optimization for multi-objective optimization can not solve this problem. Through the fuzzy optimized algorithm and the rough set method to determine the link between the objective functions in the paper, so as to obtain the relative important weighting factors attribute to various objectives. And then the pursuit of multi-objective optimization transforms to seek the optimal level of satisfaction of the overall goals. It avoids the difficulties about the different dimensions of the goal transform into the same goal. Binary is used to code distribution network. The improvement of PSO algorithm and the Powell optimization algorithm are used to optimize distribution network planning, then that overcomes insufficient for precocious restraining using alone PSO, increases the development ability of algorithm, and sharpens the partial optimization ability. The example shows that the method is feasible and effective.

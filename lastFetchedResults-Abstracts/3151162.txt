The paper presents the findings of an empirical research using a sample of 59 large and important Brazilian firms with the objective to verify if environmental management practices can influence the their competitiveness in the international market. Because the sample used was constituted of Brazilian enterprises, most of them internationalized, it can be considered that the results reflects a reality that extrapolates the country borders. Using structural equations modeling techniques it was possible to conclude that the environmental corporate management when integrated with R&amp;D and marketing promotion provides a significant, relationship with export performance. Besides these important findings some considerations regarding other relevant characteristics that can influence the competitiveness are also discussed like: the lack of support from the high level management, the existence of a very low awareness about the importance of sustainability and also the existence of a weak communication about sustainability with internal and external stakeholders. Some recommendations for future researches and for practitioners are also presented.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of two endophytic bacterial elicitors (Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp.) on the production of alkaloids in protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) of Pinellia ternata Breit. Both bacterial strains increased the growth rate of P. ternata PLBs. Pseudomonas sp. promoted the differentiation of the PLBs, whereas Enterobacter sp. inhibited PLB differentiation. The bacterial strains increased guanosine production in PLBs by 9–166%, inosine production by 2–33%, and trigonelline production by 114–1140% compared to the control. For Pseudomonas sp., guanosine and trigonelline production was greater when bacterial extracts were added to the PLB suspension cultures rather than living cells (co-culture treatment). Inosine production was similar in both the bacterial extract and co-culture treatments. For the Enterobacter sp., guanosine, inosine, and trigonelline production tended to be greatest when living cells were added to the PLB suspension cultures rather than bacterial extracts. These results suggest that Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. could increase alkaloid yield from P. ternata under field or tissue culture conditions. We also observed that Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. produced some of the same alkaloids as their host plants. Additional study needs to be done to determine if these endophytic bacteria could be used to produce alkaloids in the fermentation industry.

The Valencian region, in eastern Spain, is home to ≈3050 vascular plant species, 68 of which are listed under the critically endangered IUCN category. To afford protection to our endangered, rare and endemic flora, a network of small (2–20 ha) statutory reserves has been created by the Regional Wildlife Service. These are termed “micro-reserves” and encompass a large number of individual species and natural habitats. The objective is to monitor long term changes in the plant populations and to carry out active management of the protected plants. In the selection of plots, criteria of distinctiveness and endangerment of plants was followed. Eight years after the onset of this initiative, plant micro-reserves have become an essential tool for the effective protection of the diverse flora of this Mediterranean region.

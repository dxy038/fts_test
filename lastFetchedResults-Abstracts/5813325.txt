This work integrates robotics and electronic games with the objective of producing more motivating and attractive therapeutic activities in distal radius fracture rehabilitation (wrist region). The proposed robotic system allows the reliable measurement of all wrist angular motion amplitudes. To this end, a framework is proposed to allow the full integration of the designed game to the developed hardware. The framework stores data from the game and from the robot movements for further analysis. The prototype was tested in healthy subjects, and a questionnaire was used to produce qualitative impressions on the system.

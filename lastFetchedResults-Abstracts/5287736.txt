Based on cultural algorithm and classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a cultural particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is proposed. In the improved algorithm, double evolutionary mechanisms are used. The population space and the belief space of cultural algorithm are redesigned. The proposed model was used to solve the partner selection problem of virtual enterprise. In a virtual enterprise, the whole task can be accomplished by the cooperation among those candidate partners. The optimal objective is to minimize the total cost and completing time. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by simulations. Results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

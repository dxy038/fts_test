The existing Internet operates primarily based on the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4). An address length of 32 bits is applied in the IPv4, and there are only about 4.3 billion addresses. Along with the development of the Internet, the limited IP address space defined in the IPv4 is to be exhausted, and the scarcity of the address space will affect further development of the Internet. Thus the address space has been redefined in the IPv6 to expand the address space. The Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) becomes the next- generation Internet protocol, and was originally proposed due to the scarcity of the IPv4 address space. To transmit lage IPV6 packet on short time, we can use Gigabit Ethernet. The CRC calculation is a core part of the Ethernet processing. CRC is used to generate a checksum over the whole frame at transmission and to check that the frame is still correct at reception. Gigabit is a popular broadband technology for good reason. It can transfer large amounts of data through a large network at high speeds. It uses full duplex bidirectional links, each side of the link must be capable of computing two CRC checksums at the same time, one for the transmitted frame. Here the CRC processing time is very much reduced.

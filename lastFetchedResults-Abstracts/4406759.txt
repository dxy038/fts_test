Increasing in the number of consumers and expansion of the power systems lead to higher levels of short circuit current. Fault current limiters are considered to be the most privileged solutions in future power systems. Saturable core fault current limiters (SCFCL) have proper features to operate in distribution power systems such as high speed response, multi-shots operation and compatibility with re-closers. The objective of this paper is a detailed finite element analysis of a typical SCFCL and inspection of the magnetic field effect and its variations on limitation process. Furthermore, a thorough study of mechanical force applied to the windings is performed in FLUX 2-D environment. Finally, a comparative study based on a mathematical model applied to EMTDC/PSCAD is used for evaluation of the simulations.

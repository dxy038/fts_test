Objective
Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is, after cystic fibrosis, the 
second most common fatal monogenic disorder and the second most common 
hereditary neuromuscular disease after duchenne dystrophy. The disease is 
characterized by degeneration of anterior horn cells leading to progressive 
paralysis with muscular atrophy. Depending on the clinical type (WerdnigHoffmann = type I, intermediate form = type II, Kugelberg-Welander = type 
III), some workers also have delineated an adult form of SMA (SMA type 4). 
SMA causes early death or increasing disability in childhood. The aim of 
this investigation was to describe the clinical findings of patients with spinal 
muscular atrophy (SMA) with survival motor neuron (SMN) gene deletion.
Materials & methods
This is a descriptive study conducted on 10 patients of SMA, confirmed by 
deletion of the SMN gene. All 10 patients had symmetrical muscle weakness, 
which was diffuse in those with onset of symptoms up to 1 months of age, and 
either proximal or predominant in lower limbs. 
Frequency determination of positive clinical and laboratory data was done 
according to revised diagnostic criteria
Results
It was found that all patients with SMA had homozygous deletions of exons 
7 and 8 of the survival motor neuron  1 (SMN1) gene, which is one of the 
candidate genes identified within 5q13. Fasciculations, atrophy and decreased 
DTR were frequent findings. Laboratory metabolic tests and all brain CT 
scans were normal. EMG and NCV findings, all showed normal motor and 
Sensory NCV and denervation of muscles of upper and lower extremities were 
compatible with a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy. 
Conclusion
Our results confirm that SMN1 copy number analysis is an important parameter 
for identification of couples at risk of having a child affected with SMA and 
reduces unwarranted prenatal diagnosis for SMA.

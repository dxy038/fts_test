Memories and microprocessors improvements rely on the continued scaling in silicon based CMOS technologies known as ldquoMoorepsilasrdquo law. However, new classes of products are emerging that provide additional value based on functional innovation and diversification instead of scaling. This functional diversification is being called ldquoMore-than-Moorerdquo. Product innovation in ldquoMore-than-Moorerdquo technologies is differentiated by circuit design, architecture, embedded software and unique process technology. These innovations enable the use of older, proven technologies in highly reliable products. This approach allows for non-digital functions such as RF, power control, passive components, sensors and actuators to migrate from the system board level into a package level (SiP) or chip level (SoC) implementation. The objective of ldquoMore-than-Moorerdquo is to incorporate digital and non-digital functionality into compact systems. ldquoMore-than-Moorerdquo technologies are application specific and focus on the interface between the ldquoAnalogrdquo and the digital world. In this paper we will discuss the applications of ldquoMore-than-Moorerdquo concept and its utility in real life.

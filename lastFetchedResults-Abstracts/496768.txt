Relations between political violence and child adjustment are matters of international concern. Past research demonstrates the significance of community,
family, and child psychological processes in child adjustment, supporting study of interrelations between multiple social ecological factors and child
adjustment in contexts of political violence. Testing a social ecological model, 300 mothers and their children (M ¼ 12.28 years, SD ¼ 1.77) from Catholic
and Protestant working class neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland, completed measures of community discord, family relations, and children’s
regulatory processes (i.e., emotional security) and outcomes. Historical political violence in neighborhoods based on objective records (i.e., politically
motivated deaths) were related to family members’ reports of current sectarian antisocial behavior and nonsectarian antisocial behavior. Interparental conflict
and parental monitoring and children’s emotional security about both the community and family contributed to explanatory pathways for relations
between sectarian antisocial behavior in communities and children’s adjustment problems. The discussion evaluates support for social ecological models for
relations between political violence and child adjustment and its implications for understanding relations in other parts of the world.

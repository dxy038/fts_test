The objective of the present study is to investigate temperature and chemical sensitivity of carbon nanofilms made on diamond surface by high temperature surface modification followed by plasma treatment. The carbon nanofilms made this way were characterized by electrical measurements, Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The nanofilms were found amorphous in nature. They showed significant sensitivity of their electrical conductance to temperature and exposure to vapors of different organic compounds. The fast response and recovery of the conductance make the carbon nanofilms on diamond substrates promising for development of all-carbon chemical sensors which could be suitable for biological and medical applications.

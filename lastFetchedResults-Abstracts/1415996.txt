    Increasing the speed of data transfer and rapidly changing environment caused enterprises to pay more attention to Information management. One of the issues related to information is how to receive, maintain, and forget it in a conscious and unconscious form. So, the main objective of this research is identifying the importance of effective factors on organizational forgetting, hence the main purpose will be prioritization of effective factors on organizational forgetting.
One of the oil and gas companies in Pars Special Economic Energy Zone has been studied. Fuzzy analytical network process with the non-linear programing approach was used to prioritize the effective factors on organizational forgetting. Comparing to other prioritizing methods this method  is used because the assumptions were more compatible  to the real situations of decision making. 
In this research, 16 factors were identified as effective factors on organizational forgetting that categorized in four groups i.e. environmental factors, believes, processes, and physical procedures. The research results show that among these four categories, physical procedures and environmental conditions have  a more important effect on organizational forgetting and then operational processes and believes follow respectively.

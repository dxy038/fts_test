Production scheduling problem has always been a research focus of peer scholars both at home and abroad and research on production scheduling models under supply chain is becoming a hot spot of further exploration. Therefore, on this hot issue, the paper establishes a collaborative production scheduling model based on multi-Agents and discusses techniques and methods for each part to achieve collaborative production scheduling. In addition, supplier selection process on the basis of multi-objective and price negotiation is proposed and primary partner selection method is determined. Enterprises adopt the combination based on EDD + SCR rules to determine their task allocation and set date of delivery for all orders, then each workshop makes workshop production scheduling according to companyÂ´s production plan. Finally, conduct simulation analysis of the case by using Swarm simulation software platform and then verify the validity of production scheduling model put forward in this paper.

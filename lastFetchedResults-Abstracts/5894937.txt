In long production cycles, the earliness and tardiness weight (utility) of products vary depending on the time. It is necessary to reflect the weight of products for earliness and tardiness at decision epochs to decide on the optimal strategy. This research demonstrates the use of Stochastic Utility Evaluation (SUE) function approach to optimize system performance using multiple criteria. In addition, this research explores how SUE function using stochastic information can be derived and used to strategically improve existing approaches. SUE function for earliness and tardiness is used in an existing model to develop a tri-objective problem. Typically, this problem is very complex to solve due to its trade-off relationship. However SUE function makes it relatively easy to solve the tri-objective problem since SUE function can be incorporated in an existing model. It is observed that SUE function can be effectively used for solving a tri-objective problem.

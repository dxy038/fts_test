Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is an
alternative-shaping route for manufacturing complex
component shapes of hard and brittle materials such as
hardmetals (WC-Co cemented carbides). It is well
established that in these materials EDM typically
induces a heat affected surface layer with poor integrity.
This degradation effect may be compensated
through specific post-EDM surface treatments either
by thermomechanical means or material surface
deposition. In the latter case, a key property for optimal
performance is the level of coating to substrate
adhesion and how this is affected by the EDM-induced
surface. The main objective of this investigation was to
evaluate the adhesion strength of TiN coatings on
EDMed hardmetals. A series of hardmetal samples
that had been subjected to different multi-pass
sequential EDM levels were coated with TiN. Adhesion
behavior was assessed using the indentation
adhesion test and comparing the critical load for crack
extension (Pc) and the interfacial fracture toughness
(KIc,interface) to those exhibited by the TiN coating
deposited on a ground and polished substrate (used as
baseline control). Experimental results indicated that
indentation adhesion increased with finer-executed
EDM, almost reaching baseline level values. The
results are discussed on the basis of the compromising
EDM influence on both surface integrity of the substrate
and tortuousness at the interface, the latter
resulting in mechanical anchoring of the TiN coating to
the hardmetal substrate.

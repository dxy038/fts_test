The objective of this work is to bring to control literature the strengthened and symmetric version of the classical Rouche´s form. The author discusses the need for Rouche´s form as a tool for the analysis of linear time-invariant control systems. A robustness criterion is given, and its corresponding geometrical interpretation is obtained. A simplified implementation of the symmetric form is obtained, and its relation to passivity is highlighted. An application to time delay systems is given

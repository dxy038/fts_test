Energy efficiency remains a critical design issue for wireless sensor networks. How to maintain the network connectivity and, at the same time, to minimize the energy consumption is a very challenging problem. Different from many previous excellent results, we explore the topology control problem for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. Our objective is to propose distributed topology control algorithms, where only local information is kept for all of the nodes. The experimental results show the strengths of the proposed algorithms in the average edge length and the average link length.

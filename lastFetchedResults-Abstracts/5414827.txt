This paper is concerned with the stability of the impulsive bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time delays. By means of Lyapunov function and analysis technique, sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and uniformly stability of a unique equilibrium solution without assuming the activation function to be bounded, monotonic or differentiable. This stability property is independent of the stability behavior of continuous-time BAM model since the impulses do contribution to systemÂ´s uniformly stability

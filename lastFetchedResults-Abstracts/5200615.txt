This study addresses the blind image deconvolution which uses only blurred image and less point spread function (PSF) information to restore the original image. To identify the blind image it is a very important step for restoring the image. Therefore, the first step is to look for PSF model. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized to seek the unknown PSF. The objective function is based on the wavelet transform. It can identify the parameters of PSF exactly. Finally, the feasibility and validity of proposed algorithm are demonstrated by several simulations.

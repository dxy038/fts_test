In practice, the key problem to apply LQR optimal control method is how to correctly choose the weighted matrix of performance index. At present, there is no formulaic approach for this problem. To obtain the satisfying results, people must repeat to test many times. This kind of LQR control method based on genetic algorithms, which can obtain satisfying control results at first hand, is presented for double inverted pendulum system. The method optimizes the Q-matrix by using genetic algorithms, selects trace of the result of Riccati equation as the objective function. The control problem of double inverted pendulum is resolved successfully. The simulation results prove that the control effect by this method is better than the other methods mentioned in the references.

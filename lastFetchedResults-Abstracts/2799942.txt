The paper presents the dynamic modeling and multi-objective robust Proportional-integral-Derivative (PID) control strategy for a nonlinear process continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. Motivated by the fact that many existing method involved in design an optimal PID controller based on single performance for the industrial process, multi-objective robust Proportional-integral-Derivative (PID) control strategy by formulating time domain index into frequency domain specifications, which satisfy the multi-objectives: robustness, controller limit, output performance. The paper also proposes a novel utilization of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) for PID controller parameters tuning to control the CSTR system to track the reference and reject the load disturbances.

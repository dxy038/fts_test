Tube loop seton drainage treatment of multiply recurring high-spreading extrasphincteric perianal fistulae in 19 patients is reported in this study. The drainage loop setons make possible the rinsing of the wound following fistulectomy and also the bidirectional drainage of the wound discharge. Strangulation of the wound and an early closure of the fistula and hence the development of recurrence is prevented by means of controlled formation of scarred tissue. The sphincteral musculature of the anus is also protected from damage. Thirty-five recurring fistulae of 19 patients included in the present study were treated successfully by this method. Two fistula recurred. None of these patients developed incontinence. The use of tube loop setons was found to have advantages over the pull-out method in cases of high-spreading multiply recurring extrasphincteric or suprasphincteric perianal fistulae.

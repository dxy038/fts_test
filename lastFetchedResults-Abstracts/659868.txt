The objective of this study was to determine the interaction of modified bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) with lead and tin organoderivatives. The relative depolarization, of the lipid membrane, caused by organo metals, was used to estimate their activity. Dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TMDA) and sodium dodecylsulfonate (AS-12) were used to modify BLMs. The trialkylderivatives of tin (IV) were found to be the most active towards the lipid membrane, whereas dialkyltin (IV) and trialkyllead (IV) derivatives were less active. Also, a correlation exists between depolarization activity and the lipophilicity of organo metal hydrolysis products. The surface charge of modified membranes had a secondary influence on depolarization efficiency of the tin and lead derivatives.

Background and objective: Brucellosis has been endemic in Iran. Detection of Brucella antibodies is a useful method for diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the indirect ELISA (IELISA) for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in comparison to routine serological methods.

Material and methods: Brucella abortus S99 was used for LPS preparation. The LPS was extracted by hot phenol method with enzymatic digestion. Microtitre plates were coated with LPS. For IELISA, binding of antibodies to LPS was revealed by using peroxidase conjugated anti human IgGl.

Results: The cutoff values were set at 17.92-21.63% positivity (P%). The cutoffs were obtained by testing negative serum samples. The specificity and sensitivity for IELISA was 95.5% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value , negative predictive value and overall agreement for IELISA was 93.33% , 100% and 96.98% , respecrively.

Conclusion: The results indicate the potential use of the designed IELISA as a sensitive, specific, rapid and simple method for diagnosis of human brucellosis.

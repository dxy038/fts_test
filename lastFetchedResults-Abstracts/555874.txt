Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the kind Javad Salehi
of source problem processing on construction and transfer of the solution schema Psychology Dept., Zanjan University
to the target problem in an analogical problem - solving situation. Method: For Noorollah Mohammadi
this purpose, using an experimental "post-test multiple group" a sample of 90 Psychology Dept., Shiraz University
male undergraduate students of Zanjan University were first divided into three Amir Onagh
groups: verbal, theatrical, and painting. The participants all read the story of BA in Psychology
"General and Dictator" and recreated the story through their specific methods.
Subsequently the members of the three groups attempted to solve the problem of
the ray and the tumor, whose necessary schema was embedded in the primary
story. Results: Results show that prior to indicating a structural similarity
between the story of the general and the ray problem, the participants who had
acted out the story, were more successful in solving the problem in comparison
with participants who had recreated the story verbally or through drawing. This is
despite the lack of difference between the three groups with regard to the quality
of recalling the story of the general, and the fact that the quantitative difference
was even worse in the acting group. Conclusion: Since the successful solving of
the target problem in this study, required a kinesthetic schema, and as the
possibility of forming these schemas is higher during executing active behavior
(acting) in comparison with other situations, the participants in the acting group
performed better than their counterparts in other groups. In general, results
indicate that for a successful transfer of principles from resource to target, the
richness of the formed schemas is not sufficient. To solve the target problem, the
formed schema should be of the same source with the required schema

A novel MOS-based power device, the monolithic bidirectional switch (MBS), is investigated in this work. An analytical model is used to explain basic device operating principles. A self-aligned fabrication process of lateral MBS devices with Schottky contacts and local oxidation of silicon technique (LOCOS) is described. Experimental results are compared with the analytical model to analyze the influence of device parasitics. Bidirectional switching and an on/off-current ratio of more than 100 is demonstrated for MBS devices for the first time.

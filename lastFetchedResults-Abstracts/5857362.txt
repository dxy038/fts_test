Being high restricted by the conditions of roads, places and facilities under emergency situations, the location problems of emergency supplies distribution centers are suitable to adopt scattered optimization location modeling. The paper firstly set up the objective function of the location problem of emergency supplies distribution centers based P-centre model. And for meeting the needs of quickly get the solutions under the emergency requirements, the paper proposed an optimizing location algorithm according to the principles of 0-1 programming and dynamic programming, which could simply the solving process and to get the solutions of the best number of distribution centers and the optimal supplies distributing schemes at the same time. The efficiency of the algorithm is then estimated, and it is proved to have the functions of effectively cutting down the complexity of the calculations and improving the speeds in solving this kind of problems. Finally, a calculating case is demonstrated and the practicability of the algorithm is validated.

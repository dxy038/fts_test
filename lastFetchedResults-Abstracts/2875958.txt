The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) group developed the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standards for the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) are the two multiple access techniques which are generally used in LTE. The objective of this paper is to make the multiple access techniques adaptive according to the parameter peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in LTE to save power at base station (BS) as well as at mobile station (MS). Here PAPR is used as parameter to change the modulation order used for symbol mapping in LTE systems. In this paper we are presenting algorithms to determine modulation order on the basis of PAPR. A comparison between proposed method and Clipping and Filtering method for reduction of PAPR is also presented. Simulations result shows that the proposed algorithms can reduce the PAPR values without affecting Bit Error Rate (BER) for multicarrier as well as single-carrier modulation systems.

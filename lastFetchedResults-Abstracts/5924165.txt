Data were collected from employees (n=271) in six upscale hotels of Zhejiang Province, China via self-administered questionnaire and then processed utilizing SPSS 18.0. Hierarchical regression showed that JD and IC had negative relationship with JS respectively. The results further demonstrated that the negative effect of JD on JS is stronger for female and non-supervisory employees than male and supervisory staff. However, the moderating roles of gender and OL were not found between IC and JS. Research implications for human resource practices in hotel industry are discussed.

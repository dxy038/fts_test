This paper addresses the problem of regional stabilization of NCSs in continuous-time form subject to state constraints, saturated quantizer and packet dropouts. Different from the previous results based on quadratic stability, a state feedback uniform quantizer is designed via the non-quadratic Lyapunov functional approach. To achieve such an objective, the saturated quantizer is decomposed into two parts, a saturation function and a uniformly bounded disturbance. A polytopic representation of the saturation function is utilized, which builds the foundation on the construction of the non-quadratic Lyapunov functional. The designed controller is obtained through the solutions of some matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.

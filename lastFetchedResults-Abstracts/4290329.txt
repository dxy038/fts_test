GAMBITS (Graphical Approach to Modelling and Building Interactively a Technical System) has evolved to fill the gaps in other methods by providing support for (1) the progressive realisation and the traceability of functional and non-functional requirements from initial conception, through implementation to maintenance; (2) the human involvement in the system, from the procurer, developer and user perspectives; and (3) support for building embedded, real-time and large distributed systems. The GAMBITS method permits successive refinement of understanding from emerging needs, through progressive transformations of an implementation-independent specification, to partial or full realisation of a local or distributed system. Starting with a business objective, the method allows the representation of concepts at different development stages or lifecycle steps. The method permits substantial verification of an implementation through traceability links that can map each component of requirement to the design and the subsequent implementation in a procedural or object-oriented application

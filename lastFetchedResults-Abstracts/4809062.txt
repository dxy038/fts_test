This paper presents a controller design for a three-phase controlled rectifier using an adaptive tabu search. The averaging model of the power electronic system is used as an objective function instead of the model from software packages. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently obtain the best performance of the output waveform compared with the classical method. Moreover, this approach is convenient and flexible for electrical engineering to design the controller of power electronic systems with good performances.

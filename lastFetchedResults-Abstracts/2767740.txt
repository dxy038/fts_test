This paper presents a novel search metaheuristic inspired from the physical interpretation of the optic flow of information in honeybees about the spatial surroundings that help them orient themselves and navigate through search space while foraging. The interpreted behavior combined with the minimal foraging is simulated by the artificial bee colony algorithm to develop a robust search technique that exhibits elevated performance in multidimensional objective space. Through detailed experimental study and rigorous analysis, we highlight the statistical superiority enjoyed by our algorithm over a wide variety of functions as compared to some highly competitive state-of-the-art methods.

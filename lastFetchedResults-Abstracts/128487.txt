Objective(s): This study was carried out in the Qaem-Shahr weaving factory, Iran to determine the role of age in the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disorders.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving a total of 385 male workers divided into several age groups and it surveyed the effect of the age factor in upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. We compared disease prevalence in four different parts of the upper limb- namely shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hands/fingers. The relationship between upper limb disorders and age was assessed using SPSS and Excell software packages. We used the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaires (NMQ) to obtain prevalence rates for UEMSDS.
Results: 86.2% of workers were in the >40y age group. Disease prevalence in hands/ fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder was 73.18%, 62.3, 60.16%, and 57.73% respectively. There was a significant relationship between age group and upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Owing to the relatively advanced age of most workers and the presence of other risk factors such as high mobility, poor nutrition, heavy workload, awkward postures at work, physical exertion, inadequate break, etc. the highest prevalence of muscle, tendon and joints disorders was observed in the hand/fingers and wrist, elbow, and shoulder in descending order of frequency. High rates of upper limb disorders can be reduced to an acceptable level by proper attention to these findings, organizing training programs, ergonomic design of workplace, employing a younger workforce plus pre-employment and periodic examinations.

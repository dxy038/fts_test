A new technique for the shape synthesis of antennas that are of electrically small or intermediate size was described in preliminary form. Its use of characteristic mode based objective functions allows it to achieve one thing not possible with other shape synthesis methods proposed thus far, namely that we optimize the geometry before defining the excitation (feed) location or type. This reduces the physical constraints placed on the optimization process and leads to potentially new designs due to the increased degree of freedom afforded. An appropriate feed point is only chosen after the shape optimization is completed, by selecting a location on the resulting structure for best impedance matching. In this paper we will present additional applications of the method.

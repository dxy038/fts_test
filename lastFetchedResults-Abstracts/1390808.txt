Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor X inhibitor used in human thrombotic disorders and its oral administration makes it an attractive potential anticoagulant for dogs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban on canine pooled platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Pooled PPP was collected from 20 healthy adult Beagle dogs. Aliquots of pooled citrated PPP were treated in vitro with DMSO solutions of rivaroxaban (98% purity) to obtain 19 final concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 mg/L of drug. Samples were immediately submitted for the following coagulation assays: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), tissue factor-induced thrombin generation and anti-factor Xa activity. Concentration–effect data were analyzed with various nonlinear regression models for stimulatory or inhibitory effects.

xaban caused a concentration-dependent prolongation of all coagulation parameters. Rivaroxaban concentration for 50% baseline inhibition of the propagation phase of thrombin (rate index) was 0.024 mg/L, and for 50% baseline inhibition of the optical density in the anti-factor Xa activity assay was 0.053 mg/L. At these concentrations, PT and aPTT remained within the reference range. Two-fold prolongation from baseline of PT and aPTT was achieved with higher concentrations, i.e. 1.24 and 1.69 mg/L, respectively. Thrombin generation was completely suppressed by concentrations ⩾0.8 mg/L. In conclusion, rivaroxaban showed an in vitro concentration-dependent anticoagulant effect on canine plasma. Thrombin generation and anti-factor Xa activity were more sensitive and accurate than PT and aPTT in detecting the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban.

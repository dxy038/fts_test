Objective
ermine whether IARC’s 2001 decision to downgrade the classification of insulation glass wool from Group 2B to Group 3 remains valid in light of epidemiological evidence reported after 2001.
s
formed a systematic review of epidemiological evidence regarding respiratory cancer risks in relation to man-made vitreous fiber (MMVF) exposure before and after the 2001 IARC re-evaluation with focus on glass wool exposure and respiratory system cancer.
s
2001, three new community-based, case-control studies, two detailed analyses of existing cohort studies and two reviews/meta-analyses were published. These studies revealed no consistent evidence of an increased respiratory system cancer risk in relation to glass wool exposure.
sions
ur evaluation of the epidemiological evidence published since 2001, we conclude that IARC’s 2001 decision to downgrade insulation glass wool from Group 2B to Group 3 remains valid.

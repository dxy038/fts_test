Objective
The objective of this study is to assess the sigmoid distensibility during CT colonography (CTC) in patients with diverticular disease.
Methods
Consecutive patients without a history of pelvic radiation or neoplasms underwent 150 CTC. Three radiologists in consensus evaluated axial images for colonic distention, luminal diameters (mm), diverticula, and muscular thickening.
Results
The minimum colon diameter in patients with muscular thickening was significantly smaller, irrespective of the presence of diverticula (P=.009).
Conclusion
Muscular thickening with diverticular disease was associated with significantly less sigmoid colon distension.

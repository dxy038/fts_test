A new technique for simulating power electronic circuits consists of connecting voltage sources in parallel with nonlinear elements such as switches and diodes. Alternatively, current sources may be connected in series with the nonlinear elements. The mismatch currents through the voltage sources (or the mismatch voltages across the current sources) are calculated. The objective of the proposed technique is to determine the voltage or current sources for which the mismatch quantities are zero. The technique is general and it can be applied for simulating the transient and steady-state responses. Feedback control systems may be easily included in the analysis. The responses of typical power electronic circuits have been determined using the proposed technique.

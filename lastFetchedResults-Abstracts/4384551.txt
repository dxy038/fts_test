In this paper, a static and dynamic photoelectrothermal model including the impact of low-frequency current ripple on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) performance is proposed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the dynamical interaction among thermal, photometrical, and electrical properties of the LEDs when they are supplied by a dc constant current with a superposed low frequency sinusoidal ripple, which is the common case in offline LED drivers. Therefore, this paper presents both a model and experimental data for analyzing the LED photometrical behavior in terms of luminous flux, efficacy, flicker, and chromaticity. Three laboratory prototypes with different heat sinks and LED models have been tested. Experimental results are presented to evaluate the LED photometrical behavior under the aforementioned operating conditions and to validate the proposed modeling methodology.

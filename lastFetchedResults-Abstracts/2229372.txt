Wild aquatic birds are considered as reservoir hosts for Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) and may act as vectors for transferring these viruses to poultry, causing outbreaks of disease. Recent studies suggested that the velogenic viruses arise from avirulent strains originating from wild birds. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the aquatic birds of Khozestan province were infected with NDV. In winter, 24 Muscovey ducks from Shoshtar, 20 geese from Dezfoul and 51 geese from Khorramshahr (Aquatic birds of Khozestan province) were bled, and birds\&#039; sera were collected and used in HI assay and antibody titer to NDV were determined. Beta procedure of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was performed in U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates with 0.5% chicken erythrocytes. All serum samples tested for antibodies against hemagglutinin by HI assay had positive results, and all of these birds had high levels of antibody titer to the NDV. The results in the present study clearly showed that the aquatic birds of Khozestan province population in Iran carries NDVs, and may act as one of the important reservoirs for this virus. So it was concluded that detection and elimination of these birds can be a valuable tool for the control of Newcastle Disease outbreaks.

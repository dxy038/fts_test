This paper presents a graphical package to facilitate the teaching and learning of power system reliability. This package is written in Microsoft Visual Basic. The software calculates and displays graphically the reliability indices as a function of the system load. The software permits students to change the load duration curve and see the impact on system reliability of system load demand. Students can manipulate the graphical display by keyboard input or by mouse operation. The objective of this package is to help the students to a better understanding of the various aspects of generation system reliability evaluation through a user friendly GUI called Generation Capacity Reliability Evaluation Program (GCREP).

One of the requirements of the pathology of Iran’s economy is providing a theoretical framework for identifying, categorizing, prioritizing and assessing economic harms. In this paper, taking into account the ideas of the Islamic model of progress as a framework for this study, the analytical method is used to express a voluntary understanding of this model and its economic system. In the Islamic-Iranian model of progress, the proposed progress which is based on the provincial justice theory, balancing is introduced in three basic, legal and feasible levels. At the legal balance level, the economic system consists of four main sub-systems (favorable system, legal, decision-making and issues). Given the main function of each system, extracting their components can provide cognitive and functional indicators for the pathology of Iran's economy at different levels. According to the research findings, the adaptation of this model to the Iranian economy indicates that justice can be implemented at any level; however, as this justice moves from the level of objective issues to the optimal system, the depth increases, and, of course, it equally moves away from society’s determinations. According to the proposed framework of the paper, the main problem in the legalization of the Iranian economy is the lack of a link between desirable system, legal system (first and foremost the constitution), decision-making system (general policies of the system), and the system of issues. This has led to stagnation of the capacity for justice at each of these levels.

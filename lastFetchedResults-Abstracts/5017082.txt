The application of case libraries has become a main problem in engineering designs. This paper presents an organizing scheme structured in catalogs and archives to design auto-body panel die-design case library. Meanwhile, we have developed a case library framework based on grid, and solved the principal problems existing in current case libraries. For example, the applications are restricted to small enterprises, and it is difficult to realize large-scale share among various case libraries. Additionally, a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to realize a quick match with the best case, which can satisfy the intelligence request of the case library and direct the future new designs. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly increase the efficiency of searching the best case, and the case retrieved by our method has a higher similar accuracy compared with the objective case

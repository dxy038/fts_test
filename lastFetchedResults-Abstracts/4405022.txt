In this paper, sound localization in the human brain is observed by using non-invasive measurement, such as electroencephalography (EEG). In a 5.1-channel speaker configuration, classical music that is localized in the horizontal plane is reproduced, and then how auditory evoked potential is represented in the human brain is analyzed. The magnitude spectrums of EEG signals in several brain cortexes are investigated. Furthermore, depending on sound localization, neuroimaging analysis is applied. As a result, the magnitude spectrum in the alpha waves is lower during sound reproduction. Moreover, the result of neuroimaging analysis offers opportunities for feasible objective measurements on sound localization in near-future work.

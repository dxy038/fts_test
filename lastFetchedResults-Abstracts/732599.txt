Objective
The aim was to examine to what extent lifestyle, education, social support, and comorbidity predict the ability of perioperative smoking cessation, and are associated with the development of important postoperative complications.
Design

The design was a randomized clinical trial.
Setting

University hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark, were the settings.
Participants and methods

One hundred twenty patients scheduled for primary elective hip or knee arthroplasty were randomized to either smoking intervention or standard care. Tobacco and alcohol consumption, exercise and eating habits, level of education, matrimonial status, and the presence of social support were registered. The data gathered concerned smoking cessation/reduction and severe postoperative morbidity.
Results

Men and patients with a good social network were more likely to successfully quit smoking. Smoking intervention successfully reduced the incidence of postoperative complications, as did weekly exercise exceeding 4 h, and having a high education level.
Conclusion

This study emphasizes that smoking intervention programs in health care settings are highly effective in reducing postoperative risks in hip and knee arthroplasty.

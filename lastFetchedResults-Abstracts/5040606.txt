The number of consumer-generated media etc has increased rapidly because of the diffusion of the Internet. Moreover, word-of-mouth communication has increased as well. However, many enterprises are unable to effectively analyze such information to offer better products and services to their customers. To address this strategic deficiency, some enterprises have analyzed these communication trends as a means to improve the quality of the services they provide, and thus, increase customer satisfaction. Accor Hotels, for example, relies on a consulting firm to analyze word-of-mouth communication with the aim of improving the quality of the companyÂ´s services. Given these trends, the objective of this study was to use a technique called natural language processing to analyze word-of-mouth communication among consumers regarding their experiences with various hotels. Further, we seek to categorize and visualize language patterns on the basis of the value the hotel enterprises provide for their customers.

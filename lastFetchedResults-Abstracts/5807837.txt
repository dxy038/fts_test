The focal mechanism of an earthquake and fault plane solutions provide insight into the geology of an area. The objective of this paper is to give a means of better understanding fault movement when an earthquake occurs. In this paper we present an interactive 3D visualisation of possible fault plane solutions, which are usually represented as 2D &#8220;beach-ball&#8221; plots, with their respective block models. Additionally a 3D alleviation display of an area, with respective beach ball earthquake representations, provides a more in depth picture of seismological maps under the earthÂ´s surface. The program solution allows a better grasp of space, which is useful to students of seismology and anyone who wants to visualize fault movement of an earthquake.

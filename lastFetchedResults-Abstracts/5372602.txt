We present the framework development of network management system approach. This research designs for network management system monitoring in Local Area Network (LAN) environment. The main objective of this study is to monitor and measure the server performance, thus to analyze whether the server is normal, optimal or overloaded. As a result, this framework of network management system can provide measurement of the server network traffic observed in the real network environment. In addition, this framework of network management system can also provide a best practice for developers to implement the network management system in real time basic.

Objective(s): Transtheoretical Model is a behavior change model that incorporates the stages of change for the process of quitting smoking. The aim of this study was to determine these stages in smokers living in Bandar Abbass, Iran.
Methods: This was a cross sectional study. Using cluster random sampling, 1810 subjects aged 15 years and over, were studied from April to May 2007 in Bandar Abbass, Iran. Economy Model Questionnaire was used to collect data regarding three stages of change including precontemplation, contemplation and preparation within current smokers to describe different levels of readiness to quit smoking.
Results: In all, 1810 individuals were studied. Two hundred and twelve participants (11.7%) were smokers, among them 204 (96.2) were men. There were statistically significant differences between smokers and non- smokers in terms of gender, age and education (P<0.001). The stage of change distribution across precontemplation, contemplation and preparation was 50.9 %, 46.2 %, and 2.8% respectively. There were no statistical differences between stages of change in terms of gender, age and education.
Conclusion: This study revealed the majority of smokers were distributed in precontemplation and
contemplation stages. These findings should be considered in future studies.

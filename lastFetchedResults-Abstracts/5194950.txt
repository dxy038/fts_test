This paper aims to study the dynamic behavior of the fuel cell by focusing on the cell temperature and the membrane humidity effects. The objective is to build a non-linear dynamic model based on the electrical aspect. We consider most of the phenomena that occur inside the fuel cell by assimilating it to an equivalent electrical circuit that associates several elements. The simulations show the influence of the cell temperature and the membrane humidification rate on the power economy. The model built in this paper constitutes an important step towards the optimization of the energy loss inside the cell

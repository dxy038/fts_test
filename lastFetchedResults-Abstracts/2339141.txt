Objective
Trace elements such as zinc and copper have physiological effects on neuronal
excitability that may play a role in the etiology of intractable epilepsy. This topic
has been rarely discussed in Iranian epileptic patients.
This study with the analysis of serum zinc and copper levels of children and
adolescents with intractable and controlled epilepsy may identifies the potential
role of these two trace elements in the development of epilepsy and intractability
to antiepileptic drug treatment.
Materials & Methods
Seventy patients between the ages of 6 months to 15 years that referred to
Childrenâ€™s Medical Center with the diagnosis of epilepsy, either controlled or
intractable to treatment enrolled in the study. After informed parental consent
the levels of serum zinc and copper were measured with atomic absorption
spectrophotometer and analyzed with SPSS version 11.
Results
35 patients were enrolled in each group of intractable (IE) and controlled epilepsy
(CE). 71.45% of the IE and 25.72% of the CE group had zinc deficiency that was
statistically significant. 48.58% of the IE and 45.72 of the CE group were copper
deficient, which was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Our findings showed significant low serum zinc levels of patients with intractable
epilepsy in comparison with controlled epilepsy group.
We recommend that serum zinc level may play a role in the etiology of epilepsy
and intractable epilepsy therefore its measurement and prescription may be
regarded in the treatment of intractable epilepsy.

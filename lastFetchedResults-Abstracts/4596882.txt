Green building is a sustainable concept to reduce environmental impact. Decision-making for green building is a complex task. We present a multi-stage green building framework that will guide future development of a comprehensive multiple stage, multiple objective (MSMO) decision-making framework. Various software tools can assist in studying components of our multi-stage framework. We seek to simultaneously explore building options via a Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) approach that uses experimental design and statistical analysis to uncover multivariate patterns that will provide guidance for green building decisions. DACE is a useful method for studying complex engineering systems, and DACE models will be incorporated into our MSMO framework.

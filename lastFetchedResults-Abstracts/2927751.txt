This paper summarizes the use of 3 types of optical system which measure 3D robot movement and position. The principal objective has been the calibration of industrial robots as part of an ESPRIT research project, CAR 5220. This project aims at improving the absolute static positional capability of industrial robots from greater than l0 millimetres (approx.) to better than 1 millimetre, which is the typical level of repeatability

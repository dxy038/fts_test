The objective of this study was to examine the 120-hr disposition of phenol and four p-substituted congeners after ip and dermal administration in the 29-day-old female rat. The dermal absorption was very high (66–80% of the dose) for phenol, cyanophenol, heptyloxyphenol and nitrophenol, but minimal for hydroxybenzoic acid (2%). The major portion of the dose for all of the phenols not absorbed dermally in 24 hr was washed from the skin. Only minor amounts (1–2%) were detected in the treated skin at 120 hr. Urinary excretion was the predominant means of elimination for these phenols and occurred primarily within 24 hr after dermal and ip administration. However, the excretion of heptyloxyphenol after administration by both routes differed from that of the other compounds, with more of it detected in the faeces. The profile of metabolites in urine (collected at 12–24 hr) from the animals dermally treated with phenol, cyanophenol, heptyloxyphenol and nitrophenol showed only peaks that eluted earlier than the parent compound, which suggests that conjugates or more polar metabolites were formed and excreted. The difference in dermal absorption between hydroxybenzoic acid and the other phenols may be due to potential ionization of the p-substituted carboxylic acid group of hydroxybenzoic acid. This suggests that, at least for the phenols examined in this study, physicochemical characteristics other than just lipophilicity can affect in vivo dermal absorption.

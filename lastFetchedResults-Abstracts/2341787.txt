Cycle economy as a paradigm for industry in the 21st century depends on economical and ecological treatment of limited resources. The objective is to achieve more use with fewer resources. Adaptation processes including disassembly and re-assembly contribute significantly towards this objective. The usual disassembly of used products is characterized by a high rate of manual operations. The number of upcoming used products varies strongly. The goods which have to be disassembled have unknown product properties and a great variety of product types. To cope with such demands, modular disassembly processes and tools are developed. These are implemented in a integrated disassembly cell using product accompanying information systems for the control.

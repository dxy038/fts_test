Objective
To introduce the experience of aeromedical transport of critically burned patients in Northwest China and to explore the time and conditions of transport.
Methods
From August 1992 to July 2003, eight sorties of aeromedical transport of critically burned patients in Northwest China were analyzed.
Results
Eighteen critically burned patients were safely transported to destination. Their total burn surface areas (TBSA) were 49–95%, and their full-thickness burn surface areas were 41–92%. Escharotomies on the chest and extremities were performed in 6 patients and 28 extremities, respectively. All patients were accompanied by inhalation injury. Among them, tracheostomy was carried out in 12 patients with moderate and severe inhalation injury. Of 18 patients, 4 patients were transported with shock and 14 patients were transported after resuscitation.
Conclusion
It is safe to transport critically burned patients after resuscitation. Furthermore, it is also safe to perform aeromedical transport during shock with caution and good preparation

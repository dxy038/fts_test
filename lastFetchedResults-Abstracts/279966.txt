Objective: To review the mammographic and ultrasound appearances in patients who have invasive ductal carcinoma with a central acellular zone (ring carcinoma), as this feature has been reported to be associated with a poorer outcome.

Materials: Eight patients were identified with ring carcinomas. Two breast radiologists reviewed their mammograms and ultrasound images. Patient records were reviewed to assess outcome.

Results: All patients had lesions deep within the breast, adjacent to the chest wall, five lesions were incompletely visualised on mammography. The appearance was of a circumscribed or obscured mass, without microcalcification. Five patients had ultrasound demonstrating a solid well-circumscribed hypoechoic microlobulated lesion.

Conclusion: In our series of patients who have a ring carcinoma of the breast, mammographic and ultrasound appearances were similar in all cases and lacked the typical features of malignancy.

Some efforts are underway in the automobile industry to determine the distance which an electric car will be able to traverse based on some typical battery conditions. A software package DIANE for modelling battery performance in electric vehicles has recently been developed by Marr, Walsh and Symons (1990). The objective of this paper is to introduce fuzzy logic approach in applying correction factor to the range determined by DIANE. The overall algorithm has been implemented for 8 different cars and 5 different batteries

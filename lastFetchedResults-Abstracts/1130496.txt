Abstract
Introduction: Surfactants have an important role in many industrial products such as detergents and cleaners, pharmaceuticals, motor oils and floating agents. Such extensive applications of surfactants have produced environmental pollution and have caused problems in wastewater treatment plants. Various techniques such as biological degradation, ozonation and extraction are used to remove the surfactants from water sources. Unfortunately, most of them are either expensive or accompanied by other chemical waste byproducts.. 
Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the adsorption of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as a typical cationic surfactant onto rice husk samples from aqueous solutions.
Materials and Methods: The CTAB concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 375 nm using picric acid method. The important parameters, which affect the adsorption, such as pH of solution, contact time, initial concentration of CTAB, and absorbent dose were investigated.
Results: The adsorption amount of CTAB increased with increasing of contact time and mass of rice husk and decreased with increasing of the initial concentration of CTAB. It was found that the adsorption kinetics is very fast, so that more than 90% of CTAB removal occurred after 5 min. Upon examining the pH, it was observed that CTAB removal is not affected by pH of solution. The adsorption capacity of rice husk was found to be 4.75 mg/g under optimized experimental conditions (pH =6, contact time = 30 min).
Conclusion: Rice husk seems to be an efficient adsorbent for the removal of cationic surfactant (CTAB) from aqueous solutions. Given the advantages such as biodegradability, being environmentally friendly, low cost, and local availability, it seems that rice husk can serve as a promising adsorbent for the removal of cationic surfactants from water or industrial waste waters.

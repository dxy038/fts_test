In wireless sensor networks (WSNs) the communication traffic is often time and space correlated, where multiple nodes in a proximity start transmitting at the same time. Such a situation is known as spatially correlated contention. The random access methods to resolve such contention suffers from high collision rate, whereas the traditional distributed TDMA scheduling techniques primarily try to improve the network capacity by reducing the schedule length. Usually, the situation of spatially correlated contention persists only for a short duration and therefore generating an optimal or sub-optimal schedule is not very useful. On the other hand, if the algorithm takes very large time to schedule, it will not only introduce additional delay in the data transfer but also consume more energy. To efficiently handle the spatially correlated contention in WSNs, we present a distributed TDMA slot scheduling algorithm, called DTSS algorithm. The DTSS algorithm is designed with the primary objective of reducing the time required to perform scheduling, while restricting the schedule length to maximum degree of interference graph. The algorithm uses randomized TDMA channel access as the mechanism to transmit protocol messages, which bounds the message delay and therefore reduces the time required to get a feasible schedule. The DTSS algorithm support sunicast, multicast and broadcast scheduling, simultaneously without any modification in the protocol. The protocol has been simulated using Castalia simulator to evaluate the runtime performance. Simulation results show that our protocol is able to considerably reduce the time required to schedule.

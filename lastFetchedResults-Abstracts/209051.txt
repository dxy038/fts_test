Background & Objective: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most important
health problems all over the world. This study was conducted to determine the co-infection of
hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) in HBV infected patients in Golestan province
oflran.
Materials & Methods: This population based cross sectional study was done in 2004. 139
HBsAg positive cases were assessed for co-infection with HCV and HDV. Serologic tests were
done by ELISA method using available kits. Data were analyzed by SPSS-12 and STATA8
software. P-values ofless than 0.05 were considered as significant.
Results: Sixty eight (48.9%) of 139 cases were males and 71 (51.1%) were females. The mean
(±SD) of participant's age was 41.89 (±I1.3) years (range: 25-64 years). Anti-HCV and AntiHDV
antibodies were positive in 17 (12.3%) and 8 (5.8%) cases, respectively. Females were
more infected with HCV and HDV than males. But the differences were not significant.
Conclusion: The prevalence of co-infection with HCV and HDV in HBV infected cases is
relatively high and notable in Golestan province of Iran. Because of negative effects of these coinfections
in clinical outcome of the disease, it is recommended to assess possible HCV and
HDV infection in individuals with HBV infection. This may result in more efficient management
of the disease

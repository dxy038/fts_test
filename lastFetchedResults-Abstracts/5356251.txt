This paper presents a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based state feedback damping controller design for unified power flow controller (UPFC). The selection of the state feedback gains for the UPFC controllers is converted to an optimization problem with the eigenvalue-based objective function which is solved by a PSO that has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time-domain simulation studies. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of the phase compensation based method for different operating conditions and disturbance. The results analysis reveals that the PSO based designed damping controller for UPFC has an excellent capability in damping power system low frequency oscillations.

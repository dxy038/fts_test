This paper proposed LSB Information Hiding algorithm which can Lift wavelet transform image. Furthermore, made the objective evaluation of image quality by the peak signal to noise ratio and normalized cross correlation coefficient. Achieving the purpose of information hiding with the secret bits of information to replace the random noise, using the lowest plane embedding secret information to avoid noise and attacks, making use of redundancy to enhance the sound embedded in the way nature to be addressed. The results showed that the proposed algorithm has a very good hidden invisibility, good security and robustness for a lot of hidden attacks.

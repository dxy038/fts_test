This paper considers the design and the practical implementation of a stable multiple objective real-time scheduling problem for a complex production system. In this paper, a complex production system is viewed as a kind of systems producing a variety of products (multiple-part-type) under constraints and multiple production objectives often conflicting. Previously, fuzzy control theory and fuzzy intervals arithmetic have been used to develop a distributed and supervised continuous-flow control architecture. In this framework, the objective of the distributed control structure is to balance the production process by adjusting the continuous production rates of the machines on the basis of the average local behavior. The supervisory control methodology aims at maintaining the overall performances within acceptable limits. In the new proposed approach, the problem of a stable real-time scheduling of jobs is considered at the shop-floor level. In this context, as the stability of the control structure is ensured, the actual dispatching times are determined from the continuous production rates through a discretization procedure. To deal with conflicts between jobs at a shared machine, a decision is made. It concerns the actual part to be processed and uses some criterions representing a measure of the job's priority. The simulation results show the validity of the proposed approach in terms of production cost, robustness and system stability.

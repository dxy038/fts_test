The focus of this paper is on joint channel-aware and queue-aware scheduling schemes for the downlink of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) networks. The objective is to enhance the stability of the queues while improving the network throughput. For this purpose, a Multi-Carrier Opportunistic Stable Queue (MC-OSQ) scheduling scheme is proposed, and a multi-carrier Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) scheduling scheme is extended. The proposed stability metric used by MC-OSQ makes the network queues stable, while improving the network aggregate throughout. The comparable performance of MC-OSQ with that of M-LWDF reveals that the proposed stability metric is effective in reflecting the queue status in queue-aware scheduling schemes.

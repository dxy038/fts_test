To analyze and resolve the contradiction of abnormal combustion and improving hydrogen-fueled engine power is the key for promoting the progress of hydrogen-fueled engine research. Optimal control is the most valuable technology for resolving this contradiction. In this paper, the optimal model of hydrogen-fueled engine for multi-variable, multi-objective, multi-constraint under the whole operating conditions was established. The technology was a combination of nonlinear programming theory and optimal calibration algorithm of genetic algorithm. Calibration process can be adjusted dynamically to match with the working conditions of engine by weighted function. It implements the unity of comprehensive performance optimization and individual optimization, and not only simplifies calibration process but also improves calibration speed. Furthermore, a new method that accurately and quickly calibrates MAP under the conditions of multi-variable, multi-goal and multi-constraint is provided to effectively resolve the contradiction of the abnormal combustion and improving hydrogen-fueled engine power.

On the basis of analysis of mechanism about crankshaft fillet rolling, the sliding motion in rolling process is classified into elastic sliding caused by elastic deformation of material and geometry sliding caused by geometrical shape and relative position of sliding pair. Aiming at the issue of sliding in crankshaft rolling process, the kinematical model of fillet rolling machining is established. Velocities of contact-arc on journal and the corresponding point on roller are described by mathematic functions. By drawing line graph about contact-arc velocity between rolling tool and work piece, analysis on kinematics matching is executed. In order to enhance surface quality, reduce heating value, bring down power loss and achieve the double effect of rolling and polishing, the optimal mathematical model by taking minimum sliding friction as objective function and by taking crankshaft rotating speed, radius of roller and Strutting angle of roller as design variables. Solving is carried out by method of penalty function of interior point and by taking 480 crankshaft as an computational example and satisfying polishing effect is received.

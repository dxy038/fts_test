With the rapid developments in very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology, design and computer-aided design (CAD) techniques, at the chip and package level, the operating frequencies are fast reaching the vicinity of gigahertz and switching times are getting to the sub nanosecond levels. The ever increasing quest for high-speed applications is placing higher demands on interconnect performance and highlighted the previously negligible effects of interconnects, such as ringing, signal delay, distortion, reflections, and crosstalk. In this paper, modelling and simulation of high-speed interconnects using FDTD method is discussed in detail. The objective is to extract the termination parameters for signal integrity analysis.

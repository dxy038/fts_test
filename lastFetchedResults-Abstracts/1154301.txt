Wire-electro discharge machining (Wire-EDM or WEDM) is one of the important non-traditional machining processes, which is used for machining of difficult-to-machine materials and intricate profiles. Being a complex process, it is very difficult to determine optimal parameters for improving cutting performance. Cutting velocity and surface finish are most important output parameters, which decide the cutting performance. There is no single optimal combination of cutting parameters, as their influences on the cutting velocity and the surface finish are quite the opposite. In the present work, a multiple regression model is used to represent relationship between input and output variables and a multi-objective optimization method based on a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) is used to optimize Wire-EDM process. A non-dominated solution set has been obtained and reported.

Several sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring existence and global exponential stability of periodic solution for the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with periodic coefficients and time-varying delays by using the continuation theorem of Mawhin's coincidence degree theory and Gronwall's inequality. These results are helpful to design globally exponentially stable BAM networks and periodic oscillatory neural networks.

A multi-objective design procedure is applied to the design of a close-coupled inductor for a three-phase interleaved 140kW DC-DC converter. For the multi-objective optimization, a genetic algorithm is used in combination with a detailed physical model of the inductive component. From the solution of the optimization, important conclusions about the advantages and disadvantages of using close-coupled inductors compared to separate inductors can be drawn.

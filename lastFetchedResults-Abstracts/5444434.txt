The research in hand is an effort to introduce a new efficient searching technique known as Bidirectional Square Root Search, which is fastest then existing searching techniques including binary search in many cases. In this technique the number of element of the sorted list to be searched is reduced by exploring the list from both end simultaneously. Running Cost analysis and the result obtained after implementation are provided in the graphical form with an objective to compare the efficiency of the technique with binary search, as binary search is consider as an efficient and fast one.

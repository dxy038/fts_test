The objective of this work is the development of an efficient methodology for design and integration of bandpass filters (BPFs) for RF/wireless applications. After investigating the different design topologies and configurations, a 2-pole BPF has been designed and integrated in two different configurations ("vertical with off-set", and "vertical without off-set"), focusing particularly on design miniaturization and performance improvement. The design integration in "vertical configuration without off-set" has shown a size reduction of up to 27 %, without noticeable performance degradation within the passband.

Background and Objective: In this research, we studied prevalence, type, size and behavior of persistent ovarian cysts.

Subjects and Methods: We studied women with persistent ovarian cysts referred to Imam Khomaini hospital in Ahvaz- Iran in 2006-2007. Important factors in this study were patient's age, pathological diagnosis, type and size of cysts. A total of 112 patients were divided into 3 age groups: Less than 20 years, between 20-40 years and more than 40 years old. Cysts were divided into 3 groups according to their size: Less than 5 cm, 5-9 cm and more than 9 cm. Data were analyzed with SPSS 13. Results: 93% were benign and 7%were malignant. 11.6% of patient had less than 20 years old , 67.5% 20-40 and 20.6% more than 40 years old. Functional and adenoma were the most common in less than 20 years, functional, dermoid and adenoma were most common in 20 -40 years, and functional were the most in more than 40 years. 39.2% of cysts were less than 5 cm and all of them were benign. 40.1% of cysts were 5-9 cm (84.4% were benign and 15.6 % were malignant). 20.4% of cysts had more than 9cm (93% were benign and 7% were malignant).

Conclusion: 92% of persistent ovarian cysts were benign, thus we can follow conservatively with sonography and tumor markers and invasive approach is not necessary for all patients Sci Med J 2010; 9(2):175-181

The proline-rich  B-casein was digested  in vitro with trypsin, and the oligopeptides produced 
were then isolated by RP-HPLC and subsequently identified by amino acid analysis and ion mass 
spectrometry. The peptide fractions from the complete digestion were then treated with purified x-prolyl 
dipeptidyl peptidase (X-PDP) extracted from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG. Two bitter peptides (f53-97 
and f203-209) containing X-Pro-Y-Pro in their amino acid residues were completely hydrolyzed by X-PDP, 
while several peptides with a high degree of hydrophobicity were also decreased in a peak area. The 
debittering effect of X-PDP from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG on enzyme modified cheese (EMC) was 
also investigated by both subjective and objective methods. The bitterness of cheddar cheese slurries 
supplemented with Neutrase
Â® 
0.5 L was completely eliminated after treatment with crude enzyme extract 
from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG. Two hydrophobic peptides in EMC with Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val 
and Phe-Leu-Leu residues were hydrolyzed by crude enzyme extract. The RP-HPLC, and subsequently, ion 
mass spectrometry analysis have shown that the debittering effect on EMC was due partially to the presence 
of X-PDP.

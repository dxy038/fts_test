Robust passive filtering for a class of linear uncertain neutral delay systems is proposed. The parameter uncertainties of the system are assumed unknown and norm bounded. By combining the linear matrix inequality with Lyapunov function method, a sufficient condition on the existence of robust passive filters is derived. The objective is to design linear filters such that for all uncertainties, the resulting augmented system is regular, robust stable independent of delays, and satisfies the proposed passive performance. The proposed filter design problem is turned into the feasible solution problem of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed design approach.

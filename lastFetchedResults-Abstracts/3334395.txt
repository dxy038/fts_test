It has been understood the large drawback of a CLLC bidirectional serious resonant converter is using three magnetic components, i.e., the transformer and two resonant inductors. In this paper, an integrated magnetic transformer for simplifying and boosting the electrical vehicle (EV) and plug-in electrical vehicle (PHEV) on board charger module (OBCM) implementation and performance of a bidirectional CLLC resonant converter is proposed. The new integrated magnetic transformer including two primary windings, one secondary winding, bobbin, and a magnetic core, are designed and implemented. With the magnetic integration, the converter with the high power density is achieved while the number of its components and cost are reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated magnetic transformer is evaluated with a 3.3kw bidirectional DC/DC converter. The experiential results show that our transformer can operate on the full voltage range of the converter with a high efficiency.

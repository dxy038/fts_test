s
aphics did not distinguish refusers from completers or dropouts from completers. Completers were more likely than dropouts to have had surgery and to have diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Reasons for refusal and dropout were identified.
sions
al and psychosocial variables might play a more important role than demographics in refusal and dropout. Researchers should collect demographic and refusal data at the outset of studies and consider collecting baseline psychosocial data. Researchers should over sample for women without coexisting chronic conditions, and clinicians should educate women about the importance of their participation in studies.

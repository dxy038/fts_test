Due to the superiority of spray cooling system in removing high waste heat flux generated by the electronics, a novel spray cooling system combined with ejective condenser is proposed and its work procedure is introduced. Most previous relevant studies are only focus on the influences of parameters on the spray cooling performance. In the present paper, a multi-objective optimization function on the overall system is provided through the analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics, and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to solve this problem. The optimized results of the total mass, the total pump power consumption and the heat surface temperature are obtained at different heat power. The optimal system structure parameters of the sprayer, the ejective condenser, the radiator are obtained. The work conditions of the sprayer mass flow and the heat surface temperature are also got under the performance of minimum power consumption, minimum system mass and the lowest heat source temperature at heat source power 500 W (heat flux 500 W/cm<sup>2</sup>).

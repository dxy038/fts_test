The objective of this work was to study the influence of three Glomus species—Glomus mosseae (Nicol. and Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe, Glomus intraradices (Schenck and Smith) and Glomus deserticola (Trappe, Bloss, and Menge)—on the development of Verticillium-induced wilt in Capsicum annuum cv. Piquillo. Results showed that the effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as biocontrol agents varied among different Glomus species. In pepper colonized by G. intraradices the severity of the disease was even higher than that observed in non-mycorrhizal plants in terms of plant growth and pepper yield. On the other hand, the high effectiveness exhibited by G. mosseae in improving plant growth and the early beginning of the reproductive stage in these plants was not associated with great plant protection and high pepper yield in diseased plants. Only plants associated with G. deserticola had greater yield than non-mycorrhizal ones despite the lower P fertilization applied to the mycorrhizal treatment and this fact was observed in both healthy and diseased plants. It is suggested that the higher specific phosphorus uptake in Verticillium-inoculated plants associated with G. deserticola could contribute to diminish the deleterious effect of pathogen on yield. On the other hand, the possible influence of endogenous phenolics in roots on the tolerance or resistance of pepper against wilt induced by Verticillium dahliae remains unclear.

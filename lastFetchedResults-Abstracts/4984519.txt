In this paper, the vehicle equipped with electromechanical brake system is taken as the research objective, and the simulation and research on the control strategy of anti-lock brake system is done. Firstly, the force of the wheels is analyzed in cornering with braking, and the control strategy of anti-lock brake system is proposed based on the slip rate and BP neural network PID control. Then, the simulation model of the vehicle with 11 freedom degrees is created in cornering with braking. At the same time, the simulation models of the tires and the actuator of EMB are created. Finally, the simulation analysis on the braking deceleration and directional stability of the vehicle in cornering with braking is done. The results show that the control strategy proposed can be applied effectively to improve braking performance of the vehicle in cornering with braking.

The Dial-a-ride problem in designing vehicles trips to satisfy the pickup nodes and delivery nodes. Time-Windows are provided and represents user requirement in both pick-up nodes and delivery nodes. A fleet of homogeneous vehicles is assumed to be available at a depot node. The aim of DARP is to minimize cost and to improve quality of service. In this paper, the problem is multi-objective and an optimization scheme is defined to obtain satisfactory Pareto front. The local search strategy is based on Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) and the initial population is obtained thanks to a randomized greedy algorithm.

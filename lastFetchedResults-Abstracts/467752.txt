Objective: LY-117018 HCl is a recently developed, selective estrogen receptor modulator and an analog of raloxifene. Its mode of action on the skeleton is similar to that of estrogens, although it does not have the same side effects. The aim of the current study was to compare the effects produced by the administration of 17α-ethinyl estradiol (0.1 mg/kg/day) and LY-117018 HCl (1 mg/kg/day) on bone remodeling, bone mineral density, and body and uterus weight in sham-operated and oophorectomized rats (experimental model of postmenopausal osteoporosis).
Study Design: Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were used. Treatment was given for 3 months after oophorectomy or sham operation. Bone mineral density was determined in the lumbar spine (L2, L3, and L4) and in the left femur with use of a Hologic QDR 1000 (S/N 277) densitometer. Bone remodeling was estimated with use of the formation markers osteocalcin (bone gla protein) and alkaline phosphatase and the resorption markers type I collagen carboxyterminal telopeptide and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.
Results and Conclusions: The newly developed derivative of raloxifene, LY-117018 HCl, offsets the reduction in bone mineral density and the accompanying increase in bone remodeling markers observed in oophorectomized rats compared with control animals. 17α-Ethinyl estradiol also prevents the loss of bone mass atrributed to oophorectomy, but this is accompanied by an increase in body mass and a greater increase in uterus weight than that observed after treatment with LY-117018 HCl.

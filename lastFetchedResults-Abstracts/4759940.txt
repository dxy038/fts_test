The author addresses the application of fuzzy logic for control of a hypervelocity interceptor when the airframe is undergoing large aerodynamic parameter variations. The primary objective of the controller development was to determine the adequacy of a single fuzzy controller design throughout the entire flight regime of a hypervelocity interceptor. The flight encompasses a wide range of altitudes, angles-of-attack, and velocities, resulting in large variations in the aerodynamic parameters. Because of these large variations, the fuzzy controller must contain enough robustness to overcome these aerodynamic uncertainties. A description of a pitch plane autopilot design for a hypervelocity interceptor is given. It is shown that the fuzzy logic controller provides a tremendous amount of robustness to aerodynamic variations

A new field goniometer system (FIGOS) is introduced that allows in situ measurements of hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance data under natural illumination conditions. Hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data sets taken with FIGOS nominally cover the spectral range between 300 and 2450 nm in 704 bands. Typical targets are small-growing, dense, and homogeneous vegetation canopies, man-made surfaces, and soils. Field BRDF data of a perennial ryegrass surface reveal a strong spectral variability. In the blue and red chlorophyll absorption bands, BRDF effects are strong. Less-pronounced bidirectional reflectance effects are observed in the green and in most of the near-infrared range there surface reflectance is high. An anisotropy index (ANIX), defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum bidirectional reflectance over the hemisphere, is introduced as a surrogate measurement for the extent of spectral BRDF effects. The ANIX data of the ryegrass surface show a very high correlation with nadir reflectance due to multiple scattering effects. Since canopy geometry, multiple scattering, and BRDF effects are related, these findings may help to derive canopy architecture parameters, such as leaf area index (LAI) or leaf angle distribution (LAD) from remotely sensed hyperspectral BRDF data. Furthermore, they show that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data are strongly biased by the spectral variability of BRDF effects

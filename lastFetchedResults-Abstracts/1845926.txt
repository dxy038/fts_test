The objective of our study was to test the hypothesis that subtle brain abnormality can be present in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) patients normal by conventional MR imaging (cMRI). We examined 50 SCD patients to identify those patients who were normal by cMRI. Quantitative MR imaging (qMRI) was then used to map spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) in a single slice in brain tissue of all 50 patients and in 52 healthy age-similar controls. We also used a radiofrequency (RF) pulse to saturate blood spins flowing into the T1 map slice, to characterize the effect of blood flow on brain T1. Abnormalities were noted by cMRI in 42% (21/50) of patients, with lacunae in 32%, and encephalo malacia in 20%. Brain T1 in patients normal by cMRI was significantly lower than controls, in caudate, thalamus, and cortex (p ≤ 0.007), and regression showed that gray matter T1 abnormality was present in caudate and cortex by age 4 (p ≤ 0.002). In patients abnormal by cMRI, T1 reductions in gray matter were larger and more significant. White matter T1 was not significantly increased except in patients abnormal by cMRI. RF saturation in a slab below the T1 map produced no significant change in T1, compared to RF saturation in a slab above the T1 map, suggesting that inflow of untipped spins in blood does not cause an artifactual shortening of T1. Gray matter T1 abnormality was present in patients normal by cMRI, while white matter T1 abnormality was present only in patients also abnormal by cMRI. These findings suggest that gray matter is selectively vulnerable to damage in pediatric SCD patients and that white matter damage occurs later in the disease process. Our inability to find an effect from saturation of inflowing blood implies that rapid perfusion cannot account for T1 reduction in gray matter.

One of the important challenges that still exist in Wireless Mesh Networks is the capacity reduction due to interference of wireless links. In order to improve throughput of wireless mesh networks each node is equipped with multiple interfaces and can use multiple channels simultaneously. Important issue in these networks is efficient channel assignment so that it minimizes interference. In this paper, we consider a static channel assignment in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks with the objective of minimizing overall interference. We present a genetic algorithm, tabu search algorithm and then based of them we propose hybrid algorithm to better solve the channel assignment problem. We evaluate the algorithms by graph theoretical metrics and ns-2 simulation. The simulation results reveal that our hybrid algorithm show better performance for increasing throughput compare with the other two algorithms.

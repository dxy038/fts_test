Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the patency of human umbilical arteries treated with polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) after rabbit implantation.
Background

The development of small-caliber vascular substitutes with high patency after implantation remains a real challenge for vascular tissue engineering.
Methods

Cryopreserved human umbilical arteries were enzymatically de-endothelialized and the luminal surfaces were coated with poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) multilayers. The PEM-untreated arteries and PEM-treated rabbit carotids were used as graft control. The native rabbit carotids were bypassed by grafts.
Results

The Doppler ultrasound evaluation, performed in vivo, showed that all PEM-treated grafts remained patent during the full experimental period, whereas after only 1 week, no blood circulation was detected in untreated arteries. Scanning electron microscopy and histological graft examination showed pervasive thrombus formation on the luminal surface of untreated arteries after 1 week and clean luminal surface for treated arteries for at least up to 12 weeks. The arterial wall cells were identified through alpha-smooth muscle actin αυδ platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. The smooth muscle cells positive to alpha-smooth muscle actin were identified in adventitia and media and the endothelial cells positive to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule in intima. Von Kossa reaction didn't reveal any calcium salt deposits on the wall arteries, suggesting a good wall remodelling with no sign of graft rejection.
Conclusions

The in vivo evaluation of human umbilical arteries treated with PSS/PAH multilayers demonstrated a high graft patency after 3 months of implantation. Such modified arteries could constitute a useful option for small vascular replacement.

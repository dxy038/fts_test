A comparison between the algorithm for Land Aerosol property and Bidirectional reflectance Inversion by Time Series technique (LABITS) and a daily estimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) algorithm (AERUS-GEO) over land surface using MSG/SEVIRI data over North Africa is presented. To obtain indications about the quantitative performance of two AOD retrieval methods mentioned above, daily SEVIRI AOD values is considered with respect to those measured from the global aerosol-monitoring Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. The correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between retrieved SEVIRI AOD at 650 nm from the AERUS-GEO algorithm and the AERONET Level 2.0 daily average AOD at 675 nm is 0.80 and root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.044, and R<sup>2</sup> between retrieved AOD from the LABITS algorithm and AERONET AOD is 0.80 and RMSE is 0.037.

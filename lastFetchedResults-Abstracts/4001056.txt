The paper considers the cinematograph camera and assesses its inherent limitations. The advantages of multiple-camera working are discussed, with special reference to the electronic camera; the recording of an electronic image is shown to be the culminating development. The paper discusses picture quality, contrast range and tonal fidelity, and the objective and subjective evaluation of definition. The reconciliation of the electronic and photographic viewpoints is shown to be possible, and the standards of the motion-picture and television industries are compared. The paper concludes with a survey of the performance requirements of the electronic camera, the mechanics of motion-picture recording of electronic images and factors governing the choice of film stock.

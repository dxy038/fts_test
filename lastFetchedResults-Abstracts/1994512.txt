As a giant deceased philosopher of religion whose second anniversary of death is to be held accedingly, John Hick is renownedly celebrated for his endeavors to explain religious plurality and diversity. He up front strives to set forth an explanatory hypothesis that can portray the best explanation of this pluralism in the real world, adopting miscellaneous philo-epistemological elements. Hick, although having approved ontologically of the being of the ultimate reality of truth independent of mind and language(in a framework belonging to critical realism), does not maintain that realism possesses only an ontological nature but it also has epistemo-semantic dimensions. With this in mind, it is safe to say that there is a far long way for him to traverse. Analyzing his pluralistic standpoint in explaining religious experience and its related epistemology, the author’s main objective is to shed light upon the fact that he yields some kind of ontological anti-realism while adopting Fregean-Russelian descriptive theory of reference. In this regard, the author calls into question the reference theory and the possibility of being bound over these consequences from Hick’s viewpoint, pointing to his stipulated and implied pre-suppositions. The question to reaise is whether or not the theory of reference, adopted by Hick concerning religious reality, leads him to a view compatible with his realistic standpoint.

We analyzed the high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent patients. The predominant manifestations were multiple nodules (n=6) and a single nodule (n=7). Regarding the pattern of multiple nodules, two cases of cavities or necrosis, four cases of surrounding centrilobular micronodules and five cases of “acinar” nodules were seen. No “tree-in-bud” appearance was detected. Five of seven cases of a single nodule were classified as polygonal, and two of them were round. Two cases accompanied micronodules and one case cavitation. Although no “tree-in-bud” appearance was observed, pulmonary cryptococcosis mimics tuberculosis.

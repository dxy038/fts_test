Abstract-Objective: To analyze the biomechanical influences on cervical vertebra after the removal of nucleus going with the cervical disc degradation, and to inspect the immediate stability and bone fusion rate with artificial double Cage fusion setting into intervertebral disc.Methods: to establish precisely with CAE method four finite element models as followed: C3-6 normal height disc model, C4-5 height decreased disc model, C5-6 height decreased disc model, C4-5&amp;C5-6 height decreased disc model.With these models,we can examine the biomechanical parameters of decreased disc models and Cage fusion model in anterior bent, posterior extent, lateral bent, axial rotary state.Results: To a great extent,the applications of double Cage fusion debases the s C4, C5 &amp;C6 vertebral body maximum Von Mises stress which is close to the stress values in C3-6 normal height disc model.Conclusion: Double Cage fusion has good mechanical strength to rebuild the stability of the cervical spine, and can meet the needs of clinical cervical interbody fusion requirements.

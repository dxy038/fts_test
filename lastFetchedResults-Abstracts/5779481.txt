Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are resource constrained systems that needs efficient utilization of all resources. Clustering is well known technique for achieving high scalability and efficient resource allocation in WSN. One of the fundamental issues in cluster based networks is to determine the optimal number of clusters with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption. Considering its importance, a Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering approach is proposed to determine the optimal number of clusters in WSN. The study considers the deployment of 100 nodes in 100&#215;100 m<sup>2</sup> area for random uniform distribution. The optimal number of clusters determined by FCM has been compared with those obtained by analytical method. Study on lifetime of wireless sensor networks is also presented with optimal clusters in network.

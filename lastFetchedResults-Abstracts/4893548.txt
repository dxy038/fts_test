At present, vehicle to grid (V2G) technology has been received widely attention since a large amount of electric vehicles entering into the market gradually. The electric vehicle (EV) as a specific electricity load, can be used as a mobile storage device to participate load adjusting in the power grid and to provide platform for the renewable energy sources coordination. The management strategies for V2G and the involved key issues are analyzed in details, such as battery weary, bidirectional charger and charging stations via the centralized control, autonomous control and battery management strategies. Besides, the economic benefits from both the power grid &amp; EV owners and research development directions are discussed in the paper.

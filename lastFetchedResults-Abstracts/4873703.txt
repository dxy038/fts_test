The objective of the paper is to experimentally evaluate the field uniformity of the electromagnetic environment within a mini-reverberation chamber made of aluminum material and with two orthogonal and mechanical stirrers. The frequency spectrum of interest is between 8 GHz and 10 GHz in the step of 0.1 GHz. Sixty stirrer steps are made at each frequency within a complete stirrer rotation. A small dual-ridge horn antenna, designed at 8-10 GHz, is used as the transmit antenna, while another identical dual-ridge horn antenna is applied as the receive antenna to make field strength measurements continuously. The electric field strengths are measured at nine different locations within the chamber. The measured results suggest that the field uniformity of this mini-reverberation chamber is excellent by employing the proposal of the IEC 61000-4-21.

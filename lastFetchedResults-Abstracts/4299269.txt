This paper provides an overview of the work that Newark College of Engineering (NCE), USA, has achieved towards its goal of a comprehensive assessment process. The scope of assessment is defined and the five steps to implement a comprehensive assessment program are described in some detail. Future plans are to continue to define outcomes, objectives and performance criteria for all courses within the NCE engineering curricula. A key objective of their efforts is to create fully automated assessment tools that eventually will be distributed over networks for administrative ease. Finally, it is the teamÂ´s intention to continue to create a comprehensive system that will provide feedback to students, faculty and administrators in order to support continuous improvement initiatives on the part of all concerned

This paper presents a multi-objective algorithm for on-line adaptation of a multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) receiver. A specially tailored genetic algorithm (GA) is developed in order to adapt the complete receiver while dynamically optimizing the critical fast Fourier transform (FFT) section of the receiver for both error value and power consumption. The results obtained, through evaluation within complete receiver architecture, demonstrate that the algorithm can find results optimized for both objectives. Results also show that there are significant reductions in error value and power consumption as compared to the reference solution

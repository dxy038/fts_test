Image segmentation refers to a process by which a raw input image is partitioned into non-overlapping regions such that each region is homogenous and connected, and the union of no two spatially adjacent regions is homogeneous. The objective of segmentation is to simplify and change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. This paper reviews the modified segmentation method for color images based on CIELAB Color Space and Edge detection of color images using the various edge detectors. This work aims to identify/segment different colors in an image by analyzing the CIELAB color space which enables to quantify these visual differences. This proposed method has been tested with images of various formats, size and resolution and the results are proven to be better.

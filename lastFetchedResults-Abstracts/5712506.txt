The primary objective of this paper is to review several results available in the statistical literature pertaining to the problem of hierarchical estimation. Some relevant extensions are derived for the problem of reconstructing the globally optimal estimate based on local estimates transmitted by feeder nodes. Their utilisty is next demonstrated with characterizations and examples pertaining to common scenarios in decentralized estimation problems.

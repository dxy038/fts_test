Objective(s)
The fractions of Candida albicans have been used as an immunomodulator. The present work assessed the effect of different fractions of C. albicans on nitric oxide (NO) production by mice peritoneal macrophages. 
Materials and Methods
Cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of C. albicans ATCC 10321 strain were extracted. Mice peritoneal macrophages were purified and cultured. Different concentrations of both fractions and also killed C. albicans cells were used for macrophages stimulation and evaluation of NO production. NO amount was detected in culture supernatants of macrophages by Griess reagent. Also, MTT assay was performed to assess the viability of macrophages.
Results
The results elucidated that suppressive effect of cell wall proteins on NO release was significant at the dose of 100 ?g/ml (P=0.01), while cytoplasmic fraction increased NO amount at the dose of 1 ?g/ml compared to the control group (P=0.003). Augmentation of NO production was statistically significant at 200 killed C. albicans per well (P=0.006).
Conclusion
According to our findings, cytoplasmic fractions and killed C. albicans have a positive effect on NO production by peritoneal macrophages, while cell wall fractions did not. Therefore, it is proposed that C. albicans fractions can be studied more as inflammation modulators.

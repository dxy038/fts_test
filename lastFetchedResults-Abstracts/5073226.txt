In this paper, a multi-layer fuzzy logic controller (MLFC) is proposed for the transient stability enhancement of the electric power system making use of a dynamic braking strategy. The proposed controller has two layers: the first layer termed the supervisory layer specifies the region of operation of the sub-controllers within the second layer called the execution layer. The outputs of the sub-controllers are then fuzzily combined to achieve the overall objective of the system. The MLFC was found to be very robust to any changes in the network configuration. The scheme was tested on a nine bus system with three generators and three loads and also on the IEEE four generator test system. The simulation results provided shows the effectiveness of the MLFC and thus the proposed fuzzy strategy provides a simple and effective method of transient stability enhancement.

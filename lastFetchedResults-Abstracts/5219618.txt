In this paper we present a resource-adaptive framework for real-time vision-aided inertial navigation. Specifically, we focus on the problem of visual-inertial odometry (VIO), in which the objective is to track the motion of a mobile platform in an unknown environment. Our primary interest is navigation using miniature devices with limited computational resources, similar for example to a mobile phone. Our proposed estimation framework consists of two main components: (i) a hybrid EKF estimator that integrates two algorithms with complementary computational characteristics, namely a sliding-window EKF and EKF-based SLAM, and (ii) an adaptive image-processing module that adjusts the number of detected image features based oadaptive image-processing module that adjusts the number of detected image features based on the availability of resources. By combining the hybrid EKF estimator, which optimally utilizes the feature measurements, with the adaptive image-processing algorithm, the proposed estimation architecture fully utilizes the system´s computational resources. We present experimental results showing that the proposed estimation framework isn the availability of resources.

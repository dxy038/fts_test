With the great development of renewable energy, the integration of large-scale wind power has been the focus of many recent studies. As the randomness and uncertainty, it is of great challenge to make suitable power generation plans to ensure the safety and stability of current grid. The objective of the presented paper is to propose a new approach to smooth the output of wind power. We flat the fluctuation of wind, and solve the optimal problem through an improved PSO algorithm. Finally, the result shows the optimal generation plan with the pumped storage stations. Through the data we worked out, it can be easily found that the cost of thermal unit significantly was reduced with pumped storage station and the frequency of start and stop was also reduced. The result shows the method in this thesis is reasonable.

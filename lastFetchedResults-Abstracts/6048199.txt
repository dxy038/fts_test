Advanced control is the most efficient technology available to achieve the objective of any industrial process, namely the reduction of variable costs while maintaining product quality. Some advanced control methods are: model based predictive control, internal model control, adaptive control, fuzzy control, robust control, neural network based control and optimal control. One advanced control method that is successfully used in industrial control applications is Model Based Predictive Control (MBPC). This paper presents a control application using this advanced control technique for controlling a binary distillation column.

Introduction & Objective: Teaching human anatomy, at any level, relies not only on the expertise of a tutor but also on the availability and use of good teaching aids. Plastination specimens have a unique position as a teaching aid to exhibit accurate anatomical structures and are easy to be stored and handled by students. The aim of this study was to assess the comparative use of polyester resin instead of silicon in S10 technique of plastination.
Materials & Methods: This is an applied experimental study which  was performed on a human body after fixation of the cadaver The polymer was prepared by mixing glycerin and polyester resin and the cobalt (accelerator) and peroxide (hardening material) were  added to it. Dissection, dehydration, defatization and impregnation of the body were carried out. Finally, the palatinate of specimen was compared with the palatinate of Heidelberg university (standard group). The collected data were analyzed by SPSS software using paired T-test.
Results: The prepared palatinate specimen was dry, nontoxic and without noxious fumes and showed a normal anatomical position of structure. Flexibility, elasticity and traction were compared with those of standard specimen and no significant differences were observed. Injected colored polymers in vessels were detected easily.
Conclusion: According to this study, the palatinate specimen prepared by polyester resin polymer provided an excellent opportunity to demonstrate and study the dissected areas of the difficult structures which can be of great benefit in teaching gross anatomy. In addition, because of the durability, safety, reduction in toxic and noxious fumes of formalin, the palatinate specimens can be unique materials as a teaching aid along with the Wet specimens.

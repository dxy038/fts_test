This paper presents the solution of security constrained economic emission dispatch in power systems using a stochastic search technique termed as SEEDSS. SEEDSS is a truly multi-objective technique that minimizes cost of generation, emission of hazardous gases and maximizes the security margin simultaneously. Various solutions provided by SEEDSS in a single run include those with minimum values of each objective, the best compromise between them as well as the Pareto-optimal set of solutions reflecting the trade-off information among the objectives. Test results on an IEEE 30 bus system and IEEE 118 bus system are presented

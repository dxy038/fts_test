This is the 21st century, and things are different. Today, the primary delivery model and copy of record for IEEE publications are electronic. The end product of the publication process is a digital version of the original manuscript that is fully text searchable, with embedded hyperlinks allowing readers to jump to the references cited in the text, all linked together by means of unique digital objective identifiers (DOIs). Now, it is also possible to embed applications with published manuscripts; for example, it is possible to include videos or even analytical simulations as part of the record manuscript.

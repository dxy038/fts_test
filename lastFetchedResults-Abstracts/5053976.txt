To equilibrate the physical material in the process of inventory and transportation in supply chain operation, and to make them optimize, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed by using fuzzy mathematics, in which transportation and inventory are considered together. Through analyzing, the results are shown that the total cost of transportation can be saved effectively and the multi-objective optimization model is feasible.

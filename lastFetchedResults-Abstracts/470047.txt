Objective
Occlusion of the omphalomesenteric artery in utero, leading to disruption of the umbilical ring with subsequent herniation of intestines, has been proposed as the mechanism by which gastroschisis occurs. We hypothesized that affected fetuses have a predisposition to arterial or venous thromboembolism.
Study design
Thirty-one children born with gastroschisis were tested for Factor V Leiden, prothrombin, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutations. Fifty-two appropriately grown term neonates whose mothers were matched by maternal age and race served as control neonates.
Results
Of children with gastroschisis, 6.45% were heterozygous for Factor V Leiden. No infants with gastroschisis had prothrombin gene mutations. Thirty-six percent of affected infants were heterozygous, and 16% were homozygosity for MTHFR. Among control infants, 42% were heterozygous, and 14% were homozygous for MTHFR.
Conclusion
The mutation rate for MTHFR did not differ in children with and without gastroschisis when mothers were matched by race and age.

A pair of characteristic spectra, IEm and IEx, were extracted from 3D fluorescence contour plot by the statistical image information method. ItÂ´s found that these characteristic spectra contain rich information, such as the peak positions and peak relative intensities. And the fluorescence properties of the substance could be described by these characteristic spectra. The data were objective and computable. The combination of pattern recognition technology with the characteristic spectra could apply in the classification and identification of the fluorescence substances. The method of extracting characteristic spectra from fluorescence contour plot is as follows: the pixel points of contour plot which were produced from the direction of excitation wavelengths, was counted from 200 to 800 nm at intervals of 1nm along the direction of emission wavelengths, According to the statistical result, the characteristic spectrum of IEm can be obtained. Adopting the similar approach, the pixel points of contour plot which were produced from the direction of emission wavelengths, was counted from 200 to 800 nm at interval of 1nm along the directions of excitation wavelengths. We can also obtain the characteristic spectrum of IEx. Based on the characteristic spectra, IEm and IEx, 41 different batches in five Chinese traditional medicine injections were identified by the plane distance cluster analysis, and the results were correct.

Delay tolerant networks (DTNs) have been widely used in the world. There isnÂ´t stable end-to-end path in DTNs. The major objective is how to improve the possibility of finding a path from source to destination under limited conditions. In this paper, we proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) location-based energy aware routing protocol that uses 3D location information to conduct routing of the real 3D DTNs. The key insight is that make use of the location information can reduce the overhead of DTNs. Then introduced an energy-awareness scheme to extend the network lifetime. We implemented 3DLEAR, Epidemic and PREP to compare their performance with different network environments. Simulation results show that 3DLEAR outperform other two protocols in delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. Additionally, we evaluated the improvement of the energy-awareness scheme on the network lifetime.

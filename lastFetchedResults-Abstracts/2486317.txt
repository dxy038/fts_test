<p><strong>Background:</strong> Bromeliads can be epiphytic, terrestrial or saxicolous and use strategies to allow water to be re­tained in their leaf axils, where various arthropods can be found. These include mosquitoes, whose larvae are the most abundant and commonly found organisms in the leaf axils. The objective of this study was to look for im­mature forms of mosquitoes (the larval and pupal stages) in bromeliads in municipal parks in São Paulo and to discuss the ecological and epidemiological importance of these insects.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> From October 2010 to July 2013, immature mosquitoes were collected from bromeliads in 65 munici­pal parks in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, using suction samplers. The immature forms were maintained until adult forms emerged, and these were then identified morphologically.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Two thousand forty-two immature-stage specimens belonging to the genera <em>Aedes</em>, <em>Culex</em>, <em>Trichoprosopon</em>, <em>Toxorhynchites</em>, <em>Limatus</em> and <em>Wyeomyia</em> were found in bromeliads in 15 of the 65 parks visited. <em>Aedes</em><em> albopictus</em> was the most abundant species (660 specimens collected), followed by <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em> (548 specimens) and <em>Cx. </em>(<em>Microculex</em>)<em> imitator</em> (444). The taxa with the most widespread distribution were <em>Ae. aegypti</em> and <em>Toxorhynchites</em> spp, followed by <em>Ae. albopictus</em> and <em>Cx. quinquefasciatus</em>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Bromeliads in urban parks are refuges for populations of native species of Culicidae and breeding sites for exotic species that are generally of epidemiological interest. Hence, administrators and surveillance and mosquito-control agencies must constantly monitor these microenvironments as the presence of these species endangers the health of park users and employees as well as people living near the parks.</p><p> </p>

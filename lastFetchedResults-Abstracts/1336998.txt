The objective of this study was to describe the histopathologic changes observed in extrapituitary organs as well as the pituitary glands of horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). Adrenal gland, thyroid gland, liver, lung, kidney, heart, and pituitary gland from 32 horses with clinical and histologic evidence of PPID and 20 control horses were reviewed histologically. Ten of the control horses were aged animals (â‰¥15 years), allowing those changes attributed to age to be identified. In addition to previously reported changes in adrenal gland and liver, an association was established between PPID and several extrapituitary histopathologic changes, namely bronchiolitis, proliferative glomerulopathy, and myocardial lipofuscinosis and fibrosis. The potential biologic significance of these changes is discussed and, although the retrospective design of the current study precludes establishment of causal relationships between the observed extrapituitary changes and PPID, these findings suggest that further investigations are warranted.

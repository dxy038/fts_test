This paper proposes a methodology for the development of automatic scheduling techniques, for preventive maintenance of generating units and lines, in a competitive electric energy environment, with the inclusion of transmission constraints and forced outage rates, over a specified operational period. For generator maintenance the objective of the ISO is to maintain adequate level of reliability throughout the operational period (for which Bender´s decomposition technique is used) and the objective of the GENCO is to maximize profit or to minimize loss in profit (for which transmission constrained price based unit commitment, TCPBUC, based on Lagrangian relaxation method is used). For line maintenance minimum cost model bender´s technique with adequate level of reliability is used. A coordinating technique using penalty factors is incorporated to converge the conflicting objectives. The transmission constraints are modeled using DC sensitivity factors. Case study with a 6 bus, 3 generator, 11 line system is presented and discussed

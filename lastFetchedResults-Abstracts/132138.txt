BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vitamin C is constituent with antioxidant power, it was reported that increasing oxidative stress in diabetic mellitus associated with decreasing in collagen synthesis. This study was performed on the possible effect of dietary vitamin C supplementation on wound healing in chronic diabetic rats.
METHODS: This study was performed on 160 male rats. Diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin (S.C, 50mg/kg). Animals were divided into 4 groups and then rats were remained diabetic for 8 weeks. Control group (I) received the vitamin C deficient diet. Prophylaxis group (II), received 250mg/kg vitamin C which was added to their drinking water, one month before induction of diabetes. Treatment group (III), received vitamin C (250mg/kg) one month after induction of diabetes. Combination group (IV) received the vitamin C one month before diabetes induction until wound healing. Wound was made on animals by a circular 3cm2 full thickness incision on back, 8 weeks after diabetic induction. Surface density of blood vessels and epidermal layer, content of collagen and biochemical measurement of hydroxyproline at days 1, 3, 7, II, 15 and 20 after operation were measured.
FINDINGS: The mean of surface density of blood vessels and epidermal layers of group II up to day 7 was more than all groups. Also, these mentioned indicators; in group I were more than groups 11I and IV during all days. The mean of collagen and hydroxyproline content in group I was more than all examined groups at days of 11. The result of group III was less than group IV during all days.
CONCLUSION: This data suggest that, vitamin C supplementation as prophylaxia or combination in rats with chronic diabetic could impair wound healing.

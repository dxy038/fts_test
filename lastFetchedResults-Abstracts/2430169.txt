A multiscale fatigue crack growth model is proposed to analyze the thermal–mechanical effects in materials under the non-additive effects of creep and cyclic loading. On the basis of the design criterion for aircrafts, the thermal–mechanical creep and fracture crack growth of a near-alpha titanium alloy TA12 are investigated. Influences of temperature profiles and perturbation number η are also discussed. This fracture control approach offers a reference in the life design of airplanes. The objective of this research is to provide an inverse approach on health monitoring of crack growth in fracture control from the perspective of multiscaling.

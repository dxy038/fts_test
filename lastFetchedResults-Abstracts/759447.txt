This study examined the bidirectional relationship
between parent and teacher reported conduct problems
in youth and parenting practices using a longitudinal
sample of boys assessed from 6 to 16 years of age.
Analyses tested whether these bidirectional associations
changed across development and whether the nature of
these associations varied across African-American and
Caucasian families. Overall, the results supported a bidirectional
relationship between conduct problems and all
parenting practices examined from childhood to adolescence.
The influence of conduct problems on changes in
parenting behaviors was as strong as the influence of
parenting behaviors on changes in conduct problems across
development. Changes in the bidirectional relationship
across development were found in some, but not all,
models. While corporal punishment was more strongly
related to changes in teacher-reported conduct problems for
African-American boys compared to Caucasian boys, more
similarities than differences were found between the ethnic
groups in terms of the bidirectional associations examine

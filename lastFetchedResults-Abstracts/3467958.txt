Cobalt dot arrays are fabricated by Ga<sup>+</sup> ion beam induced chemical vapor deposition (IBICVD) with an objective to explore size limitations. Dots of about 100-150 nm in diameter are obtained as flat islands. Characterization by means of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) show the deposited structures exhibiting ferromagnetic properties.

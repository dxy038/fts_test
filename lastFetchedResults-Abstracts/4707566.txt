It is formulated as a large-scale, complex, the misalignment discrete variable and the multi-restraint multi-objective mathematical optimization problems. For the purpose to take into account both economy and reliability of distribution network planning, this paper uses investment cost, loss of network and reliability and so on as multi-objective functions to establish mathematics model. It is proposed that the smallest investment, the smallest loss and the least SAIDI as mathematics model. That uses the rough set method to determine the link between the objective functions and uses the fuzzy optimized algorithm to obtain the relative important weighting factors attribute to various objectives. And then the pursuit of multi-objective optimization transforms to seek the optimal level of satisfaction of the overall goals. The improvement of PSO algorithm and the Powell optimization algorithm are used to optimize distribution network planning. The example shows that the method is feasible and effective.

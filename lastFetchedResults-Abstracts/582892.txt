Objectives: Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are associated
with health and the disease status. The objective of the present study
was to investigate the association among white blood cell (WBC) counts,
neutrophil counts as a WBC subpopulation, and diacron reactive oxygen
metabolites (d-ROMs) levels in an asymptomatic population.
Methods: The clinical data, including general cardiovascular risk variables
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were collected from 100
female subjects (mean age, 62 years) in outpatient clinics. The correlation
of the d-ROMs with hs-CRP, WBC, and neutrophil counts was examined.
Results: The mean/median levels were WBC counts 5.9 × 109/L,
neutrophil counts 3.6 × 109/L, hs-CRP 0.06 mg/dL, and d-ROMs 359
CURR U. A simple correlation analysis showed a significant positive
correlation of the d-ROMs with the WBC counts, neutrophil counts,
or hs-CRP levels. The correlation between d-ROMs and neutrophil
counts (B = 0.22, P  <  0.05), as well as that between d-ROMs and hs-
CRP (B = 0.28, P  <  0.01), remained significant and independent in a
multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for other variables. A multiple
linear regression analysis showed that WBC counts had only a positive
correlation tendency to the d-ROMs.
Conclusions: Neutrophils may be slightly but more involved in
the oxidative stress status, as assessed by d-ROMs, in comparison to
the overall WBC. Further studies are needed to clarify the biologic
mechanism(s) of the observed relationship.

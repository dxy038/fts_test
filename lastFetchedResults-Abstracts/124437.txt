Background : Neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia Neonatarum) continues to cause blindness due to the unusefuiness of agents used prophylactically in preventing this condition. Prepared povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution is an effective antibacterial and antiviral agent. Objective : To evaluate and compare betadine solution I% and erythromycin ointment 0.5% in prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatarum.
Methods : Through a masked and prospective clinical trail , 300 infants born in Shahid Khani hospital of Kashan were studied. About 30 minutes after birth , 100 newborns received betadine solution I% (group I) , 100 newborns received 1 cm erythromycin eye ointment 0.5% (group II) and 100 newborns received no treatment (group III). All neonates were followed up for one month.
Findings : Rate of neonatal conjunctivitis was 9% , 12% and 34% in group I , II , III respectively (P<0.0001). No ocular side-effect of medications was seen in groups I and II. Conclusion : Ophthalmic solution of betadine (1%) as a prophylaxis against ophtalmic neonatarum is more effective than treatment with erythromycin ointment 0.5% or without treatment. Additionally , it has wider spectrum and less cost and no or minimal ocular toxicity.

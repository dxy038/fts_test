During the period 28 June-1 July 1999, The MITRE Corporation conducted a demonstration of a VHF data link system using a text message sent to participating Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS)-equipped aircraft over the VHF frequency 131.55. Two demonstration systems were deployed in Taiwan ROC: one at CKS International Airport and one at Kaohsiung International Airport. This experimental data link capability was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of a digital data link system using equipment already used for airline business operations. Consequently, the airlines did not have to add any special avionics equipment in order to receive the data link message. For this demonstration, the data link text was a digital Automated Terminal Information Service (DATIS) message that was uplinked to participating aircraft. While DATIS itself is not a new capability, the objective of the demonstration was to show how a simple controller-pilot communication could be performed with a VHF data link

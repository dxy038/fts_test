This paper presents a new approach for trajectory planning of manipulator robots based on Virtual Potential Field (VPF) in presence of static obstacles. In this method, a series of via points between starting point and goal point is obtained by traverse end- effector of manipulator in affected by different VPF while avoiding obstacles in the Cartesian space. An optimum trajectory is generated by using pattern search algorithm which determines strength of potential fields to minimize the value of desired objective function. Cubic splines are used to generate a smooth trajectory through path points in joint space that are obtained by inverse kinematics solution of corresponding points in the task space. The effectiveness of this method is shown by simulation studies.

The objective of this paper is to provide an assessment of the advantages that cell breathing may give in optimal management of CDMA network capacity. The paper studies the capabilities of cell breathing and is primarily intended to determine whether there are any deployment and/or traffic scenarios where the breathing algorithm can be used to improve capacity in high traffic cells by redirecting mobiles to surrounding cells

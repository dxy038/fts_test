Objectives Parkinsonâ€™s disease is one of the most common nervous system disorders which may result inarticulatory problems and consequently decrease in speech intelligibility. The reduction in the rate and therange of the articulators are main problems observed in patients with Juvenile Parkinson Disease (JPD). Suchdisorders may cause disturbances in the exact articulation of consonants and vowels. Changes in formantstructures, in terms of time and frequency, are suitable tools to present the dynamicity of the articulatory system,especially tongue. Therefore, articulatory movements of patients with JPD can be analyzed and investigatedthrough this way. The Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) is an intensive behavioral voice treatment whichhas been designed exclusively for patients with JPD. The objective of the present study was to investigate theeffect of voice treatment on improving articulatory skills and the effect of improving articulatory skills onspeech intelligibility in a patient with JPD. Methods and Materials The patient was a 35 year old male, who was suffering from JPD which his speechwas declined in intelligibility. An acoustic assessment and speech intelligibility tests before and after thetreatment were conducted. Intensive voice therapy program includes 16 one-hour individual sessions, basedon the principles of LSVT. Results Post-intervention, a significant increase in the voice intensity loudness, the duration of F2 formanttransition and the patient`s speech intelligibly were observed. Conclusion The effect of intensive voice treatment based on the LSVT principles are beyond the vocalintensity. Patients with JPD may receive benefits in their voice quality, articulation and speech intelligibility.

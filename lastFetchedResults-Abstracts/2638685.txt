Changes in the health, or condition, of a machine often produce changes in the machineâ€™s vibration. Even a perfectly healthy machine produces some degree of vibration, as it is virtually impossible to have perfect balance and alignment. Additionally, the machine itself may produce vibration as part of its process or work. Condition monitoring monitors for a change in the vibration that a machine normally produces Vibration analysis is the main conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis This technique has its unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When this technique is conducted independently, only a portion of machine faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that this technique in a machine condition monitoring
program provides useful reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry The objective of this research was investigated the correlation between vibration analysis and fault diagnosis of electromotor and was distinguished unbalancing of that. This was achieved by vibration analysis of an electromotor in Mahshahr Silo. The vibration analysis was initially run under regular interval during machine life Then a series of tests were conducted under the operating hours of machine. Vibration data was regularly collected. Overall vibration data was produced by vibration analysis was compared with previous data, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the results of vibration condition monitoring technique. Numerical data produced by vibration analysis was compared with vibration spectra in standard condition of healthy machine, in order to
quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results of this paper were given us more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing electromotor faults.

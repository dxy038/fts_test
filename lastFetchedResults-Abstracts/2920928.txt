The many different types of polymeric insulated medium voltage cables on the market today have very different properties as regards handleability. Some designs are very easy to handle in laying and installation operations. Others are very rigid and elastic and thus tempt to rough handling. The objective of carrying out the work described by the author is the development of a measuring method for the evaluation of properties of the individual cable designs in respect of handleability to enable selection of the optimal type of cable for any purpose

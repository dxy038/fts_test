The objective of this paper is to understand the airborne gravimetry´s error model which derived from its measuring principle. Based on the error model, some according performances of accelerometers which can satisfy the requirement of airborne gravimetry were discussed, including the needed precision and repeatability of quartz flexible accelerometer´s bias, scale factor and positioning accuracy. To make sure that the accelerometers can meet the challenge, precise temperature control method was needed. So the needed class of temperature control precision was also discussed here. Finally a two-stage temperature control model was introduced, which can achieve a precision of plusmn0.02degC.

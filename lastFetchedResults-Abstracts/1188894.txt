The polyester polyurethanes, PU based on isophoronediisocyanate, polycaprolactone, and 1,4-butanediol with different amounts of functional groups introduced into the hard segments via second chain extender, 2,2′-bis-(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid, were investigated by electron spin resonance, ESR, spin label method, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, WAXD, optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, DSC. The objective of this study is to clarify the effect of functional groups on the motional heterogeneity, microphase separation and crystallisation of the polyurethanes. The concentration of carboxylic groups varied from 0 to 0.45 mmol g−1. The temperature-dependent ESR spectra of spin labelled PU hard segments chain ends with stable nitroxide radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidin-1-yloxyl are sensitive to the amount of functional groups attached to the hard segments. Composite ESR spectra of functionalized PU, with fast and slow component, suggest that PU hard segments are partitioned in two motionally different environments. According to the ratio of fast and slow component motional heterogeneity increases with an increase of functional groups up to 0.35 mmol g−1 and above this concentration slow component decreases indicating higher degree of phase mixing and stronger effect of soft segments. Polarized micrographs and the extent of ordering from WAXD measurements reveal the changes of phase morphology with the carboxylic groups content in a similar way as shown from the motional behaviour of spin label on the segmental level. The degree of crystallinity and the separation of spherulitic rings are decreasing above a certain concentration of functional groups. The effect of functional groups in PU on the hard and soft segment mixing is discussed in terms of additional noncovalent interactions and chain structure which at critical level of interactions lead to a formation of more open hard segment structure accessible to interaction with the soft segment.

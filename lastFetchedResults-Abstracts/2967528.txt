Spare parts control and inventory planning for Boeing commercial aircraft is a large, complex, and mostly automated process. Management inventory policies are exercised through a set of control parameters that are programmed to generate inventory plans for a significant percentage of stocked parts. These control parameters directly impact customer service performance and inventory investment. Effects of parameter changes are difficult to predict due to the nature and number of control parameters. This paper describes the situation and presents a simulation prototype as a tool to determine how control parameters affect inventory, performance, and time needed until effects are realized. The simulation predicts the effects of decisions (implemented through parameter changes) on performance, including service to airlines, inventory levels, and operating costs. Essential to achieving our objective was the interoperability of several unique software programs.

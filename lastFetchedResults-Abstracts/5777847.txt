In view of the shortcomings of traditional multi-objective optimal methods, this paper introduces iSIGHT which is a kind of optimal design software. Based on optimal design framework Isight, the multi-objective optimal design method and step using the Neighborhood Cultivation Genetic Algorithm (NCGA) are investigated. Taking a multi-objective optimal design of spring as the example, the Pareto optimal sets are obtained, and then design maker can select a solution which suits the engineering best. The process and result verify the validity and feasibility of iSIGHT in solving multi-objective optimal design problems.

In this paper, a multi-objective programming model for optimizing the topology of a practical industrial network control systems is established on the basis of the analysis of IP packets through each link, and then solved by Genetic Algorithm(GA). To ensure the effectiveness of GA, this paper proposes an individual coding scheme and its valid criterion, designs a set of specific genetic operators based on Gene Ring operation, and modifies the default parameters of corresponding switches in the practical system through simulation and calculation. The results show that the model and the algorithm can effectively reduce the network load and optimize the topology without the necessity for changing in the links of the control system by adding cost.

This paper presents an index set to assess the status and ability of the smart-grid operation. In this paper, the &#8220;ability of multi-objective self-approximate-optimal operation&#8221; is considered as the most distinctive difference between smart grid and traditional power grid. Since the objectives of grid operation are to satisfy demands from electric system stakeholders, a multilevel set of the key smart-grid objectives is proposed with analysis and summary of these demands. Moreover, an index set that consists of a series of key indices for grid operation is identified around the objective system.

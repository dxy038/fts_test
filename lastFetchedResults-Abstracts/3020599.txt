The paper presents a method (named as the "Power" Concept) which quantifies the controlling &amp; management of the necessary but relentingly high Monitor Wafer usages in the Wafer Fab. The objective is effective &amp; prompt wafer usage reduction without losing the command and control of the wafers quantity &amp; quality. This approach establishes the understanding &amp; quantification on the impact of each well-intentioned input action taken. Quantifications are achieved by \´adding direction\´ to the Input Power(P), and thus riding and tapping on this Power(P) &amp; not be overwhelmed by the problems of uncontrolled Power(P). Quantifiable anticipated results are the characteristics of this approach.

A phenolâ€“formaldehyde (PF)-resin designed to penetrate wood and immobilize copper and boron in wood cells for protection against decay was investigated. The phenol portion of the PF-resin was partially substituted with pyrolysis oil derived from softwood bark. The objective was to reduce the environmental impact associated with the production of petroleum-borne phenol, as well as to improve the product economics. Leaching tests were conducted with three different formulas of resins containing 50%, 75% or 85% by weight of pyrolytic oil on a total phenol basis. The leachates were analyzed for the presence of copper by atomic absorption spectroscopy while inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy was used for boron detection. Copper leaching was reduced up to 18 times when comparing the treatments with and without the resin. Preservative leaching varied between wood species as well as between the resins containing different concentrations of pyrolytic oil. The organic leachates were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Trace amounts of organics, mostly acetic acid, were found in the leachates.

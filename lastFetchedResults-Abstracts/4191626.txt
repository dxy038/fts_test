The main objective of the US Reinventing Air Force Space Action Team was to define organizational responsibilities, programs, policies and funding profiles for providing an integrated, coherent program to solve the Air ForceÂ´s most pressing Space mission needs. US Space management and operations are optimized on Cold War imperatives and outdated technical and industrial paradigms. The resultant &#8220;overhead&#8221; is undermining our ability to invest in the future. External ad hocracies are running our business while we play catch up. Culture change is mandatory for the Air Force to accomplish its mission. The Reinventing Air Force Space Action Team identified over 550 issues (essential elements of the problems and essential elements of the solutions), aggregated them into 21 specific actions and recommendations, and evolved those into five &#8220;Centers of Gravity&#8221;, five Supporting Plans and six Supporting Recommendations

This paper presents an optimal power flow (OPF) formulation including a detailed representation of synchronous machines and their control systems. The representation is accomplished by the inclusion of the algebrized differential equations representing the generators and their controllers, at an equilibrium point, to the set of algebraic load flow equations of the conventional OPF. The computational framework is structured with advanced concepts of object oriented modeling (OOM) using the C++ language. Automatic differentiation techniques are applied allowing users to define objective functions and operational constraints. An interior point method is used to obtain numerical solutions of the associated optimization problem. Numerical results are presented for a 45-bus Southern Brazilian equivalent test system.

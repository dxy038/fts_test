Background and objective Matrix Metaloproteinases (MMPs) produced mainly by fibroblasts play a major role in wound healing processes. This study aimed to investigate the MMP2 activity in dermal fibroblasts found in chronic contact nickel dermatitis lesions. Methods In order to study the role of MMP2 in contact nickel dermatitis fibroblast from patients and healthy individuals were cultured based on ex-plantation of skin. MMP2 activity was measured in fibroblast culture media using zymoanalysis. Zymograms were then analyzed by quantitative densitometry. MTT assay was also used to evaluate and compare proliferation capacity of fibroblasts in both cell cultures. Results The mean MMP2 activity 6-8 days after ex-plantation was significantly higher in patients fibroblasts than in normal individuals( 170±9.2 and 134.3±5.9 in patients and normals respectively (p

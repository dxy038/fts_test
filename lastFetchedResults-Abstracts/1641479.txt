Granite stones processing industry from Tamilnadu state produces tons of non-biodegradable fine powder wastes and utilization of that hazardous waste in concrete production will lead to green environment and sustainable concrete technology. The main objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the suitability of granite powder (GP) waste as a substitute material for fine/natural aggregate in concrete production. The experimental parameter was percentage of granite powder substitution. Concrete mixtures were prepared by 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% of fine/natural aggregate substituted by GP waste. Various mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength; ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and elastic modulus were evaluated. To ensure the reliability of its usage in aggressive environments, the durability properties such as water permeability, rapid chloride penetration (RCPT), carbonation depth, sulphate resistance and electrical resistivity was also determined. The obtained test results were indicated that the replacement of natural sand by GP waste up to 15% of any formulation is favorable for the concrete making without adversely affecting the strength and durability criteria however it is recommended that the GP waste should be subjected to a chemical bleaching process prior to blend in the concrete to increase the sulphate resistance.

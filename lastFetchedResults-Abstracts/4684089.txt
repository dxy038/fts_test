The main objective of the paper is to study the recently proposed tensor product distributed compensation (TPDC) based design framework in the case of observer and controller design. The TPDC links the TP model transformation and the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) framework. The study is conducted trough the output feedback control design of the prototypical aeroelastic wing section that is used for the theoretical as well as experimental analysis of two-dimensional aeroelastic behavior and exhibits limit cycle oscillation without control effort. The control strategy is based on a state feedback controller and an observer to estimate the available state values.

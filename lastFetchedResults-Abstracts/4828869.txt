Sequence labeling is concerned with processing an input data sequence and producing an output sequence of discrete labels which characterize it. Common applications includes speech recognition, language processing (tagging, chunking) and bioinformatics. Many solutions have been proposed to partially cope with this problem. These include probabilistic models (HMMs, CRFs) and machine learning algorithm (SVM, Neural nets). In practice, the best results have been obtained by combining several of these methods. However, fusing different signal segmentation methods is not straightforward, particularly when integrating prior information. In this paper the sequence labeling problem is viewed as a multi objective optimization task. Each objective targets a different aspect of sequence labelling such as good classification, temporal stability and change detection. The resulting optimization problem turns out to be non convex and plagued with numerous local minima. A region growing algorithm is proposed as a method for finding a solution to this multi functional optimization task. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real data (BCI dataset). Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on these datasets.

Objective: The goals of the study are evaluation the effect(s) of food deprivation as a social stress on testis structure. We also investigated the effects of melatonin treatment as an antioxidant component and inequality on the effect(s) of food deprivation. 
Methods: We investigated the improving effects of melatonin and social stress (food deprivation) on 42 male rats in 7 groups including control, sham, melatonin received (M), food deprivation (1/3 of control daily food) plus observation (FD), FD + melatonin (FDM), isolated FD (FDi), and FDi + melatonin (FDMi) groups. After 14 days, rats' testes were studied using immuno histochemistry and TUNEL assays to determine the number of apoptotic cells. Biochemical evaluation was taken on malodialdehide (MDA) and glutathione (GSH). ANOVA and Tukey's tests were done to analyse the data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: The results of sham group was declined for similarity to results of control group. In FD group, MDA was increased significantly (P < 0.01), GSH was decreased and the number of apoptotic cells was increased, significantly (P < 0.01). In FDi group, there was no effect on the ratio of oxidative stress compared to the control group. Melatonin treatment could decrease apoptotic cells (P < 0.05) and MDA concentration (P < 0.05) in the FD group.
Conclusion: Food deprivation can induce oxidative stress which is associated with increasment of apoptotic cells in testis. Isolation can compensate these effects. These results refer to inequality. Since melatonin is recognized for its anti-oxidative and improving effects, we have shown involvement of oxidative stress mechanisms on the stress of food deprivation with inequality.

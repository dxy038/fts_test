The multiple knapsack problem (MKP) is a popular test-bed for researchers developing new Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. We explore a range of different representations and operators for the MKP, which have been adapted from the single objective case. Results indicate that order-based approaches are superior to binary representations for the problem instances considered here.

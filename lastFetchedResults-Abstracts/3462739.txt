The design of finite-impulse response (FIR) filters can be performed by using neural networks by formulating the objective function to a Lyapunov energy function. Focusing on this goal, the authors present an improved structure of a feedback neural network to implement the least-squares design of FIR filters. In addition to using the closed-form expressions for the synaptic weight matrix and the bias parameter of the Hopfield neural network (HNN), the proposed approach can achieve a notable reduction both in the amount of computation required and hardware complexity compared to the previous neural-based method. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach

This paper presents some new sufficient conditions for the global robust asymptotic stability
of the equilibrium point for bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks
with multiple time delays. The results we obtain impose constraint conditions on the network
parameters of neural system independently of the delay parameter, and they are
applicable to all bounded continuous non-monotonic neuron activation functions. We also
give some numerical examples to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our
results, and compare the results with the previous robust stability results derived in the
literature.

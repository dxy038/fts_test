HDL-mutation based fault injection and analysis is considered as an important coverage metric for measuring the quality of design simulation processes [20, 3, 1, 2]. In this work, we try to solve the problem of automatic simulation data generation targeting HDL mutation faults. We follow a search based approach and eliminate the need for symbolic execution and mathematical constraint solving from existing work. An objective cost function is defined on the test input space and serves the guidance of search for fault-detecting test data. This is done by first mapping the simulation traces under a test onto a control and data flow graph structure which is extracted from the design. Then the progress of fault detection can be measured quantitatively on this graph to be the cost value. By minimizing this cost we approach the target test data. The effectiveness of the cost function is investigated under an example neighborhood search scheme. Case study with a floating point arithmetic IP design has shown that the cost function is able to guide effectively the search procedure towards a fault-detecting test. The cost calculation time as the search overhead was also observed to be minor compared to the actual design simulation time.

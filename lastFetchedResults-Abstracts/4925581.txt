In this paper, a multi-objective heuristic-based method of design of a fuzzy controller for an inverted pendulum-cart system is investigated. A heuristic search optimization called &#8220;Imperialist Competitive Algorithm&#8221; is proposed to be used in generating and optimizing the fuzzy rules engine. The main purpose of this paper is to design a model-free nonlinear controller for inverted pendulum-cart system which can regulate a wide range of initial conditions and minimize a pre-defined quadratic performance index by taking into account the physical system constraints. Also the system constraints are proposed to be coded using Pontryagin method. All the objectives and system constraints are assumed to be fuzzy objectives and fuzzy constraints. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in problem objectives and constraints satisfaction compared to the optimal linear and nonlinear controller.

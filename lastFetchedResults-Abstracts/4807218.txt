XLIM, French research institute based at the University of Limoges, develops a patented project which is called "Michelson project". The objective of this study is to measure a high electromagnetic field in a selected location by using the diffraction of a target. To realize this measurement, a target, a receiving antenna and a system of acquisition are needed. This method allows to measure high electromagnetic field without risk of receiving antenna breakdown, and disturbs less the field in the zone of the measurement, because no cables are used and the dimensions of the target are small. According to the source and so according to the chosen receiving antenna, the Michelson method can measure as well harmonic signals as transient signals.

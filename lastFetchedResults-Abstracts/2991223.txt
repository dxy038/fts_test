The discrete multitone modulation (DMT) systems have been widely used in various applications. The DMT system can be considered as a dual of a subband coder, obtained by using the synthesis bank as the transmitter and analysis bank as the receiver. In designing optimal subband coders, the objective is to minimize output quantization noise, whereas in the problem of designing optimal DMT system, the objective function to be minimized is the transmitted power. We show that the design of optimal DMT systems can be formulated as a hypothetical design problem of optimal subband coders. The solution of optimal DMT system can be obtained using existing design methods for optimal biorthogonal subband coders

Background and Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive neurologic disease in young adults. It characterized by widespread demyelinative lesions within central nervous system (CNS). Because of variable distribution of demyelination throughout the CNS, people with MS may experience disorders of balance, coordination, strength, sensation and vision. The aim of this study was to investigate difference in performance between people with MS and control subjects on clinical functional balance tests.

Subjects and Methods: We studied 40 people with confirmed MS and 40 healthy persons. Our settings were in Ahvaz school of rehabilitation Sciences, Jundishapur university of medical sciences and center of MS society of Khuzestan. with use of clinical functional balance tests (Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test, modified Romberg test with opened and closed eyes, and lateral reach test to right and left side) subjects were measured on their ability to maintain balance.

Results: Participants with MS performed more poorly than control subjects in all balance tests (P= 0.001). Conclusion: The ability to maintain balance is a markedly problomatic in people with MS. Sci Med J 2010;9( 1):35-43

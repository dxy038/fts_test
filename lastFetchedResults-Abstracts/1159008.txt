The main objective of this paper is to study the influence of longitudinal ultrasonic vibrations on the tube spinning process. A robust experimental tube spinning system was designed and manufactured, in which the preform and mandrel can be excited by ultrasonic vibrations. Tube spinning experiments under ultrasonic vibrations were carried out on annealed AA-6061 preforms. A modal analysis was used to study the vibrational behavior of the system. The forming forces acting on the non-vibrating roller were measured in radial, axial, and tangential directions. Experimental results showed that low power longitudinal ultrasonic vibrations can improve the inner surface quality of annealed 6061 aluminum samples. In addition, high power ultrasonic vibrations can affect forming forces and material escape. Analysis of forming forces variations under ultrasonic vibration revealed that these changes are mostly because of contact effects of ultrasonic vibrations.

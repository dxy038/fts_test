Objective(s): To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARG) with essential hypertension (EH) and additional role of gene– high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) interaction. Materials and Methods:A total of 1640 patients with EH (806 males, 834 females), with a mean age of 52.5±12.6 years, were selected, including 816 EH patients and 824 controls, who were enrolled from the community. Three SNPs were selected for genotyping in the case–control study: rs10865710, rs709158, rs1805192. Logistic regression model was used to examine the interaction between SNP and HDL on EH, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were also calculated. Results: All genotypes were distributed according to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in controls. Logistic regression analysis showed an association between genotypes of variants in rs1805192 and decreased EH risk, EH risk was significantly lower in carriers of Ala allele of the rs1805192 polymorphism than those with Pro/Pro (Pro/Ala+ Ala/Ala versus Pro/Pro, adjusted OR (95% CI) =0.65 (0.53–0.83), after covariate adjustment. In addition, the Ala allele of the rs1805192 polymorphism was also associated with diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but not systolic blood pressure (SBP), we also found, by interaction analysis, combined effect of rs1805192 and HDL on EH risk after covariate adjustment. Conclusion: Our results support an important association between rs1805192 minor allele (Ala allele) of PPARG and lower EH risk, the interaction analysis showed a combined effect of Ala- HDL on lower EH risk.

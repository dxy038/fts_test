This work aims to study and design antennas for base stations containing metallic electromagnetic band gap (EBG) materials. The objective was to make and study new concepts of EBG metallic antennas able to work according to a wide (or broad) form pattern radiation, i.e. presenting at least 60deg angular aperture. The use of metallic structures offers a new approach to the industrial partners to reduce the costs and to facilitate the design techniques. The high impedance presented by the metallic structure allows us to use only one layer of rods and to make the antenna less cumbersome than it was before with a dielectric structure.

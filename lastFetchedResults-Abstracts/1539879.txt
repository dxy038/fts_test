In some recent works dealing with the existence of solutions for impulsive fractional differential equations, it is pointed out that the concept of solutions for such equations in some preceding papers is incorrect. In support of this claim, the authors of these papers begin with a counterexample. The objective of this note to indicate the mistake in these counterexamples and show the plausibility of the previous results.

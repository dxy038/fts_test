Objective Exploring the relationship of exposure to a
traumatic event and the subsequent onset of posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) in the population.
Methods Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed using
the Impact of Event Scale (IES), Posttraumatic Diagnostic
Scale (PDS) and interview data. Logistic regression analyses
with sex, age, marital status, educational level and
traumatic event characteristics were performed. Prevalences
were standardised to the sex and age distribution of
the German population.
Results A total of 41 % of the subjects reported exposure
to a trauma, leading to full PTSD in 1.7 % and to partial
PTSD in 8.8 % of the participants. Logistic regression
revealed accidents (OR 2.5, 95 % CI 1.3–4.7), nonsexual
assault by known assailants (4.5, 2.1–9.8), combat/war
experiences (5.9, 2.0–17.4), life-threatening illness (4.9,
2.7–8.9) and interpersonal conflicts (15.5, 2.5–96.0) as risk
factors for full PTSD; risk factors for partial PTSD were
accidents (3.2, 2.4–4.3), sexual (4.6, 2.2–9.6) or nonsexual
(2.3, 1.4–3.8) assault by known assailants, life-threatening
illness (6.2, 4.6–8.3), death of relatives (5.0, 3.2–7.8) and
interpersonal conflicts (22.0, 8.3–58.1).
Conclusions Of subjects exposed to traumatic events,
only a minority developed PTSD indicating a relationship
between characteristics of the exposure and the individual
and the onset of PTSD.

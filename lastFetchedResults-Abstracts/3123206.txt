In this paper the steady state analysis and control of double-output induction generator (DOIG) for variable speed wind energy conversion system is studied. The objective is to analyze the performance of DOIG under steady state conditions. In addition, IGBT based current regulated voltage source converter with carrier-based sinusoidal pulse width modulation (PWM) method for rotor side converter has been proposed. Stator oriented flux vector control is employed to achieve the independent control of active and reactive power of the machine. The machine is modeled in vectorized form in a synchronous reference frame. The complete simulation model is developed for such machine under variable speed operation using MATLAB Simulink environment for effectiveness of the study.

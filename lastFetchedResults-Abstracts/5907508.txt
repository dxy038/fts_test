The butterfly is a valuable nature resource from the viewpoint of education and tourism. In recent years, the over-exploitation of mountainous areas and overuse of pesticide results in dramatic decrease of butterfly species and populations. This paper studies the related network and virtual reality technologies for developing a virtual butterfly museum and the objective is to provide students and the general public with a web-learning environment for studying butterfly ecology. The virtual museum exhibits several species of butterflies, including Pieridae, Papilionidae, Danaidae, Satyridae, Nymphalidae, as well as insects often seen in Taiwan. We can visit it through network at any time and from anywhere to proceed with observation and learning activities, and discuss with others on the website. Therefore, it can help people understand butterfly ecology and promote the protection of natural environments.

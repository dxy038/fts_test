VoIP service can provide effective and economic voice conversations for global individuals, companies and enterprises. It also preserves more QoS constraints than many other multimedia network applications. While VoIP is applied in wireless mobile networks, the further challenge is the serious QoS impact from the burst loss of packets during handoff. In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to endeavor to reduce quality degradation in mobile VoIP (MVoIP) service. The proposed P<sup>3</sup>T scheme<sup>+</sup> couples an improved cross-layer pre-registration scheme with our enhanced PPT (predictive packet transmission) scheme not only to reduce handoff latency in layer 3, but also further to recover the lost packets from handoff latency. Besides, we not only validate our proposed scheme via theoretic analysis, but also further apply the E-model to demonstrate the improved objective perceptual voice quality while applying the proposed P<sup>3</sup>T handoff scheme.

All the patients underwent clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT) and then in vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed. We evaluated predictive power of CCCT to find IVF outcome in women with decreased ovarian reserve in comparison to those who have appropriate ovarian reserve. SPSS 12 was used to analyze the data of this study via student t test, Fisher exact, Chi -square tests and logistic regression analysis.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif';">Results: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif';">IVF success rate was 11.7% and CCCT sensitivity and specificity were 30.2% and 92.9% while its positive and negative predictive values were 14.9% and 97% respectively.<br /></span><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">Conclusion:</span></strong><em></em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Book','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">CCCT is a good test in estimating ovarian reserve. Due to its high negative predictive value, lower chance of pregnancy is expected in the cases with abnormal results.</span></p>

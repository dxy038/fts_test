Blu-ray disc (BD)/digital versatile disc (DVD)/compact disc (CD) compatible optical pickup supporting Blu-ray 4times read/write has been developed. To achieve 4times speed for BD, a one-lens-type objective lens was adopted to ensure stability for high-speed tracking servo control. Optical system, signal characteristics, and actuator vibration characteristics of the developed pickup are presented.

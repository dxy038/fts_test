This study empirically investigates the causality between prices and volume in mini Taiwan exchange (MiNi-TAIEX) futures. Using hourly data from the MiNi-TAIEX futures prices and trading volume, the Granger causality test was applied to examine the priceâ€“volume relationship. The results show that there is a significant long-run and bidirectional causality between hourly prices and trading volume. The finding of this study can provide a future expert system with useful information about whether the knowledge of past future price movements can improve the short-run forecasts of current and future movements of trading volume, and vice versa. In addition, the analytical results may prove useful for future theoretical and empirical work on the future market.

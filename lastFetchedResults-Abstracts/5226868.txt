First of all, using of objective methods this article builds the index system of ESER evaluation in industrial enterprises including three levels, six sub-set and 32 indicator variables. Second, we establish mathematical models of ESER evaluation. Third, this paper determines the weight of each index by analytic network process (ANP). Finally, taking a large state-owned steel enterprises for example to study, the results show that in 2008 the comprehensive performance of ESER is III revel (good), basically reflecting the actual situation of ESER, at the same time revealing some problems that the company still need to overcome.

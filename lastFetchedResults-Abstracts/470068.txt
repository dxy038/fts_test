Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if a suboptimal cytoreduction can be predicted preoperatively in women with advanced ovarian cancer.
Study design
All women with stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer treated with initial surgery at our hospital between January 1, 1995 and January 1, 2003 were eligible; 56 patients met inclusion criteria and underwent retrospective chart review. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.
Results
Twenty-nine women (52%) had optimal cytoreduction (OC), and 27 (48%) had suboptimal cytoreduction (SC). Women in the SC group had higher median CA-125 values at surgery (954 SC vs 597 OC, P = .07). Three sites of disease on preoperative CT were reported more frequently in the SC patients; omentum (P = .007), parietal peritoneum (P = .096), and ascites (P = .093).
Conclusion
A suboptimal cytoreduction confers no survival advantage to women with advanced ovarian cancer. Thus, these patients may be the best candidates for initial chemotherapy, and identifying them preoperatively becomes important.

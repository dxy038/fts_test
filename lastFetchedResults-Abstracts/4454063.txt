A system architecture for intelligent implantable biotelemetry instruments is presented. The system consists of a modular chip set interconnected by a synchronous serial bus. A user-programmable microprocessor controls all functions, including data acquisition, actuator control and telemetry. Data acquisition is performed by an eight-channel conditioning chip with programmable gain, bandwidth, and sampling rates. An advanced telemetry unit allows bidirectional communication of both data and commands, while providing an error-detection scheme to ensure integrity

Ontology is playing an increasingly important role in knowledge management and the Semantic Web. The tourism information ontology is becoming a core research field in the realm of information retrieval. The objective of this study is to explore the potential role of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) in a web-based ontology construction support system in a tourism domain. An ontology construction method known as TOCM (Tourism Ontology Construction Method) that can generate an ontology based on Formal Concept Analysis theory is proposed. Under the framework of our ontology construction method, the knowledge engineers could reach a new ontology of tourism information that was demonstrated as useful to support their ontology construction tasks.

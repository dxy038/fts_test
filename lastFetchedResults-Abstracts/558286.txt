The objective of the current study was to estimate some productive parameters of Sudanese Nubian goat under extensive management system. The data eighty-six parities of Sudanese Nubian goats were used; these parities were occurred during the period between October 1998 to August 2000, to parent stock raised on traditional pastroralism. These parities were used in completely randomized design to investigate the effects of nutritional supplementation, season of kidding, parity order and litter size on milk yield and lactation length of Sudanese Nubian goats. The result revealed that average total lactation milk yield was 89.18 ± 38.60 kg. Nutritional supplementation had a highly significantly effect on average total lactation milk yield. However, season of kidding; parity order and litter size had non-significant effect on average total lactation milk yield. Total milk yield was highly correlated with the first month yield, r = 0.599. The overall mean of lactation length was 181.12 ± 51.36 days. Nutritional supplementation and parity order had non-significant effect on lactation length. However season of kidding had a significant effect on lactation length. The linear regression of the total milk yield on lactation length was highly significant. The study indicated that, by instituting adequate management improvement action, the productivity of goat could be improved

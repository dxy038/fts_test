In this paper, the author presented a transportation problem with Non-Linear constraints in which supplies and demands are trapezoidal fuzzy values and the objective function assumes multiple objectives. Then, Non-Linear constraints are linearized by defining and adding auxiliary constraints. Finally, the optimal solution of the problem is founded by solving the linear programming problem with fuzzy and crisp constraints and applying fuzzy programming technique. The method proposed to solve this problem is illustrated through numerical examples. Multi-objective goal programming methodology is used for numerical examples. The results of this research were developed and used as one of the Decision Support System models in Logistics Department of Kayson Co.

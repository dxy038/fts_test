World health organization (WHO) recommends the use of line probe
                            assays (LiPAs) for rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST). However,
                            only a limited number of studies from Pakistan have documented the
                            performance characteristics of line probe assays in testing multi-drug
                            resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The
                            objective of this work is to evaluate the diagnostic plausibility of the
                            LiPA tests MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl on MDR MTB isolates from Pakistan. This
                            was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Indus hospital, Karachi.
                            LiPA testing was performed on 196 smear-positive samples using BACTEC
                            MGIT 960 as a gold standard. The sensitivity of MTBDRplus for isoniazid
                            and rifampicin was found to be 88.8% and 90.2%, respectively, while
                            sensitivity of MTBDRsl for fluoroquinolones, amikacin/capreomycin, and
                            ethambutol was found to be 72.9%, 81.8%, and 56.6%, respectively. The
                            MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl genotypic testing can serve as useful additional
                            tools for DST in a high-burden country like Pakistan provided it is used
                            in combination with phenotypic testing.

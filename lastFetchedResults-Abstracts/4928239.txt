This paper presents a modified navigation system and controller for an automatic UGV. It uses new variables to overcome the difficulty of dealing with cross coupling effects in dynamical equations due to the use of Cartesian coordinates. Then it proceeds with the introduction of a trajectory design algorithm in conjunction with L<sub>1</sub> control architecture to accomplish the path following objective. This paper shows by illustrative simulations that using L<sub>1</sub> adaptive controller can greatly facilitate controlling the UGV in uncertain environmental conditions.

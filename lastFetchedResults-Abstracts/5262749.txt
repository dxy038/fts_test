Bayesian network can represent probabilistic information flexibly, and to make inference on it . With the time sequential simulation Technique, the Bayesian topological structure and the Bayesian bidirectional inference method used in the distribution systems for the reliability assessment, the influence of each element or several elements to the reliability of the whole system can be gained conveniently, and the correlative data that relate to the time and the fault times can be gotten easily as well. Thus the shortcomings of traditional reliability assessment methods are overcomed . According to verification with the models, the effectiveness and advantage of the reliability assessment with the Bayesian network method used in the distribution systems is better.

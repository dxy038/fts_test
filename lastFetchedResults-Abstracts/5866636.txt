A description is given of a current-mode-controlled bidirectional flyback converter handling different values of power in either direction. The flyback transformer operates in a continuous conduction mode in one direction and in a discontinuous conduction mode in the other direction of power flow. Signal flow graph modeling, analysis, and design of such a scheme are presented. Experimental results are included

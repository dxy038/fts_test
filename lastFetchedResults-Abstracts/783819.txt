Objective The aim was to assess determinants of suicidality
(suicidal ideation and suicide attempts) in a general
population cohort with depressive spectrum disorders, and
to compare determinants for suicidal ideation and determinants
for suicide attempts in this cohort.
Method The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and
Incidence Study is a epidemiologic survey in the adult
population (N = 7,076), using the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
Results In a cohort of 586 persons with a depressive
spectrum disorder, 97 (16.6%) reported suicidal ideation
and 19 (3.2%) suicide attempts in a period of 2 years. In a
multivariate model, male gender (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30–
0.99, p = 0.05), longer ([13 months) duration of depression
(OR 2.86, 95%CI 1.21–6.73, p = 0.02; OR 2.71, 95%
CI 1.24–5.91, p = 0.01), anhedonia (OR 2.00, 95% CI
1.01–5.91, p = 0.05), feeling worthless (OR 1.99, 95% CI
1.05–3.74, p = 0.03), comorbid anxiety (OR 2.46, 95% CI
1.38–4.40, p\0.01), previous suicidal ideation (OR 3.50,
95% CI 1.96–6.24, p\0.001) and use of professional care
(OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01–3.79, p = 0.05) were significantly
related to suicidality. Determinants of suicidal ideation
differed from determinants of suicide attempts.
Limitations Suicidality (and not actual suicides) was
assessed with only two questions from the CIDI and some
determinants for suicidality were assessed in the same time
period as suicidality.
Conclusions Features of depression were the most
important determinants of suicidality in a depressive
spectrum cohort. Determinants for suicidal ideation differed
from suicide attempts. These findings could be
helpful in identifying those who need more intense treatment
strategies in order to prevent suicidality and eventually
suicide.

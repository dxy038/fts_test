A transonic axial compressor with circumferential casing grooves is optimized to improve operating stability. Numerical analysis is conducted by solving three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes equations using the shear stress transport turbulence model. An optimization process based on a weighted-average surrogate model and steady flow analysis are performed with three design variables defining the tip clearance, blade tip angle, and depth of the grooves. The steady stall inception point is identified from the last converged point, and values of the stall margin as the objective function are predicted using steady flow analysis at the design points sampled by Latin hypercube sampling in the design space. The surrogate model is constructed based on these objective function values. Optimization of this model found the optimum design, which yields a considerable increase in the stall margin compared to the smooth casing. To investigate unsteady behavior of the flow in the optimized compressor with casing grooves, an unsteady flow analysis is performed, and the stall inception point is re-predicted using this analysis.

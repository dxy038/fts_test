
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Campylobacter jejuni is a common cause of acute diarrhea in humans. As regards there is not  exact information about the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of this bacterium in Iran, this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and antibiotic resistance in campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from 10 years old children admitted to diarrhea in several medical centers in Tehran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 117 diarrheal samples collected from several medical centers in Tehran in 2011. Stool samples were homogenized and cultured in Preston ‎enrichment broth, then were subcultured in Campylobacter specific medium under microaerophilic condition in 42 ?C for 48h. ‎The isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Antibiograms were performed by the disc diffusion method.
FINDINGS: From 117 samples tested, 9 samples (7.69%) were positive for campylobacter jejuni. Maximum resistance and sensitivity were observed in the cotrimoxazole (5 cases, 55.55%) and gentamicin (8cases, 88.88%) respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of study showed that Campylobacter jejuni is one of the important causes of diarrhoea in ‎children less than 10 years of age and the most resistance of antibiotics was to cotrimoxazole.  

KEY WORDS: Campylobacter jejuni, Erythromycin resistance, Diarrhea.

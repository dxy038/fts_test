Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a disinfectable, needle-free connector in the prophylaxis of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
Methods
A randomized controlled trial was performed in a polyvalent intensive care unit. Patients who needed multilumen central venous catheters were randomly assigned to a study or a control group. All catheters were inserted and manipulated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. Study group patients were equipped with catheters with disinfectable, needle-free connectors whereas control group patients were equipped with catheters with 3-way stopcocks. Two peripheral blood cultures and a semiquantitative culture of the catheter tip were performed on removal of the catheter.
Results
The study included 243 patients, with a total of 278 central venous catheters. The catheters' mean insertion duration was 9.9 days. Both groups were comparable regarding patient and catheter characteristics. Incidence rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection was 0.7 per 1000 days of catheter use in the study group, compared with 5.0 per 1000 days of catheter use in the control group (P = .03).
Conclusions
To add a disinfectable, needle-free connector to the CDC recommendations reduces the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection in critically ill patients with central venous catheters.

Observation and consideration of wavesâ€™ characteristics in coastal zone is one of the most important
topics in the field of costal engineering. Chabahar area has attracted attentions due to its strategic
location in transportation developments of the region with other parts of the world, especially Far
East. This study looked at the data gathered from buoy during summer, and winter of 1998 to 2000
and registered wind analysis during 1998 until 2003, waves and wind rose of the region. Based on this
information, it is shown that this region mostly has instabilities in its surface layers and most of the
time, duration-limited wave growth conditions dominated on waves. The similar model of wave,
considers the relationship between non-dimensional parameters. The main objective of this research is
calculation and estimation of non-dimensional energy, frequency, fetch and duration of wind waves
and the relations between these parameters for Chabahar coast.

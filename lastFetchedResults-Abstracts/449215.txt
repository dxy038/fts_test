Objective
To evaluate patient outcome following epiretinal membrane urgery uing trypan blue to facilitate viualization and delamination.
Deign
A retropective noncomparative review of 23 patient.
Method
Patient underwent a three-port par plana vitrectomy with delamination uing trypan blue 0.06%.
Reult
The median preoperative viual acuity wa 20/100. The median potoperative viual acuity wa 20/60. eventeen patient (74%) improved their viual acuity by at leat 2 chart line. No advere reaction related to trypan blue wa oberved up to 1 year potoperatively.
Concluion

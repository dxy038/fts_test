Investigations into optimising the locations of base stations in an indoor wireless communications network are reported. The method is based on introducing quality-of-service criteria and using these to form an objective function in an optimisation scheme. Using this approach both coverage- and interference-limited environments are handled. Results are provided based on an accurate propagation prediction model to estimate local mean signal power. These demonstrate that significant improvements in quality of service can be obtained by optimising the locations of base stations

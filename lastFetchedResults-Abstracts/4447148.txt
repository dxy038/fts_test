A biosensor system is presented for identification of properties of a fluid. The class of biosensors studied in this work, are capable of operating as a dielectric constant measurement device. This paper focuses on studying the effectiveness of the VLSI adaptation on the CHEMFET in determining fluidic properties. The objective of this research is to determine metrology infrastructure issues needed for developing multisensor system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices

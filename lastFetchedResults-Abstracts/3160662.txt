In order to provide the best possible radio resource management solutions, a resource management framework based cognitive capability, which is capable of properly adapting to the environment conditions for optimizing multi-objective, is proposed. In such framework, three areas of cognitive capability are defined. Additionally, the cognitive capability heterogeneity, which refers to different cognitive capability for nodes, is also considered. Especially, a CRRM framework with cognitive capability heterogeneity, including cognitive resource management with cognitive capability level matching the reward and that with fairness, is developed.

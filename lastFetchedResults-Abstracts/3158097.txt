According to the research and analysis of auto-generating exam paper issues, identified auto-generating exam paper is a multi-objective constrained optimization problem, this paper puts forward mathematical models for auto-generating paper based on genetic algorithm. In this model, uses the properties of global-selecting-excellent and intelligent search of genetic arithmetic, on the basis of the every properties corresponding with the mathematical model´s control index, so we can obtain a satisfying exam paper according with the teacher´s demands from item bank, it effectively solves the problem of auto-generating exam paper in item bank. Theoretical analysis shows that the genetic algorithm has polynomial time and space complexity which used. Genetic algorithm can solve effectively the issue of intelligent generating exam paper in item bank is verified through the experiment, compared with other similar methods, it can find the groups in meeting the conditions earlier, thus easier to find the optimal solutions, and has a widely application and promotion worth in auto-generating paper.

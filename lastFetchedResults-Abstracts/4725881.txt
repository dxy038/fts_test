Requirements engineering (RE) is critical to the success of a software development project. In order to have professionals who are capable of accomplishing software projects successfully, Requirements engineering education (REE) is therefore an important endeavor. The objective of this paper is to identify and to present the current research on REE in order to discuss their contribution types, identify deficits and to extract the useful approaches. A search was conducted using bibliographic databases to find as much research as possible. The papers found in this study are classified with respect to research types and their empirical type. We believe that this study will be a reliable basis for further research in Requirements engineering education.

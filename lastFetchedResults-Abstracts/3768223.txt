The evolution of the computer networks is visible. New technologies are created and standardized very quickly. The observed tendency is the development of communications structures with simple access to easy usersÂ´ connection. The mesh networks were created with the objective to be dynamics with quickly and safe user insertion. But, the dynamism found in the mesh networks creates many challenges to the developers and engineers. One of these challenges is the choice or development of one routing algorithm that satisfy all the requirements of the different topologies which may form a mesh network, e.g. one wired network working at the same time with a mobile network. This work has the objective to present the results of the MANETs routing protocols performance evaluation in a mesh topology.

Service quality and customer satisfaction are among the most
important and problematic concepts in marketing theory and practice.
Nowadays, with the development of the service industry in the world,
there has been increasing attention towards different dimensions of
service quality and many companies have been trying to improve the
quality level of their services and to enhance customer satisfaction.
The purpose of this paper was to devise scales for measuring the
quality of services provided to customers and for their satisfaction in
Saipa. It was also the objective of this research to develop a structural
model and then to test the relationships between the relevant variables.
Saipaâ€™s customers and employees comprised the population of
the study. To determine the sample size, random sampling method,
together with Kukran formula was used. LISREL software and the
logic of structural equation modeling were used to present the research
model. The results show that there are nine indicators with which
we can measure the satisfaction of customers. We also found that
the quality of services, as perceived by the customers, has a positive
effect on their satisfaction and there is a direct relationship between the
indicators of services quality.

Background: Oocyte donation and assis ted reproduc tive technology (A RT) give women
with ova rian failure , adva nced repr odu ctive age, inheritable disorders or recurrent
imp lantat ion failure , the ab ility to conceive , The success of oocyte donation is reportedly
influe nced by multiple parameters of the ooc yte donor and recipient. The objective of this
study was to eva lua te the donor and rec ipient variab les affecting the ou tcome of oocyte
donation ,
Methods: In this retrospective stu dy, we ana lyzed 51 oocyte donat ion cycles of 45 women
in an in vitro fert ilization clin ic. Da ta collected included age , body mass index, endometrial
thickness, cycl ing and gravidity of reci pients and the age of donors.
Results: The cli nica l preg nancy rate was 40% per reci pient and 35% per cycle resulting in
9 singleton, 7 twin and 2 triplet gesta tions. Embryo impl antation rate was 27%. Oocyte
fert iliza tion rates amo ng patients who had become impregnated and those who had not
were 75% and 79%, respect ively of 18 pregnancies, 15 culmi na ted in a live birth (33% live
birth rate) . There was no significant relationship between inc idence of pregnancy and
mea n age, 8MI, gravi dity , cycl icity of recipients and age of donors. There wa s a
significant difference between the endometrial thickness of patients who became
pregnan t and those who d id not (p=O.048). The numbe r of transferred embryos was
pos itive ly assoc iated with pregnancy (p=0.006).
Conclusion: The factor that most relia bly predic ts the outco me of oocyte donat ion cycles
is oocyte rec ipient endometrial thickness. Donor age from 20-34 years dose not affect
clinica l pregnancy rates. Do nors in the ir early 30's are co nsidered to be the best
candida tes for oocyte donation.

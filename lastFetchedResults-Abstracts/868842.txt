Tchebycheff metric based approaches have become popular for sampling the set of nondominated solutions in an interactive search for a most preferred solution in multiple objective decision making situations. These approaches systematically reduce the set of nondominated solutions which remain available for identification and selection from one iteration to the next. The interactive weighted Tchebycheff procedure (IWTP) of Steuer and Choo (An interactive weighted Tchebycheff procedure for multiple objective programming. Mathematical Programming 1983;26:326â€“44) is a weight space reduction method. An alternative approach to reducing the set of nondominated solutions within a Tchebycheff framework is proposed and compared to the IWTP. This approach uses reservation levels based upon decision maker responses for objective space reduction. This reservation level driven Tchebycheff procedure (RLTP) is shown to be more flexible than the original IWTP, while producing solutions of similar high quality.

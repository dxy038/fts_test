This paper presents 18 fundamental movements for the rehabilitation of the stroke patient. The objective of this research is to develop the movement sequences which are suitable for the rehabilitation process and is focused on hemiparesis sufferers which are the most common among stroke patients. The muscle activities are analyzed using electromyography (EMG). 12 electrodes are attached to the right arm of the subject includes deltoid, bicep, tricep, flexor and extensor. The experimental results proof that it is likely to produce movement sequence for stroke rehabilitation based on each muscle activity.

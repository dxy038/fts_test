Technological advances have brought great changes in all areas, including education. The distance learning evolution (D-learning, E-learning and M-Learning) has prompted the adoption of the most interesting pedagogical approaches such as constructivism and social-constructivism... The adoption of these pedagogical trends improved the quality of learning by providing the personalization of learning and collaborative learning. Through this technological evolution and with the development of the Web 2.0, a new pedagogical approach called Connectivism has emerged [1]. ItÂ´s a promising pedagogical approach that covers learning in heterogeneous communities (humans or not) and is based on the contribution of new technologies. However, Web 2.0 is not efficient to reach distributed knowledge in networks in a smart way and where the ability to learn becomes more and more important [2]. The objective of our works is to conceive and implement CLE Connectivist Learning Environment which is a clouded and ubiquitous learning environment. The intended purpose is to adopt connectivism as a pedagogical approach in order to construct knowledge through collaboration between heterogeneous communities composed of humans and intelligent objects.

Astrometric and photometric data fusion for the purposes of simultaneous position, velocity, attitude, and angular rate estimation has been demonstrated in the past. This state estimation is extended to include the various surface parameters associated with the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Additionally, a physically consistent BRDF and radiation pressure model is utilized thus enabling an accurate physical link between the observed photometric brightness and the attitudinal dynamics and ultimately the orbital dynamics. An example scenario is then presented where the model is an uncontrolled High Area to Mass Ratio (HAMR) object in geosynchronous Earth orbit and the position, velocity, attitude, angular rates, and surface parameters are estimated simultaneously.

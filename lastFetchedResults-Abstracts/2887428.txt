In VANET, nodes or vehicles on the road can communicate with each other and with RSUs (Intelligent System) through wireless medium. The vehicles can exchange the traffic information through other vehicles to take decision for forwarding in the road map. We assume that each vehicle is aware about the sections vehicles and RSU contains the information of location, speed and arrival time of vehicles in a RSU section or range. This paper introduces delay aware traffic control scheme that aims to achieve a delay nominal collection delivery in the context of a two hop vehicular intermittently connected network. The realization of this objective is challenging especially when network information was assumed to be completely unavailable. Nevertheless, the famous retransmission mechanism is used in typical data communication networks to recover from data losses and error comes to the rescue. This mechanism works on the basis of traffic information of vehicles. The vehicles having higher mobility speed generates a traffic request for clearance then the RSU monitors that information and takes decision to forward that vehicle first such that the traffic scheduled for vehicle forwarding is maintained. If the space is not available then wait for some time and newly arriving vehicles wait for their turn to pass from traffic. RSUs deployed at the road sides which are in charge of data collection and distribution. Proposed scheme is a capable scheme in which delay is handled by RSU and then share the data when vehicle travel out of the communication range of the RSU.

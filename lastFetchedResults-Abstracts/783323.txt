Objective This study investigates the
prevalence of current somatization in the population
by taking different levels of symptom severity into
account. Somatization is described along a continuum
from mild and negligible bodily misperceptions
to severe and disabling somatoform symptoms.
Methods A representative sample of 2.552 persons in
Germany was examined with a screening instrument
for medically unexplained physical complaints
that had occurred during the past 7 days. All 53
symptoms from the ICD-10/DSM-IV sections of
somatoform disorders were included. Results 81.6%
reported at least one symptom causing at least mild
impairment and 22.1% at least one symptom causing
severe impairment. The entire sample had an average
of 6.6 symptoms associated with at least mild
distress. Somatization of any degree was associated
with female gender, age above 45, lower educational
level, lower household income and rural area. The
most common symptoms with prevalence rates
> 20% were various types of pain (back, head, joints,
extremities), food intolerance, sexual indifference,
painful menstruations and erectile/ejaculatory dysfunction.
Conclusion This population survey demonstrates
that medically unclear complaints are an
everyday phenomenon. About three out of four cases
are below clinical relevance with only low level of
impairment. Epidemiological correlates are similar
between clinical and non-clinical forms of somatization

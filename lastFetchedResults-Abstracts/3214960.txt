This paper presents a comparative analysis among different arrays of photovoltaic (PV) modules under partial shading conditions. This scenario is typical of a residential area where partial shading can occur due to trees or neighbor buildings. The main objective is to evaluate the power extraction under partial shading in parallel and series PV modules arrays, and compare the results. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed analysis.

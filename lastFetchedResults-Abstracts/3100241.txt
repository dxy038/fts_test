In this paper a new approach is presented to handle the reservoir constraints optimization operation problem. The new technique treats constrained optimization as a two-objective optimization. One objective is original objective function; the other is the degree violating the constraints. SCE-UA algorithm is applied to the two-objective optimization by using the individualpsilas comparing procedure and the population ranking procedure which is respectively based on the Pareto dominance relationship and the Pareto strength definition. By combining Pareto strength ranking procedure with SCE-UA algorithm, a new Pareto strength SCE-UA algorithm (PSSCE) is proposed. To show practical utility, PSSCE is then applied to a realistic case study, the Huanren reservoir system in Hun River Basin in the Northeast China, which mainly serves hydropower generation. By Comparing with dynamic programming (DP) method, it is concluded that the proposed algorithm provides promising and comparable solutions with known global optimum results.

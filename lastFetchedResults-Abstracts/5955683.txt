Full-scale impulse testing of various cable systems that were carried out under the DSTAR (Distribution System Testing, Application, and Research) program, of which the NRECA Rural Electric Research program has been a participant, is described. The primary objective of this phase of the DSTAR program is to evaluate the neutral performance of various cable types under impulse conditions. It also attempts to evaluate the efficacy of a number of neutral grounding schemes

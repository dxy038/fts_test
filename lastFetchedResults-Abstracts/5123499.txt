The protection of electric and electronic systems against the induced effects of lightning strikes is a great concern for the EMC engineers. In this paper, a single-objective optimization approach is proposed as a tool to obtain the best arrangement of down-conductors and horizontal equipotential rings of a lightning protection system (LPS) that gives rise to the lower electromagnetic field in certain regions of the LPS protected volume. The concept of &#8220;safe area&#8221; is introduced and used as measure of the optimization procedure. The magnetic flux density is evaluated by means of a time-domain simulation. Various applications regarding LPS configurations, directly struck by lightning, are presented and discussed

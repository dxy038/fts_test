The main objective of this study, within development of engineering solutions for coastal areas depuration, was to establish the role of the benthic macro-organisms in the biodegradation of the detergents in marine environment and to estimate the toxicity of these substances for a particular marine species: the ascidian Styela plicata. The experimental studies undertaken in aquarium with seawater enriched in a pure lynear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), the 1-(p-sulfophenyl)nonane (1C9-LAS), showed that the degradation was two times more fast in presence of the S. plicata, than of the only marine bacteria. The toxicity of this pollutant was also determined. This study demonstrates that the ascidia S. plicata can be a potential biomediator for the surfactant 1C9-LAS, and it can be used to design a pilot project, to bioremediate harbours and the coastal areas interested from the urban pollution.

The objective of image fusion is to combine information from different source images of the same scene to achieve a new image which can provide much more visual information than the source images. This paper proposes a new image fusion method using image black segment. According to the contrast of block, the original images are separated into clear part, blurring part and the part between clear part and blurring one. For the clear part and blurring one, the former is selected as the corresponding block of fusion image. The part between clear part and blurring one is fused by the choice of the corresponding pixel based on the contrast. Simulation results show that the method achieved better fusion effect.

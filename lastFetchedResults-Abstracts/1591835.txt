Objective. To review the evidence on what works in teenage parent support programmes; to determine the key elements of successful teenage parent support and parenting programmes; and to determine the gaps in the evidence.

s. Databases were searched, using a specific search strategy, for systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, to ascertain whether social support, parenting programmes, or both, are effective in improving maternal or infant outcomes. The findings were summarized.

s. Only one systematic review specifically addressed interventions among teenage parents and their children, although several randomised trials have since been published.

sions. Key questions remain for future support and parenting programmes.

 support and parenting interventions improve maternalâ€“child interactions and child cognitive development, but do not reduce low-birth weight, stillbirth or neonatal death. Social support and parenting programmes need to be combined with measures to increase the minimum income, reduce smoking in pregnancy and increase breast-feeding rates. Robust evaluations of packages of care in the UK are needed to inform national and local teenage pregnancy strategies.

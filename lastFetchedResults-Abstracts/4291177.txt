Currently, flexible fiber and optical endoscopes are attractive for the visual control of the collectors hollows, chemical apparatuses, different pipe lines. The problem associated with the movement of the endoscope flexible test portion inside of the article as well as impossibility of an exact objective positioning are the limitations for the endoscope application for the extensive cylindrical articles control with a narrow front neck of input. Moreover, in the articles controlled there are remaining liquid solutions and oil products that result in objective pollution and render the endoscope application under these conditions impossible. For the given problems solving there was developed photorecording endoscope with the system of axial movement and positioning flexible test portion inside of the extensive cylindrical articles.

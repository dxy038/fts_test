BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE; Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall and is believed to mediate many of the sequela of infection. The liver plays a central role in the inflammatory response to LPS. Elevation of livers enzyme level is one of changes induced in acute phase of inflammation by infection or tissue damage. Ghrelin is a peptide hormone mainly secreted by the mucosa of the stomach and stimulates growth hormone release. Based on anti-inflammatory effects of Ghrelin, in this study we examined the protective effect of Ghrelin on lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatotoxicity in rat. METHODS: In this study forty male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups (N=10). Control group received normal saline, second group received LPS (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p), third group received Ghrelin (4 nmol/kg, i.p), and forth group received LPS + Ghrelin (10 mg/kg and 4nmol/kg, respectively) for 8 days. At the end of the 8th day, animals were anaesthetized and blood samples were collected directly from heart. Hepatotoxicity was evaluated by measuring aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT).
FINDINGS: Injection of LPS induced a significant increase in AST, ALT, ALP and GGT compared with control group (p<0.001). LPS- induced increases in AST, ALT, ALP and GGT were significantly reduced by treatment with Ghrelin (p<0.001),
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results suggest that Ghrelin has protective effect against LPS- induced hepatotoxicity and this effect may be mediated by anti inflammatory effect of Ghrelin.

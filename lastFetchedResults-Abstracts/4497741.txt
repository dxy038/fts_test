Power quality problems have drawn extensive attention in recent years, from both power companies and customers. Reliable and comprehensive evaluation of power quality, as one of current research focuses, possesses great significance in assessing power sector, investigating customer satisfaction to utility industry, and determining the electricity price. To improve the objectivity and rationality of power quality evaluation, a novel combination method including both the objective and the subjective weights is proposed in the paper. The combination method is to sort the power quality level at every evaluation point through integrating the objective and the subjective weights obtained with the maximizing deviations and the fuzzy method. The proposed method sets the weights more reasonably aiming at a comprehensive evaluation of power quality, and overcomes the limitations of its counterparts using either the objective weight or the subjective weight only. Finally, real data collected from a distributed system is served in the case study to demonstrate the developed method.

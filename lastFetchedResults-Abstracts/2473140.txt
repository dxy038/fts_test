Objective
Breath holding spells (BHS) are common involuntary reflexes in infancy and
early childhood. Differential diagnosis should embrace Long QT Syndrome
(LQTS) and paroxysmal abnormalities of rhythm. The aim of this study was
to compare QT dispersion (QTd) in children with breath holding spells and
normal controls.
Materials & Methods
QT dispersion and Corrected QT(QTc) dispersion were measured in 12 lead
surface electrocardiograms in 56 patients with BHS and compared with healthy
children of the same age referred to the clinic for regular checkup visits.
Results
The most common type of BHS was cyanotic (83.9%). Seven patients
(12.5%) had pallid and two patients (3.5%) had mixed spells. There was a
history of breath holding spells in 33.9% of the children. QT dispersion was
61.6± 22.5 and 47.1±18.8 ms in patient and control groups, respectively. QTc
dispersion (QTcd) was 104 ± 29.6 and 71.9 ±18.2 ms, respectively. There was
a significant difference between patient and control groups in terms of QTd
and QTcd (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
QTd and QTcd were increased in children with BHS. Therefore, the evaluation
of EKG for early diagnosis of rhythm abnormalities seems reasonable in these
children.

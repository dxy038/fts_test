Full-duplex (FD) radio has been introduced for bidirectional communications on the same temporal and spectral resources so as to maximize spectral efficiency. In this paper, motivated by the recent advances in FD radios, we provide a foundation for downlink hybrid-duplex heterogeneous networks (HDHNs), composed of multi-tier networks with a mixture of access points (APs) operating either in FD mode or half-duplex (HD) mode. Specifically, we characterize the network interference from FD-mode cells, and derive the HDHN throughput by accounting for AP spatial density, self-interference cancellation (IC) capability, and transmission power of APs and users. By quantifying the HDHN throughput, we present the effect of network parameters and the self-IC capability on the HDHN throughput, which shows the superiority of FD mode for larger AP densities (i.e., larger network interference and shorter communication distance) or higher self-IC capability.

LTE-Advanced networking standard introduces fixed relays as one of the ways to support the ambitious performance requirements for next-generation network services. The relays are introduced to increase the available capacity or to extend the coverage of the network. Balancing the dynamic interference scenarios and the complex resource management in relay-assisted networks presents one of the key challenges for the further development of LTE-A. This paper introduces the challenge of adaptive resource management and identifies simple adaptive scheduling methods based on channel quality information. The paper then utilizes a comprehensive simulation tool to show clear throughput benefits of using adaptive resource management for either the cell edge users or users experiencing very good signal-to-interference ratio, depending on the system objective.

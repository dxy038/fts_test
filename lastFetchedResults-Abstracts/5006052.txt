This paper presents a new effective restoration procedure designed for the electrical power system (EPS) with large scale of dispersed generation (DG) penetration. The "deep build-together" strategy is proposed to simultaneously consider this rebuilding by transmission and distribution networks, thereby, to serve the maximum of customers in a minimum of time. The restoration problem has to be now formulated as a multilevel, multi-objective optimization problem with constraints. The proposed method is designed with consideration to the network in the coming year which requires the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) components. Some simulations, using Eurostag software and a part of an IEEE New England 39 buses power system including a French type distribution network, with different cases (with a large scale of DG contributing or not in restoration process), will be shown to illustrate the DG ability in restoration process. The benefits of employing DG are also quantified

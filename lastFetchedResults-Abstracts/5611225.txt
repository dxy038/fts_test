Several well known imaging techniques operate by recording samples of the Fourier transform of the object function and then reconstructing the object function by means of the 2D inverse FFT. A central problem arises in interpolating from the inherent polar raster to a rectangular raster, so the inverse FFT can be properly applied. This paper considers the use of nearest neighbor and inverse distance interpolation when the angular recording interval is relatively small. The objective is to obtain a computationally simple reconstruction algorithm that achieves good resolution in the final image plane.

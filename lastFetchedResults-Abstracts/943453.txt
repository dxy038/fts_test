Abstract
Introduction: Diabetes is known as a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Another issue is people’s belief about therapeutic effects of opium on the metabolic ill conditions. This conception has led to the rising prevalence of opium consumption, which demands further studies in different regions. 
Objective: The aim of this study was determination of the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors between diabetic patients in Kerman and study of opium’s impression on these factors as a common social habit in this region.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study we enrolled 248 diabetic patients (203(81%) female and 45 (19%) male, age 54.37 ± 9.75 years old) in Kerman. A questionnaire completed after direct interview, physical examination and laibratory assessment. The data were analyzed by SPSS soft word.
Results: Mean duration of disease was 8.78 ± 7.48 years. Overall, 38.7% of the patients had arterial hypertension and 75.6% were in uncontrolled DM state, as glycosilated hemoglobin more than 7%.  As revealed, 47.6% of the patients had cholesterol greater than 200, 69.3% triglyceride higher than 150, 57.8% with LDL-C greater than 100 and 43.7% were with low level of HDL-C. The prevalence of opium consumption in patients was 20.4%. The hyper-cholesterolemia was significantly less frequent in opium users; in contrast, high systolic blood pressure was more frequent among them. No significant difference was observed in the other type of serum lipids or statement of diabetes control.
Conclusion: Cardiovascular risk factors were frequent among patients in Kerman. Thus, preventive policies should be adopted to control it. On the other hand, opium consumption did not show any considerable effect on cardiovascular risk factors.

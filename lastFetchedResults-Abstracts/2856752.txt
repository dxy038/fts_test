This paper presents the influence of perceived texture regularity on the visual quality of textures that are synthesized through parametric and non-parametric approaches. It is shown through subjective testing that textures with different degrees of perceived regularity exhibit different degrees of vulnerability to texture synthesis artifacts. The paper also proposes a method for adaptively selecting the appropriate texture synthesis algorithm based on an objective no-reference texture regularity metric. It is shown through subjective testing that the proposed adaptive texture synthesis performs better than the individual methods.

The study of the human behavior in driving situations is of primary importance for the improvement of driver´s security. This study is complex because of the numerous situations in which the driver may be involved. The objective of the CASSICE project (Symbolic Characterization of Driving Situations) is to elaborate a tool in order to simplify the analysis task of the driver´s behavior. In this paper, we mainly take an interest in the indexing and querying of a multimedia database including the numerical data and the video sequences relating to a type of driving situations. We will put the emphasis on the queries to this database. They are often complex because they are formulated according to criteria depending on time, space and the use terms of the natural language.

The paper studies a medium voltage-low voltage transformer with a decoupled on load tap changer capability on each phase. The overall objective is the evaluation of the potential benefits on a low voltage network of such possibility. A realistic Danish low voltage network is used for the analysis. The load profiles are characterized by using single phase measurement data on voltages, currents and active powers with a 10 minutes resolution. Different scenarios are considered: no tap action, three-phase coordinated tap action, single phase discrete step and single phase continuous tap action. The effectiveness of the tapping capability is evaluated by comparing the Voltage Unbalance Factor and the voltage levels on the neutral cable.

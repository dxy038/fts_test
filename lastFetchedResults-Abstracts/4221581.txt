The regeneration power which is generated braking period of railway vehicles is increasing voltage of DC-line, and excessive voltage of DC-line is generating several problems. So, itpsilas very important issue to DC traction system about dealing with regenerate power. Regeneration energy storage system is one of the methods to use the regeneration energy efficiently and to improve the problems. In this paper, we proposed the design and efficient control algorithm of the bidirectional DC/DC converter used in electric railway for utilization of regeneration energy. And as realization of prototype model, we verified the efficiency of bidirectional DC/DC converter.

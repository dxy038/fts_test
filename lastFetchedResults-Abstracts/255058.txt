A mean climatology is studied to examine atmospheric circulation characteristics to assess
the wintertime (December, January, February and March - DJFM) synoptic weather system affecting
northern India. The main objective is to study the mean circulation and mean energetics distribution
pertaining to the winter season, which are embedded with an eastward moving synoptic weather system in
westerlies, called Western Disturbances (WDs). Forty years (1958–1997) of uninitialized daily re-analysis
data of the National Center for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCEP- NCAR, henceafter NCEP), U.S. has been considered for this study. Winter circulations are
considered over the domain 15 S–45 N and 30 E–120 E. This domain is considered particularly to
illustrate the impact of wintertime synoptic weather system Western Disturbances (WDs), which travel
towards the east over the western Himalayas during winter and yield an enormous amount of precipitation
in the form of snow. Large-scale balances of kinetic energy, vorticity, angular momentum, heat and
moisture budget terms are analyzed. The main findings of the study show that strong rising motion in the
extratropical region brings a significant amount of precipitation over the region of study. Also, horizontal
flux of kinetic energy converges in the tropical region and diverges over the extratropical region. It is seen
that both the zonal and meridional component of kinetic energy contributes to the production of kinetic
energy in the upper troposphere. Vorticity budget shows that wintertime circulation over the western
Himalayas is characterized by a negative generation of vorticity. The relative and planetary vorticity
advection contributes to the horizontal transport of vorticity. The moisture flux transported into the region
shows that in the middle tropospheric levels moisture undergoes phase transformation due to turbulent
exchange and hence releases latent heat.

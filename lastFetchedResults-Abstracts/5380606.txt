When one encounters numerical instability in solving electromagnetic field problems by the momemt method, one often puts the blame on the choice of expansion and weighting functions and so on. The objective of this presentation is to show that the numerical instabilities may not be due to the choice of expansion or weighting functions but is inherent in the method. Three examples are presented to illustrate this point.

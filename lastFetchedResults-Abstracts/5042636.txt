The objective of image fusion is to combine information from multiple images of the same scene to form one composite image that contains a more accurate description of the scene than any one of the individual source images. A multi-focus color image fusion method is proposed in this paper. This method is implemented to perform Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) transform on multi-focus color images to get intensity (I) components, and get wavelet coefficients by taking Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) on I components as basis of calculation of activity level of each pixel, then according to the activity level to form a fused image by a selection mode. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional approaches.

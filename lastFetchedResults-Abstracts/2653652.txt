 Background <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S.
                            aureus</i>) is the most common pathogen responsible for
                            osteomyelitis. Objectives Our objective was to investigate the potential
                            of a probiotic as a treatment for <i>S. aureus</i>-induced
                            infection following fracture fixation in a rat model. Methods Fifty male
                            Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to five groups (Control, <i>S.
                            aureus</i>, <i>S. aureus</i> +ceftriaxone, <i>S.
                            aureus</i> + once weekly probiotic, and <i>S.
                            aureus</i> + twice weekly probiotic). <i>Lactobacillus casei
                            subsp. casei</i> (ATCC: 39392) was selected from eight strains of
                            probiotic bacteria with anti-staphylococcal activity. Infection was
                            induced by inoculation with106 colony-forming units (CFU) of <i>S.
                            aureus</i> in a closed femur fracture model stabilized with an
                            intramedullary pin. Three weeks after the surgery, the development of
                            infection and response to the therapy was documented using radiographs,
                            microbiological and histopathological analysis. Results No bacteria were
                            recovered from rats in the Control group. The analysis of variance
                            revealed a significant difference in the CFU/femur (P &lt; 0.001)
                            and CFU/pin (P = 0.001) across all five treatment groups. When the
                            results were compared, the CFU/femur was significantly lower in the
                            <i>S. aureus</i> + Probiotic twice weekly in comparison with
                            <i>S. aureus</i> (P = 0.008) and the <i>S.
                            aureus</i> + ceftriaxone (P = 0.012) groups. Repeated measure
                            ANOVA to test the radiographic scores during the follow-up time between
                            the intervention groups revealed no significant differences (P = 0.179).
                            Conclusions Parenteral administration of viable <i>L.
                            casei</i> inhibits <i>S. aureus</i>-induced infection
                            as shown by the bacteriologic analysis, but makes no difference to the
                            radiological union rates. This could be the first step towards
                            developing an effective, biologic adjunctive therapy for the management
                            of osteomyelitis following fracture fixation.

An efficient evaluation index system and evaluation model is crucial for effectiveness evaluation of the air defense networked fire control system. This paper, based on pre-research for functions and characteristics of the system, put forth a comprehensive evaluation index system which includes four layers of index hierarchy. Aiming at the characters of some indexes, several evaluation methods are adopted for giving their corresponding evaluation results. Under the condition of networking, the key effect of information stream for exerting system effectiveness is highlighted in this paper. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is employed to establish effectiveness evaluation model for the system. Moreover, to identify the validity of the proposed methods and model, a case study is discussed. The evaluation case shows that the model of effectiveness evaluation is feasible, and capable to carry out objective and reasonable effectiveness evaluation for the system.

Although intentional clock skew can be utilized to reduce the clock period, its application in gated clock designs has not been well studied. A gated clock design includes both data paths and clock control paths, but conventional clock skew scheduling only focus on data paths. Based on that observation, in this paper, we propose an approach to perform the co-synthesis of data paths and clock control paths in a nonzero skew gated clock design. Our objective is to minimize the required inserted delay for working with the lower bound of the clock period (under clocking constraints of both data paths and clock control paths). Different from previous works, our approach can guarantee no clocking constraint violation in the presence of clock gating. Experimental results show our approach can effectively enhance the circuit speed with almost no penalty on the power consumption.

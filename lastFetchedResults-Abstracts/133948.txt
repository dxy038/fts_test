Determining the glycoconjugates's terminal sugars that have a key role on placental development and functions was our objective. Each terminal sugar must be defined in the developmental stage and period does its role.
Placentas that had been obtained from pregnant Balb/c strain mice, were processed in tissue preparation. Using lectin histochemistry, tracing the terminal sugar was done in placentas. Each lectin was specific for only one terminal sugar. Staining and observing the specimens by light microscopy was done. Some photographs were obtained from interesting fields. From 511 gestational day to 11th , only soybean agglutinin (SBA)had positive reaction with specimens. This reaction tapered at I gestational day. Moderate reaction was observed to peanut agglutinin (PNA) in 12th day. High density reaction in some cellular centers were observed to PNA at 13th gestational day. Moderate reaction in whole tissue was observed at 14th day. Reaction to PNA disappeared at 14th day. Low density reaction to lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA)was observed at 15th day. High density reaction in some cellular centers were observed to LTA at 16th gestational day. Reaction to lectins tapered gradually at the terminal days of gestation, and disappeared finally.
Our results suggest that SBA specific terminal sugar has the key role on placental development and functions at 5th to 11th gestational days. PNA Specific terminal sugar has that role at 12th to 14th LTA specific terminal sugar has that key role on 15th to 18th gestational days. 19th to 21th are free from key terminal sugars.

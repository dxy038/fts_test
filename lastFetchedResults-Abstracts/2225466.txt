A 67-year-old woman presented with dysphagia, odynophagia and hoarseness. In her chest X-ray, there was evidence of consolidation associated with loss of volume in the upper lobe of the left lung. Acid-fast bacillus was not seen at the direct smear of the throat exudates. In laryngoscopy, bilateral edema of the arytenoids and exophytic lesions at the posterior commissure were detected. In the biopsy sample of these lesions, acid-fast bacilli were seen. Finally, the patient was treated by anti-tuberculosis drugs.

A cost-effective methods of multiplexing, transmitting, and selecting optical video signals is proposed and demonstrated by using appropriate combinations of bidirectional optical trunk-amplifier, medium-density wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and optical space switching techniques for rapid cost-effective construction. The major factors affecting optical video transport/distribution system design are described. In particular, a tapping-type optical loop-shaped trunk section network is proposed from the viewpoint of system reliability, probability of call-loss, and B-ISDN with analog overlay. The experimental results and design philosophy for an optical selector composed of WDM filters and space switches connected by silica-based waveguide on a chip are also discussed

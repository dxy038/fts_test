Objective
The aim of the study was to describe the average values of the nasal anthropometric measurements in young Turkish male population.
Methods
Study group consisted of 108 volunteer young Turkish males whose age were 18–30 years (mean age 22.31 year). All subjects were students in Yasar Dogu School of Physical Education and Sport of University of Ondokuz Mayis.
Results
The means total length and nasal bridge length of the nose were 56.92 and 55.26 mm, respectively. The means of the nasal bridge width and morphologic nose width were 29.74 and 33.63 mm, respectively. The mean width of the anatomic nose was 23.14 mm. The mean width of the nostril floor was 11.00 mm. The means length and width of the ala were 19.93 and 4.81 mm, respectively. The means of length and width of the columella were 9.34 and 5.34 mm, respectively. The mean frontonasal angle was 134.96° and the mean nasolabial angle was 90.32°.
Conclusion
The nose was the dominant feature in the facial region. Anthropometric measurements related with the nose measured were compared with the available literature. Average values of the nose in this population may be used as a landmark for guidance to plan corrective surgery of the nose.

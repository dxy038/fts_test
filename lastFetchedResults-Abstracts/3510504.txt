The authors present the design of a robust controller using the linear quadratic Gaussian with loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) for nuclear reactors with the objective of maintaining a desirable performance for reactor fuel temperature and the temperature of the coolant leaving the reactor for a wide range of reactor powers. The results obtained are compared to those for an observer-based state feedback optimal reactor temperature controller. Sensitivity analysis of the dominant closed-loop eigenvalues and nonlinear simulation are used to demonstrate and compare the performance and robustness of the two controllers. The LQG/LTR approach is systematic, methodical, and easy to design and can give improved temperature performance over a wide range of reactor operation

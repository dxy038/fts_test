In order to meet the requirement of objective quality assessment for polarization image, this paper presents a novel no-reference IQA (image quality assessment) method based on the degree of noise pollution from the angle of noise detectation. The degree of noise pollution of a image is calculated with all the pixel gradient which value is the least of 4-direction gradients in 8-neighbor or outstretched neighbors. The experiment results show that this method has the properties of no-reference, less complex computation, consist with the result of subjective quality assessment.

Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the regulation of prostaglandin release by oxytocin and the influence of oxytocin on intracellular calcium and on the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system in human amnionâ€“derived WISH cells. Study Design: We determined prostaglandin E release from WISH cells treated with oxytocin, evaluated the cytosolic calcium concentration in single WISH cells by confocal microscopy, and measured both intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and adenylyl cyclase activity after oxytocin treatment. Results: Treatment of WISH cells with oxytocin resulted in a concentration-dependent release of prostaglandin E, which was increased by lithium chloride and inhibited by indomethacin and U-73122. In single WISH cells, oxytocin increased cytosolic calcium. Moreover, the hormone lowered levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate but did not alter adenylyl cyclase activity. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that WISH cells respond to oxytocin by increasing prostaglandin E release. In addition to phospholipase C activation and cytosolic calcium increase, the hormone effect involves also a reduction of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate level.

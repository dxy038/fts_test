In order to obtain high productivity for a cotton crop, one of the major requirements is to establish an adequate plant population. The use of good-quality seed may ultimately be the best approach to attain this goal problem. The objective of this research was to study the effect of N-fertilization (at rates of 95.2 and 142.8 kg of N ha−1), foliar application of K (at rates of 0, 0.38, 0.77, 1.15 kg of K2O ha−1, applied twice during square initiation and boll development stages) and the plant growth retardant (PGR), mepiquat chloride (applied twice, 75 days after planting at 0.0 [control] and 0.048 kg a.i. ha−1, and 90 days after planting at 0.0 [control] and 0.024 kg a.i. ha−1), on seed yield, viability, and seedling vigor of Egyptian cotton (Gossypium barbadense cv. Giza 86). A field experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Research Center, Giza, Egypt in two growing seasons. Growth, mineral uptake, seed yield per plant and per ha, seed weight, seed viability, seedling vigor and cool germination test performance were all found to increase significantly due to the addition of the high N-rate, the foliar application of three potassium concentrations, and the PGR mepiquat chloride. The N and K rates as well as application of mepiquat chloride had no significant effect on the germination rate index in both seasons. Under the conditions of this study, applying N at a rate of 142.8 kg ha−1 combined with spraying cotton plants with K2O at 1.15 kg ha−1 and with mepiquat chloride at 0.048 + 0.024 kg ha−1 were found to improve seed yield as well as seed viability and seedling vigor in the next season.

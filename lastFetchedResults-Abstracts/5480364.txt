This paper deals with oriented engineering application of voltage security analysis of large-scale power systems, including engineering criterion of voltage security, principal objective, and systematic procedure of voltage security assessment. A systematic approach to voltage security assessment is presented in this paper. Example of Yunnan grid voltage security analysis using systematic voltage security analysis method is presented

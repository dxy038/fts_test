Soft start circuit offers guarantee for the normal start of DC-DC converter, and prevents the damage to components. On the basis of introducing principle of soft start circuit, this paper analyses several ways for realizing soft start. Due to the existence of load voltage in bidirectional DC-DC circuit, the ways that mentioned are useless. So an improved method is presented in this paper. We get the simulation result through the use of MATLAB simulation software, and achieve the soft start which controlled by MCU on the existing experimental platform combining with upper computer monitor. All the results indicate the feasibility of this method.

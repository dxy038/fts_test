Context and Objective: One of the major reasons of consolidation of terrorist
movements in the world is the continuation of the financial supply provision
through various channels. Money laundry is one of the most significant supply
sources of these groups and in many cases a dialectic connection is created
between them. In the present paper, with a descriptive-analytic approach,
besides attempting to look into the connection between money laundry and the
continuation of terrorist acts, measures taken by the international society to
confront these two phenomena is dealt with. The main point under scrutiny in
this paper is the connection between money laundry and fortification of terrorist
movements and its subsequent impact on national and international economy.

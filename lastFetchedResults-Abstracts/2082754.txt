The ERICA's European framework that have been proposed to assess the exposure of biota to radionuclides is based on tiered approach: the Tier 1 assessment is based on equilibrium assumptions (constant radioactive releases over time, equilibrium at the interfaces water-suspended matter and water-biota); the Tier 2 assessment allows to use time-dependent and site-specific data to perform a more precise evaluation. The objective of this paper was to compare these two tiers in the context of routine releases from nuclear power plants in freshwater ecosystem. The Loire River where 14 nuclear power plants (NPPs) operate was chosen as a case study and the transport of 60Co in the river, its partition between water and suspended particles and its bioaccumulation was calculated under equilibrium and time-dependent assumptions respectively. Using this case study allowed to quantify the overpredictions linked to conservatisms assumed in Tier 1. Recommendations were identified on when a Tier 2 approach is actually needed.

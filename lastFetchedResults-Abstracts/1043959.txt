Optimal shape of textile structure secures the thermal comfort of the user and is an important factor of the work safety engineering during the work in the unfavorable environmental conditions. The coupled problem is formulated by means of energy and mass balance as well as the experimental relationship. The problem is sensitivity oriented. The sensitivity of an arbitrary functional is analyzed by using direct and adjoint approaches and implemented into the shape optimization. Some objective functionals are formulated. Illustrative numerical example of 2D shape optimization is presented.

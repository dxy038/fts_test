Background and aim: During the past current decades, objective measurements in general and specialy dynamic measurements had been important aspect of evaluation of stuttering. Although these measurements can not replace with perceive judgements but these measurements help us to better diagnosis and treatment. Also we can use these for give feedback of treatment results to patient. Thereforee the purpose of this study was to measure and compare some dynamics characteristics between adult stutterers and nonstutterers.Materials and Methods: Sample ofÂ  this study was 32 adult men including 16 stutterers and 16 nonstutterers. We used from Vowel /a/ prolongation was used for gathering the subjects voice sample.The data by were analysed by Dr. Speech software.Results: According to this research there is not significant difference in average of vocal folds contact quotient and contact index among adult stutterers and nonstutterers. But there is significant difference in average of vocal folds contact quotient perturbation between adult stutterers and nonstutterers.Conclusion: In this research we used vocal folds contact quotient and contact index as factors from occurrence and expanding of stuttering and therefore we concluded that these factors do not have significant role in stuttering occurrence and expanding.

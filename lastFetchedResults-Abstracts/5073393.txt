This article proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (HDABCA), which combines Differential Evolution with Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABCA), for designing the fractional order proportional-integral controller (FO-PI) in a surface-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drive. FOPI controllersÂ´ parameters involve proportionality constant, integral constant and integral order, and hence its design is more intricate than that of usual integral-order proportional-integral controller. Here the synthesis of controller is done according to the objective function considered. In order to digitally realize the fractional order PI controller, an Oustaloup approximation method is used. Simulations and comparisons of proposed HD-ABCA with conventional methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, especially for actuating fractional order plants.

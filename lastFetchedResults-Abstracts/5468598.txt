Measurement of total suspended solids TSS concentration is essential to characterize polluted or turbid marine waters, and to further estimate various water constituents using an optical algorithm. The objective of this work is to design an optical sensor system for measuring the total suspended solids concentration. The proposed instrument measures the radiation scattered by suspended solids in water samples. This optical sensor used light-emitting diodes, LEDÂ´s, as sources, and a silicon photodiode as a detector. The readings were measured using a multimeter. The linear correlation coefficient between the estimated total suspended solids and measured TSS was very high and the root mean square error was low.

In this paper, we focus on the problem with the objective to maximize the system performance, while guaranteeing multiple QoS (quality of service) constraints for wireless data networks accommodating multiclass services with different quality requirements. First, we formulate and solve the opportunistic scheduling problem with multiple general long-term QoS constraints. Then, we generalize this problem to include short-term QoS constraints for real-time multimedia users and long-term QoS constraints for non-real-time data users simultaneously in multiclass services networks. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheduling schemes guarantee the different QoS constraints, and achieve high system performance.

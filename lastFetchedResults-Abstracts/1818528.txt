Objective: To determine the mineral concentration distribution in deciduous enamel by quantitative X-ray microtomography (XMT). Design: Tooth rods (∼2 mm × 2 mm) were removed from the mid-buccal region of 11 deciduous molars. Three XMT slices were taken at 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mm from the amelocemental junction. The distribution and variation in mineral concentration of enamel were studied from the XMT images. Results: The mean mineral concentration for all the teeth was 2.81 (S.D. = 0.065) g cm−3. There was no notable difference in the mean mineral concentration values between the three XMT slices of each tooth. However, there was up to 8% variation between different teeth (2.69–2.92 g cm−3). Gradients of increasing mineral concentration from the amelodentinal junction (ADJ) to the external surface were found, ranging from 0.08 to 0.60 mg cm−3 μm−1 with a mean of 0.366 mg cm−3 μm−1. The mineral concentration gradients in the occlusal slices were steeper than those in the cervical slices. The difference in mineral concentration between the inner and outer enamel ranged from 1.5 to 8.7%. Conclusion: In view of the large variation in both the means and the gradients of mineral concentration in deciduous molars, the mineral distribution of each experimental tooth should be measured as baseline data in studies of caries progression.

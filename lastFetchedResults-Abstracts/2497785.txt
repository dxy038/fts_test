In this paper, an efficient method is presented to control the attitude of a satellite with ON-OFF actuator.
The main objective of this method is to control the amplitude of the limit cycle which commonly appears in
the steady state of such systems, while simultaneously by consideration of real actuator constraints, it
reduces the fuel consumption of system. The proposed method is a combination of a command modifier
(which is based on the set point and the required accuracy of pointing, by means of optimization, it calculates
the desired limit cycle), a phase plane controller (PPC) and a compensator (to compensate for the real
constraints of the actuator). The effectiveness and outperformance of the proposed method is approved in
comparison with the previous methods of attitude control problem through the closed loop simulation and the
stability and robustness of the closed loop system is fully analyzed and illustrated by simulations.

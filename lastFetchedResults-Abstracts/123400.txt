BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Normal blood pressure varies based on age, sex, height and weight, however it is necessary to use standard references to evaluate the values. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of normal blood pressure in 7-11 year old children in Zahedan and compare it with standard references.
METHODS: After taking legal agreements and important information, this study was performed on 1500 students who were chosen by cluster sampling method from primary schools of Zahedan (750 males and 750 females). One hundred fifty persons were randomly selected from each grade of school. Blood pressure was detected at a relax position with standard cuffs. The measurement was repeated two weeks later and the data was evaluated. It was analyzed by Pearson coefficient and multiple regression analysis.
FINDINGS: The results showed that mean of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 7 year old boys were 116 cm, 19.5 kg, 99.5 and 68.5 mmHg and in girls were 117cm, 19 kg, 101 and 70 mmHg, respectively. In 8-year-old boys were 120.6 cm, 21.2 kg, 100 and 68.8 mmHg and in 8-year-old girls were 12.5 cm, 20.2 kg, 101.2, and 70.1 mml Hg, respectively. In 9-year-old boys were 127cm, 23.5 kg, 102 and 70.7 mmHg and in 9-year-old girls were 126.5 cm, 23.5 kg, 102 and 71.5 mmHg, respectively. In 10-year--old boys were 13.6 cm, 25.9kg, 102.1 and 70.7 mmHg and in 10-year-old girls were 132.8cm, 26.1 kg, 103.5 and 71.6 mmHg, respectively. In 11-year-old boys were 136cm, 28 kg, 105.2 and 70.6 mmHg and in 11-year-old girls were 136.6 cm, 29.2 kg, 106.5 and 72.8 mmHg, respectively. Multiple regression analysis and Pearson coefficient showed that these variables have a direct relation and effect with each other.
CONCLUSION: Results showed that systolic blood pressure is nearly comparable with standard range. While diastolic blood pressure is more than the standard range, and height and weight of children are less than the standard range for each percentile.

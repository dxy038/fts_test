The widespread adoption of biometric technologies has proved to be slower and less enthusiastic than predicted, especially in Europe. In order to overcome the current impediments and limitations in existing biometric systems, and thus to increase trust and confidence in biometric solutions, the BioSecure Network of Excellence (NoE) works though integrating multidisciplinary research efforts and facilitating objective evaluations to address a range of challenging issues in the field of biometrics. To achieve these goals the BioSecure Network of Excellence takes in charge the development or improvement of existing open-source systems for speech, face, talking face, signature, fingerprint, hand and iris modalities, as well as for development of multi-modal biometric experiments. These reference systems along with existing publicly available databases and assessment protocols define the building blocks of the BioSecure Integrated Performance Evaluation Framework. This evaluation framework will be put in practice during the 1st BioSecure Residential Workshop. More than sixty doctoral, postdoctoral, senior and invited researchers will meet together during four weeks, to advance mono-modal and multi-modal evaluation experiments integrating reference systems and research prototypes. In this paper more details about this event and the underling research challenges are given. This exercise will lead to a worldwide biometric evaluation campaign to be launched in 2007.

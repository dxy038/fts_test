Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Electronic Product Code (EPC) have received great attention in recent years. The EPCglobal Network uses the Internet to transmit EPC data gathered from RFID tags. Although EPC Network is used to capture and share EPC-related data within a supply chain, the information discovery mechanism is still to be determined so far. In this paper we propose a novel RFID event publishing approach in the IOT based on EPC Network. The objective is to publish the RFID event in different repositories that wish to expose and share their information. In addition, we propose the strategy and algorithm for RFID Event publishing.

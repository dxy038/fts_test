Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors for symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes among women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (defined as ≥4 vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes in 1 year) who were receiving maintenance antifungal therapy.
Study design
A prospective study of 65 women aged ≥18 years with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis who attended vaginitis clinics in Detroit, Mich, and Philadelphia, Pa.
Results
The 9-month risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis recurrence was 41.8%. Almost two fifths of the women reported activity limitations because of vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes, most or all of the time. Younger women and those women with a history of bacterial vaginosis were at increased risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes. Behavioral factors that were associated significantly with increasing vulvovaginal candidiasis recurrence ≥2- fold included wearing pantyliners or pantyhose and consuming cranberry juice or acidophilus-containing products.
Conclusion
The use of pantyliners or pantyhose, consumption of cranberry juice or acidophil-containing products, a history of bacterial vaginosis, and age <40 years were positively associated with a symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis episode

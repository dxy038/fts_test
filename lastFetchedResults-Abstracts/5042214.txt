The objective of expert systems is the use of Artificial Intelligence tools so as to solve problems within specific prefixed applications. This paper deals with the development of an expert system valid to optimize the adaptation transients arising in adaptive control using a logic formalism previously described. Its structure is composed by a supervisor based on an expert network organization and designed to improve the transient performances in the adaptive control of a planar robot. Apart form the basic adaptation scheme consisting of an estimation algorithm plus an adaptive controller, two additional coordinated expert systems are used to update an adaptation gain and the sampling period with a master expert system coordinating both above expert systems.

This paper presents a perspective in a multi-objective geometric programming (MOGP) optimization based on the so-called &#8220;weight deviation sum&#8221;. The quantity is applied to characterize two different weight-assignment schemes involving (i) arbitrarily-chosen weights and (ii) optimized weights. Comparing their weight deviation sums, the optimized scheme can achieve a closer solution to the ideal multi-objective optimum than the conventional arbitrarily-chosen scheme.

This work applies some of the techniques used in mining of association rules in large relational databases to fusion of data from large spatial databases. The specific objective is to show that algorithms developed for the identification of frequent itemsets in the relational databases can be, after slight modifications, successfully used to fuse complex two dimensional objects from large amounts of range data collected with ultrasonic sensors. The paper presents two algorithms that use this approach to construct polylines and polygons from ultrasonic range data

In the multi-agents public traffic control system, the problem about being comfortable is very important. The challenge is to find solutions to achieve the objective minimized amount of vehicles in overload. This paper proposes a solution algorithm for keeping comfortable of public traffic based on grey disaster prediction through principled cooperation between agents that represent traffic command center, traffic operators, and drivers. It is deduced that the algorithm is practical and adaptable to a variety of public traffic networks.

The main objective of the research is to define and propose a framework for data hibernation in the workflows under intrusion threat. When the intrusion is detected, the data services need to be discontinued immediately to retain the security and the integrity of the valuable data, till the system is recovered from the threat. By discontinuing data services, the end users may face inconveniences in using the system because of its temporary unavailability. Data hibernation addresses a mechanism of secure transferring of data and providing an access of the data alternatively keeping the data integrity intact. Data hibernation involves three steps i.e. designing an alternate schema for storing data, transferring data to that alternate storage and providing an access to that data. Hence the system can continue to provide data services securely to the end user even in the threat situations.

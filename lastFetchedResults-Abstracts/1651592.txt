This paper emphasizes material nonlinear effects on composite beams with recourse to the plastic hinge method. Numerous combinations of steel and concrete sections form arbitrary composite sections. Secondly, the material properties of composite beams vary remarkably across its section from ductile steel to brittle concrete. Thirdly, concrete is weak in tension, so composite section changes are dependent on load distribution. To this end, the plastic zone approach is convenient for inelastic analysis of composite sections that can evaluate member resistance, including material nonlinearities, by routine numerical integration with respect to every fiber across the composite section. As a result, many researchers usually adopt the plastic zone approach for numerical inelastic analyses of composite structures. On the other hand, the plastic hinge method describes nonlinear material behaviour of an overall composite section integrally. Consequently, proper section properties for use in plastic hinge spring stiffness are required to represent the material behaviour across the arbitrary whole composite section. In view of numerical efficiency and convergence, the plastic hinge method is superior to the plastic zone method. Therefore, based on the plastic hinge approach, how to incorporate the material nonlinearities of the arbitrary composite section into the plastic hinge stiffness formulation becomes a prime objective of the present paper. The partial shear connection in this paper is by virtue of the effective flexural rigidity as AISC 1993 [American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). Load and resistance factor design specifications. 2nd ed., Chicago; 1993]. Nonlinear behaviour of different kinds of composite beam is investigated in this paper, including two simply supported composite beams, a cantilever and a two span continuous composite beam.

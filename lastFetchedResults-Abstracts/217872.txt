The main objective of this research is to compare two different irrigation methods according to parametric evaluation system in an area of 77706 ha in Shavoor Region in Khuzestan province, Southwest of Iran. Soil properties of the study area including texture, depth, electrical conductivity, drainage, calcium carbonate content and slope were derived from a semi-detailed soil study regarding Shavoor plain in a scale of 1/20000. After analyzing and evaluating soil properties by means of Geographic Information System (GIS), suitability maps were generated for both methods. The results showed that 14952.07 ha of the studied area were highly suitable for drip Irrigation method though not suitable enough for the surface irrigation method. Also, it was found that some series coded 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 22 and 23 covering an area of 27578.26 ha were not suitable to be used under both irrigation systems. Ultimately, drip irrigation system was suggested as the best method to be applied to the said study area. The main limiting factors in using both surface and drip irrigation methods in this area were soil salinity and drainage.

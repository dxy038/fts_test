A workflow model is the formal representation of a business process. The process perspective of a workflow model, which describes the control logic of workflow, is at the heart of most workflow specifications. Whether the control logic of a workflow is correct directly affects the realization of corresponding business objective. According to the fact that many workflow management systems only allow for free choice workflow processes, a Petri net-based verification approach is proposed in this paper for the control logic verification of a workflow model. It is proved that the proposed method has polynomial time complexity.

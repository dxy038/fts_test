Background and Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common disorder of endocrine among the women capable of reproduction. This disorder involves 6-7 percent of women. With regard to mental health, disorders such as depression and eating disorder can be seen and a change in their quality of life is expected.
Materials and Methods: One thousand and eight hundred and twenty four female students were evaluated psychologically in order to assess the prevalence and development of polycystic ovary syndrome. The students suffering from polycystic ovary were assessed mentally.
Results'. Eighty students between 15-18 years old were suffering from PCOS. Previous family problems were significantly higher in control group (P=0.03). There were no significant differences in terms of drug misuse, committing suicide, physical problems and daily sleepiness. Depression symptoms were observed in 38.3 percent of control group and 32.6 percent of sufferers of PCOS. Anxiety assessment indicated that 22.5 percent of PCOS group and 22.3 percent of control group were suffering from anxiety. Conclusion: Despite universal reports regarding psychological effects of PCOS in the quality of life of adult sufferers such as depression, sleeping and eating disorders, such differences were not observed in our PCOS study group. This may indicate the role of age in developing psychological disorders among the sufferers. Moreover, parameters such as cultural factors, the importance of considering own physical state and the impact of social view on interpersonal relationships can play an important role.

In this paper we present a no-reference objective quality measure for stereoscopic 3D videos generated by depth image-based rendering (DIBR). At first we will derive an ideal depth estimate for each pixel value. The ideal depth estimate will then be used to calculate three distortion measures: temporal outliers (TO), temporal inconsistencies (TI), and spatial outliers (SO). The combination of the three measures constitute the proposed no-reference measure. Its performance is verified using subjective DMO S scores and compared to the full reference version of the proposed algorithm. The subjective results show that the proposed measure highly correlates with subjective scores and is close in performance to the full reference version of the measure.

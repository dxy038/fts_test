We used 32 Radarsat SAR images collected between 1996 and 2001 over the Roanoke River floodplain, North Carolina (USA), to assess the utility of C-HH Radarsat SAR for operationally mapping flooding beneath forest canopies. Our objective was to test the sensitivity of standard-beam Radarsat to flooded forests under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions, and at multiple incidence angles (ranging from 10-46&#176;). We found that winter (leaf-off images) could be used to accurately map flooding (&gt;95% accuracy) regardless of incidence angle. Mapping accuracy was acceptable for leaf-on images (&gt;85%) but was nevertheless significantly lower than for leaf-off images. Images at shallow incidence angles (e.g. S6 mode, 41-46&#176;) were especially affected by speckle in the interpretations, whereas images acquired at very steep incidence angles (extended low beam, 10-23&#176;) exhibited a substantial amount of geometric feature displacement that limited their utility for practical applications. For mature forests, forest structure (independent of leaf-on or leaf-off status) did not appear to affect the ability to map flooding; however, separate interpretations were required to delineate flooding in very young, dense successional stands (&lt;15 years). When controlling for flooding status, we found that Radarsat images were sensitive (in a statistical sense) to some components of forest structure (basal area, canopy height, crown depth), especially if both leaf-on and leaf-off images and images acquired at multiple angles were used for the analysis.

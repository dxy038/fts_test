The optimization design based on the improved Simulated Annealing Algorithm was made for the induction motors with high voltage of YKK series according to the design rule in which several motors are of the same stator lamination. The lowest effective material cost and the highest efficiency for the every motor were taken for the mix objective, and the excellent results were achieved. The efficiencies of all motors in the series reach or excess the standards of the high-efficiency motors. The optimal design results have been applied in the practice engineering.

This paper presents a new scheme to model transients in power systems. Since transients are nonstationary both in time and space, their analysis and characterization are difficult, and the traditional method of Fourier transform and short-time Fourier transform have their limitations in transient analysis. Here, the authors propose the use of a new time-frequency multiresolution wavelet analysis of transients in power systems. The final objective is to build an intelligent transient recorder, which is capable of detecting and classifying power system transients by type from the transient waveform signature based on an effective and efficient wavelet modelling and characterization

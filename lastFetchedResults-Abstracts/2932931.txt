We present an video objective quality measure which has good correlation with subjective tests. We then introduce the objective measure into the design of an MPEG encoder. The new MPEG encoder extracts four features (bit rate, a feature that measures blockiness, one that measures false edges, and one that measures blurred edges) from the input and output video sequences and feeds those features into a four-layered back-propagation neural network which has been trained by subjective testing. Then the system uses a simple feedback technique to adjust the GOP (group of pictures) bit-rate to achieve a constant subjective quality output video sequence

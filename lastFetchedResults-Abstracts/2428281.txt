A one-dimensional (1-D) vertical draining test for Jumunjin sand was carried out in one-step and multi-step outflow conditions. An inverse analysis method was conducted to determine the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil. A non-linear optimization method combining a finite element code and inversion analysis was used to minimize the objective function, defined by the difference between observed and predicted data. Unsaturated hydraulic parameters in van Genuchten model were estimated using soil suction measurements in 10 cm intervals and an outflow rate at the bottom of a sand column. The predicted hydraulic properties and the experimental results were in close agreement when the measurements were compared from the one-step and multi-step outflow experiments. The results also showed that the multi-step outflow experiment was more appropriate in determining the unsaturated hydraulic properties than the one-step outflow experiment. The comparison between predicted and measured results concluded that the inverse analysis based on the 1-D outflow experiment was reliable and useful to determine the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils.

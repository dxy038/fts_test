Summary
uous professional development (CPD) is essential in modern day nursing. Learning needs analysis (LNA) is an important element of CPD. This paper describes the development of a LNA tool for multiple sclerosis specialist nurses. The tool contains an empirically developed LNA schedule and uses a blend of both subjective and objective exercises to help the nurse formulate a comprehensive learning plan. The tool is organised into four phases: phase 1, focuses on the knowledge and skills necessary to the fulfilment of work-based objectives; phase 2, involves a more in-depth assessment of particular areas of professional knowledge; phase 3, examines learning strategies; and phase 4, involves the development of a learning plan. The tool has been implemented throughout the UK via local trainers. While the tool was developed for a specialist nurse population the principles upon which it is based are likely to be transferable to other nursing contexts.

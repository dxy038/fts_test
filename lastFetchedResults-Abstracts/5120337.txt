The main objective of this paper is to give detailed analysis of a Dual Band fractal antenna operating simultaneously at L and S Band. A L/S band Sierpinski fractal stacked multilayer patch antenna has been designed, and analyzed for achieving -4 dBi gain at plusmn50 degree using Ansoft Designer Tool. To evaluate the performance of this dual band antenna in comparison to two separate antennas, efforts are also made to design two separate triangular patch antennas resonating at individual L and S band frequencies. The analyzed performance of the antenna indicates two distinct frequency bands, meeting the VSWR requirement and its gain radiation pattern. The designed topology of the dual band fractal antenna can be employed for satellite navigation.

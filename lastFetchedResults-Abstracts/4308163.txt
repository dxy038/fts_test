Taking pneumatic ABS as study object, the pneumatic system, braking system and the vehicle were modeled. Then, the CARIMA model of ABS was derived. Taking wheel slip rate as the control object, the reference trajectory function and the objective function was established. Thus, the general predictive control law was got. Considering the inertia of the braking system, the vehicle was modeled using matlab. The control system was established and the simulation was done, good results were got. Simulation results show that good result can be got applying GPC to ABS.

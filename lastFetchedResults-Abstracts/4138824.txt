The Marine Engineering Laboratory (MEL), the Annapolis Division, Naval Ship R&amp;D Center, has developed a procedure for the development of long-range R&amp;D planning particularly aimed at the logical objective determination of the requirements imposed on new ship procurement by the Navy mission. Starting from a broad concept suggested by Naval Ship Systems Command (NAVSHIPSYSCOM), MEL has developed the structure of a procedure which, when completed and validated, will provide a logical, objective determination of future requirements and a standardized format for Ship System Formulation. The structure consists of mission objectives, vehicle types, specific techniques and components, as well as forecasts of the functional capabilities techniques and components.

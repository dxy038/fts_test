In this paper, three &#8220;compositive&#8221; additive models of DEA( Data Envelopment Analysis) with preferential cones are introduced, some concepts of the non-dominated solutions with cones in multi-objective programming generalized. Necessary and sufficient conditions are formed around the models to identify non-dominated solutions. This provides a basis for effecting contacts with other disciplines and other parts of DEA.

The blocking performance of wavelength routing WDM optical networks can be improved by employing wavelength conversion. In this paper, we address the problem of optimally placing a limited number of wavelength converters in mesh topologies. Two objective functions, namely, minimizing the average blocking probability and minimizing the maximum blocking probability over all routes, are considered. We first extend an earlier analytical model to compute the blocking probability on an arbitrary route in a mesh topology, given the traffic and locations of converters. We then propose heuristic algorithms to place wavelength converters, and evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristics using the analytical model

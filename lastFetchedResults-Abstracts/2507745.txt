Background: The electrocardiogram artifact is a major contamination in the elec
tromyogram signals when electromyogram signal is recorded from upper trunk mus
cles and because of that the contaminated electromyogram is not useful.
Objective: Removing electrocardiogram contamination from electromyogram
signals.
Methods: In this paper, the clean electromyogram signal, electrocardiogram artifact
and electrocardiogram signal were recorded from leg muscles, the pectoralis major
muscle of the left side and V4, respectively. After the pre-processing, contaminated
electromyogram signal is simulated with a combination of clean electromyogram and
electrocardiogram artifact. Then, contaminated electromyogram is cleaned using adap
tive subtraction method. This method contains some steps; (1) QRS detection, (2) for
mation of electrocardiogram template by averaging the electrocardiogram complexes,
(3) using low pass flter to remove undesirable artifacts, (4) subtraction.
Results: Performance of our method is evaluated using qualitative criteria, power
spectrum density and coherence and quantitative criteria signal to noise ratio, relative
error and cross correlation. The result of signal to noise ratio, relative error and cross
correlation is equal to 10.493, 0.04 and %97 respectively. Finally, there is a compari
son between proposed method and some existing methods.
Conclusion: The result indicates that adaptive subtraction method is somewhat
effective to remove electrocardiogram artifact from contaminated electromyogram
signal and has an acceptable result.

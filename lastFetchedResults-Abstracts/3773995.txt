A new approach to the design of a class of positive systems is described. The approach consists, essentially, of a parameter optimization of the system structure with respect to a certain objective function evaluated when the system reaches its stationary state. The positiveness of the system, in particular the Frobenius-Perron properties, are exploited to convert the above design problem into a constrained optimization problem which, in turn, can be solved by standard methods.

The development of mathematical dynamical models of the pretreatment process in reverse osmosis plants is presented. The objective is to use the models for testing and comparison of control strategies in reverse osmosis plants. Thus, these models have been developed to implement them using off-the-shelf software (EcoSimPro), so that advanced control algorithms can be easily tested. During modeling, the parameters are selected to be simple to obtain from available plant measurements.

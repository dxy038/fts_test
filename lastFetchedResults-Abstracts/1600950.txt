The objective of this article is to discuss the modelling and simulation of the motion of oil spots in the open sea, and the effect on the pollutant concentration when a polluted water pumping ship follows a pre-assigned trajectory to remove the pollutant. We assume here that the oil spots motion is due to the coupling of diffusion, the transport from the wind, sea currents and pumping process and the reaction due to the extraction of oil, implying that the mathematical model will be of advection–reaction–diffusion type. Our discussion includes the description of a parallelization of the selected numerical procedure. We present some results of numerical experiments showing that indeed the parallelization makes the model evaluation more efficient.

A bidirectional down-link CATV/fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and up-link FTTH transport system is proposed. By employing &#8722;1 side-mode injection-locked and optoelectronic feedback techniques in our system, brilliant performances are experimentally observed in both downstream and upstream transmissions.

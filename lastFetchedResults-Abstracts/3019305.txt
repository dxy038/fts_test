In this paper, a recurrent-type of neural network in the form of a three-layer bidirectional symmetrical or asymmetrical associative memory is presented. The network possesses desired structural features of a bidirectional associative memory and a three-layer feedforward neural network. The network allows two modes of memory recall, namely, recalling by a pattern-pair from both layers 0 and 2 inputs, and recalling by one pattern from either the layer 0 or 2 input. Simulation results on noisy alpha-numeral type of autoassociative and heteroassociative pattern recognition problems are given.

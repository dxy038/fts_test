Multifractal (MF) approach was applied for the analysis of ultraviolet/visible (UV/VIS) spectra as an independent confirmation of the diagnostic efficacy of UV/VIS spectral analysis of intraperitoneal fluids, ascites, taken from patients with a known clinical diagnosis. Recently, it was reported that from UV/VIS spectra differentiation of malignant from benign ascites is possible. Here, it was shown that by using MF analysis of UV/VIS spectra, the objective classification of UV/VIS spectra is possible. The applicability of UV/VIS analysis and MF classification of spectra were evaluated on N=68 cases, of which M=64 and B=4 were clinically confirmed as malignant and benign, respectively. The overall diagnostic efficacy was 89.71% when using on-line analysis of UV/VIS spectra (61 out of 68 samples were positively recognized: 58 malignant and 3 benign), and even 95.59% by using off-line MF classsification (65 out of 68 samples were classified correctly: 63 malignant and 2 benign). It can be inferred that UV/VIS spectral analysis of ascites, combined with MF analysis, could be suggested as a successful and safe screening method in the evaluation of intraperitoneal fluids.

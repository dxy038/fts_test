Abstract Introduction:
Minerals are a large class of micronutrients, most of which are considered essential for metabolism. Deficiency in such materials leads to serious disorders.
The objective of this study is evaluation of potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, iron and zinc intakes in Rasht and Qazvin. Material and Methods:
This cross-sectional study was performed in two areas of Rasht and Qazvin in 2003 on 1100 people. Dietary
assessment was performed. Chi-square-test was used for statistical analysis.
Results:
More than 3/4 of people in these areas receive adequate potassium (2000 to 4000mg/d). The calcium and magnesium intakes are not taken adequately especially by women in Rasht. Phosphorous is taken enough in all people (>800 mg). In Rasht, only 4.2% and in Qazvin 9.9% of women receive adequate quantities of iron >20mg/d. Moreover, most of the people do not receive adequate quantities of zinc (less than 10 mg/d). Conclusion:
Calcium, iron and zinc intakes are not adequate, particularly in women.

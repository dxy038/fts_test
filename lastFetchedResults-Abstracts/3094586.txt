The convergence of computers, the Internet, and wide variety of interactive video devices, in most of the multimedia applications, all using different color representations, is forcing the digital designer today to convert between them. The objective is to have a converter, which will be useful for number of applications with a basic function of converting from one color space to another. This paper discusses a PCI based system for one such conversion i.e. R´G´B´ to YCbCr conversion with reconfigurable hardware which is necessary in many video designs. The reference design files show VHDL code to describe the conversion equations and synthesize to a target field programming gate array (FPGA). Simulation test vectors (25%, 50 %, 75 % RGB color bars) are also provided. As an implementation example placed and routed design in a Spartan II device (2S200PQ208) is discussed. Results using this conversion method show the achieved improvement in speed factor as compared to the existing tools and have been verified successfully with no visually perceptual errors in the transformed and the reconstructed images.

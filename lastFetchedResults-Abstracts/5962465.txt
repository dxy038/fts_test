Hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed for optimizing the power voltage control systems according to number of control actions. The advantage of HGA is its capability in control the parametric genes of chromosome. In this paper, we apply HGA to find out the optimal solution for coordinate voltage control in a simple six buses power system. The number of control actions is fixed from one to six by HGA. Because of the multi-objective classification of the obtained solutions, all these solutions could therefore form a landscape of control pattern which is aptly applicable to the control purpose of coordinate power control system. The application of the proposed paradigm is demonstrated through simulation and the results obtained suggested that the speed of voltage recovery in some degree related with the number of actions of control when emergency happened. The effective of control is influenced by the location of control devices and the system structure.

A characteristic of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is to allow individual decision making units (DMUs) to select the factor weights which are the most advantageous for them in calculating their efficiency scores. This flexibility in selecting the weights, on the other hand,deters the comparison among DMUs on a common base. For dealing with this difficulty and assessing all the DMUs on the same scale, this paper proposes using a multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) approach based on scalarizing function for generating common set of weights under the DEA framework. This is an advantageous of the proposed approach against general approaches in the literature which
are based on multiple objective nonlinear programming.

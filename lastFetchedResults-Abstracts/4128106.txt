The paper is a transcript of the authorÂ´s notes of an objective investigation of the thermal, electricity supply and economic problems associated with the warming of substantially constructed buildings of the surface air-raid shelter type. It examines&#194;&#191;inter alia&#194;&#191;the factors of thermal contrast existing between normal buildings and structures of the type under discussion; why, where, when and how heat energy should be transmitted to the occupants; the pros and cons of radiant and convective forms of space-heaters; the thermal capacity of the structure; conditions conducive to surface condensation or sweating, and the like. The design and construction of a floor-warming installation are examined in detail, the performance data obtained during an 8-week test run are analysed, and the paper concludes with a series of estimates of the seasonal consumption of energy, and of the total costs involved in maintaining various standards of thermal comfort in shelters of the type discussed, based on data obtained during the test period.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the osseous constraint related to forced forearm external rotation as the initial stage in a posterior elbow dislocation. Six joint specimens without soft tissues were examined in a joint analysis system developed for simulation of dislocation. The osseous stability, expressed as the maximal torque needed for pathologic external forearm rotation, increased from varus to valgus stress (P = .0001) and from 10° to 90° of elbow flexion (P = .012) and also tended to increase from forearm supination to pronation. The work of pathologic external forearm rotation until the point of maximal torque decreased from a maximum in full extension to a minimum at 30° of elbow flexion (P = .03). The elbow in a slightly flexed position, varus stress, and forearm external rotation trauma might be the important biomechanical factors in the posterior elbow dislocation, and they might serve as guidelines during clinical investigation for posterolateral instability.

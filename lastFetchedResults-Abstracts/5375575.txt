We propose a measure to characterize the energy efficiency of algorithms for localization in wireless networks. The measure presented differs from previous approaches in that it is bounded and supports objective comparison. Furthermore, it corresponds to the general understanding that a high value should indicate high efficiency. Simulation results for localization using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), for least squares estimation (LS) and for multidimensional scaling (MDS) are briefly discussed.

The objective of this work is modelling and optimisation of sheet bending process by means of numerical simulation. One of the problems to be solved in the sheet metal forming processes of thin sheets is the taking into account of the effects of technological process parameters so that the part takes the desired mechanical characteristics. Accordingly, it has been a crucial research subject for designing bending tools guaranteeing an optimal performance of products in terms of mechanical properties and good rigidity. In this paper, we propose a numerical procedure allowing the definition of the optimal values of process parameters in flanging operation, which minimises the residual stresses and the material damage at the end of the bending phase. The concept of continuum damage mechanics fully coupled with elasto-plasticity has been retained to describe the progressive damage accumulation into the sheet metal. According to parametric investigation on the maximum stress and calculated damage values, it has been found that the punch-die clearance and the die radius have significant effects on mechanical behaviour of parts. An application of design of experiments was developed as a preliminary step for the optimisation of the process parameters by using response surface methodology. This model allows the identification of the influential parameters of an optimisation problem and the reduction of the number of evaluations of the objective function.

Objective To test the impact of socio-economic and
psychological adversity and healthcare on long-term
recovery from depression.
Method A community sample of 347 people with
depressive disorders was followed up after 9 years.
Baseline socio-economic adversity, social support, healthcare
use, and psychiatric history were identified. Respondents
completed self-report instruments on current
depressive status (Beck depression inventory) and longstanding
psychosocial adversity (sexual, physical or emotional
abuse). Univariate analyses tested for association
between recovery and respondent characteristics.
Results Follow-up was achieved for 182 (52%) of the
sample, of whom 75 (41%) indicated recovery from
depression. Psychological adversity definitely and socioeconomic
adversity probably were associated with lack of
recovery. Baseline healthcare had no apparent impact on
outcome. Rurality and support after life events were
associated with recovery. History of depression was associated
with non-recovery.
Conclusion Psychological adversity is, and socio-economic
adversity may be, associated with long-term nonrecovery
from depression in community settings

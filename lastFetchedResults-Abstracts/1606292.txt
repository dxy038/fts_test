BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative diseases. According to the positive effects of unsaturated fatty acids of sesame oil on neurons membrane and causing defense against free radicals, the aim of this study was to investigate the reinforcing effects of sesame oil on spatial memory in Alzheimer's rat. 
METHODS: In this experimental study, 35 male rats weighing approximately 200±50 gram were divided in five equal groups: control, sham (salin recipient), Alzheimer's model (ICV injection of streptozotocin) and 2 groups of Alzheimer's model + sesame oil pretreatment (8 and 5 ml/kg by IP for 28days). Alzheimer's model was induced by ICV injection of streptozotocin (1.5 mg/kg). The Morris Water maze was used for studying the spatial learning memory.
FINDINGS: Intraventricular injection of streptozotocin damaged the spatial memory. Pretreatment of sesame oil (5 and 8 ml/kg; 28 days by ip injection) significantly (p < 0.05) improved the reduced spatial memory in Alzheimer's rat. 
CONCLUSION: Long-term pretreatment of rats with sesame oil prevents from reduced spatial memory in Alzheimer’s rat.

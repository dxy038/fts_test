The objective of every religious state, and especially that of the Islamic state, is to assure justice. In this research we examine the Iranian economy’s performance in this regard, with an emphasis on Imam Ali’s approach in the treaty of Malik-e-Ashtar. In the course of data analysis, at first, using quantitative method and the data regarding Gini coefficient and calculating Atkinson index, the first criterion introduced in the treaty of Malik-e-Ashtar, that is, reducing poverty and inequality, is examined in order to assess Iranian economy’s performance. The Gini coefficient and Atkinson index have a fluctuating trend in the relevant period. Thereafter, drawing on the experts’ views, the other criteria mentioned in the treaty are examined using questionnaire and field data gathering. The questionnaire data are analyzed using SPSS19 software.
The results show that the score regarding justice in our present society is 2, while the score regarding the ideal society is 5. The gap between the present and ideal situations is calculated at 60 percent. In order to determine the utmost reducible gap between the present and ideal situations through improvement of a presupposed standard, we use another index called “criterion reducibility.” Adopting the dynamic system method and meta-innovative methods exploiting vensim software, the indigenous behavior in the socio-economic system is simulated and examined, and five different scenarios are presented as policy solutions. The results show that if one gives a shock of positive step sort to each of the introduced variables in the different scenarios, the society’s situation regarding justice will be improved in different degrees in the years 2014-2025.

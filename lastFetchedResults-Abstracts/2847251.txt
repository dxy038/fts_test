Compared with the conventional optimization approaches, Gauss Pseudospectral Method (GPM) can deal better with optimal problems with complex constraints and is less time consuming. As a numerical technique, GPM transforms the optimal control problem to a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) by using discrete approximation. This paper considers a cruise missile´s mission which is to hit a fixed target while minimizing the exposure to anti-air defenses. The objective function can be set as integrated altitude along the trajectory. The Gpops tool kit is used to demonstrate GPM on this problem. The case study´s results show that the method converges fast and precisely.

In recent years, distributed generation (DG) and renewable energies source (RES) are attracting special attention to distribution systems. Renewable energies, such as photovoltaic and wind turbine generator systems, are used as green energy. However, the large amount of distributed generation causes voltage deviation beyond the statutory range in distribution systems. Furthermore, power flow at interconnection point is fluctuated substantially. So distribution systems need a solution for voltage control and power flow control method. This paper proposes a decision technique of optimal reference scheduling of the battery energy storage system(BESS), controllable loads(CL), interfaced inverters with DG, and the existing voltage control devices for optimal distribution system operation. In this proposed method, the formulated control objective is solved by optimization algorithm. The proposed method achieves the following a tunes: The node voltage is maintained in the acceptable range, the fluctuations of active and reactive power flows are reduced at the interconnection point in the distribution system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations using MATLAB<sup>&#174;</sup>.

Past works showed that the degradation of the electronic devices caused by aging could induce failures of electronic system, including a harmful evolution of electromagnetic compatibility. This paper presents the impact of accelerated aging conditions on several typical passive components (electrolytic capacitor, iron powder inductor). The preliminary degradation models of electrolytic capacitor and powder iron inductor are proposed based on experimental results and physical analysis. The overall objective of this study is to predict the evolution of electromagnetic emission level produced by a buck DC-DC converter under a thermal aging, by using these passive device degradation models.

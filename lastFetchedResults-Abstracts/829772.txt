he main aim of this paper is to attain an understanding of identity which is realized in two levels of individual and society. The article is thus divided into two sections: (individual) identity and nationality based on the belief that nationality is in fact the same as collective identity and has an objective and social validity. In the first section the writer presents a definition of the various dimensions of identity. Assuming that, scientifically and historically, material identity has little validity; the writer discusses spiritual identity as a religiously valid identity and argues that the enemy has targeted this identity in other nations. In the second section, the wrier discusses nationality from a religious point of view, and concludes that nationalism can be used in two positive and negative senses, the latter sense being always used by the enemy. In the former sense, the writer argues, nationalism involves the defense of one’s country, which is not only not negative, but an act so strongly supported by religion and intellect, but the biased praise of one’s country at the price of other human values has dealt strong blows on Islam and the concept of the unified ummah. The writer concludes by touching on the concept of postmodern nationalism, which is a baffling mix.

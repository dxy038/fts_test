Massive parallel computing (MPC) originally appeared in the arena of multi-core processors and graphic processing units with parallel computing architecture. Nevertheless, most embedded software is still written in C, therefore C code parallelization is being subject of many ongoing R&amp;D efforts. The most prominent approaches to parallelization of C code include Intel Cilk Plus, OpenCL, vfAnalyst, etc. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the automatic parallelization of existing sequential C code, without any source code modifications/annotations, by proposing two appropriate algorithms for parallelization, Block algorithm, and Operation based algorithm.

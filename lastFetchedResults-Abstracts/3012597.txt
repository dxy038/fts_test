We consider single machine scheduling problem with dynamic job arrival and total weighted tardiness and makespan as objective functions. The machine is subject to disruptions related to late raw material arrival and machine breakdowns. We propose several reactive algorithms to guide the execution of the jobs and to hedge against the presence of perturbations in the shop floor. These algorithms are based on flexible predictive schedules characterized by a partial order of jobs. The efficiency of these algorithms is shown through some computational experiments.

The effects of two antifungal agents (natamycin, potassium sorbate) were compared on the mould growth on the surface of dry sausages (both heat treated and fermented). The mould growth was studied on fermented sausage Presporska salama and heat treated dry sausage Vysocina after the production and during the ripening and storage. Different samples were prepared: two natamycin treated (0.1% and 0.2%) and one potassium sorbate treated (2%), the control sample was not treated. All the samples were inoculated with spores of Penicillium nalgiovense and their germination and growth were monitored. An objective evaluation of the growth was carried out using video image analysis (NIS Element software 2.30). Natamycin proved to be the most efficient in the suppression of mould growth.

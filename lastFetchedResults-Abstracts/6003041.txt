The implications of legislation, acts of terrorism directed at air transport, have led to the development of a number of pieces of equipment that are capable of automatically screening luggage items for explosive materials. These systems, known as explosive detection systems (EDSs) have the high throughput combined with realistic detection and false alarm rates that mass screening at busy airports requires. The paper describes the advances that have been made in baggage X-ray technology, with reference to systems implemented at airports, that have allowed this automated screening process. A programme for the objective testing of EDSs is described in detail. Because these systems are used to screen the luggage of foreign nationals, the acceptance criteria must be internationally agreed. This process is outlined

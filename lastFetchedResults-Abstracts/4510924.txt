In this work the modeling and optimization of finite burn maneuver between two given coplanar elliptical orbits, with minimum fuel consumption, is presented. This problem changed into a Two-Point Boundary Value problem. The analysis is carried out for different initial true anomalies and transfer durations. The objective of this algorithm is to find the time of ignition, true anomaly and magnitude, and direction of thrust such that the desired state at entry interface is achieved. A performance between the impulsive and finite burn models is also compared. This method provides an efficient and time saving method for real Finite burn maneuvers. The upper stage is supposed to be in a Keplerian motion controlled by the thrust, that is assumed to be of various magnitudes and directions, results of simulations are also presented.

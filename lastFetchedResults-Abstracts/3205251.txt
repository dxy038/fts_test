A design of phase diversity receiver for an ISDB-T is proposed in this paper. The objective is to improve the quality of the receiving signal by a simple hardware. The phase value of each receiving antennas are adjusted by named downhill simplex or amoeba algorithm, considering cross correlation between the head guard interval and the tail guard interval of the OFDM symbol as a cost function. We confirmed the BER improvement in the Rayleigh fading environment with several delay spreads by numerical simulation. The algorithm employed here has rapid convergence time to follow the Rayleigh fading.

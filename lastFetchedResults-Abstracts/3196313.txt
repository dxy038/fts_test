This paper shows the usefulness of the nonlinear controller realizing periodic motion of monorotor UAV by experiments. Monorotor UAV has no equilibrium point. So, the control target is semi-hovering; a motion that passes desired non-equilibrium point at which height and attitude stop periodically. In order to achieve this control objective, we propose discontinuous and time-varying output zeroing controller which allows zero dynamics to be controlled. The numerical simulation and experiments show the validity of suggesting controller design method.

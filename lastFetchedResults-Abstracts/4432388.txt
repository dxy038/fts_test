In this paper, we propose a very effective method for removing blocking artefacts that are typically introduced by a block-based coding. The method combines an error-compensation interpolation and an adaptive spatial-varying filtering (SVF). Without destroying most key image information, the proposed method uses different filtering processes based on a simple region classification. It is observed that, compared with the coded image, this proposed scheme not only increases the resulting PSNR, but also significantly improves the visual quality. In addition, the gains (subjective and objective) that are achieved with our method are comparable to or slightly better than several other de-blocking schemes recently reported in literatures.

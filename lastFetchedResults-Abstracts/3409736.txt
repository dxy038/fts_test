This paper defines a narrow sense (NS) Pareto optimality and shows that the NS Pareto optimality is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium for electricity producers. It claims that a vector optimization is a generalized multi-objective optimization, which can be solved using the Kuhn-Tucker vector optimization theorem (KTVOT). The paper establishes a mathematical relationship between the Pareto optimality, the Nash-Cournot gaming, and KTVOT, based on a gaming model for deregulated electricity markets.

This paper addresses the problem of regulating a discrete-time linear uncertain and time-varying system to the origin. It is shown that, based on an interpolation technique, by minimizing an appropriate objective function, how feasibility and a robustly and asymptotically stable closed-loop behavior can be achieved. It is shown that the control is a piecewise afflne and continuous function of the state. Several simulations demonstrate the performance of our results.

In this study, the 3-h period measured wind speed data for years 2003–2007 at 10 m, 30 m and 40 m heights for one of the provinces of Iran. Semnan have been statistically analyzed to determine the potential of wind power generation. This paper presents the wind energy potential at five towns in the province – Biarjmand, Damghan, Garmsar, Semnan, and Shahrood. Extrapolation of the 10 m data, using the Power Law, has been used to determine the wind data at heights of 30 m and 40 m. From the primary evaluation and determining mean wind speed and also weibull distribution, it is found that Damghan has better potential for using wind energy in the province. Thus concentrated on Damghan town and its sites – Moalleman, Haddadeh and also Kahak of Garmsar (only had Meteorological stop) using a 10-min time step wind speed and wind direction data for three measured heights. Between these sites, Moalleman is selected for a more accurate and spacious analysis. The objective is to evaluate the most important characteristic of wind energy in the studied site. The statistical attitudes permit us to estimate the mean wind speed, the wind speed distribution function, the mean wind power density and the wind rose in the site at the height of 10 m, 30 m and 40 m. Some local phenomena are also considered in the characterization of the site.

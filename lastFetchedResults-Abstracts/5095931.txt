The aim of this study is to develop a method of lesion extraction from a large image of a skin surface and evaluate a new set of color features and their ability to classify the extracted skin lesions. It is beneficial for a dermatologist to be able to take a snapshot of a large skin surface and have an automated system locate and diagnose atypical lesions. The proposed system accomplishes this task and is designed to be used by dermatologists as a completely integrated analytical tool to improve the rate of correct diagnosis well above 90%. Simulations are implemented to show extraction of skin lesions and how their features are measured as well as classification results. The outcomes showed that the computer aided diagnosis model discussed in this paper has an improved classification performance and is an objective diagnostic tool that can be used in medical practice.

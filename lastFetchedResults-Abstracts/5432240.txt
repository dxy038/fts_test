The performance of a reconfigurable telecommunication satellite payload strictly depends on the architecture of its high-power section. This paper trades-off two multi-amplifier architectures based on both standard traveling-wave Tubes (TWTAs) and MPAs (Multiport Amplifiers), with the objective of assessing the provided on-board power flexibility, the overall DC-RF power efficiency and power consumption.

In this work, performance analysis and interpolation of turbo codes over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels is presented. The objective is to determine whether a combination of turbo codes and modulation schemes establishes a highly efficient coded modulation technique that may keep bit error rate at a minimum in various communication systems and ensure near optimum performance especially in broadband communications. Computed results are presented for various parameters outlined in the formulations

    The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of mass media on public self-portrayal.  Based on the results of the review comments, and review of empirical sources, a conceptual framework and main hypothesis have been proposed. The method of data collection was through use of questionnaires.   The statistical population was women in the range 17 to 40 years of age in Baneh City, of which 480 were selected by multistage random sampling. Data was analyzed using SPSS software.  The results showed that there is a significant relationship between the exposure to mass media and self-portrayal. Women who were exposed to the local media were affected less while women who were exposed to foreign media showed a greater effect on self-portrayal. This data shows a change in cognitive, action and behavior patterns and indicates new trends. The relationship between self-portrayal and age showed a lesser influence when compared to the effects of socio-economic status. The variables in the multivariate analysis: domestic and foreign media exposure, socio-economic status and age, showed the greatest to least relationship with the dependent variable, respectively, and accounted for 40 percent of the overall effect.

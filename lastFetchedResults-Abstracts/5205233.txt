The design of room automation systems is a challenging task with growing complexity and a high optimization potential. On the market, a high number of prefabricated devices from different manufacturers is available for a large variety of functions. This leads to a high number of device combinations and many design variants respectively, that should optimally realize the requirements. To overcome this problem, an efficient and scalable solution method is needed, that can create multi-vendor designs with high quality. In this paper, a method that deals successfully with this objective is presented including test results. With the abstract design of the system and additional requirements given, it can synthesize optimal multi-vendor system designs by using an efficient evolutionary algorithm with directed operations.

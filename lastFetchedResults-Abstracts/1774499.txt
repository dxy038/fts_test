Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) represents a potent toxin that binds to its receptors on neurons and inhibits the release of neurotransmitters. Additionally, its fragments are used to transport pharmacological substances to neuronal cell bodies. The main objective of this study was the development of a suitable model system to study internalization of the TeNT. We have produced a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for TeNT by hybridoma technology, after immunization of BALB/c mice with tetanus toxoid, and have named it T-62. The immunochemical characteristics of MoAb T-62 were tested using ELISA, PAGE and immunoblotting. Finally, we have used an immunohistochemical method to detect specific binding of MoAb T-62 to TeNT bound to PC 12 cells. Our results show that MoAb T-62 is highly specific for TeNT, even when it is bound to its receptor, and that it could be of considerable importance in studies regarding fundamental research on TeNT receptors, intracellular transport of TeNT, as well as retrograde transport of pharmaceutical substances and non-invasive delivery of polypeptides through the blood brain barrier. In addition, MoAb T-62 is an invaluable tool in TeNT vaccine production as it can be used for the detection of reverse toxicity, which could drastically reduce the need to use animals in these experiments.

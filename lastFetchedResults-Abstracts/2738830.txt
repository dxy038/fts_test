The key objective of the High Field Magnet work package of the European Project EuCARD is to design and fabricate the Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn dipole magnet FRESCA2. It has an aperture of 100 mm and a target bore field of 13 T. The design features four 1.5 m long double-layer coils wound with a 21 mm wide cable. The project has now entered its experimental phase in view of the magnet fabrication. We present the experimental test campaign conducted on cable samples in order to understand and to control better the cable behavior and geometry. One full scale double-layer coil using copper cable with the final dimensions and insulation scheme has been wound and heat treated in order to check the fabrication process. This has given useful feedback on the fabrication procedure and on the expected magnet dimensions, as well as on the tooling itself.

Background
tory myocardial ischemia (TMI) is seen as a complication of severe asphyxia. Its presentation is variable, ranging from tachypnea to cardiogenic shock, and it is often masked by the predominant disease. The objective of this study was to detect TMI secondary to perinatal asphyxia in a population of asphyxiated newborns (NB) in comparison with asphyxiated NB with no evidence of TMI.
s
pril 1996 to December 1997, 43 asphyxiated (stressed) NB were studied. Three were excluded. Patients were placed into two groups: Group A with TMI (n = 33) and Group B without TMI (n = 7).
s
nificant differences were found in gestational age, birth weight, extrauterine age, Apgar score, or total creatine phosphokinase values between the two groups. Differences were found in CPK-MB levels and in ischemic electrocardiographic changes and blockages, especially for Group A. In this group, only 24 (72.7%) were cardiovascularly symptomatic.
sions
clude that TMI secondary to perinatal asphyxia is more frequent than has been reported. Thus, it would be useful in all asphyxiated NB to measure CPK-MB isoenzyme activity and patients can then be submitted to an electrocardiogram for detection in order to offer opportune treatment when required.

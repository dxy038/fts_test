In this paper, we focus on assigning and scheduling stabilization surgical cares in operating rooms in case of a disaster. In such situation, surgeons are nomadic. Each victim is characterized by an emergency degree and a ready date in the hospital. In order to satisfy the increasing surgical need, the medical staffs can be reinforced during the time. The objective function defers those used in normal situation, it is about saving the maximum of human lives. So, we propose an integer linear program performed by the Cplex solver. Computational experiments show that a substantial aid is proposed by using this program.

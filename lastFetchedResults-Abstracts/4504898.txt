The objective of this study is to develop a vision-based driver assistance system for lane detection and active keeping control based on the design of cooperative driving. This lane keeping system (LKS) can alert the driver beforehand to the danger of unintentional departure from the lane and then actively control the vehicle steering to help the driver keep the car within the lane more easily. A charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera is used as the front-end sensing for this system to detect the lane marks and instantaneously calculate the lateral deviation. In order to enhance the image recognition precision, an adaptive lane detection algorithm with dynamic calibration was developed. The lane keeping control strategy was designed in accordance with the vehicle dynamics to figure out the appropriate assisted steering torque and further control the column-type electric power steering (EPS) of vehicle. In this work, the electronic control unit (ECU) of LKS has been implemented with an embedded hardware for the consideration of access to flexible adjustment and volume production.

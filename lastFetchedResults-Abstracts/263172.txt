The objective of this study is to investigate numerically a compact steam methane reforming (SMR) system integrated with a water-gas shift (WGS) reactor. Separate numerical models are established for the combustion part, SMR and WGS reaction bed. The concentration of species at the exits of the SMR and WGS bed, and the temperatures in the WGS bed are in good agreement with the measured data. Heat transfer to the catalyst beds and the catalytic reactions in the SMR and WGS catalyst bed are investigated as a function of the operation parameters. The conversion of methane at the exit of the SMR catalyst bed is calculated to be 87%, and the carbon monoxide concentration at the outlet of the WGS bed is estimated to be 0.45%. The effects of the cooling heat flux at the outside wall of the system and steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio are also examined. As the cooling heat flux increases, both the methane conversion and carbon monoxide content are reduced in the SMR bed, and the carbon monoxide conversion is improved in the WGS bed. Both methane conversion and carbon dioxide reduction increase with increasing steam-to-carbon ratio.

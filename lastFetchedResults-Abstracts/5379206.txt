The rapidly increasing contribution of wind power to electric power generation around the world has motivated a need to develop more widely applicable methodologies for evaluating the actual benefits of adding wind turbines to traditional power generating systems. Reliability and cost evaluation of wind generation systems requires simulation of long-term chronological wind speed data for specified geographical wind farm sites. The main steps to construct the wind speed simulation model are presented in this paper. It is important that the developed models maintain the main statistical characteristics of the wind farm locations. Wind speed data from two wind sites are used to illustrate the model. The results of wind data simulation, power output profile, and power system risk evaluation are presented and compared using different types of wind models at different wind farm sites. The objective is to derive a general and appropriate model for reliability evaluation of power systems containing wind sources

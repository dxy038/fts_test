The short-term objective of the work described is to develop ground and knowledge-based systems integrated with actual electric power system breadboards and testbeds to demonstrate the viability of advanced automation approaches for spacecraft onboard and ground-support applications. Initially, such systems would be used primarily in advisory capacities. As confidence is gained in their operation, these systems would evolve to allow closed-loop control. The long-term objective is to develop such intelligent knowledge-based systems for actual onboard autonomous operation of the spacecraft electric power system. The approach taken has been to start with well-defined, limited electric power system applications as stand-alone systems. The next step has been to integrate such applications with actual breadboards that are representative of flight systems. The next activity is concerned with focusing on integrating these knowledge-based systems with conventional automation software and hardware. Current efforts emphasize adding robustness to the interactions among the knowledge-based systems as well as adding intermediate levels of autonomy for the power system management.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

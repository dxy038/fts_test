We investigate the issues in voice communications using IP over tandem connections of wireline and wireless links with the goal of determining end-to-end system performance. We study the particular example of using G.711 speech coding in the backbone wireline network and adaptive multi-rate (AMR) speech coding in a wireless LAN tandem network and study the impact of specific methods of adaptive re-encoding, error concealment, error control coding, and network protocol design to deliver the desired end-to-end quality of service. In addition to simulation results and objective speech quality measures, we present estimation-theoretic and information-theoretic analyses for the tandem packet loss link connections.

According to the aperture of the objectives, surfaces with steep topographies greater than approximate 25° are difficult or unable to measure with white light interferometry. Hence, an adaptive-orientation measurement is proposed by adjusting the incidence angle from 51° to 21°. In this study, a micro-grinding with #3000 diamond wheel V-tip was employed to fabricate the micro-pyramid-structured Si surface with 142 μm in depth and 38 nm in surface roughness. The objective is to evaluate the micro-profile accuracy of micro-ground Si surface. First, the four micro-ground surfaces of micro-pyramid-structured surface were measured along the adaptive orientation with an incidence angle, respectively; then iterative closest point (ICP) matching was used to reconstruct the whole micro-ground surface with four adaptive-orientation measured point clouds; finally, 3D reconstruction error and characterized profile error were investigated. It is shown that the ICP matching with denoising and finishing is valid to register four adaptive-orientation measured point clouds for reconstructing an integrated micro-ground surface. Moreover, a decrease in incidence angle to measured surfaces leads to a decrease in 3D reconstruction error, an increase in valid top-topographic point number and a decrease in characterized profile error. It is confirmed that the adaptive-orientation measurement with 21° incidence angle may enhance 3D reconstruction accuracy by about 35%, valid top-topographic point number by about 3 times and characterized profile accuracy by about 38% against the traditional measurement, respectively. The micro-ground form error of 5.5 μm and the characterized profile error of 6.0 μm may be achieved, respectively, thus the micro-grinding is valid for the precision micro-fabrication of micro-structured surface.

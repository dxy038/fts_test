Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two-step adhesive systems on secondary caries inhibition around fluoride-releasing materials in vitro.
Methods

Two self-etching primer systems, Clearfil SE Bond (SE) and UniFil Bond (UB), and two one-bottle systems with a total-etch wet-bonding technique, Single Bond (SB) and One-Step (OS), were used prior to placement of resin composites either with (Reactmer) or without (Z100) fluoride release. Class V cavities prepared in extracted human premolars were restored with various combinations of materials: Reactmer/SE, Reactmer/UB, Reactmer/SB, Reactmer/OS, Z100/SE, Z100/UB, Z100/SB and Z100/OS. After storage for 14 days, the restored teeth were incubated in bacterial medium containing sucrose with Streptoccus mutans for 2 weeks. Water sorption and desorption of the adhesives and fluoride release from the resins either coated with adhesive or uncoated were also determined.
Results

The one-bottle groups showed higher water sorption and desorption than the self-etching primer groups. Although fluoride release from the Reactmer specimens was suppressed by the adhesive coating, the one-bottle groups allowed significantly higher fluoride release than the self-etching primer groups. On microradiographs, the radio-opaque layers adjacent to the Reactmer restorations were thick and clear, while the layers adjacent to the Z100 restorations were thin and unclear. For the Reactmer restorations, the radio-opaque layers associated with the one-bottle groups were significantly thicker than for the self-etching primer groups.
Conclusions

These results indicated that the use of one-bottle wet-bonding systems for bonding of fluoride-releasing resin composites to dentine may contribute to inhibit secondary caries compared to self-etching primer systems.

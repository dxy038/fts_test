Sensor networks consist of small wireless sensor nodes deployed randomly over an area to monitor the environment or detect intrusion. The coverage provided by sensor networks is very crucial to their effectiveness. Many of the important applications of sensor networks demand autonomous mobility for the sensor nodes. Early failure of sensor nodes can lead to coverage loss that requires coverage maintenance schemes. In this paper, we propose dynamic coverage maintenance (DCM) schemes that exploit the limited mobility of the sensor nodes. The main objective of coverage maintenance is to compensate the loss of coverage with minimum expenditure of energy. We propose a set of DCM schemes which can be executed on individual sensor nodes having a knowledge of only their local neighborhood topology. We propose four algorithms to decide which neighbors to migrate, and to what distance, such that the energy expended is minimized and the coverage obtained for a given number of live nodes is maximized. The decision and movement is completely autonomous in the network, and involves movement of one-hop neighbors of a dead sensor node. We also propose an extension to these algorithms, called cascaded DCM, which extends the migrations to multiple hops. We have also compared the performance of the different algorithms in terms of the improvement in coverage, average migration distance of the nodes, and the lifetime of the network

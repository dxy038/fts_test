Objective(s): Candidiasis infection caused by Candida albicans has been known as a major problem in patients with immune disorders. The objective of this study was to genotype the C. albicans isolates obtained from oral cavity of patients with positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV+) with or/and without oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). Materials and Methods:A total of 100 C. albicans isolates from Iranian HIV+patients were genotyped using specific PCR primers of the 25S rDNA and RPS genes. Results: The frequencies of genotypes A, B and C which were achieved using 25S rDNA , were 66, 24 and 10 percent, respectively. In addition, genotypes D and E were not found in this study. Each C. albicans genotype was further classified into four subtypes (types 2, 3, 2/3 and 3/4) by PCR amplification targeting RPS sequence. Conclusion:In general, genotype A3 constituted the majority of understudy clinical isolates obtained from oral cavity of Iranian HIV+ patients.

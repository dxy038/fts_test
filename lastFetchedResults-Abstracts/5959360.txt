The objective of this paper is to develop an NRF signature classifier scheme in order to efficiently and accurately detect and recognize NRF signatures of nuclear material inside a cargo container. In response to this problem we have developed a local-global (LG) graph as the NRF signal representation scheme for efficient matching and on which to build the NRF signature library. Here we also assume that the NRF signals will be "free" of noise after passing a preprocessing step at a previous stage. Thus, the proposed scheme is based on the analysis of an incoming NRF signal and determining its min and max; Then we create the local triangles and express them in a form of local graphs; at the last step we combine local graphs for creating the Local-Global graphs that hold the desirable pattern (signature) of certain material.

Wireless sensor network nodes have the drawbacks such as limited energy and poor processing ability. This paper presents two algorithms, i.e. heap-optimized shortest path algorithm and bidirectional shortest path algorithm to overcome above drawbacks. These two algorithms can improve routing efficiency, extend network lifetime and reduce network congestion by optimizing the selection of unmarked nodes and by introducing the node energy threshold E<inf>min</inf>. This paper analyzes the principle and the implementation process of these two algorithms, and compares their routing efficiency with traditional algorithm via experiment. At last, the paper summarizes the advantages and applications of both algorithms.

The temporal fluctuations of the channel capacity of wideband radio channels with frequency-selective fading are analyzed on the basis of wideband propagation measurements. Since only bidirectional radio channels with fixed antennas are considered, the transfer function varies very slowly with time. Because of this it is assumed that the instantaneous transfer function of the radio channel can be estimated at the receiver and communicated back to the transmitter via signalling channels. Therefore, the transfer function is known at the transmitter and receiver

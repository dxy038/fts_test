We study the problem of dynamic spectrum access by secondary users with minimum signal to interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) and interference temperature constraints. A non-linear optimization problem with the objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary users is formulated. The non-linear optimization is solved efficiently using geometric programming techniques. When not all the secondary links can be supported with their QoS requirement, a reduced complexity search algorithm is introduced to find the optimal subset of allowable links. Secondary users may belong to different priority classes. Accessing opportunities should be proportional to priorities. Therefore, we defined a secondary spectrum sharing potential game which takes these priority classes into consideration. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are reached by distributed sequential play. The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized. Finally, the performances of both the reduced complexity algorithm and the sequential play are examined through simulations.

The objective of this paper is to present a software maintenance measurement planning, performance and evaluation process based on our successful practice during the implementation of a measurement process in a leading custom software development company in Turkey. Specifically, this study focuses on the software maintenance measurement practices using the existing ISO/IEC standards, such as ISO/IEC 9126, ISO/IEC 14598 and ISO/IEC 15939, and involves the development of software that combines the theoretical aspects of these standards with the realities of software maintenance process while developing a software application. This research addresses the issues of measuring software maintenance service quality and generating a common standard for similar systems by introducing the concept of "improved maintenance monitoring."

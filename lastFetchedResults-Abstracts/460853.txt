Abstract
OBJECTIVE: With the widespread use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy, there is also recurrent debate about the hygienic safety of CPAP devices after reprocessing. In this study we therefore investigated the actual hygenic status of CPAP devices, as well as the spectrum of contaminating microorganisms.

METHODS: A total of 122 CPAP devices were examined, including 50 devices used by patients, which were examined before and after reprocessing. Seventy-two new devices that had not been in any contact with patients served as controls.

RESULTS: The results of this study show that the microbial contamination of new and used CPAP devices is only minimal. For example, the investigation of the microbial contamination of the air of the CPAP devices revealed medians between 90 CFU/m3 (used devices before disinfection) and 145 CFU/m3 (new devices). These values were clearly below the value determined for the surrounding air (median of 400 CFU/m3). With regard to pathogenic microorganisms the determined medians for the various sampling points were only between 0 CFU/25 cm2 and a maximum of 3.5 CFU/25cm2.

Contaminating microorganisms were predominantly microorganisms reflecting the normal environmental microflora such as Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp., Micrococcaceae, and Bacillaceae. Gram-positive species could only be found in rare cases.

CONCLUSION: The data obtained give no indication of a hygienically dubious state of CPAP devices, but point out that the hygienic status of reprocessed CPAP devices is better than that of new devices. Therefore the measures for reprocessing that are already used in practice have been confirmed to be effective.

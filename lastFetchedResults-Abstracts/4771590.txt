With the economic crisis background, the maintenance function has evolved from being centered on short term questions such as the use of resources and allocation of costs to strategic considerations such as asset profit enhancement and fast response to the market demand. In this paper, our objective is to jointly optimize the maintenance of a capacity-constrained node, itÂ´s feed node and inlet buffer size in a supply chain system. By the development of a basic supply chain model, the optimization is achieved, and an empirical example is used to illustrate the application of the model.

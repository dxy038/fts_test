The dual response approach is a method of determining the optimal welding conditions in consideration of both the mean value and variance of a characteristic. The definition of the objective function is important, as the results of the optimization problem are influenced by the objective function, which is defined using the mean and variance. This study focuses on the definition and optimization of the objective function in the dual response approach applied to a gas metal arc (GMA) welding process. The objective function is defined using the desirability function. The genetic algorithm, a global optimization algorithm, is used as an optimization algorithm in this study, whereas local optimization algorithms have commonly been used in preceding studies

The ability of the human auditory system for sound localization mainly depends on the binaural cues, especially interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD). In the context of digital hearing aids and binaural audio transmission systems, these cues can be severely degraded by independent bilateral signal processing such as dereverberation or noise reduction. This contribution presents a novel two-stage binaural dereverberation algorithm which explicitly preserves the binaural cues. The first stage is based on a statistical model of the room impulse responses (RIR) and comprises a spectral subtraction rule which reduces late reverberation only. It includes a smoothing process of the spectral gains to reduce musical tones. In a second stage, the residual reverberation is attenuated by a dual-channel Wiener filter. This is derived from a coherence model of the reverberant sound field taking into account shadowing effects of the head. The overall binaural-input binaural-output structure efficiently reduces both early and late reverberation. In experiments as well as informal listening tests using measured binaural room impulse responses, the proposed algorithm significantly improves speech quality according to objective and subjective measures.

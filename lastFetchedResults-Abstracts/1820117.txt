Objective
pare the tissue reactions to implanted collagen scaffolds in the palate and the skin of rats.

inked collagen scaffolds were implanted submucoperiosteally in the palate, and subcutaneously on the skull and on the back of 25 rats and evaluated after up to 16 weeks. On H&amp;E-stained sections, the cell density and the number of giant cells within the scaffolds were determined. Blood vessels, inflammatory cells, and myofibroblasts were detected by immunohistochemistry.
s
er ingrowth of myofibroblasts and blood vessels in the palate was found during the first week compared with the skin. A more severe inflammatory response was initially found in the back skin. Furthermore, about twice as much giant cells were present in these scaffolds.
sion
al environment seems to promote the ingrowth of myofibroblasts and blood vessels into the scaffolds. Mechanical stimuli seem to enhance the initial inflammatory response. Overall, the scaffolds were gradually integrated within the host tissue, eliciting only a transient inflammatory response. The scaffolds were biocompatible and are promising for future applications in oral surgery.

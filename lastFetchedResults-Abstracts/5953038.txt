The first argument presented is that if we have a clear understanding of the objectives of the requirements engineering (RE) process then we can identify what techniques we need. No single method or technique will be sufficient. The second argument is that a key objective of the RE process is to specify a system which will ultimately be successful. Three common types of failure are examined: process failure, expectation failure and interaction failure. The third argument is that if the causes of each type of failure can be described then we will be able to identify what techniques are needed to help us avoid failure. The five common causes are described: the requirements engineering process itself, human communication within requirements, knowledge development, documentation of requirements and management. A discussion of each cause is followed by a list of the RE techniques needed. The paper concludes with a `wish listÂ´ of seventy requirements for RE techniques, and a brief discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the RE community in meeting those requirements

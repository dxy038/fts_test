Profit Unit commitment in deregulated power system has a different objective than that of traditional unit commitment PBUC has been performed to emphasize the importance of the profit. The distinct feature of PBUC is that all market information is reflected in the market price. This paper presents a solution for profit based unit commitment by the use of Lagrangian firefly algorithm. The profit based unit commitment (PBUC) solution is developed to determine the unit ON/OFF schedule, power, spinning and non-spinning reserve generations ofGENCOs taking part in the competition. The resultant schedule evidently maximizes the profit and the proposed algorithm is tested for a small unit test system with 3 unit 4 hour data and the simulations are carried out to show the performance of proposed methodology using MATLAB. The proposed algorithm can be extended to ´n´ number of generating units.

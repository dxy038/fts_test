A compact ultra-wideband (UWB) slot antenna with band-notched characteristic is proposed in this paper. The fabricated antenna consists of a three-arm fork-like metal patch fed by a 50 &#937; coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line, a rectangular ground with a semicircular slot and a pair of shorting strips inserted in the semicircular slot, which creates one notched band. By adjusting the length, width of the two coupling strips and the distance between them, a band-rejected filter characteristic at the wireless local area network (WLAN) band can be obtained. The experimental results show that the fabricated antenna, with a compact size of 30&#215;25mm<sup>2</sup>, has an ultra-wide impedance bandwidth from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz for VSWR&lt;;2 except a stop band for 5.15-5.825 GHz. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional radiation pattern in the E-plane and omni-directional radiation pattern in the H-plane and the gains are stable over the operating band except the notched band.

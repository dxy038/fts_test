 Introduction The objective of this study was to report the
                            correction of a maxillary transverse discrepancy in an adult patient
                            using Le Fort I osteotomy procedure associated with a bone-borne
                            maxillary distractor device. Both the indications, advantages of the
                            procedure and the use protocol were highlighted. Case Presentation The
                            results showed that the bone-borne distractor promoted the correction of
                            maxillary transverse discrepancy with minimal side effects on the
                            maxillary posterior teeth. Conclusions The bone-borne maxillary
                            distractor device is a good alternative for correcting the maxillary
                            transverse discrepancy in patients undergoing Le Fort I surgery,
                            especially in cases presenting either periodontal disease or gingival
                            recession of maxillary posterior teeth.

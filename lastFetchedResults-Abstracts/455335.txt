Recent evidence suggests that sterol 27-hydroxylase may play a role in cholesterol homeostasis and affect atherogenesis. The major objective of the study was to map and characterize the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) promoter region. Here we show that CYP27 gene has a TATA-less promoter and transcription initiates at a cluster of sites. The basic promoter is located between −166 and −187 bp from the translation initiation site. Possible positive transcription regulation sites are located at position −187 to −320 and −857 to −1087 bp. A negative transcription regulator site is located in position −320 to −413 bp. An enhancer sequence is located upstream to position −1087. CYP27 is upregulated by dexamethasone and downregulated by cyclosporin A and cholic acid. The dexamethasone responsive element is located between 1087 and 678 bp upstream to the putative ATG. Cyclosporin A affects bile acid metabolism by repressing CYP27 at the transcriptional level. The cyclosporin A- responsive element is mapped to between 1087 and 4000 bp upstream of the ATG. Cholic acid represses sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA level by affecting the stability of its mRNA. The results obtained here imply that CYP27 has a potentially important role in cholesterol homeostasis in human cells, and is regulated by several substances that were previously shown to affect bile acid metabolism.

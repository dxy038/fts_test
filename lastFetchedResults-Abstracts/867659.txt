This article addresses the combinatorial optimization problem of managing earth observation satellites
(EOSs) such as the French SPOT5, which is concerned with selecting on each day a subset of a set of candidate
photographs. The problem has a significant economic importance due to its high initial investment
cost that exists in these instruments and its solution difficulty resulting from the large solution space,
making it an attractive research area. This article proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the SPOT5
selection problem using a new genome representation for maximizing not only a single objective as profit
but a multi-criteria objective that includes the number of acquired photographs. Test results of our proposed
GA show that it finds optimal solutions effectively for moderate size problems and obtains better
results for two large benchmark instances coded 1403 and 1504 in the literature. Also, we verify the
result that the best known value in the literature for problem coded 1401 is an optimal value.

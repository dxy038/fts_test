This paper defines underlying performance quality measures for designing, optimizing, setting and evaluating the protective relaying algorithms and equipment. The paper starts with evaluation of digital measuring algorithms, and gradually introduces the performance indices for the operating principles, relays and protection systems. Multi-objective formal ranking methods based on fuzzy set theory are used to combine diverse measures into composite performance indices enabling evaluating and optimizing various functions of protective equipment

The paper presents a software tool for designing fixed and variable-structure organization architectures for distributed intelligence systems (DIS) using genetic algorithms (GA). It is intended as a research aid focused on ways to improve the genetic operators, and to explore the kind of domain-dependent information required by these operators. The objective is to yield better and earlier design

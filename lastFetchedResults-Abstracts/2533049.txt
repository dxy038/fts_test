Background and Objective: Diabetic foot ulcer as one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus is known to be resistant to conventional treatment of wound healing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low level laser therapy with GaAs laser, 904 nm, in foot ulcer healing of type 2diabetic patients.

Materials and Methods: 27 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus suffering from Wagner Grade II ischemic foot ulcers were randomly divided into two groups: GaAs laser (n=15) and placebo (n=12). In the laser therapy group, GaAs, (2 j/cm2, 90mW) was applied while in the placebo group laser probe was set similar to the laser group,  but the power was off. Conventional treatment after laser therapy was done for both groups in a similar vein, i.e., three times a week for twelve sessions. Wound surface area and temperature around the wound (before and after therapy) in the 1st, 6th and 12th sessions and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) in the1st and 12th sessions were recorded.

Results: Throughout the 6th and 12th sessions, reduction in wound surface percentatage in comparison with baseline was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the laser group (43.98plusmn 6.36, 72.08plusmn 7.22 respectively) than the placebo group (6.48plusmn 7.98, 12.69plusmn 9.05 respectively), but the skin temperature and ABI values did not show any significant difference.

Conclusion: GaAs laser using photochemical and nonthermal mechanisms may be effective on the acceleration of diabetic chronic foot ulcer closure.

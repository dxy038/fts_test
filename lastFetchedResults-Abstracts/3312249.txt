A current source system based on CAN bus was designed. The system is used for distributed control of the current source. The current source module of the system is controlled by the AT89C52 micro controller, and the output current is bidirectional and adjustable. The current source module has high linearity and stability. The system operates simply, and it has high reliability. The system provides a practical solution for situations where bidirectional current source is required.

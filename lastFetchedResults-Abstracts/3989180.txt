Compartmental modeling is an approach to dynamic systems analysis that has proven useful in enhancing the understanding of biological and ecological systems. The compartmental approach emphasizes model conceptualization and is especially appropriate in applications in which quantitative behavioral data are difficult or expensive to obtain and in which qualitative understanding is the primary goal. In these applications, models are often developed by interdisciplinary teams. Domain experts contribute their understanding of component behaviors and interactions, while systems engineers guide the modeling process and insure the rigor of subsequent model-based analyses. The success of these applications clearly demands efficient and effective methods for transferring qualitative knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. The paper examines the expanded roles of knowledge acquisition, verification, and interpretation in the formulation of compartmental models. The objective is to illustrate that knowledge engineering, as currently practiced in the development of expert systems, is an essential ingredient in the compartmental approach to dynamic systems

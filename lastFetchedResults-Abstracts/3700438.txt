The Rayleigh backscatter properties of four-wave-mix light (FWM) are theoretically and experimentally investigated for the first time. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions. It was found that the Rayleigh backscattering of FWM light may cause severe crosstalk problems in bidirectional multichannel systems.

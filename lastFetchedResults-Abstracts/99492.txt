The objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of the type of surface-profiling instrument on the roughness measurements in radar remote sensing studies. Particularly, the use of mechanical profilers as compared to more precise laser profilers is investigated. The motivations for this study are twofold. First, simple and inexpensive mechanical profilers will probably still be used extensively for in situ ground measurements in the next few years, e.g., to investigate the use of multipolarization, multiincidence angle satellite data, i.e., Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European Space Agency Environmental Satellite. Second, a great amount of roughness data have been acquired in the past by means of mechanical profilers and, to date, a quantification of the error budget affecting these measurements is still missing. The paper focuses on modeling and quantifying the measurement errors associated with profiles a few meters long. To determine the errors, we compare soil roughness measurements obtained using laser and mechanical profilers over agricultural surfaces with different roughness characteristics. The analyzed datasets consist of roughness measurements acquired over the Matera site (Italy) and the Marestaing site, near Toulouse (France), in 1998 and 2000, respectively. Analytical expressions for first and second statistical moments of roughness parameters as a function of different sources of measurement errors are derived and compared to experimental values. The results show that mechanical measurements, once appropriately calibrated, are in overall good agreement with laser measurements. Practical indications of the most appropriate profiler length and number of independent measurements to be recorded are also derived in the paper.

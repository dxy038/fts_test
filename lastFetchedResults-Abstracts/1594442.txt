The COOLOD/N2 and PARET/ANL codes were used for a steady-state thermal-hydraulic and safety analysis of the 2 MW TRIGA MARK II reactor located at the Nuclear Studies Center of Ma√¢mora (CENM), Morocco. In order to validate our PARET/ANL and COOLOD-N2 models, the fuel center temperature as function of core power was calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental values. The comparison indicates that the calculated values are in satisfactory agreement with the measurement. The main objective of this study is to ensure the safety margins of different safety related parameters by steady-state calculations at full power level (2 MW). Therefore, we have calculated the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR), fuel center and surface temperature, cladding surface temperature and coolant temperature profiles across the hottest channel. The most important conclusion is that all obtained values are largely far to compromise safety of the reactor.

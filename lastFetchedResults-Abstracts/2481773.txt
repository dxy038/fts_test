ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Filtration in radiology devices plays a pivotal role in weakening of soft X-ray photons and reduction of absorbed radiation dose by patients. This study aimed to evaluate the filtration rate of radiology devices at public hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences, Iran.  
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used the DIAVOLT device to measure the level of radiology filtration. DIAVOLT was placed under the X-ray tube and exposed to radiation by applying multiple potential differences to the radiology device. After radiation, output potential differences were measured and recorded. 
FINDINGS: This study was performed at Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals located in Mazandaran, Iran. Potential differences of 50-80 kilo-volts (kV) were applied to radiology devices, and output voltage of the DIAVOLT device was observed to be compatible with input potential at the standard error rate of ±5. In Amirkola Children’s Hospital, level of filtration was 0.5 mm, while it was estimated at 2.5 aluminum mm in other hospitals. In addition, applied input time to the DIAVOLT device was compatible with output time. In Shahid Rajaee Hospital of Babolsar city, rate of input potential was higher than the output potential in the DIAVOLT device, which diverted from the standard level; however, filtration degree was adequate. 
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, kV examinations were accurate at all the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences. Therefore, it could be concluded that rate of filtration is adequate in the radiology devices used in these health centers.
KEY WORDS: Filtration, Diagnostic Imaging, Educational Hospitals, Babol University of Medical Sciences.

Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) bring together many applications and disciplines to capture the most intensive economical development of the century. The objective of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the trust-based security mechanism for WSNs. Three kinds of trust information are summarized. After analyzing the security problems and brief reviewing of the trust management for WSNs, a comparing study with two typical trust management models are given with the consideration of energy conservation. Experiment result shows that the new ones prolong the networks lifetime.

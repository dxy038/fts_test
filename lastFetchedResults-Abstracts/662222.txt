The fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in contaminated soils may be affected by several environmental factors including the presence of co-contaminants. This study was conducted in order to assess the effect of metals on (i) the adsorption of 14C-phenanthrene in soils and (ii) its extractability and ability to form non-extractable residues. The first objective was accomplished using batch adsorption experiments with an uncontaminated agricultural soil spiked with the metals Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Adsorption of phenanthrene was significantly higher after the addition of the metals (Kf=21.48 vs. 8.55) and the desorption less readily reversible when compared to the unspiked soil. The extractability of phenanthrene was assessed with incubation (4 months, laboratory conditions) and microlysimeter experiments (6 months, natural climatic conditions) on three soils spiked with metals. All the soils were labelled with 14C-phenanthrene. The amount of extractable phenanthrene residues was significantly higher when the metals had been added to the soils. Nevertheless, the quantity of non-extractable residues was non-significantly different between the spiked and unspiked soils. The mechanism leading to increased adsorption and extractability of phenanthrene in the presence of metals is still unknown. In perspective, it would be interesting to assess the bioavailability of PAHs in the presence of metals in further experiments.

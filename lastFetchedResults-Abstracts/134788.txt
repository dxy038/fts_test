Background: Dimensions of the newborn's body are the basis for all changes in anthropometric indices. Objective: Determining the normal range of head and face dimensions in normal one-day old male newborns in Fars and Turkman races.
Method & material: This descriptive and cross sectional study was accomplished on 311 normal male newborns (n=311) by cephalometry.
Results: Mean and standard deviation of cephalic and facial indices in the Fars race are respectively 77.28±4.97% , 78.47±5.45% and in the Turkman race are 78.15±10.78% , 71.9±10.89% respectively. Dominant and rare types in the Fars race are respectively Mesocephalic (38.4%) and Hyperbrachycephalic (10.2%) and so in the Turkman race are respectively Mesocephalic (41.8%), Hyperhrachycephalic (6%) respectively.
Dominant facial type in the Fars and Turkman races are respectively Hypereuroprospic (81.9%) and (48%).
Conclusion: There is no significant difference between the types of head & face in Fars and Turkman races in this research, but there are significant differences between the dominant types of face in both races.

Summary form only given. A self-consistent two-dimensional three moment radio frequency glow discharge simulation is performed for methane gas using a fluid model. The main objective of the simulation is to provide a better insight on charged species dynamics and their effect on deposition for a polyatomic discharge. The model incorporates continuity equations for electron, radicals and ion number densities. An electron energy equation is also solved in the model to obtain electron temperature. The swarm data as a function of electron energy are provided as input data in the fluid model. PoissonÂ´s equation is solved to obtained the self-consistent electric field in the domain. The governing equations are solved using a finite-difference numerical scheme. The convective-diffusive terms are discretized by the exponential scheme. The model predictions are compared to experimental measurements obtained from a reactor in our laboratories. The algorithm is very stable and robust for both drift and diffusion modes of transport of the species. The discharge simulation predicts both the spatial and temporal variation of electron, ion number density, and electron temperature for different operating conditions. The axial and radial variation of time-averaged species density, electric potential, and electron temperature are also obtained from the simulation. The model predictions are used to derive quantities such as electron and ion current densities and power deposition under these operating conditions. The effects of variation of RF voltage, DC bias voltage, pressure, and reactor geometry on plasma properties are discussed.

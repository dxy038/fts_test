This paper is concerned to design a switched state feedback robust control for continuous-time systems subject to norm bounded uncertainty. As important features of the proposed design method, we mention that it can handle a general LFT structure for the uncertainty and it is based on stability conditions that can be numerically solved by means of LMIs and a line search. Moreover, the switching rule as well as the state feedback gains are determined from the minimization of a guaranteed cost function derived from a multi-objective criterion. The theoretical results are illustrated with an academic example.

In this paper, a slicing tree based tabu search heuristic for the rectangular, continual plane facility layout problem (FLP) is presented. In addition to the incorporation of facilities with unequal areas we also integrate the possibility to specify various requirements regarding (rectangular) shape and dimensions of each individual facility by using bounding curves. Therefore, it is possible to solve problems containing facilities of fixed and facilities of flexible shapes at the same time. We present a procedure that calculates the layout corresponding to a given slicing tree on the basis of bounding curves. These layouts are slicing structures which are able to contain empty spaces to guarantee that stringent shape restrictions of facilities are kept. Due to these features this approach is better suited for practical use than so far existing ones. The effectiveness of our approach in terms of objective function value is shown by comparing our results to those found in the literature. Even a large problem instance comprised of 62 facilities has been solved.

Summary form only given. Despite the complexity of deposition processes in microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition, this technique is still a common choice to produce an excellent quality diamond. Recently, several simulation plasma models have been proposed in order to prescribe the complex deposition process and also to better understand the plasma -microwave energy and plasma - diamond growth surface interactions in the microwave plasma CVD reactors. The objective of this paper is to numerically analyze microwave plasma discharge behavior in a scale up CVD reactor for single crystal diamond deposition. Simplified plasma model inside a 915 MHz microwave cavity reactor is presented. A pair of drift diffusion equations, Boltzmann equation, two-term approximation coupled with Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields is used to calculate profile distribution of electric field, electron density and electron temperature as a function of microwave input power and operating pressure. The shape and location of the plasma discharge versus substrate holder configuration inside the reactor is also investigated. Preliminary simulation results are compared to the experimental observations.

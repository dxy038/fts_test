Summary form only given. We have developed a novel technique, which enables us to write such structures within the bulk of an optical fiber through its cleaved face, enabling control over light subsequently exiting the fiber. We show the experimental set-up where an amplified Ti:sapphire 150 fs pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 250 kHz is used to irradiate the samples at 850 nm, via a 50X objective.

A novel topology of a multilevel modular capacitor-clamped dc-dc converter will be presented in this paper. In contrast to the conventional flying capacitor multilevel dc-dc converter, this new topology is completely modular and requires a simpler gate drive circuit. Moreover, the new topology has many advantageous features such as high frequency operation capability, low input/output current ripple, low on-state voltage drop, and bidirectional power flow management. This paper discusses the construction and operation of the new converter along with a comparison to a conventional converter. Finally, simulation and experimental results are used to validate the concept of this new topology.

Call admission control, call control for short, is a fundamental optimization problem arising in communication networks. The objective of the problem is to maximize the profit of call requests that can be accommodated in the network without violating the bandwidth constraints on the links. We study the offline variant of the problem on line networks. We provide polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) or algorithms with good approximation ratios for the problem when varying restrictions are imposed

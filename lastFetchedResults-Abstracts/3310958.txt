Non-classical states of light enable new modes of new modes of communications, sensing and computation. A key objective of current research is the construction of a scalable photonic quantum network that will facilitate the preparation of distributed quantum correlations among light beams, and enable new quantum-enhanced applications. Such a network can be constructed by means of linear optical operations, measurement by photodetectors, and storage in a photonic quantum memory.

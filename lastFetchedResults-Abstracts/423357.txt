Objectives
The objective of the present study was to elucidate the vasodilator mechanisms of nebivolol, a high selective β1-receptor antagonist with antioxidant properties.
Background

Oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) is regarded as an important cause of its decreased biological activity.
Methods

Oxidative stress was induced through the binding of oxidized (ox)-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to its specific endothelial receptor, called “lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1” (LOX-1), in bovine and human endothelial cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing bovine LOX-1 (BLOX-1-CHO cells). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide (O2·−), and NO were measured in cells by flow cytometry.
Results

Nebivolol and its 4-keto derivative prevented in a dose-dependent manner the increase of ROS (p < 0.001) and O2·− (p < 0.001) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and BLOX-1-CHO cells stimulated with ox-LDL. Atenolol had no effect. The incubation of HUVECs and BAECs with ox-LDL reduced basal and bradykinin-induced NO and nitrite concentration (p from <0.001 to <0.01). Nebivolol and its 4-keto derivative prevented the reduction of basal and stimulated NO and nitrite concentration (p from <0.001 to <0.01) while atenolol had no effect. The preincubation of BAECs with blocking anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody (LOX-1 mAb) significantly counteracted the effect of ox-LDL on stimulated generation of NO (p < 0.001), but the effect was significantly lower than that of nebivolol and its 4-keto derivative alone (p < 0.01).
Conclusions

In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicate that nebivolol increases NO also by decreasing its oxidative inactivation.

This article describes the design and simulation implementation of a behavior-based control system that can be used for maneuvering of nonholonomic vehicles. As opposed to a single controller approach which treats tracking a curve with discontinuous yaw, we apply a behavior-based control approach with switching among different controllers for tracking smooth trajectories and yaw control. We use the results from hybrid system control where multiple Lyapunov functions are used in order to prove overall controller stability. The controllers are designed using a command filtered, vector backstepping (CFBS) approach where each controllerÂ´s objective is to force a specified output to track a desired ideal output. The article includes design of the control law and simulation based analysis of the performance. The simulation confirms the theoretical result.

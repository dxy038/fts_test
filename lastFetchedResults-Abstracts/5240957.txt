Accurate objective quality metrics are of great potential benefit to the video industry, as they promise the means to evaluate the performance of acquisition, display, coding and communication systems. Many researchers have focused on developing digital video quality metrics which produce results that accurately emulate subjective responses. However, to be widely applicable a metric must also work over a wide range of quality, and be useful for in-service quality monitoring. We have developed novel spatial-temporal distortion metrics for video sequences. This metric is capable of capturing spatial distortions in video sequences, in addition to temporal artifacts. And it can quantify the spatial distortion and differentiate the type of distortion. Furthermore the metric correlate well with subjective quality measures because perception distortions of human were took account of. Results are presented that demonstrate our perceptual quality metric performs better than existing methods.

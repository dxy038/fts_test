In this paper, minimum weight design of composite laminates is presented using the failure mechanism based (FMB), maximum stress and Tsai–Wu failure criteria. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed FMB failure criterion (FMBFC) in composite design. The FMBFC considers different failure mechanisms such as fiber breaks, matrix cracks, fiber compressive failure, and matrix crushing which are relevant for different loading conditions. A genetic algorithm is used for the optimization study. The Tsai–Wu failure criterion over predicts the weight of the laminate by up to 86% in the third quadrant of the failure envelope compared to FMB and maximum stress failure criteria, when the laminate is subjected to compressive–compressive loading. It is found that the FMB and maximum stress failure criteria give comparable weight estimates. The FMBFC can be considered for use in the strength design of composite structures.

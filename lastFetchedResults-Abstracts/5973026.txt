In this paper, in order to better apply the algorithms to the engineering, three algorithms for numerical solution of the inverse problem for a class of line source are compared. First of all, mathematical mode of a class of line source will be briefly introduced, and according to characteristics of the inverse problem, the objective function of inverse problem is constructed; then three algorithms which are designed to solve the inverse problem are given, According to the two cases of unknown parameters interval estimation, three algorithms are analyzed based on the simulated data, then the measured data is used to verify the solution efficiency of three algorithms. Through the data inversion, the principles of algorithms selecting are concluded on the practical engineering application, and the efficient of the algorithms application can be promoted by the comparison of three algorithms.

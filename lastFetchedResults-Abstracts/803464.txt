Background: Eremostachys azerbaijanica (family Lamiaceae) is one of the 16 endemic Iranian herbs of the genus Eremostachys. In Iran, the root of E. azerbaijanica is traditionally used as local analgesic and anti-inflammatory.
Objective: In this research, roots of E. azerbaijanica were phytochemically studied until perhaps by identification of chemical content of this plant, a step to be taken toward correct use from this natural product in treatment of diseases.
Methods: Methanolic extract from the root of E. azerbaijanica was prepared by Soxhlet method and its three compounds were isolated by SPE method and reversed-phase preparative HPLC. Finally, the compounds have been elucidated by UV and 1D NMR spectroscopic analysis.
Results: Three iridoid glycosides, Lamalbide (Lamiridoside), Pulchelloside I and Sesamoside were isolated from the root of E. azerbaijanica.
Conclusion: The comparison of the results obtained from the present study and former published results, shows that three iridoid glucosides which identified in this research, have been previously elucidated in some species of Eremostachys.

Summary form only given. Chalcogenide (ChG) glasses have been widely investigated as candidate materials for waveguide applications and we have recently reported on optical properties of bulk materials and their use in undoped and rare-earth doped films. Current efforts in our group to examine property differences introduced to these glasses during film deposition have shown notable structural and chemical variation to the parent bulk glass material. Most recently, we have expanded our capabilities to structurally characterize single and multiple layer films suitable for use in devices. It is our objective to understand how structural and chemical changes affect linear and nonlinear optical behavior of these elements.

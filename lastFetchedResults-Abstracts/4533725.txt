The rapid growth of time-critical information services and business-oriented applications is making quality of service (QoS) support increasingly important in content distribution. This paper investigates the problem of placing object replicas (e.g., web pages and images) to meet the QoS requirements of clients with the objective of minimizing the replication cost. We consider two classes of service models: replica-aware service and replica-blind service. In the replica-aware model, the servers are aware of the locations of replicas and can therefore direct requests to the nearest replica. We show that the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-aware services is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms for efficient computation of suboptimal solutions are proposed and experimentally evaluated. In the replica-blind model, the servers are not aware of the locations of replicas or even their existence. As a result, each replica only serves the requests flowing through it under some given routing strategy. We show that there exist polynomial optimal solutions to the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-blind services. Efficient algorithms are proposed to compute the optimal locations of replicas under different cost models.

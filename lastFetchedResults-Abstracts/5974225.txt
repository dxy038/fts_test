Cold state experiment on a Swiss-roll combustor was performed. The effects of wind speed and the number of channels on pressure drop were tested. Results showed that the pressure in the channels of the combustor increase with the increase of the distance from the inlet of gas. The local resistance caused by the bend angle affects on-way resistance very much. The total pressure drop increases with the increase of the number of bidirectional countercurrent channels and wind speed. Within the experiment range, the correlation of total pressure drop and the wind speed show a nonlinear relationship between line and parabola. Based on the formulas of line resistance and local resistance, the flow resistance of the Swiss-roll combustor was described mathematically by a synthetical resistance coefficient. A pressure drop formula was developed by regression of experimental data. The calculation results from this formula agree well with the experimental data. It can provide reference to the design and operation of the burner. Meanwhile, the method can also be widely applied to researches on the flow resistance of multi-elbow structures used in the electrical, water conservation and chemical industries.

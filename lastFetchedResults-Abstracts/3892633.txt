The basic objective of generation and transmission systems is to serve every major load point in the system as reliably and economically as possible. The probability of failure that is related to the load characteristics is important in the reliability study of generation and transmission systems. This paper describes a probabilistic method, designated as system well-being analysis, for evaluating the effect of peak load, load factor, load curtailment philosophy and percentage load curtailed. Contingency level selection, a dominant factor that influences the accuracy and efficiency of probability study is also considered. This approach incorporates the conventional risk index as well as the accepted deterministic criteria identified as being in the healthy and marginal states. By including deterministic criteria in conjunction with probabilistic methods, well-being indices based on these criteria can be used by the system operator to alleviate the difficulties encountered in interpreting a single risk index. A technique for calculating the well-being indices in generation and transmission systems, together with the effects of individual load attributes. Is illustrated by application to an educational test system designated as the RBTS

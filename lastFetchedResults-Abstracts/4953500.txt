In this paper a convex synthesis methodology is applied to a benchmark problem. The objective is to control the water level in the steam generator of a Pressurized Water Reactor. Both robustness and performance constraints are specified for this benchmark. The proposed approach explicitly takes into account constraints in both time and frequency domains. In this method, specifications are expressed into a convex optimization problem using Youla parameterization. A finite dimensional basis of parameters is then used, making the optimization problem numerically tractable. Two linear controllers corresponding to high and low operating power ranges are designed. The resulting controller is finally validated on a non-linear simulator used for the benchmark, thus allowing for comparison.

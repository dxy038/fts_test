The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to decentralized resilient robust observer-based stabilization with delayed feedback for uncertain delayed systems which are composed of identical nominal subsystems and symmetric nominal interconnections. The proposed method employs the structural properties of the system to construct a low order control design model and the convex optimization approach. It is shown how this methodology can lead to a reduced-order control design with delayed feedback when considering a delay- dependent approach and additive gain perturbations in the gain matrices to obtain a quadratically stabilized global closed-loop system.

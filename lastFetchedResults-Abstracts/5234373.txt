Abrasive machining is commonly defined as a process to remove material by the action of sharp grain of abrasive mineral in order to obtain a final desired shape and surface quality. Therefore, it is considered one of the most important processes in the wood industry. The use of simulation on the most critical process in the wood industry would definitely help to obtain a better understanding of the processes and the effect of changes such as equipments, operators, and raw material, as well as others in the processes. The objective of this research is to simulate an abrasive machine commonly used in wood machining to have a better understanding of the behavior of the main variables that significantly affect the sanding process when change in time. The model uses a large amount of equations (650f) to predict the behavior of the abrasive process. Moreover, the model not only integrates continuous and discrete simulation, but also, it can be interactive (the operator learning curve can be introduced into the model), and includes stochastic considerations in operation time, maintenance, repairs, etc.

The objective of this study was to determine if a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) device can be used to detect the magnetic field produced by the flow of stress generated potential in a vibrating long bone. Vibration or stress wave propagation of human long bones was monitored by bonded strain gages and by a SQUID. The outcome of this study may prove useful in the treatment of osteoporosis, if we can show that small changes in the bone density and cortical thickness can be measured accurately by SQUIDs.

This paper presents a calibration method for a robot Head-Eye system which can be used in a humanoid robot vision system. This method estimates the transformation between the robot coordinate and the camera coordinate. The calibration procedure uses visual measurements and kinematic information as the inputs of nonlinear optimization. For this calibration method, an objective function for the optimization, that uses the Minimum Variance method is defined. The procedure of this method is very simple and intuitive. Besides, the result of this method is considerably precise and robust against the noisy environment. The performance is compared with earlier approaches and the results of simulation and actual experiment are followed.

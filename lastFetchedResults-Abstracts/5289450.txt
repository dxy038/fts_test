Considering the complexity of ship systems, the global optimum design problem on anti-shock resistance of ship systems is analyzed in this paper. The investment on anti-shock resistance of ship systems is taken as optimum objective function, and anti-shock strength of equipments in system is taken as optimum variable. Then the relationship between investment and anti-shock ability of equipments and systems was preliminarily discussed in this paper. Based on the optimum design method between anti-shock investment and performance, three mathematic models of global optimization were built according to practical engineering situation. Furthermore, the numerical analysis method was summarized. At last, the shock-resistance of some a power system was optimized by the method presented in this paper.

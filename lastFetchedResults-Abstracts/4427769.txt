A non-grid-connected wind power system is a complex system that includes several subsystems such as a wind turbine subsystem, non-grid-connected electric generator subsystems, a non-grid-connected wind power control subsystem, gas-solid coupling vibration subsystems, and high-energy-consuming special load subsystems. It is a multi-objective, multi-factor, higher-order non-linear dynamics of large-scale system. The non-grid-connected wind power system simulation is an experimental method based on the operation model of non-grid wind power system. This paper analyzes the importance and processes of the non-grid-connected wind power system simulation, then presents the process of a software development model and then designs the software process according to the model. Simulation technology is widely used in wind power generation equipment design, testing, operation analysis and other aspects. It will help accelerate the development of wind power technology in our country and is a shortcut to narrow the technology gap with developed countries.

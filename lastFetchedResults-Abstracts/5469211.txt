The authors are concerned with the translation of data structures they call messages. Messages are an example of a type of data structure encountered in generic data translation. The objective is to provide a system that the nonprogrammer can use to specify the nature of translations from one type to another. For this reason, the authors selected a visual interface that uses interaction techniques that do not require knowledge of programming or command languages. The translator must accomplish two tasks: (i) create a mapping between fields in different message types that specifies which fields have similar semantic content, and (ii) reformat or translate data specifications within those fields. The translations are accomplished with appropriate but different visual metaphors.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Delay-time and energy constraints have a significant impact on the design and operation of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs). Aiming for a class of random sudden events, the real-time actuator scheduling strategy is proposed based on the event driven in WSANs. In proposed scheduling strategy, three performance indexes, such as reaction time, energy consumption and energy distribution of whole network are considered at the same time. We translate the actuator scheduling strategy into a multi-objective optimization issue. However, the optimal solution of the multi-objective issues is usually not able to be obtained. To solve the problems, we first obtain the optimal solution of a single objective, and then make each performance index try to be close to own optimization solution via normalizing the evaluation function in order to achieve multi-objective approximate optimization solution. This approach is called the normalization optimization approach. The extended simulations illustrate the proposed actuator scheduling strategy is feasible and effective in WSANs.

Objective: The paper provides an overview of the National Library of Medicine's (NLM's) AIDS Community Information Outreach Program during the years 1994 to 2005, discusses the impact of previously funded projects, and explores future implications for HIV/AIDS information outreach to communities in need. Methods: A qualitative assessment was conducted to provide information on the impact of projects funded by the AIDS Community Information Outreach Program during fiscal year 2002. Interviews were conducted and final reports were analyzed, resulting in themes based on roles and responsibilities of participants and the impact of the projects in the communities. Results: Results from the assessment suggest that access to HIV/AIDS information led to improved communication between patients and their health care providers and encouraged better health care decision making. Feedback from reports and interviews included examples of impact such as an increase in services provided to communities, national and global recognition of HIV/AIDS services, sustainability of projects, and improved communication. Conclusion: Community-based health information outreach projects may empower the HIV/AIDS community to become more involved in health care and improve communication with providers. NLM will continue to promote the AIDS Community Information Outreach Program to encourage community organizations to design local projects for their specific communities.

Introduction & Objective: Falls and related injuries in the elderly persons is a problematic subject from different views in the world. Some fall risk factors including impaired balance, abnormal gait and muscle weakness respond favorably to exercise. In the review of literatures, all exercises, have been performed in standing position. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the sitting balance exercises with inexpensive and simple instruments, such as board and bail in the elderly.
Material & Methods: Through inclusion and exclusion criteria seventeen volunteer females were selected and one of participants was dropped out due to ankle injury at home. They participated in twenty consecutive days at exercise (each session, 16 minutes) in Kholdebarin center. Balance exercise was performed in sitting position in three different motions by roiling boards on a ball by both feet or each foot alone.lntervention efficacy was assessed by ABC (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale), LSLS (Timed Left Single leg Stance), RSLS (Timed Right Single leg stance), SR (Sharpened Romberg) and 6WS (Six Meter Walking Speed time) scale tests before and after intervention.
Results: The participant's mean age and MMSE were 65 ± '• 4.7 and 23.4 ± 1 respectively. All the test results revealed i significant improvement after exercise. Results of this study showed that this exercise protocol is effective (p <0.05) in improving the elderly balance and the use of team approach is useful to maintain the attendance.
Conclusion: Foot & feet exercise on rolling boards in sitting position improved balance in the elderly ladies in a short period of time.

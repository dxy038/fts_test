The objective of this paper is to develop a prototype called intelligent mammography retrieval engine. It can be implemented as a computer software that able to examine/analyst digital mammogram image and automatically yield its finding and recommendation. The computerized examination is done through comparison of a new digital mammogram image with the existing collection of digital mammogram image in the database. The digital mammogram images in the database that exactly identical to the new digital mammogram image will be sources of yielding finding and recommendation of new digital mammogram image.

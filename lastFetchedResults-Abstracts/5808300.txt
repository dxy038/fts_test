Majority of the TOTAL DOSE evaluations of MOS devices are made by using Cobalt 60 sources at dose rates which are far from the real conditions found in the natural space environment. When geostationary satellites experienced dose rate around 1 to 2 Krad(Si) per year, the dose rate recommended by the two major test procedures vary from 30 Rad(Si)/hour up to 300Krad(Si)/hour. One can think that those test conditions do not reflect the permanent effects that could occur during the lifetime of the mission. The objective of the study is to evaluate the dose rate effects on circuits representative of the MATRA MHS state-of-the-art CMOS technology used for space parts manufacturing and provide recommendations for future new CMOS technologies characterizations

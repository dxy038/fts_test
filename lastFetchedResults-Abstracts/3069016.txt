A chaotic bidirectional memory model (C-BAM) is constructed through the inclusion of chaotic neurons in the original BAM. Empiric experiments showed the occurrence of a chaotic dynamic capable to generate large diversity of recalled patterns involving complex excursions over all stored memories. This suggested that the retrieval sequence can model the ability of a novice or the ability of an expert to execute a task. Moreover, the paper illustrates a case in which a novice recall can be transformed into an expert recall through parametric variation.

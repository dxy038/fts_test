CO3- and/or F-substituted apatites have been considered as potential bone substitution material for dental and orthopedic applications. The objective of this study was to compare physico-chemical properties and in vitro bioactivity in fetal bovine serum (FBS) of apatites containing CO3 and/or F. The results showed that CO3 and F in apatites have opposite effects on crystallinity and solubility. Calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (HA) and F-substituted apatite (FA) partially transformed to beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) at temperature 950 °C. After immersion in FBS for 10 days, calcium deficient HA, FA, and CO3-substituted apatite (CHA) and CO3- and F-substituted apatite (CFA) pellet surfaces all showed formation of apatite.

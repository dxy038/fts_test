Monaco is a domain-specific language for machine automation programming. It has been developed with the objective to empower domain experts with limited programming capabilities. Its main language features are an imperative notation for reactive systems, concepts for describing asynchronous event handling in a concise way, and a state-of-the-art component approach. Monaco is a programming language with a Pascal-like syntax, but also comes with a visual programming environment. In this paper we review the language Monaco, show the visual representation scheme, report on the programming environment and compare our visual notation to Statecharts.

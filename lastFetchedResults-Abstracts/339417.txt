Objective
Glucocorticoid is widely used for the treatment of diseases such as hematological malignancies. Glucocorticoid sensitivity is different from person to person and the mechanism of the regulation of glucocorticoid sensitivity is not well known. Glucocorticoid resistance is a major clinical problem.
Methods and Results

Here, using glucocorticoid-induced T-cell apoptosis, a model system for the analysis of the mechanism of glucocorticoid action, we clarified that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) modify glucocorticoid sensitivity, namely that the activation of extracellular signalâ€“regulated protein kinase (ERK) and p38 MAP kinase reduce and enhance glucocorticoid sensitivity, respectively.
Conclusion

These findings might provide new tools for overcoming glucocorticoid-resistance.

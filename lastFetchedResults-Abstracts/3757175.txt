This letter studies single-input dc-dc converter topologies that are suitable to be expanded into their multiple-input converter version. The analysis is based on several assumptions, restrictions, and conditions, including the goal of minimizing the total number of components and the use of at least one forward-conducting bidirectional blocking switch in each input leg. These conditions may affect the outcome of the multiple-input converter synthesis and lead to different configurations from those suggested before in the literature. Although simultaneous power delivery from all sources is not required, it should be possible to independently control the power drained from each input with some degree of freedom. The letter lists four rules that must be observed in order to be able to realize a multiple-input converter from its single-input version. These rules are used to identify the only feasible input cell that complies with all assumptions and conditions. Unfeasible input cells are also shown. The letter also identifies some additional feasible input cells if some of the assumptions and conditions are relaxed. These input cells are used to suggest several multiple-input converter topologies. Among them, six topologies, including versions of the single-ended primary inductance converter and the Cuk converters, are introduced through their circuit schematic.

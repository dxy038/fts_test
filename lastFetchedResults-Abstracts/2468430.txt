It is well known that the bidirectional reflectance of a particulate medium such as a planetary regolith depends on the porosity, in contrast to predictions of models based on the equation of radiative transfer as usually formulated. It is shown that this failure to predict porosity dependence arises from an incorrect treatment of the light that passes between the particles. In this paper a more physically correct treatment that takes account of the necessity of preventing particles from interpenetrating is used together with the two-stream approximation to solve the radiative transfer equation and derive improved expressions for the bidirectional and directional-hemispherical reflectances. It is found that increasing the filling factor (decreasing the porosity) increases the reflectance of low and medium albedo powders, but decreases it for ones with very high albedos. The model agrees qualitatively with measured data.

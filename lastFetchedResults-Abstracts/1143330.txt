In this paper, three different processes for puree extraction from Golden Delicious apples and enzyme inactivation are analyzed and compared: (i) hot extraction technique, (ii) cold extraction technique and (iii) a newly developed vacuum puree extraction technology (Zenith ChronoÂ®). The analysis was carried out by means of manual laboratory operations reproducing the three processes. The primary objective of this study was the evaluation of the minimum amount of ascorbic acid that must be added to the three fruit purees in order to contain oxidization and color change in the products. Afterwards, the residual enzymatic activity was checked and characteristics of the products were compared (i.e. fraction of dried solids and consistency of the puree). All of the processes achieved complete enzyme deactivation and an imperceptible color change, and the results of this paper support interest in vacuum puree extraction technology.

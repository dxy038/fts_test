Bollor√© Technologies, EDF and CEA/CEREM started in 1993 a program for the development of a lithium polymer battery technology with a first objective: producing reproducible 40 Ah single cells. A cell design was selected and a manufacturing process based on extrusion was built up. 40 Ah single cells were produced by this process and are undergoing tests. The cycleability obtained at 0.4 and 4 Ah is between 300 and 400 cycles, is still in progress, with a specific capacity around 150 mAh/g of cathodic vanadium oxide. Power tests, thermal modelling and specific energy projections based on the same electrochemical performances confirm the interest of the lithium polymer battery for electric vehicle application.

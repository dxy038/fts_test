Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of presacral neurectomy in women with severe dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis that was treated with conservative surgical intervention. Study Design: One hundred forty-one sexually active women of fertile age with chronic severe dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis were treated with conservative laparoscopic surgery. Patients were assigned randomly to not receive (group A) or receive (group B) presacral neurectomy. At 6 and 12 months after the surgical procedures, the cure rate was evaluated in each patient. The frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain were also evaluated at the same time intervals. Results: The cure rate was significantly higher in group B compared with group A at a follow-up examination at 6 months (87.3% vs 60.3%) and 12 months (85.7% vs 57.1%). At follow-up visits, the frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain were significantly lower in both groups compared with baseline values; in particular, significantly lower values were observed in group B versus group A for the severity. Conclusion: Presacral neurectomy improves the cure rate in women who are treated with conservative laparoscopic surgery for severe dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis.

To some extent all professional health care tools providers depend on technology, be it the area of preventive medicine, diagnosis, therapeutic care, rehabilitation, administration or health related education and training. The field of clinical engineering has immerged as a discipline of biomedical engineering. Clinical Engineering is a discipline whose general objective is to serve the health care organization to improve quality and reliability of the present day health care delivery system. Health care industry in general has two major issues at hand, first one is how to revive the industry to provide standard and quality health &amp; the second issue is, to do this in a cost effective manner. Not only this, clinical engineering also deals with equipment management and purchasing in a way to improve patient care and safety and prevent health impairment of staff and patient, The duties of the clinical engineer also involve selection of desired product, planning proper equipment maintenance and quality standards. With the advancement of technology, engineering has found its way in every discipline of life including medicine, diagnostic and treatment in a modern day care hospital is no longer dependent merely on sign and symptoms. This new field of engineering is perhaps the fusion of equipment control and management growth with human anatomy and physiology, bringing machines ever closer to human though costly but its worth initiating clinical engineering units in medical centres for the benefit of patients thus providing them with high quality of life. In this paper growing role of clinical engineering in medicine and clinical specialties in under developed country is discussed. The responsibility of clinical engineer in context to keep machines and humans in a superb state at each and every step from equipment purcha

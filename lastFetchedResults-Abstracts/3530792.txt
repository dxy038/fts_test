The objective of the paper is to reformulate PoyntingÂ´s theorem in charge-potential terms, and it is shown that the energy flow vector which is obtained simplifies the quantitative description of electromagnetic power transfer. It is closely related to the circuit concepts familiar to all electrical engineers, and, unlike the Poynting vector, is equally useful in communications and in power-frequency applications. It demonstrates the fundamental importance of electrostatic forces in all electromagnetic devices. The author shows that practical difficulties in applying field theory, and, in particular, the Poynting vector, have led to the use of hybrids in which two wholly different viewpoints are mixed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

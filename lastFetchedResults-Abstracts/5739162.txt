Until now, the evaluation of product packaging has been performed subjectively since no other way existed. Previous research has also shown that people tend to prefer images with high fractal dimension. If so, then the fractal dimension of product package images should enable a determination of how preferable product packages would be, or function as an index to estimate whether product packages would attract attention. In this study, we calculated the fractal dimension for packages of 45 types of canned beer. We performed a comparative analysis using the SD method to determine the degree to which the product packages influenced the potential customerÂ´s impression of the product. The results showed that the fractal dimension is highly important to an objective evaluation.

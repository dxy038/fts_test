
Objective: Depression and Anxiety literature in Iran is short of cultural/indigenous studies,
especially with regard to Azeri ethnic group. This study was carried out in order to identify
depression and anxiety aspects in Azeri ethnic group.
Methods: In a cross sectional qualitative design, 32 Azeri informants (14 patients, 13 lay
people, and 5 professionals) recruited in the study using purposeful sampling method.
Individual in-depth interviews were conducted and the collected data were analyzed through
content analysis technique.
Results: Primary results indicated that 11 main theme categories exist in Azeri ethnic
group: avoidance, dysfunction, arousality, disorganized personality, repetition, somatization,
problematic behavior, maladaptive cognition, awareness, positive, and negative emotionality.
Conclusions: Current evidence does not support the hypothesis of “Somatizing” depression
and anxiety in Iranian cultural background, and perhaps other psychological processes are
involved in somatic symptom report. Theoretical advantages and implications of the study in
the framework of clinical and indigenous studies are discussed.

Building Equipment Internet of Things is a network which can connect all kinds of equipment in buildings together. This paper develops a management system for Building Equipment Internet of Things, which not only can acquire equipment operation parameters, environmental data and person location infomation, but also can publish these data to the Internet. The architecture of this system and some important modules in it are introduced in detail, including the flow of the Communication Service Module, the data structures of the real-time database, the frames of three important tables in Database. Compared to the traditional Building Automation Systems, this system can make it possible for people to access the data of equipment, environment as well as person position through the Internet, and control every device by any remote computerÂ´s Web browser. Moreover, our system can realize both the multi-objective optimization energy saving control and the fault diagnosis of equipment based on the data above. Finally, if added in it the functions of energy consumption collecting and monitoring as well as the functions of building power quality monitoring, this system can be expanded easily to a comprehensive building equipment and energy management system based on Internet of Things.

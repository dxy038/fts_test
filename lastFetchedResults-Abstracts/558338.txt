Rice straw is widely cultivated and harvested once or twice annually in almost all rural areas in north of Iran and could be used in producing composite soil blocks with better characteristics. This paper reports on an experimental investigation into the physical and mechanical performance of a composite soil reinforced with rice straw and the model the behavior of composite soil. The main objective of the work is to analyze the characteristics of a sample of soil that available in the Markazi province region of Iran and to investigate the possibility of enhancing soil properties by reinforcement with rice straw at different levels. Based on the experiments on the soil, the following features are obtained: Soil type: cl, Wop = 15%,gdmax=1.83, P.L.= 22%, L.L.=33%, PI=11% Stress-strain relation is highly nonlinear and sensitive to various factors such as fiber contents, confining pressures and sample curing periods. This paper uses the fuzzy modeling for finding the nonlinear relations. Simulation results are very promising

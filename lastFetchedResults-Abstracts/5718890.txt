The search for assessment methods able to reach an objective judgement of student´s knowledge is a crucial goal for both teachers and educational institutions.

The purpose of this paper is to present a new trend on Web-based assessment of student´s learning based on compiler framework, which allow computer to check free text format of student´s answers for a specific programming language.

The purpose of this study was to examine the factors affecting gestation length in 209 foalings from 65 heavy draft horses by multiple linear regression analysis. The objective variable was gestation length, and the explanatory variables were stud farm, year foaled, month foaled, age of mare, parity of mare, last gestation length, foal gender, and some meteorological parameters (the mean values of prepartum 10 days: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average barometric pressure, and hours of sunshine in a day). The mean gestation length for 209 foalings was 334.9 (standard deviation = 8.3) days, with a range of 313-352 days. Stepwise regression analysis showed that last gestation length and foal gender had significant (P < .01) effects on gestation length. Multiple regression analysis showed that last gestation length (standard partial regression coefficient = 0.54) was more influential on the present gestation length than foal gender (standard partial regression coefficient = 0.22). The present gestation length and the last gestation length were moderately positively correlated (r = 0.56, P < .01). Colt foal (n = 106) pregnancies were significantly (P < .01) longer than fillies (n = 103) (mean ± SEM: colt 337.1 ± 0.7 vs. filly 332.7 ± 0.9). According to our results, last gestation length (mare itself) and foal gender were the main factors affecting gestation length in heavy draft horses. Once several gestation lengths are known, predictions with acceptable accuracy can be made about the gestation length of that mare's following foaling.

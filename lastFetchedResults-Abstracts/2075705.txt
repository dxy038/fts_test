It has been suggested that extraterrestrial organic material may well represent an important part of the organic material available for the origin of life. It may be expected that early life on Mars was similar to prokaryotic life on Earth and whatever preceded the prokaryotes. Detection of markers of microorganisms on Mars is then a key point in the search for life. The analytical technique has to be robust, sensitive and non-specific due to the large scope of targeted molecules. The main objective of this work is to present the capabilities of a TMAH-PY-GC–MS technique for the in situ analysis of organic matter in extraterrestrial soil samples. Two Martian analogues were analyzed to validate the technique. Biomarkers of microbial and higher plants origin such as lipids (n-alkenes, fatty acids) and carbohydrates were detected in samples. In the two samples, fatty acids had a microbial origin. On the other hand, n-alkenes and n-alkanols were from preserved higher plants biopolymers. TMAH-PY-GC–MS technique presented the advantage to wider the scopes of targeted molecules without adding additional device as pyrolysers are already used in spacecraft.

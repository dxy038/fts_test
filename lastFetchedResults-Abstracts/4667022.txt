A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes communicating within a transmission range and it is a self-configuring network of mobile routers. The concept of caching frequently accessed data provides efficient communication among mobile nodes. The main objective is to avoid the stale data using invalidation policy based on TTL. In this paper we introduce an Enhanced Adaptive TTL (EATTL) algorithm in which each 1-hop distance nodeÂ´s to data cache node maintain a hash table for cache invalidation. Data item name is used as key and TTL used as its value. Simulations are carried out in NS-2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The simulation results showed that EATTL algorithm can cut the query delay by a factor of 3 and double the throughput compared to the Adaptive TTL.

The most important Sasanian-Islamic port of Iran in the Persian Gulf was Siraf, with a total population of 300,000. The ruined site of Siraf lies on the Persian Gulf, 230 Km. south-east of Bushehr. By the time Siraf was mentioned first (c. 850), it was already a flourishing port with merchants dealing with India, East Africa, Madagascar, Malay Peninsula and China. Siraf had a prominent role in the transfer of Indian medical knowledge to Jundi Shahpur medical school during Sasanian period. In addition to Indian medicine and Ayurvedaic medicine, Siraf was the gate of Jundi Shahpur for Egyptian and Hellenistic medicine in the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods. This relationship was bidirectional and the heritage of Jundi Shahpur medical school including its medical books, medicinal plants and medical knowledge were transferred to the East by Indian and Chinese sailors and merchants. The import and export of medicinal plants and the existence of the storages of medicinal plants in Siraf port was mentioned in many times by historical geographists of the middle ages. In conclusion, this Sasanian-Islamic port had a key role in the introduction of medicinal plants and the transmission of knowledge of medicine from India, East Africa, Egypt and China to the rising Jundi Shahpur medical school. The critical function of introduction of oriental medicine and medicinal plants to Iran through Siraf port was continued for several centuries, even after the down of Jundi Shahpur medical school.

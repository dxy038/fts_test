We for the first time implement a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to optimize the display panel gate driver circuits with amorphous silicon thin-film transistors (ASG driver circuit). The MOEA is integrated with a circuit simulator based upon a unified optimization framework. The results of this study indicate the developed optimization flow can find the better solutions than a simple GA. The measurement data of the fabricated sample further show the achieved result is robust and superior to the original design. This approach benefits design and manufacturing of display panels in the industry of information and communications technology.

A formulation for the feeder reconfiguration to reduce power loss, increase system security and improve power quality by considering operational constraints is presented. The problem formulation proposed is a constrained, multiobjective and nondifferentiable optimisation problem. The optimal feeder configuration can simultaneously attain the above objectives. However, these objectives are noncommensurable such that it is difficult to solve this class of problem by conventional approaches that optimise a single objective. Thus; these objective functions are first formulated in fuzzy sets to represent their imprecise nature. A fuzzy satisfied method based on evolutionary programming is then introduced to determine the optimal solution. The proposed approach is implemented in a software package and its effectiveness is verified through numerical examples on the Tai-power system

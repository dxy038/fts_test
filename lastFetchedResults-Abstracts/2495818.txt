Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is one of the most efficient techniques among severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods that enhance the mechanical properties of polycrystalline metals by refining subjected grains. In this article, equal channel multi angular pressing (ECMAP) process as one of the effective ECAP methods on production of ultra-fine grained (UFG) Al5754 strips is studied. Route C is considered as a multi pressing route and grey relational analysis is used as the optimization method. Geometrical parameters were taken as input variables and strain inhomogeneity index, equivalent plastic strain and required process load were taken as the objectives. The suggested tests by full factorial method were simulated by FEM. Finite element simulations were done by ABAQUS commercial software and obtained results were validated by analytical methods and experimental tests. Then considering all input and output parameters, optimization was done and optimum values of input parameters were elicited. Also, the effectiveness of each parameter on the objective parameters was obtained. It is concluded that, among geometrical parameters of route C, die channel angle (?_2) and die corner angle (?_1) have the maximum and minimum effectiveness respectively..

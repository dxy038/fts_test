This work presents a novel algorithm to solve the dynamic optimization problem with flexible constraints. The objective of the problem is considered with different degree of satisfaction. Fuzzy inference is then incorporated into iterative dynamic programming (IDP) to find the solution. Two typical problems are employed to demonstrate the capability and efficiency for the proposed algorithm

IceCube is a neutrino observatory in operation at the geographical South Pole. The main objective of IceCube is to conduct very-high-energy neutrino astronomy, including the search for the sources of cosmic rays. IceCube operates by measuring Cherenkov light from particles produced in neutrino–matter interactions. IceCube has made multiple observations including atmospheric neutrinos and cosmic ray anisotropy. For the first time, IceCube is reporting the observation of 28 events consistent with an astrophysical origin. The events have energies that range from ≈ 30 TeV to ≈ 1.2 PeV . The atmospheric origin of the events is excluded at the 4.1σlevel. In these proceedings we summarize the study of these 28 events. We also present the results of the search for neutrinos in coincidence with GRB 130427A.

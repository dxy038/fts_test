
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neck pain is very common in new industrial societies. Endurance and neuromuscular trainings are two types of exercise therapy to treat patients with chronic non-specific neck pain. So, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two exercise protocols including: endurance training and proprioceptive exercise, in treatment of patients with chronic non-specific neck pain.
METHODS: Forty seven patients (male and female) with chronic non-specific neck pain participated in this experimental study. Subjects were randomized into two exercise groups: endurance training (ET) and proprioceptive training (PT) to get their exercises for 10 daily sessions. To measure deep flexor muscle endurance (mmHg), pressure biofeedback (Chatannooga) was used, cervico-cranial joint position error (degree) calculated with laser resource device and neck pain and disability identified by using Neck Disability Index, Neck Pain and Disability Scale Questionnaires and Visual Analog Scale before, 10 days and 45 days after treatment.
FINDINGS: Joint position error, endurance index and pain changed significantly after treatment in 2 groups; (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Mean percentage difference of variables for endurance index improved significantly more in endurance training group (p < 0.03), and more improvement in joint position error measurement was found in proprioceptive group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It seems that ten sessions of endurance and proprioceptive training can improve endurance and reduce joint position error and pain in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain. Endurance training appeared to be more efficient for enhancement of the level of muscle endurance in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain. However, proprioceptive training sounds more effective in reducing joint position error pain in such a group of patients.

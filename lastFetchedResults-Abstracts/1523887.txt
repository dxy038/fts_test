A novel analytical method is proposed for rapid simultaneous determination of five 4-hydroxycoumarin rodenticides in animal liver tissues by eluent generator reagent free ion chromatography (RFIC) with fluorescence detection. Rodenticides were initially extracted from homogenized animal liver tissues with ethyl acetate and the extracts subjected to a solid-phase extraction process using Oasis HLB cartridges. The IC separation was carried out on an IonPac® AS11 analytical column (250 mm × 4.0 mm) using gradient KOH containing 10% acetonitrile as organic modifier at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analytes were detected by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 270 nm and an emission wavelength of 380 nm. The average recoveries of the objective compounds spiked in animal liver tissues were between 81% and 98%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.004–0.010 mg/kg for them. Within-day and day-to-day relative standard deviations (RSD) were less than 8.5% and 9.7%, respectively. It was confirmed that this method could be used in a toxicological analysis.

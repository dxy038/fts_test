A robust controller design method is implemented for the aircraft control. The objective is to replace a linear compensator which is design to control the aircraft system by a sliding-mode controller. The nonlinear control law has to recover a nominal time response which is already obtained using the linear controller. The main advantage of employing the variable structure method is to make the system insensitive to a particular class of model uncertainties and actuator faults. Eigenstructure assignment technique is employed to design the sliding surface. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method to control the aircraft system.

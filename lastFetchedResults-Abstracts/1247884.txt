Background: One of the complications of Iron drop recommended for 6-24 months children is the potential reduction in microhardness of primary tooth enamel because of low pH. The objective of this study is to assess the protective effect of amorphous calcium phosphate caseine phosphopeptide (ACP-CPP) and silicone oil in primary teeth.
Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted primary anterior teeth were divided into three equal groups. The initial micro hardness was measured by Vickerâ€™s microhardness tester. The first group without a protective layer and the second and third group after application of ACP-CPP and silicone oil respectively, were immersed in iron drop. Microhardness was remeasured. One tooth in each group along with a tooth not exposed to iron drop were randomly chosen for SEM qualitative analysis. Analysis was performed with Repeated measures ANOVA with SPSS-18.
Results: All groups exhibited significant decrease of micro hardness (p=0.001), however, no contrasting pattern was found between various groups.
Conclusion: Neither ACP-CPP nor silicone oil could not provide a significant protection against micro hardness reduction after exposure to iron drop

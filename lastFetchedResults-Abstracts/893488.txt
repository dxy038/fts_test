Entrepreneurship is the driving force behind the economy of any country. It is strongly believed that 
without entrepreneurial activities the process of agricultural development will not be achieved. This 
requires the proper transformation of capital and skill. The agricultural students should possess 
creativity in order for them to be able to start new businesses. However with the support of the 
university reaching this goal is impossible. Hence the objective of this descriptive-correlative paper is 
to evaluate the entrepreneurial atmosphere created by the university as well as its effects on the 
tendency of agricultural students to start creative businesses. The statistical population of this research 
includes the agricultural students studying in Islamic Azad University, Ilam Branch (320 people), 
among which 169 ones were selected by using Bartlett table and random sampling method as the 
sample for the study. The research tool was a questionnaire. Its validation was confirmed by structural 
equation modeling and its stability by using Cronbachâ€™s Alpha Coefficient (0.91). Based on the results 
the tendency of the students towards entrepreneurship is estimated as an average tendency. The results 
of modeling showed that the entrepreneurial supports of the university possess an indirect impact on the 
tendency of the students to start a new business via changing the attitude towards entrepreneurship and 
general skills. The results of the current study can have implications for the educational structure of 
agriculture. Hence we recommended some methods for creating a proper entrepreneurial atmosphere for 
paving the way of creating new businesses in this field.

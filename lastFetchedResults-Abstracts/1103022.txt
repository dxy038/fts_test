The paper reports the nightglow observations of hydroxyl (8–3), (7–2) and (6–2) Meinel band carried out at a low latitude station Kolhapur (16.8°N, 74.2°E, dip latitude 10.6°N), India during November 2002 to May 2005 with the objective of investigating mesopause dynamics based on derived OH rotational temperature. Overall, 132 nights of quality data were collected using filter-tilting photometer and an all-sky scanning photometer. The mean mesopause temperature observed at Kolhapur is 195 ± 11, 196 ± 9 and 195 ± 7 K from OH (8–3), (7–2) and (6–2) band emissions, respectively, using transition probabilities given by Langhoff et al. [Langhoff, S.R., Werner, H.J., Rosmus, P. Theoretical transition probabilities for the OH Meinel system. Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy 118, 507–529, 1986]. Small wave-like variations (periodicities ∼ few hours) existing over long period variations in derived temperatures are also present. A steady decrease of emission intensities from evening to dawn hours has been observed in approximately 59% of nights. No significant change of nightly mean temperatures has been noted. Furthermore, about 62% of observed nightly mean temperatures lie within one error bar of MSISE-90 model predictions.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare 2 anti-incontinence procedures in women who had severe genital prolapse and potential stress incontinence.
Study design
In addition to vaginal reconstructive surgery, 50 patients with stage II or higher anterior defect and a positive stress test result with prolapse reduction received either tension-free vaginal tape or plication of the endopelvic fascia. Preoperative evaluation included history, physical examination, stress test, and urodynamic assessment. Data were analyzed with the Student t test, the Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
The median follow-up time was similar for both groups, 26 and 24 months. Subjective (96% vs 64%; P = .01) and objective (92% vs 56%; P<.01) continence rates were higher after the tension-free vaginal tape procedure. Time for the resumption of spontaneous voiding, rates of urinary retention, or de novo urge incontinence were similar in the 2 groups.
Conclusion
Tension-free vaginal tape can be recommended for patients with prolapse and occult stress incontinence.

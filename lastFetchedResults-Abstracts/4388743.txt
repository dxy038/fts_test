The power loss reduction is one of the main targets for any electrical energy distribution company. In this paper the problem of the joint optimization of both topology and network parameters in a real Smart Grid is faced. A portion of the Italian electric distribution network managed by the ACEA Distribuzione S.p.A. located in Rome is considered. It includes about 1200 user loads, 70 km of MV lines, 6 feeders, a Thyristor Voltage Regulator and 6 distributed energy sources (5 generator sets and 1 photovoltaic plant). The power factor correction (PFC) is performed tuning the 5 generator sets and setting the state of the breakers in order to perform the distributed feeder reconfiguration (DFR). About the DFR, in this paper we introduce a simplified graph representation of the electrical network and we propose a new algorithm to find all the radial network configurations. The PFC and the DFR optimization is faced by defining and solving a suited multi-objective optimization problem adopting a genetic algorithm. Tests have been performed by feeding the simulation environment with real data concerning dissipated and generated active and reactive power values. First results are very interesting, showing that considering all the possible admissible network configurations can help the optimization procedure in finding better solutions.

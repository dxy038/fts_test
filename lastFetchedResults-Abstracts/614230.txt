Background: The scientific development of communities is one of the factors affecting the Human Development Index (HDI). 
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the human development index and the number of scientific articles of countries indexed in the ISI database. 
Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, the human development index and the number of articles indexed in the ISI database during the past five years (2005-2010) were extracted from the internet resources for every country. The study population was consisted of all countries in four groups: more developed, less developed, developing and underdeveloped countries. A group of selected countries and two groups of countries based on oil revenue and non-oil revenue were also determined. Data were analyzed by pearson correlation coefficient using SPSS software. Trend analysis charts and Scatter diagrams were depicted using EXCEL software.
Findings: scatter diagrams showed that with increasing number of scientific articles, the human development index is increasing in more developed countries. The trends in the less developed, developing and selected countries were decreasing, increasing and rapid decreasing, respectively. 
Conclusion: With regard to the results, increase in the human development index is dependent on factors other than scientific production. In the field of applied science, complete scientific cycle is not limited to the first chain (scientific production) and scientific progress must be effective in all components include technological development, economic growth and decreasing unemployment.

A multi-resolution speech and audio sinusoidal analysis/synthesis model based on an improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is proposed in this paper. Because of the special filtering characteristic and superiority in dealing with non-stationary signal of EMD, a preprocessing module is adopted to classify the original signal by using the energy ratio and spectrum center of each Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF). A pure tone is added into original signal to extract the noise-like high frequency components without destroying the harmonics of signal. Then a multi-resolution Perceptual Weighted Matching Pursuit (PWMP) and frequency fine search method are adopted to estimate the sinusoidal parameters. Finally, objective measurements of perceived audio quality (PEAQ) show that this model can be effective for the audio synthesis.

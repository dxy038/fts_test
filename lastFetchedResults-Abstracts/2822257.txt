This paper presents comparison of optimized permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMa-SynRM) with three-phase and five-phase architectures. The three-phase and five-phase PMa-SynRMs are designed with magnetic equivalent circuits (lumped parameter model (LPM)) and 2D finite element analysis (FEA) approach. Objective function with torque ripple, motor cost and efficiency is used to derive optimal design of each motor. Multiple parametric simulations are done to minimize the objective function through differential evolution strategy (DES). Both PMa-SynRMs are fabricated with same power rating (3kW) and same volume. Torque pulsation, back electromotive force (EMF), flux linkage, d- and q-axis inductances versus their respective currents and cogging torque are intensively simulated through FEA and are experimentally tested on the prototypes.

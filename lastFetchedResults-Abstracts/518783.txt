Introduction & Objective: Second trimester labor induction is a major problem in obstetrics and is the cause of two-thirds of all abortion related complications and more than half of the maternal deaths associated with abortion. The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of vaginal misoprostol and intravenous oxytocin for termination of second trimester pregnancy.

Materials & Methods: One hundred women were allocated in a randomized controlled way to one of the two induction groups: oxytocin group patients initially received an infusion of 50 units of oxytocin in 500 ml of ringer over 3 hours, 1 hour of no oxytocin followed by alternating 3 hours of oxytocin with 1 hour of rest. Oxytocin was increased by 50 units in each successive period until a final concentration of 300 units per 500 ml has been reached. Another group received 200 jig misoprostol tablets in posterior fornix vagina and was repeated after 12 hours if needed. The two groups were compared for induction to delivery intervals and their safety during induction.

Results: The success rate within 24 hours of induction was 94% in the misoprostol group and 86% in oxytocin group (p= 0.182). The mean induction to delivery time was significantly longer in the oxytocin group compared with the misoprostol group.(13.5 versus 9.93 hours ; P=0.0057). Retained placenta requiring curettage was lower in the misoprostol group than the oxytocin group.

Conclusion: Intravaginal misoprostol is more effective than high dose intravenous oxytocin in women with second trimester termination.

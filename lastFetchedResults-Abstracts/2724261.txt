Complex industrial processes are controlled by the local regulation controllers at the field level, and the setpoints for the regulation are usually made by manual decomposition of the overall economic objective according to the operatorsÂ´ experience. If a precise static process model can be built, real-time optimization (RTO) can be used to generate the setpoints. Nevertheless, since the aforementioned control structure is actually open-loop, the desired economic objective of the whole processes may not be tracked when disturbances exist. Aiming at solving this problem, a novel network based model predictive control method (MPC) for setpoints compensation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a multivariable proportional integral (PI) controller is designed to perform the local regulation control. Secondly, a stochastic packet dropout model is adopted to characterize the measurement and human-in-the-loop delay effect. Then, a model predictive controller considering the random dropout effect is developed to compensate the setpoints dynamically according to the changing conditions of the processes, such that the prescribed performance objective can be obtained. Finally, a flotation process model is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

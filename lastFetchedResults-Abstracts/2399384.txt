Objective
l resin composite system, Filtek Silorane (3M ESPE) with reduced polymerization shrinkage has recently been introduced. The resin contains an oxygen-containing ring molecule (‘oxirane’) and cures via a cationic ring-opening reaction rather than a linear chain reaction associated with conventional methacrylates and results in a volumetric shrinkage of ∼1%. The purpose of this study was to review the literature on a recently introduced resin composite material, Filtek Silorane, and evaluate the clinical outcome of restorations formed in this material.
s
 Silorane restorations were placed where indicated in loadbearing situations in the posterior teeth of patients attending five UK dental practices. These were evaluated, after two years, using modified USPHS criteria.
s
l of 100 restorations, of mean age 25.7 months, in 64 patients, were examined, comprised of 30 Class I and 70 Class II. All restorations were found to be present and intact, there was no secondary caries. Ninety-seven per cent of the restorations were rated optimal for anatomic form, 84% were rated optimal for marginal integrity, 77% were rated optimal for marginal discoloration, 99% were rated optimal for color match, and 93%% of the restorations were rated optimal for surface quality. No restoration was awarded a “fail” grade. No staining of the restoration surfaces was recorded and no patients complained of post-operative sensitivity.
icance
concluded that, within the limitations of the study, the two year assessment of 100 restorations placed in Filtek Silorane has indicated satisfactory clinical performance.

The objective of the present study is to experimentally observe thermal interaction, which is capable of triggering, due to water entrained, or entrapped within crusted melt jets with ‘large-scale structures’. The present experiment was carried out by dropping molten zinc and molten tin of 100 g. These were sufficient to generate large-scale structures of melt jets. The results showed that the entrapment-type thermal interaction occurs in molten-zinc jets with rare probability, and the entrainment-type thermal interaction occurs in molten tin jets with high probability. The difference in thermal interaction between the molten zinc and molten tin is considered to be mainly due to a difference in kinematic viscosity between them.

The ever increase in demand for bandwidth and services related to high performance broadband wireless communications has opened the doors for use of multiple antennas both at the transmitter and the receiver. The wireless channel properties are dynamic by nature as it is frequency selective as well as time dependent. MIMO channel estimation technique has been one among the prime focus areas among the researchers in past two decades, which has emerged as one among the novel techniques to support the ever increase in demand for bandwidth as well as high data rate to support upcoming telecom and multimedia services. Combination of MIMO with OFDM as well as UWB techniques has shown improved performance in providing high data rate with low complex receiver properties and channel capacity. Recently researchers have shown interest in applying MIMO-OFDM in estimating channel parameters of underwater acoustic channels. The objective of the present paper is to present the developments made by researchers in channel estimation techniques in MIMO environment in recent past years.

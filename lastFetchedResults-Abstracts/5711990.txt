War-time transport path optimization is a multi-objective optimization problem. There are some uncertain factors. In order to solve the problem quicker and more effective, this article uses fuzzy math theory and sets up a multi-objective optimization model with the transit-time satisfaction and the arrival traffic satisfaction as the goals. At the same time, the paper designs a new hybrid algorithm combined with AG, TSA and PSO. Here designs the fuzzy-hybrid optimal algorithm using the fuzzy multi-objective optimization modal and the fuzzy-hybrid algorithm. Through the example, we can find that the fuzzy-hybrid algorithm is better than the other algorithms.

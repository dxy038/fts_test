Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films have been recently applied to surface modification of biomaterials. Cellular interactions with PEM films consisted of weak polyelectrolytes are greatly affected by the conditions of polyelectrolyte deposition, such as pH of polyelectrolyte solution. Previous studies indicated that the adhesion of several types of mammalian cells to PAH/PAA multilayer films was hindered by low pH and high layer numbers. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the hemocompatibility of polysulfone can be modulated by deposition of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) multilayer films. PAH/PAA multilayer films with different layer numbers were assembled onto polysulfone at either pH 2.0 or pH 6.5. The number of platelet adhesion and the morphology of adherent platelets were determined to evaluate hemocompatibility of modified substrates. Compared to non-treat polysulfone, the PEM films developed at pH 2.0 decreased platelet adhesion, while those built at pH 6.5 enhanced platelet deposition. Platelet adhesion was found positively correlated to polyclonal antibodies binding to surface-bound fibrinogen. The extent of platelet spreading was increased with layer numbers of PEM films, suggesting that the adherent platelets on thick PEM films were prone to activation. In conclusion, PAH/PAA films with few layers developed at pH 2.0 possessed better hemocompatibility compared to other substrates.

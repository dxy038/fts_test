Astaxanthin, a natural nutritional component, is marketed as a dietary supplement around the world. The primary commercial source for astaxanthin is Haematococcus pluvialis (microalgae). The objective of the present study was to investigate the acute and subchronic toxicity of an astaxanthin-rich biomass of H. pluvialis (AstaCaroxÂ®). The oral LD50 of the biomass in rats was greater than 12 g/kg body weight. In the subchronic study, Wistar rats (10/sex/group) were fed diets containing 0%, 1%, 5% and 20% of the biomass (weight/weight) for 90 days. trans-Astaxanthin was quantifiable in the plasma of the high-dose treated group only. Compared to the control group, no treatment-related biologically significant effects of astaxanthin were noted on body weight or body weight gain. Biomass feeding did not affect hematological parameters. In the high-dose group, slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase and changes in some urine parameters and an increase in kidney weight in both sexes were noted. Histopathology examinations did not reveal adverse effects except for a marginal increase in pigment in the straight proximal tubule of the kidney in 5/10 female rats treated with the high-dose. These changes were not considered as toxicologically significant. Although the rats in high-dose group received about 9% more fat, it is unlikely that this confounding factor significantly altered the outcome. The no-observed adverse-effect-levels (NOAEL) of the astaxanthin-rich biomass for male and female rats were determined as 14,161 and 17,076 mg/kg body weight/day, or 465 and 557 mg astaxanthin/kg/day, respectively, the highest dose tested.

Renewable energy sources are emerging as a promising supplementary power sources. Batteries are necessary for storing and supplying energy. A bidirectional isolated full bridge dc to dc converter acts as a link between battery and the system. The existing dc to dc converter is equipped with a flyback snubber, which can reduce the current and voltage spikes. A new converter is proposed in this paper, which can reduce the voltage stress and can achieve near zero voltage switching. Design and the analysis of proposed converter with flyback snubber and passive capacitor-diode snubber is presented in this paper for absorbing the performance using PSIM software with a low side voltage of 48V and high side voltage of 410V.

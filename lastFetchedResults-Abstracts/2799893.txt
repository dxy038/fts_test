This paper presents a comprehensive research for the performances of the three-phase three-level boost rectifier to power-factor correction (PFC) function It uses three bidirectional switches connected to the common capacitive center point of the DC bus that allows the three-level operation and a low blocking-voltage stress on the power switches. Three modulation strategies are compared and the performance due to the mismatched elements or control parameters is presented. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation and experimental results through a 1kW prototype.

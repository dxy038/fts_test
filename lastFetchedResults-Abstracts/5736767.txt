Near-field probes are often used to measure the electric and magnetic fields above a printed circuit board in order to identify the sources and coupling paths of an electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem. It is the objective of this paper to propose a rapid E-, Hx- Hy- and circular H-fields measurement using an orthogonal loops probe design. The effects of this probe are analyzed using full-wave simulations and measurements.

Cantaloupe pastille is a novel as well as healthy fruity product, also it involves suitable processing techniques for decreasing its wastage. Texture perception is an important factor in consumer sensory acceptance also according to international standards, texture is a sensory attribute that must be evaluated by sensory assessors but in industry it is measured by texture analyzers. This study was done being informed from relationships between sensory perception and objective values of cantaloupe pastille textural parameters. Results of study for textural properties with response surface showed that hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness increased when pectin concentration was raised but xanthan concentration declined. PC plot of dependent variables illustrated that hardness and chewiness of samples which were scored by sensory assessors had closely relationships with the same when they were measured by texture analyzers. Also it was observed that there was a reversive relationship among hardness, rubber and chewiness with adhesiveness. It means when values of hardness, rubber, chewiness and cohesiveness increase also cantaloupe pastille acceptance score enhances but value of adhesiveness decreases.

During the course of curriculum evaluation, multiple expert decision combination has received much attention in recent years. But the evaluation point of individual expert is much different from others experts. To avoid the negative influence of the above problem, a novel group decision model is suggested by introducing a compromise coefficient between subjective and objective, which can give attention to both. The model is applied to curriculum evaluation and the result manifests this model is reasonable and applicable.

Grounding electrodes, being the basic component of any grounding system, need to be accurately modeled in transient analysis. Accurate determination of their impulse response has been the objective of many studies in the past. This work presents a novel and easy-to-apply methodology, based on a distributed model of the electrode. In the middle stages, closed-form mathematical expressions are used for the solution of telegraphy equations that describe the propagation of voltage and current waves along the electrode. The final expressions include few terms, so they are suitable for calculations using a pocket calculator. Comparison of results to those from EMTP for fast and slow excitation show good agreement. The performance of the method is investigated at various application cases. Validation of the proposed methodology is achieved in particular cases by comparison with calculation results available in literature.

Introduction: Surgical removal of adenoid and tonsils is the most common operation in ENT H&N surgery that principally is operated on patients under 15 years. These tissues are arranged as mucosal defense system that are first defense against different organisms and their Ig(s) productions are quite known. Then, this surgery may have an effect on serum Ig(s) levels.
Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine whether adenotonsillectomy actually affected on serum Ig(s) levels.
Materials and Methods: This study was an experimental-like type that investigated 300 patients under 15 years at Amiral Momenin Hospital in Rasht that needed these operations. Serum Ig(s) levls were measured immediately before and one month after operation. Ig(s) of serum were measured with SRID (Single Radiation Immune Diffusion). Adenoid and tonsils were removed with curette and adenotome and incision blunt dissection snare respectively.
Results: Serum IgG levels of all patients were the same pre and post-operations. Preoperative serum IgM levels of 289 cases were normal, but 278 ones had normally postoperative levels. In 11 patients, serum IgM levels decreased post operation in 11 patients. IgM levels that were low preoperations in 4 patients were changed to normal levels postoperatively. In 296 pationts, serum IgA levels were normal pre and post-operation. In 2 of 4 patients, IgA levels reached normal range postoperatively.
Conclusion: Adenotonsillectomy has no significant effect on serum Ig(s) levels.

The main objective of this paper is to achieve prolonged network lifetime with Overall energy efficiency in Ad-hoc sensor networks through controlled utilization of limited energy. In wireless sensor networks, most of the energy spent is consumed in routing the sensed data from cluster head to the base station. To optimize the clustering &amp; routing techniques, we introduce 1.Backup heads (to avoid frequent re-clustering) in each cluster, 2.Secondary membership heads (to eliminate multiple/redundant transmissions,) 3 Optimum distance hopping (to achieve overall energy efficiency of the network.) A modification to existing clustering technique [4], in combination with our energy efficient routing technique (using secondary memberships), results in considerable increase in the overall Network lifetime. Use of secondary memberships (to route the data through shortest path) conserves more energy than that of the extra energy spent for using backup heads in clustering. This results in an Overall Energy Efficiency with prolonged network lifetime.

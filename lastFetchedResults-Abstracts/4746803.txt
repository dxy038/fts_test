Performance degradation of television PAL-G signal due to spread spectrum (SS) interference is investigated. An analytical expression between RF TV protection ratio (CIR) and baseband unweighted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR<sub>V</sub>), for co-channel spread spectrum and noise interference, is derived. Subjective and objective measurements are also presented in order to clarify the validity of the analytical expressions. The results presented, characterize the degradation of the analogue PAL-G signal in an S.S. overlay scenarios.

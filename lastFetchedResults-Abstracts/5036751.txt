The author proposes the use of constraint languages for the specification of rule pattern tests. This will help the programmer focus on his primary objective: specifying the match conditions. It is shown how such constraints can then be mechanically operationalized into rule tests. Following the automated optimal order to these tests, the resulting ordered tests can be cast into an efficient network program. Restricting the programmerÂ´s task to match specification allows new (graphical and other) languages to be devised for highly effective human-computer interaction

Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) are rapidly increasing their popularity and ductility, being an essential element for smart cities and smart driving. Layer three standards have already been approved, but they do not pursue optimality in terms of high throughput. This paper aims to identify a new algorithm to put on top of the standard routing layer, namely Self hEaling Infotainment and safetY Application (SEIYA), in order to create a vehicular distributed backbone, able to stay up as long as possible (thus reducing the election phase overhead). The main objective is to enable high speed data routes for several kinds of safety and infotainment applications of a stable vehicular cloud: traffic monitoring, emergency signals, augmented reality information are just few examples. Our approach is validated through simulations on real maps with realistic vehicle flows and high throughput demands.

The author demonstrate monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) switch networks with complexities up to 4*4 have been demonstrated using multiple chips, and up to 2*2 and 1*4 have been demonstrated using single chips. All the switches use a combination of series and shunt passive FET switching elements. The 1*2 and 1*4 switches are comprised of a single switching stage. The 2*2 switch comprised of two stages of 1*2 switches. The 4*4 switch is made of four stages of 1*2 switches. The insertion loss increases with switch complexity, and is equivalent to 1.5 to 2 dB per 1*2 switch. All the switches are passive and bidirectional, and all operate from DC to 20 GHz.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Introducing optical transmission into the local network poses a number of severe economic and technological problems. In this paper, we address these problems assuming a future requirement for a wholly monomode transmission network through long/short haul and local lines. The key considerations therefore involve the economic realization of systems in the 2-140 Mbit/s range. Specific laboratory designs at 2, 8, and 34 Mbits/s employing uni- and bidirectional operation are discussed. Field experience at 1.3 and 1.5 &#956;m using very low cost unidirectional and bidirectional systems is reported, including systems based upon directional couplers, wavelength-duplex, and "piggyback" schemes.

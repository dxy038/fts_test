Sod culture is one of the important methods in establishing and
repairing of turf grass, especially in sport fields. Nowadays, a mixture of sand
and peat are commonly used in sod production in Iran. Because peat media is
expensive, it seems necessary to find an alternative medium. Rice hull, tea
waste and leaf compost as economical organic material that are available in
huge loads in north of Iran. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
utilization of low cost organic matter on seed germination and uniformity of
turf grass in sod production. Therefore a completely randomized design with
3 replications and 6 treatments: 1- mixture of leaf compost and sand (1:1)
(v.v), 2- tea compost and sand (1:1) (v.v), 3- sand, 4- mixture of rice hull and
sand (3:1) (v.v), 5- mixture of treatments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6- petri dish as control
was carried out in the experimental field of agricultural school of Islamic
Azad University, Chaloos branch during summer 2008. Turf grass species
used was Lolium prenne. According to the results, it was revealed that the
effect of different substrates was significant on seed germination percentage
(p?0.05). Results showed that mixture of rice hull and sand (3:1) (v.v)
increased germination percentage over other treatments. This was probably
related to high water retaining capacity and well aeration of rice hull.
Furthermore, the lowest and highest uniformity rate was related to mixture
treatment and sand media, respectively. It generally seems that these waste
products can be used for this purpose economically and sustainably.

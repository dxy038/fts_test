This paper investigates a control design methodology to achieve a stable controller for a multivariable system inside the fault tolerance framework. The main goal consists of designing a time invariant controller that guarantees stability even with a certain performance in terms of decay rate subject to random transient failures both in sensors and actuators. LMI, BMI, and other possible solutions are pursued for this objective. The most general case of fault tolerant including internal failures is also discussed. Finally a numerical example is shown to illustrate the proposed control design method.

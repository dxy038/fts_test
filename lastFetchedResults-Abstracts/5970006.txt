An integrated research programme on the scattering properties of non-vegetated terrains has been established at the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL) of the Joint Research Centre of European Communities. Part of this programme consists of the experimental research on retrieval of soil moisture profiles. The experiment was set up with the objective to create, under controlled conditions, different datasets which enable the study of soil moisture retrieval from microwave observations and the capability to reconstruct soil moisture profiles. The data sets consist of moisture and temperature profiles in a sandy soil using time domain reflectometry (TDR) and thermo-couples (TC), in combination with monostatic, multifrequency (1-10 GHz), polarimetric radar measurements. The article describes the experimental setup at EMSL and outlines the methodology used for data analysis. Results of TDR measurements are presented and compared with numerical simulation results

Objective through interesting organ segmentation, realize organ and tumor 3D transparent visualization and give clinical support. Methods Use personal computer to conduct morphology image process, technical analyses, process threshold segmented tissue and set grade by using grade trans-function to give organ multilayer transparent visualization. Result and Conclusions Experimental results demonstrated that using this method on personal computer can conveniently and fast to construct 3D image and retain relating environmental information and at same time can also observe internal organ construction qualitatively and quantitatively.

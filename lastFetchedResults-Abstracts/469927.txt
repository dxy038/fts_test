Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of botulinum-A toxin (BTX-A) treatment for non-neurogenic detrusor overactivity incontinence.
Study design
This prospective nonrandomized ongoing study was performed in a tertiary referral urogynecology department. In 26 women with urge incontinence and urodynamically demonstrated detrusor overactivity incontinence resistant to conventional treatment 100 units of BTX-A were injected into the detrusor muscle at 30 sites. Clinical and urodynamic evaluations and a quality of life assessment were performed at baseline and 4, 12, and 36 weeks after BTX-A treatment.
Results
Of 26 women, 14 were dry after 4 weeks, 13 of 20 women after 12 weeks, and 3 of 5 women after 36 weeks. Two women failed to respond. Two women were on self-catheterization temporarily. There were no other complications besides 9 urinary tract infections within the 51 follow-up visits.
Conclusion
BTX-A treatment seems to be a safe and efficacious new treatment option for patients with detrusor overactivity incontinence.

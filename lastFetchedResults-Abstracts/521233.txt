Background: Patients with arrested preterm labor (PTL) are at increased risk for recurrence of
preterm birth (PTB). Maintenance tocolysis after arrest of acute PTL is of questionable value. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 200 mg vaginal progesterone in order to
prevent PTB in women with episodes of threatened PTL.
Materials and Methods: This is a randomized double blind clinical trial study.Women with singleton
pregnancies between 28-36 weeks of gestation, who were hospitalized for PTL were included. A
total of 173 pregnant patients were randomly allocated to receive 200 mg vaginal progesterone
suppositories (n=86) or placebo (n=87) daily until the 36th gestational week. The two groups were
compared relative to demographic characteristics, incidence of PTB before 34 and 37 weeks, and
maternal and neonatal complications. Data were analyzed by chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests.
Results: Mean latency until delivery in the cases was longer than the control group (23.88 ± 18.01
vs. 16.67 ± 12.9; p=0.004).Treatment with progesterone was not associated with a reduction in
the rate of PTB before 34 weeks [cases: 9 (10.8%) vs. controls: 8 (10%)] and 37 weeks [cases: 45
(54.2%) vs. controls: 33 (41.2%)]. Log rank analysis revealed a significant difference for mean time
to delivery between the two groups (p=0.028). There were no significant differences for neonatal
and maternal complications in the two groups.
Conclusion: Prophylactic administration of 200 mg vaginal progesterone suppositories after
successful tocolysis in patients with threatened idiopathic PTL is associated with a longer latency
to delivery, but failed to reduce the rate of PTB (Registeration Number: IRCT138706051096N1).

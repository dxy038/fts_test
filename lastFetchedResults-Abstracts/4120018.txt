A bidirectional dual-channel chaos communication scheme based on the synchronization in the linear polarization modes of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is introduced numerically. In this scheme, two mutually coupled VCSELs are identically driven by a third chaotic VCSEL. It is demonstrated that high quality chaos synchronization in both the XP and YP modes can be achieved simultaneously. With the polarization-division-multiplexing technology and chaos modulation technology, the proposed scheme affords bidirectional dual-channel message transmission on one public link.

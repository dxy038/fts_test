Background: The mortality prediction represents a key factor in the managing of elderly
hospitalized patients. Since in older subjects mortality results from a combination of biological, functional,
nutritional, psychological and environmental factors, a Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) that
predict short- and long-term mortality based on a standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)
has recently been developed and validated. Objective: This study compares the accuracy in predicting the
mortality of the MPI with a modified version of the MPI (m-MPI) that included the Mini Nutritional
Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) instead of the standard MNA. Design: This prospective study with a
one-year follow-up included 4088 hospitalized patients aged 65 years and older. A standardized CGA that
included information on functional (Activities of Daily Living, ADL and Instrumental-ADL), cognitive
(Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire), risk of pressure sore (Exton-Smith Scale), comorbidities
(CIRS Index), medications, living status and nutritional status (MNA and MNA-SF) was used to calculate
the MPI using a previously validated algorithm. Results: Higher MPI values were significantly associated
with higher mortality rates with a close agreement between the estimated and the observed mortality both
after 1-month (MPI1=2.8% versus m-MPI1=2.8%,p=0.946; MPI2=8.9% versus m-MPI2=9%,p=0.904;
MPI3=21.9% versus m-MPI3=21.9,p=0.978) and 1-year of follow-up (MPI1=10.8% versus m-
MPI1=10.5%,p=0.686; MPI2=27.3% versus m-MPI2=28%, p=0.495; MPI3=52.8% versus m-
MPI3=52.7%,p=0.945). The estimated areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves
suggested a clinically negligible difference between the two indices. Conclusion: The m-MPI is as sensitive
as the MPI in stratifying hospitalized elderly patients into groups at varying risk of short- and long-term
mortality, but with fewer items.

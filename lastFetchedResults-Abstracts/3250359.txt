The objective of this paper is to model, identify, and detect and isolate faults to an industrial gas turbine. The detection scheme is based on the generation of so-called &#8220;residuals&#8221; that are errors between estimated and measured variables of the process. An ARX model is used for residual generation, while for residual evaluation a neural network classifier for MLP is used. The proposed fault detection and isolation tool has been tested on a single-shaft industrial gas turbine model.

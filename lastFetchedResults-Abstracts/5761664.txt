System design´s sizing and natural environmental analysis are two common issues and considered to be among the most crucial part of the study with the objective of enhancing the Grid-connected Photovoltaic (GCPV) performance in Malaysia´s perspective. This a-Si GCPV system located near to the Green Energy Research Centre (GERC) Building at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Shah Alam, Malaysia. This a-Si GCPV system installation was referred to Malaysian Standard MS1837:2010 and designed based on initial data values of PV module characteristics. To date, most of GCPV system applications using thin-film (TF) PV module technologies in Malaysia were designed at stabilized data values. So, this system is conducted to study the derating factor for matching inverter and PV array sizing and behavior of a-Si FS GCPV system under Malaysia´s real condition. The P-V analysis fully utilizes the infield data as a guideline for sizing inverter and PV array, with the aim of guiding the system designer during initial design stage for Malaysia´s climate.

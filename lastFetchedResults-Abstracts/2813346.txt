It is an urgent need to find an objective way to estimate the degree of fatigue of employees. In this study, we designed a monitoring and estimation system for the degree of fatigue. This paper explains a long-term pedaling experiment that we use it to explore the possibility to use only the time sequence data of head movement during pedaling to estimate the fatigue. While we show the possibility for this through experimental data, it is clear that we need to collect more data to establish an estimation method.

One objective of the field experiment CLEOPATRA, Cloud Experiment Oberpfaffenhofen and Transports, May 11-July 31, 1992, was to quantify water vapor transports from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere in dependence an precipitation events and the state of vegetation, and to improve remote sensing methods from ground, aircraft and space for observing elements of the hydrological cycle. The authors report and intercompare measurements of water vapor structures in the clear atmosphere performed simultaneously with a ground based microwave system and a DIAL system on board an aircraft. Measurements for two selected days-May 22 and June 1-showing different water vapor structures are discussed

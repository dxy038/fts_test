In order to fully exploit the high speed broadband multimedia services, prolonging the battery life of user equipment (UE) is critical from userÂ´s perspective, especially for the smartphone users. A collaborative mobile cloud (CMC), which consists of several UEs offers one potential solution for reducing the energy consumption at the terminal side. In this paper, an OFDMA mobile cloud system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer has been considered. The considered CMC is formed by a number of hybrid receivers which have both functionalities of harvesting energy and decoding information from the radio signal. In particular, we study the resource allocation and user scheduling algorithm for minimizing the energy cost of data transmission in the context of mobile cloud. With the objective to minimize the system energy consumption, in each scheduling time, one UE will be selected for receiving and relaying the data, and radio resource will be allocated to the dedicated UE by the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed user scheduling and resource allocation algorithms can achieve the significant energy saving performance.

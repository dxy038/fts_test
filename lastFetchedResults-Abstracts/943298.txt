 ABSTRACT: Water crisis resource management originates from limited resources has made it essential to
study the prioritization of traditional and modern methods of sustainable water resource management. The
objective of such studies is to provide a list of prioritized traditional and modern methods of sustainable
water resource management. This research aims to study rainwater harvesting method and qanat as two
traditional methods of water production and transfer. cisterns (Ab Anbars) and the water consumption
patterns in Persian gardens are considered as two traditional and sustainable methods of water storage and
consumption. The modern methods have been extracted from the Tennessee standard. From the existing
methods, using ground slope for water transfer, adjusting water pressure based on consumption rate,
qanat, cistern, rainwater harvesting system, drip irrigation system, green roof, sustainable vegetative
cover, water absorbing pavement, and rainwater collection system on the roof have been selected and the
investment options are listed for updating and implementation purposes. The rate of energy consumption,
lifetime of facilities, stationary of the method, costs of production and transfer, observing regional
management pattern, use of local materials and professionals, and health issues are the criteria applied for
the prioritization of the items based on Delphi method. The prioritization was carried out by SAW (simple
additive weighting method). According to the results, slope of the ground was the first priority of these
items, and rainwater collecting system on the roof, the last priority.

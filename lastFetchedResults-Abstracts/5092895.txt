In this paper, multi-objective control of a quarter-car suspension system subjected to random road disturbances is studied. The active suspension problem is formulated as a mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> synthesis problem and solved using linear matrix inequalities. It is first demonstrated that the influence of tire damping on the closed-loop performance can be significant. Then, this result is extended to suspension models with polytopic tire damping uncertainties.

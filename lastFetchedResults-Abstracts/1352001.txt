As a task of the EU project IP EUROTRANS towards development of an Accelerator Driven System (ADS) dedicated to the transmutation of long-lived fission products, experiments and simulations were performed on the TALL test facility at KTH to investigate thermal hydraulics along a single fuel rod simulator cooled by leadâ€“bismuth eutectic (LBE). The fuel rod simulator is concentrically inserted in a tube, so that an annular channel is formed for LBE flow. This paper presents the measured temperature profiles in the annular channel, and the comparisons with the simulation results of the CFX code. The primary objective is to help understanding the LBE heat transfer characteristics and qualifying the turbulence and heat transfer modeling for LBE application. The quantitative comparison between the calculated and measured temperatures of the LBE indicates that the simulation underestimates the experiment at most radial and axial positions. Finally the uncertainties in measurement and the deficiency in turbulence models resulting in such a disagreement were discussed, which will be directive and beneficial to future work in the field.

Objective: This paper investigates the efficacy of practical participation as a vehicle for conveying knowledge of the subject of dental occlusion.

Methods: A fourth-year class of students was divided into two groups: one had benefited from a series of practicals focusing on the re-organized approach to occlusion, and the other had attended routine clinical sessions in conservative dentistry. Both had attended the same course of four lectures. Their knowledge was tested by means of a short answer question paper.

Results: The group attending the focused practicals out-performed the control group at the 0.01 level of significance.

Conclusion: Practical participation would appear to enhance students' understanding of the subject of dental occlusion.

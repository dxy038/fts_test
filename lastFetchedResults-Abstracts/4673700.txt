This paper investigates an efficient scheduling for sending dynamic data over lossless broadcast channels. A server transmits dynamic data periodically to a number of passive clients and thus the updated discrete packets are sent into a separate packet. The objective of this paper is to design universal schedules that minimize the time that passes between a client´s request and the broadcast of a new item, independently of the client´s behavior. From the results the optimal scheduling of high transmission rate for discrete broadcast data is obtained by considering adaptive clients.

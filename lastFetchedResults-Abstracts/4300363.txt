The objective of traffic engineering is to optimize network resource utilization. Although several works have been published about minimizing network resource utilization, few works have focused on LSR (label switched router) label space. This paper proposes an algorithm that takes advantage of the MPLS label stack features in order to reduce the number of labels used in LSPs. Some tunnelling methods and their MPLS implementation drawbacks are also discussed. The described algorithm sets up NHLFE (next hop label forwarding entry) tables in each LSR, creating asymmetric tunnels when possible. Experimental results show that the described algorithm achieves a great reduction factor in the label space. The presented works apply for both types of connections: P2MP (point-to-multipoint) and P2P (point-to-point).

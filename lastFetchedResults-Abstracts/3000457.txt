Polynomial-time soft decoding for Reed-Solomon codes is investigated in the context of interpolation based decoding algorithms. Two criteria for soft decoding are studied. The first criterion is motivated by the probability of decoding failure while the second criterion is chosen to maximize the error correction capability of the code for a given additive cost function. Solutions that optimize the respective objective function are given to both problems.

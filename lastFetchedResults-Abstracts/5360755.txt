This paper describes a new method to realize an interactive manipulation of virtual liquid using a virtual case. The proposed model represents the liquid in the free fall condition as particles, while it does that in the stay condition as volume. The main purpose of this model is the realization of virtual liquid manipulation, while the generation of high quality computer graphics images or simulating the exact behavior of the liquid are not the main objective. Our system with this proposed model makes it possible to catch the liquid using the virtual case, to hold the liquid in it, then to flow away the liquid with tilting it. Also, the system realizes the manipulation to skim the liquid from another liquid case

The core objective of current study is to investigate the costs of financial distress of ongoing manufacturing sector of Pakistan. A panel of 146 manufacturing firms Pakistan are
selected for this study for the period of 2001-2011. Two most applicable panel data
techniques (fixed effects and random effects models) are utilized to investigate the costs of
financial distress and Hausmanâ€™s specification test recommended that fixed effects model
is most appropriated model in this study. The results of fixed effects model suggest that
financial distress of on-going firms of Pakistan has significant direct impact on
opportunity losses in case of Pakistan after control average collection period, total assets
growth, fixed to total assets ratio, tangibility of assets and sector distressed. The
upcoming studies must explore direct costs of financial distress and bankruptcy in case of
manufacturing as well as service sector of Pakistan.

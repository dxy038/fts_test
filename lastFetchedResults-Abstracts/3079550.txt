In this article, we present novel methods of medical examinations that use state of the art utilities, namely motion capturing as a basis to replace traditional methods. The 3D representation of the patient\´s activity, analyzed through motion capture process, provides the clinician a more objective view of the patient\´s movements and problem areas. It provides the clinician or therapist a new method to manage the entire spectrum of the rehabilitation process from diagnosis through discharge. 3D analysis of the patient\´s motions provides the therapist detailed and quantified data relative to the patient\´s injury or disability. The infinite 3D views allow visualization of motion from every angle that 2D video reproduction simply cannot provide. The proposed system can measure the rehabilitation movements that are required to obtain the desired "clinical outcome", and track the progress towards these individualized goals. Based on preliminary experiments the design metrics of measuring configuration for these motion patterns has been prepared. The implementation phase of a new diagnostic tool is just going on. In close cooperation with medical specialists we determined the exercises and motion patterns applicable during examination and rehabilitation of locomotion diseases. We made comparative tests regarding the lumbar region

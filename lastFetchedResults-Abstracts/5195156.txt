The paper focuses on the effect of small-scale fading on the throughput of communication systems that operate with different bandwidth within an indoor environment. The small-scale fading of the indoor radio channel has been measured within an office environment. From these measurements, a single intuitive scalar is derived, which characterizes the small-scale fading encountered by a certain signal. This signal has been characterized by its lower frequency and bandwidth. This measure allows for an objective, quantitative analysis of the relation between small-scale fading and signal bandwidth. The paper is complemented by a link-budget analysis to illuminate the relationship between signal bandwidth, fading margin and throughput. The bandwidth has been varied step-wise from 10 MHz to 5 GHz.

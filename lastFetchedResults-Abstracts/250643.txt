A new methodology is proposed for the topology optimization of fluid in Stokes flow. The binary
design variable and no-slip condition along the solid–fluid interface are regularized to allow for the
use of continuous mathematical programming techniques. The regularization is achieved by treating
the solid phase of the topology as a porous medium with flow governed by Darcy’s law. Fluid flow
throughout the design domain is then expressed as a single system of equations created by combining
and scaling the Stokes and Darcy equations. The mixed formulation of the new Darcy–Stokes system
is solved numerically using existing stabilized finite element methods for the individual flow problems.
Convergence to the no-slip condition is demonstrated by assigning a low permeability to solid phase
and results suggest that auxiliary boundary conditions along the solid–fluid interface are not needed.
The optimization objective considered is to minimize dissipated power and the technique is used
to solve examples previously examined in literature. The advantages of the Darcy–Stokes approach
include that it uses existing stabilization techniques to solve the finite element problem, it produces
0–1 (void–solid) topologies (i.e. there are no regions of artificial material), and that it can potentially
be used to optimize the layout of a microscopically porous material

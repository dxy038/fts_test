OBJECTIVE: We investigated the usefulness of cervicovaginal interleukin-1β and interleukin-8 levels during pregnancy as markers of preterm and term parturition.
STUDY DESIGN: Cervicovaginal fluids were obtained from 119 pregnant women at 24 to 41 weeks’ gestation. Cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay.
RESULTS: Interleukin-1β and interleukin-8 concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids obtained from women not in labor increased exponentially as gestational age increased. Interleukin-1β and interleukin-8 concentrations were significantly correlated. These cytokine concentrations were significantly higher in patients in preterm labor than in patients at preterm not in labor and were significantly higher in women at term in labor than in women at term not in labor. These cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the degree of cervical dilation and tocolytic index.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that cervicovaginal interleukin-1β and interleukin-8 contribute to term and preterm parturition. Measurement of cervicovaginal concentrations of these cytokines may be clinically useful in patients with threatened premature delivery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:644-9.)

Purpose The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of etiologic factors, symptoms, and vocal acoustic alterations related to vocal hyperfunction in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method In 23 children with ADHD and 28 control children, vocal acoustic exploration was performed to analyze the F0, jitter %, and voice turbulence index for the sustained vowels /a/ and /i/ and the average tone and intensity and tonal modulation in tests of continuous speech. The children's parents completed a specific questionnaire aimed at detecting etiologic factors and vocal symptoms. Results Children with ADHD displayed more vocal symptoms (hoarseness, neck strain, and shortness of breath while talking) and more etiologic factors (they shouted more, spoke louder and faster, and became angry more easily) than did children in the Control group. Likewise, children in the ADHD group exhibited a greater % jitter and a lower average intensity in the continuous speech tests. Conclusions These results indicate that children with ADHD display greater vocal hyperfunction as compared with children in the Control group and suggest a higher risk of developing dysphonia. The results of this study could be useful for designing vocal programs focusing on vocal education and hygiene to prevent and decrease vocal risks and on promoting vocal health in children with ADHD.

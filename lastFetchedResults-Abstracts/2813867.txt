Billion transactions of business operations lead to huge energy consumption inside data centres. Over sizing design data centre is double energy requirements in term of electrical draw-out and heat rejection. Moreover, over design data centre causes of surplus capital expenditure (CapEx) and lifetime operating expenditure (OpEx). Legacy data centres designed before the 2<sup>nd</sup> millenniums are over design capacity more than 50 percent of actual loaded. How to redesign and use more energy efficiency for data centre is a research problem. The research objective is created a model transformation approach from legacy data centre to mobile and modular data centre (M<sup>2</sup>DC). The research proposed a multivariate optimization for the right sizing of data centre as business needs by using data centre project case studies. The qualitative research method is investigation and assessment through 21 sample data centres and in-depth interviews with IT managers (32) and data centre consultants (8). The fact findings have shown the standardized modular of M<sup>2</sup>DC force requirements to fit in the building boxes and expansion as needs. The simulation model is demonstrated the power usage effectiveness (PUE) improved more than 30 percent.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the levels of very-low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein receptor messenger ribonucleic acid expression in placentas obtained from normal pregnant women at various gestational stages and from patients with preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: The relative level of expression of very-low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein receptor messenger ribonucleic acid in each sample was determined by Northern blot analysis as a ratio of the intensity to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase messenger ribonucleic acid. RESULTS: The expression of very-low-density lipoprotein receptor messenger ribonucleic acid increased significantly (p< 0.05) from both the first (n = 9) and second (n = 8) trimesters to the third (n = 11) trimester. Similarly, the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor messenger ribonucleic acid increased significantly (p< 0.05) from the first to the third trimester. The expression of both very-low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein receptor messenger ribonucleic acids in third-trimester placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies (n = 13) was significantly lower than that in normal pregnancies in the third trimester. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the expression of very-low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein receptor messenger ribonucleic acids in the human placenta, both of which increase at late gestational stages, and the decreased expression in cases of preeclampsia. Abnormal fetomaternal lipid metabolism resulting from low expression of these receptors in the placenta may be involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1551-6.)

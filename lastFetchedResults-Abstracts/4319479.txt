State-of-the-art components and subsystems for the space station Freedom are examined in terms of performance, size, and topology. One objective is to inform the users of Freedom about what is available in power supplies and power control devices. The other objective is to stimulate interest in the component industry so that more focused product development can be started. Based on results of this study, it is estimated that, with some redesign, modifications, and space qualification, many of these components may be applied to space station Freedom needs.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

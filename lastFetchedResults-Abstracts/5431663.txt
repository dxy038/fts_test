The present paper compares the demographic developments which have characterized the coastal zone in conterminous United States. The population changes in the coastal counties are analyzed for the two census periods 1950-1960 and 1960-1970, and population estimates made in 1974. The coastal counties are grouped into three classes: coastal urban, non coastal urban, which are part of coastal SMSAs and coastal rural. Three objectives are sought. The first describes the demographic changes which have taken place nationally during the past 24 years. The second objective analyzes the demographic differences in the three types of settlements discussed above. The final objective compares regional, urban/exurban differences in the demography within the coastal zone. The findings of these are discussed in light of the urban/ suburban migration and competing uses for the nationÂ´s shoreline.

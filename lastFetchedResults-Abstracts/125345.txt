Background and Objective: Imported mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MIA) as a root -end filling material has many applications in root repairing and bone healing including direct pulp capping, repair of root and furcation perforation, and apexification. By introducing a similar material, made in Iran, namely Root MTA, primary tests such as cytotoxicity test should be performed. The purpose of this study was to compare the 24h and 48h cytotoxicity effect of Root MTA on peripheral blood mononuclear cells using MTT Assay.
Materials and Methods: In this study, after blood sampling, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated on a gradient of ficole hypac. After several washing phases. cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FCS in 96 well U shape microtiterplates in a 5% Coe incubator. Serial dilution of MTA and Root MTA were added to the wells. Cell cytotoxicity was determined, 24 and 48 hours after treatment by MTT Assay.
Results: Cytotoxicity of Root MTA was less than that of MTA (ProRoot ). At 24 hours after culture there was significant difference between cell viability affected by Root MTA and MTA in the three different dilutions 20 Landa , 50 and 100 Landa  (p<0.05).
At 48 hours, there was also a significant difference between cell viability after using Root MTA and MTA in two dilutions; 50 Landa . 100 Landa (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Root MTA could be considered as a proper alternative for MTA. For ther studies such as clinical trials should also be performed.

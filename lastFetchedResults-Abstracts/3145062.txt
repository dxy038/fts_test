The water resources optimization disposition of multi-water-source, the multi-consumer is the large-scale system question of multi-objective and multi-decision-making, the reasonable allocation of water resources is one of the effective regulative measures for implementing sustainable utilization of water resources. Using the inherent parallelism mechanism of genetic algorithms and global optimization characteristics, the optimal allocation of water resource problem was modeled as the problem of biological evolution, survival of the fittest was carried out by judging the degree of optimization of each generation of individuals, thus produces the new generation, iterating so repeatedly to complete the optimal allocation of water resources. The case analysis shows that this algorithm which was applied to optimize the allocation of water resources was a success.

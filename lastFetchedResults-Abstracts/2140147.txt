Location, is an effective element on human life and is also a motivating element on his feelings in relation to his past and present. Location is not an end in poetry; otherwise, it would become political geography. Therefore, location is an instrument and its realization in poetry rather than being objective is often psychological and artistic and full of various meaningful contents. Different values and thoughts give location meaningful codes from varying aspects and compatable with temporal fluctuations. One of the frequent locations in al- monasera's poetry is Canaan. This study aims at surveying various connotations such a term has taken during the time in the poetry language of Monasera. Therefore, studying meaning changes and conceptual distinctions in al-monasera's poems necessitates this survey. The research method involves mentioning Canaanite and epistemological analysis of this location term with its different connotations. First, we present the positions of authorities in this regard and later we analyze those positions. In al-monasera's poetry, Canaan becomes the same ancient land which ancient Jews attacked it; moreover, the poet introduces his identity through Canaan. In some cases, Canaan is a myth with the help of it, the poet deepens his poetic discourse and also its content. In some other case, he illustrates Palestine with its refugeeâ€™s sufferings. Thus, the meaning mobility continues and a distinct meaning amplifies through this term, Canaan. By the way, the poet looks for his identity through a mixture of the past and present and finally invites the reader to do the paleontology of this land.

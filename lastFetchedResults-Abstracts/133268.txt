Lung tumors are one of the most common malignancies in males and females. Because definite treatment of many of the tumors (such as small cell carcinoma or lymphoma) is chemotherapy or radiotherapy but not operation, a histological diagnosis of the tumor is very important before definite operation.
Percutaneous needle biopsy is a safe, easy, sensitive and inexpensive procedure for diagnosis of thoracic tumors. This prospective and pilot study was performed to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of percutaneous needle biopsy and compare the results with those obtained from open biopsy. The sample consisted of 61 patients suspicious to thoracic tumor admitted to Alzahra hospital, Isfahan, during 1997 to 1999.
Based on the open biopsy 51 out of 61 patients had lung cancer and 10 patients had benign disorders such as anthracosis, tuberculosis, pulmonary infarction , etc. The results of Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) were as followings: sensitivity: 72%, specificity: 100%, accuracy: 57%, positive predictive value: 100% and negative predictive value: 28%.
Therefore FNA is a safe ,easy, relatively sensitive and exactly specific procedure for diagnosis of thoracic tumors. By this procedure we can avoid many unnecessary thorachotomies or invasive and expensive procedures and save money and hospital beds.

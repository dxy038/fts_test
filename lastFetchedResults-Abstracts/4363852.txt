We describe a graph-based global registration method for creating 2D mosaic images. When multi-frames overlap in space, global registration is necessary to minimize the accumulated registration errors. We use a graph to represent the temporal and spatial connectivity and show that global registration can be obtained through the search for an optimal path in the constructed graph. The definition of an adequate objective function characterizing the global registration provides a direct manipulation of the graph. The framework presented here allows the automatic construction of the graph, and the construction of a consistent mosaic from a collection of frames using projective transformations

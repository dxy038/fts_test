We formulate a multi-period portfolio choice problem in which the investor is uncertain about parameters of the model, can learn these parameters over time from observing asset returns, but is also concerned about robustness. To address these concerns, we introduce an objective function which can be regarded as a Bayesian version of relative regret. The optimal portfolio is characterized and shown to involve a &#8220;tilted&#8221; posterior, where the tilting is defined in terms of a family of stochastic benchmarks. We have found this model to perform at least as well as a benchmark given the true market parameters, while outperforming it when the market assets have the same trend.

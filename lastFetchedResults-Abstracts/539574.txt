Fruit production demands several phytosanitary treatments per year. The efficiency of these treatments is affected by product loss because of drift, a situation that is aggravated by frequent high winds and the presence of a substantial rural population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution and to quantify product losses in fruit orchard applications. Fluorescent tracers with air-blast sprayers were applied, using air-induction hollow cone nozzles, compared to conventional hollow cone nozzles. To evaluate drift, pipes cleaner were placed on columns behind the adjacent row to the treated one, and for the losses under the tree, Petri dishes were located below the treated row; for the distribution in the tree, leaves were collected from the canopy. The deposits were quantified with a fluorimeter, and the surface of the leaves with an area optical meter. Both nozzles produced equal quantity of deposits in the canopy with a minor quantity in the top part. The low drift sprinklers obtained 75% less drift than the standard nozzles; however, the losses under the tree were 50% higher. To conclude, the utilization of low drift nozzles in fruit orchards is an alternative to mitigate pollution of the environment.

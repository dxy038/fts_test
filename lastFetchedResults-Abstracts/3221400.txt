Effective team coordination is crucial for successful global software projects. Although considerable research effort has been made in this area, no agreement has been reached on the influence of dispersion on team coordination and performance. The objective of this paper is to summarize the evidence on the relationship among context dispersion, team coordination and performance in global software projects. We have performed a Systematic literature review (SLR) to collect relevant studies and a thematic analysis to synthesize the extracted data. We found 28 primary studies reporting the impact of five dispersion dimensions on team performance. Previously, only two primary studies considered and distinguished all of these dispersion dimensions in studying dispersed team performance. The dispersion dimensions affect team outcomes indirectly through influencing organic and mechanistic coordination processes. Empirical evidence show that geographical dispersion impacts negatively and temporal dispersion has a mixed effect on team performance. While studies with teams working across different time zones shows a tendency that the team performance is pessimistically perceived, studies that use direct measure on task performance shows a positive association to temporal dispersion. The paper provides implications for future research and practitioners in establishing effective distributed team coordination.

A detailed investigation on NOx emission control from a stationary bio-diesel engine is carried out using combined engine valve timing control and pulse discharge plasma based exhaust control techniques. The objective of the study is to explore the effect of the valve timing (injection pressure, injection duration and injection quantity) on the NOX formation for various blends of Biodiesel samples and subsequently to treat the exhaust by the pulse discharge plasma based techniques. A comparative study of pre and post combustion technique on NOx removal will be discussed. Further, the experiments are carried out at different engine loading and exhaust flow rate. The effectiveness of the techniques with regard to NOx control and byproduct reduction is discussed.

Objective: To describe a profile of teenage sexual health problems with an aim to improve the age specific services.Methodology: A retrospective record analysis of young people (<19 years old) attending a community GU medicine clinic in UK was performed (April 2007 to March 2008). Data was collected on age, gender, contraception use, number of teenage pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections in the past / current, and regular screening for STIs & HIV. Results: A total of 3328 patients attended our GU medicine clinic over 12 months. Of these, 411 (12.3%) were < 19 years old. Their mean age, mean sexual debut age and average number of sexual partners were 17.6 years, 14.8 years and 5.8 respectively. Ninety percent of males and 29% females had received oral sex. Condom usage was 21% in males and 28% in females. Only 57% of females used contraception, 13% of teenagers having been pregnant. Uptake of STI &/or HIV testing were 92.9% in males and 100% in females. STI rates were higher in females as compared to males (22.5% versus 17.8%, p = 0.03). Chlamydia and genital warts were statistically higher in females (8.1% and 12.3 %) than males (5.1% and 5.1%; p = 0.046 and 0.023). Fraser competency was documented in only 77%> cases. Conclusion: Teenagers form a significant proportion of our GUM attendees with increase risk of pregnancy and STIs/ HIV, hence a dedicated high quality integrated sexual health clinic may help to reduce morbidity associated with STIs in young people.

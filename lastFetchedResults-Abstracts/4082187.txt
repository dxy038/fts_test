The objective of the reported experiments is to gain a basic understanding of possible increase and control of solid propellant burning rates through the addition of electrical energy. The tests were performed in a closed vessel allowing for the addition of electrical energy during the burning phase of the propellant. The vessel is designed for testing the idea of leading the current through the propellantÂ´s dense, ionized, and possibly conducting reaction zone. Electrical energy is thus released as heat in the immediate vicinity of the unburnt propellant surface where the heat feedback is supposed to be most efficient. A 300 kJ pulsed power supply provides the electrical energy. Pressure, current and voltage are measured. This is the first report on results from the initial series of tests. Primary results presented are pressure/time curves and discharged energy. Pressure measurements are compared to simulations based on the measured discharged energy

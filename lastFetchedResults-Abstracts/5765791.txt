The objective of this paper is to search for lead users and to evaluate the efficacy of the toolkits used for innovation facilitators in the Web 2.0 context. After interviews and surveys conducted at a popular Taiwan-based community Website, we found that individuals with large numbers of hits have a higher likelihood of being lead users because they are highly active users of the Websitepsilas newly released functions, and thus obtain more expected benefits than others. In addition, they are more likely to use add-on Web toolkits, such as the trial-and-error learning tools, the module libraries, and the solutions space, to customize their personal uses, to response problems posted by others, and to share what they invent on their own. Therefore, they garner appreciation from others and obtain higher ranks in the top 100 hit parade in return. This research offers insights useful to Web service providers who seek to efficiently target lead users and construct a user generated-innovation environment using effective Web toolkits.

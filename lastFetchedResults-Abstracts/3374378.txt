The educational objective of the gaduate optics program at the Air Force Institute of Technology is to prepare students who can bridge the gap between the traditional physicist and electrical engineer. This goal is realized through two programs. One is in engineering physics, which concentrates on optical devices; the other is in electrical engneering, which concentrates on electrooptic system design. Each program is based on a common core, supplemented by specialty course sequences, and each has a thesis requirement.

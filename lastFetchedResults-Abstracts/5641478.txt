Rescheduling techniques have been proposed in the areas such as job shop problem in recent years by researchers. But it has not been widely explored in software project environment under uncertainty. This paper proposes a software project scheduling/rescheduling framework based on genetic algorithm. Our previous formulates software project scheduling and rescheduling situation as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed method will help a manager to do scheduling with the option he made to put the project back on track. Case studies by simulation data show the effectiveness of the rescheduling method in supporting decision making in a dynamic environment. This paper reports comprehensive experiments to determine the parameters of stability and efficiency. Empirical study is directed to balance the effect of stability and efficiency in different situations. Evaluations of possible impact of the available control options are also done in the model to support control decision making in software process.

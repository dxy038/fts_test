This paper is a progress report on the Ad Hoc Study on Electronic Parts and Tubes Specification Management for Reliability Jointly sponsored by the Offices of the Assistant Secretaries of Defense (Research and Engineering)* and (Supply and Logistics). The basic objective of this study is to analyzer the recommendations established by the Advisory Group on Reliability of Electronic Equipment (AGREE) Task Group 5 in order to advise the, Assistant Secretaries of Defense (Research and Engineering)* end (Supply and Logistics) regaining efficient implementation methods and procedures. This study will cover the following areas relative to electronic parts and tubes: (a) Specification of reliability of parts and tubes in terms of failure rate as a function of time and the test procedures and plans for determining compliance with the level specified; (b) Survey of methods used in preparation and coordination of parts and tubes specifications; (c) Review of the Qualification Approval Testing requirements and procedures; (d) Adequacy of test requirements with respect to reliability requirements and quality control procedures; (3) Program for exchange of technical charaoteristics and test data on parts and tubes; (f) Methodology for development and dissemination of design guide or parts application data including failure rate curves or data as a function of circuit application severity level and enviroment.

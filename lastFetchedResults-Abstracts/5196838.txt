In this paper, we propose a novel two-pass reconstruction algorithm for the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) frames in distributed video coding (DVC), in which the traditional reconstructed WZ frame is utilized to perform motion estimation to obtain a more accurate motion field. During the motion estimation, the block, as well as its neighboring pixels are concerned. An overlapped block motion compensation is subsequently performed with the help of the motion field, consequently, an enhanced prediction for the WZ frame can be obtained, based on which an improved reconstruction can be achieved. Simulation results show that both the objective and subjective quality of WZ frames can be improved significantly.

Background: Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of
primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Its etiopathogenesis, despite
numerous studies, remains unclear. Environmental, viral, and
genetic factors have been proposed as its potential etiologic
factors. In recent years, viral agents of herpes virus family such
as human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) have been noticed.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association
between the presence of HHV-8 and mycosis fungoides.
Methods: This case-control study was done on skin biopsies
of 42 mycosis fungoides cases referred to the Department of
Pathology, Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran from 2004 to
2012, and 42 age and sex matched samples of melanocytic nevi.
PCR was performed to detect HHV-8 in biopsy samples of the
patients and the control group. Statistical analysis was done
using the IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) 20.
Results: Of 42 patients with MF, 25 were male and 17 were female
with a male to female ratio of 1.4. The mean age of the patients
was 51.2 years. Most of the patients were in the age group over
60 years. Clinical lesions of the majority of the patients were
papules and plaques. HHV-8 DNA was not found in any of the
mycosis fungoides samples using the PCR method.
Conclusion: Based on our study results, HHV-8 does not play
an important role in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides.

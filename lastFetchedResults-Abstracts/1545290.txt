We formulate control problems of mechanical systems as constraint following. The system contains uncertainty which is (possibly fast) time-varying. It is unknown but bounded. The bound is, however, unknown. The objective is to design control which renders approximate constraint following. Adaptive laws are constructed. The controls are then based on the adaptive parameters. We are able to demonstrate guaranteed system performance, regardless of the uncertainty.

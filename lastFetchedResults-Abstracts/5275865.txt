On the basis of analyzing the patent race game model of product innovation and process innovation, the Cournot-Bertrand game model of product innovation and process innovation, the backward induction game model of product innovation and process innovation, and the differential game model of product innovation and process innovation, this paper compares these models from the viewpoint of application scope of game model, assumed condition of game model, and players of game model, extends these game models further, and constructs the synergy development game model of product innovation and process innovation under the condition of cooperative game. The objective of this paper is to provide useful reference for interrelated study of the synergy development of product innovation and process innovation and enterprisers.

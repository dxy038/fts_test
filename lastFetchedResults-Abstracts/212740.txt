The optimal locations for a given number offluid viscous dampers (FVDs) in a 3-D 10-storey model shear building, with or without eccentricities are investigated. A general approach for finding optimal placement of supplemental dampers in structural systems with arbitrary degree ofcomplexity in configuration has been proposed To seek the optimal location of dampers, a linear combination of maximum inter-storey drift and maximum base shear of the damped structure normalised by their respective undamped counterparts has been taken as the objective function. The effect of soil-structure interaction on maximum response reduction and also on the optimal placement ofdampers is studiedfor various degrees ofsoil compliance.
It isfound that the supplemental dampers are more effective in reducing
the seismic response of a symmetric building and its effectiveness
reduces as either plan irregularity, or soil compliance increases.

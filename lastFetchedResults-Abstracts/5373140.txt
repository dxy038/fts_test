At present, to assess the reliability of sophisticated system is hard or infeasible because of the complexities of the equipment configuration and its faults. This paper presents a method which overcomes the drawbacks of traditional fault tree analysis (FTA). Based on the thorough analysis of typical failure modes and influences of Non-Service air braking system in railway vehicle, the fault-tree of Non-Service air braking system is set up using fault tree analysis techniques and the assessment method for the reliability of Non-Service air braking system, combined with the index of the importance and the weight integration method based on the multi-objective decision making theory and subjective and objective integrated weights is put forward. The assessment examples show that the method can deduct the failure modes of Non-Service air braking system clearly, find out the weaknesses in time during the operation, reflect the influence degree of each fault modes. In addition, the calculating program is short and brief so that it is easy to develop and maintain. Therefore, the reliability assessment model can better support the overall analysis of Non-Service air braking system in the operation and our results revealed the method are suitable for the application in the research of the reliability evaluation.

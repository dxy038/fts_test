The method of reducing two-tones intermodulation when the objective is to linearize an amplifier is no longer valid in the context of multicarrier inputs. The theory of Gaussian distributed random processes through nonlinear operators is much more appropriated to describe the output. Here a method is described to obtain the optimum parameters of an active feedback structure in order to reduce the overall signal to intermodulation ratio. Also a brief discussion of the predistortion architecture is presented. In many other cases the overall S/I ratio is not as important as the spectral distribution of the distortion. This problem is also discussed in order to allow optimization of the S/I in a specific range of frequencies

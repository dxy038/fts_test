The overall objective of this work is modeling of X-Cell and the construction of robust controllers to handle parameter uncertainties and disturbances. The model was developed by combining initial estimation model derived by mathematical formulation i.e. first principle modeling and system identification modeling. This combination has proven to increase the accuracy of dynamic model. Moreover, the principle in construction of a robust controller for X-Cell was developed. This paper covers the modeling method and designing controller in hover flight regime.

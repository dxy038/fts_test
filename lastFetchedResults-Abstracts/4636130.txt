The Research Division of the Burroughs Adding Machine Company has built a large-scale digital computer which is unique in that the internal mechanization of computational steps can be changed merely by reconnection of plug-in cables. Construction from already designed general-purpose building blocks, known as pulse control units, resulted in an unusually short time (9 months) between the decision to design the computer and its realization. As implied by its name, the Laboratory Computer is a laboratory device whose most important function is to assist in a long-range development program of wide scope by providing a versatile proving ground for the trial and evaluation of new ideas and components. It is a useful source of engineering performance data, and has proved valuable as a means for training personnel. Although problem solution has been regarded as a subsidiary objective, useful results have been obtained from the machine. Initially its computational ability was modest, but recent enhancements have substantially increased its potential. These alterations have not yet been exploited to any great degree. Basic limitations on its performance as a computer are the rotational speed of the magnetic drum, the only intern a memory medium, and the speed of standard teletype terminal facilities. If further improved storage and terminal equipment becomes available it can readily be added to the system. after first being equipped with necessary transducer circuitry. Plans for the future continue to subjugate problem solution to use of the machille as a development tool.

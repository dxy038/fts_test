The design process is reduced to designing the filter bank to satisfy a set of conditions and it is known that the reconstructed signal always possesses some alias and distortion. It is the present objective to find the necessary and sufficient conditions on the filters so that the resulting QMF (quadrature mirror filter) bank cancels most alias components. Having found these conditions, the author suggests an algorithm to design the PAC (partial alias cancellation) QMF bank. Examples are given to demonstrate the theory

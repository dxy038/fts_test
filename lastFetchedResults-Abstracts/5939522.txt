The ability of CGMP to bind cholera and Escherichia coli enterotoxins, inhibit bacterial and viral adhesion, suppress gastric secretions, promote bifidobacterial growth and modulate immune system responses are the most promising applications. Objective To study the effects of casein glycomacropeptide on immune function in mice. Method 70 BALB/c mices were divided into seven groups. The blank control group was administered only normal fodder. The whey control group was administered cheese whey. The experimental group groups were administered the equal volume of CGMP which were of different consistencies. Whereafter, the index of immune organs (thymus and spleen), functions of macrophage, lymphocyte proliferation response and the activity of NK cell were determined in vivo. Results Casein glycomacropeptide could improve the growth of spleen, promote functions of macrophage and the proliferation of B lymphocyte. Conclusion The casein glycomacropeptide can remarkably enhance immune function in mice such as cellular immunity and non-specific immunity. This experiment demonstrated that casein glycomacropeptide has had the immune function in BALB/c mice.

This article introduces a new contrast enhancement algorithm of tone-preserving entropy maximization. Its design objective is to present the maximal amount of information content in the enhanced image, or being optimal in an information theoretical sense, while preventing the loss of tone continuity. The resulting optimization problem can be graph-theoretically modeled as the construction of K-edge maximum-weight path, and it can be solved efficiently by dynamic programming. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is made more effective by being combined with a preprocess of image restoration that aims to correct quantization errors caused by the analog-to-digital conversion of image signals. Empirical evidences are provided to demonstrate the superior visual quality obtained by the new image enhancement algorithm.

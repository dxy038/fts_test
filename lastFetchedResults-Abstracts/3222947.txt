The dual active bridge topology is attractive in bidirectional DC-DC applications due to its simplicity and soft switching capability. However, its high circulating energy will cause high conduction loss. This paper proposed two new dual active bridge topologies in order to minimize the circulating energy with minimal auxiliary components. These topologies can also achieve ZVS in all load range as well as simple control scheme. These topologies will be attractive in high power high density applications like battery charger, hybrid vehicle, electric vehicle and solar power system. The detailed analysis and comparison between the proposed topologies and traditional DAB converters are also presented in the paper. The experimental and simulation results verified the theoretical analysis well.

The paper presents an objective to build generic analog devices which can not only be customized to desire specification by the user in a field programmable manner but can also produce fine trimming ability in the designs using on-chip, non-volatile, real time/indirectly programmable floating-gate transistors. The basic analog building blocks based on above dimension are field programmable op-amp employing threshold voltage of transistor (V<sub>T</sub>) as the design parameter and multi-output voltage reference in which reference voltages depend on threshold voltage difference between transistors. Trimming ability is introduced in basic analog building blocks by using programmable active resistor, for example programmable active inductor, whose inductive output impedance can be precisely tuned, programmable square-wave generator whose clock can be precisely tuned in wide range and programmable wide-swing current mirror. All these designs are being simulated using BSIM3 level 49 MOSFET models on 0.35&#956;m T-Spice CMOS process. Such new dimension in design of analog devices can generate accurate analog design prototypability and device stability.

Objective
t the hypothesis that there is a prospective association between constitutional hypotension and new-onset fatigue in a large, representative sample.
s
s prospective study using a large population-based cohort dataset, the Health and Lifestyle Survey, a representative sample of the population residing in private dwellings in Great Britain in 1984 (n=9003, ages 18–97 years) had their blood pressure measured and were asked about fatigue. Participants reporting fatigue at baseline were excluded. The outcome was fatigue state in 1991.
s
ociation was shown, unadjusted or adjusted for likely confounders, in the healthy young population [systolic BP: adj. OR (95% CIs)=1.25 (0.90–1.74); diastolic BP: 1.18 (0.84–1.65)] or the whole population [systolic BP: 0.98 (0.77–1.26); diastolic BP: 1.01 (0.79–1.26)].
sion
s British population-based study, hypotension was not a risk factor for incident idiopathic fatigue.

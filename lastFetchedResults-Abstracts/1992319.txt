Based on the results achieved using experimental data and related mechanical analysis, the magnitude of  loads that a bicyclist can apply on the pedal at his extreme power, is a function of angular coordinates of pedals. Therefore, the resultant of torques which these loads apply at the axle of pedals has an oscillation nature. To avoid transferring the oscillations produced by torques to the bicycleâ€™s propellant wheel which causes fluctuations in the bicycle acceleration, a special power transfer system should be used. Designing of such mechanisms is the objective of this project. Foresaid design is a optimized instance of ordinary systems of mechanical energy generation using the method of pedaling, in which, for transferring the power from the pedal axle to the chain an ellipsoid chair wheel is used.
Regarding to the properties of the new chain wheel, the way that it transfers the power, can decrease the frequent oscillations of torque at pedal axle. Thus, the procedure of accelerating of bicycle which uses this system of power transfer will be almost without oscillations.

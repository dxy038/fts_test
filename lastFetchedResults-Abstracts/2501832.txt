Background and Objective: Use of extremely low frequency magnetic field) ELF-MF (has been reported in increasing blood sugar, cholesterol, triglyceride and reduction of withdrawal syndrome signs of morphine. Since pain is one of the main considerations and usually analgesic drugs are not very useful and have side effects, therefore, the present project was carried out using formalin test to evaluate the effect of ELF-MF.

Materials and Methods: A randomized experimental study was done on test and control groups of mice. 32 male BALB/c mice (mean of weight = 30 g) were divided into 4 groups (n=8). 3 groups of animals exposed to ELF-MF for one week 30 min daily with 25, 50, and 75 HZ and an intensity of 250ÂµT. Formalin 10% was injected i.p. to animals. The responses to formalin were observed for 60 min. Pain scores for the first 5 min (acute pain) and 16-60 min (chronic pain) every 15 s were recorded and compared to control group.

Results: In acute phase, the signs significantly reduced by 3 frequencies, i.e., for 25 and 50HZ (p < 0.001) and for 75 HZ (p < 0.05). In chronic pain, the signs significantly reduced for 25 and 50 HZ (p < 0.05). However 50 HZ frequency was the most effective frequency.

Conclusion: The findings showed that ELF-MF is effective in formalin induced pain and could be helpful in reduction of pain in general.

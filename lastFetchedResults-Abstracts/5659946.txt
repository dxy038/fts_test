In this paper we are given concept of our WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network performance for QoS monitoring and optimization solution for BS (Base Station) with multimedia application. In the communication sector, the optimal objective is to equate quality and cost. Due to its large coverage area, low cost of deployment and high speed data rates. WiMAX is a promising technology for providing wireless lastmile connectivity. Physical and MAC layer of this technology refer to the IEEE 802.16e standard, which defines 5 different data delivery service classes that can be used in order to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different applications, such as VoIP, videoconference, FTP, Web, etc. In this paper we have made six scenarios. Here two types of MAC layer QoS are used and they are UGS and rtPS having application of Voice over IP (VoIP) and MPEG respectively. Also the traffic priority for UGS is high as compared to rtPS. In each scenario the number of fixed nodes (Fixed Subscriber Stations) and Mobile nodes (Mobile Subscriber Stations) are different. To cover more nodes or if nodes are outside the coverage area more than one BS are required. All the simulation results based on optimized networks and area we have considered between and Bhusaval and Jalgam.

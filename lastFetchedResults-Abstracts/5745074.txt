Requirements of the battery charger circuit for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle applications are defined and a PWM boost rectifier cascaded with a bidirectional DC/DC converter has been proposed in this paper. Operation of the circuit has been analyzed and its mathematical model has been derived to investigate the design consideration of the circuit parameters. Feedback controller requirements to control the input and output current and DC bus voltage have been studied. Major points to be considered in parameter selection of the voltage and current controllers are explained in terms of the universal input operation. Finally, the mathematical model of the system is implemented in Simulink and its performance for steady-state power factor correction and response to load disturbance have been tested for a 3kW, 90-250Vrms, 50-60Hz input and 48V DC output battery charger circuit.

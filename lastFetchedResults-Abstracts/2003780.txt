The Italian hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivar “Tonda Gentile Trilobata” (TGT) is covered by protected geographical indication “Nocciola Piemonte” and is well-known as the best-suited hazelnut for the industrial transformation into roasted kernel. The hazelnut cultivar identification is primarily based on morphological characteristics, so there is the need for more objective analytical methods for high quality hazelnut authentication. This study reports the 1H NMR fingerprinting of raw and roasted hazelnut, with the aim of obtaining hazelnut classification based on their spectroscopic pattern. 1H NMR analyses were carried out on polar extracts of TGT and other cultivars: the data were analysed with multivariate statistical methods. Results showed that 1H NMR combined with chemometrics is useful to characterise the hazelnuts as a function of the cultivars, both on raw and roasted form. The classification models allowed identifying molecular markers useful to distinguish TGT from other types, among these trigonelline, amino acids and an unidentified orto-disubstituted aromatic compound.

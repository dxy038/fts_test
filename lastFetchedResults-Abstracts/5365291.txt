The paper proposes to analyze a real case study and to save power losses using an adequate reactive power correction system. The capacitors size and locations optimization conducts calculations with the objective to minimize the total cost. On this purpose we use an important data base from the local power delivery company. An algorithm is proposed for data analysis and results computation. A computation program STEP is developed following the proposed algorithm. The paper uses also the results of DINIS professional power system analysis software performing active and reactive power flow calculations for the analyzed power delivery system. The installation of a capacitor requires an investment cost. Therefore, a compromise should be made in order to determine the size and the location of a capacitor on the primary distribution feeder. The objective of simulation is to establish the locations and sizes for the proposed compensation systems and also to maximize the economic benefits

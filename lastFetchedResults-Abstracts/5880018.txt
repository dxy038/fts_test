This paper proposes a probabilistic unit commitment (UC) formulation to incorporate uncertain PV power or other intermittent energy sources using stochastic programming framework. The objective of this problem is to minimize the expected total cost during the decision time range. The proposed method is implemented to a small 9-bus test system using CPLEX and MATLAB. Several case studies are performed to explore the influence of load uncertainty and PV energy sources on power system operation.

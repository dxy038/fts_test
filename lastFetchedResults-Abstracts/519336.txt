Ostrich (Struthio camelus) breeds have been gaining increasing significance around the world. Also, ostrich farming has been dramatically increasing in Iran. In many bird species, it is very difficult to distinguish between males and females based on an analysis of their external morphology, especially in young birds. The objective of this study was to identify and develop DNA markers that can be used for sex determination in ostrich using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. DNA was isolated from blood and feather samples of male and female ostriches (20 cases). PCR reaction was performed by a set of specific W-link primers. The results showed an amplified fragment, about 648 bp for females and no amplified PCR product for male ostriches. This method is a fast, accurate and inexpensive procedure for large scale sex typing of ostriches.

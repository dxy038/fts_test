Provides insight into the design of controlled mechanical systems. Most conventional mechanical designs are based on requirements involving weights, stiffness, strength, and so forth. Which are not directly related to controlled performance. The objective of the paper is to identify mechanical (structural) properties that are critical for guaranteeing good controlled performance. In particular, we point out that the control bandwidth of a servo-tracking system achievable by a dynamic output feedback controller with reasonable amount of control effort, is closely related to the frequency range where the open-loop transfer function exhibits positive-realness. A finite frequency positive-real property is characterized in terms of linear matrix inequalities and structure design methods are proposed using the characterization

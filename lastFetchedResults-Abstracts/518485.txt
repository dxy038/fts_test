Background and objective: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important opportunity human pathogens, causing a wide variety of infections .The bacteria producing biofilm. A biofilm is a population of cells growing on a surface and enclosed in an exopolysaccharide matrix. Biofilm infections are difficult to eradicate with antimicrobial treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare of bactericidal activity of quinolone and macrolide antibiotics against biofilm and planktonic cells of isolate.

Material and methods: Study was done on 42 clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A modified micrititre plate test was used to determine the biofilm formation capacity of selscted for further study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 214 a muciod clinical strain was selected for further study .after detection MIC investigated bactericidal activity antibiotics against biofilm and planktonic cells of isolate.

Results: Biofilm cells were compelety eradication by treatment with 64 MIC ofloxacin and 16 MIC ciprofloxacin and 2560Mg/ml macrolide antibiotic were complety eradicated.

Conclusion: There was high difference in antibiotic susceptibility between planktonic and biofilm populations

A unified framework to achieve optimal network lifetime, utility and delay-robustness tradeoff, for wireless multimedia sensor networks, is proposed. Using delay-robustness gives the flexibility to achieve any desired level of delay QoS provisioning. We have employed sensitivity analysis to define an appropriate objective function for delay-robustness. This is achieved by capturing delay-robustness in the end-to-end delay constraints and penalizing its price in the objective function. For distributed realization of the proposed framework, the optimal tradeoff problem is decomposed into lifetime, utility and delay robustness subproblems. Performance evaluation results show that compromising network utility can not provide both lifetime and delay-robustness, simultaneously, for all operating points.

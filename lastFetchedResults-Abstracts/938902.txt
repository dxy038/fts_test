The complexity generated by the existence of a great number of parameters and processes affecting the generation of radon in the source, its transport in the source medium, its entry into a dwelling and its accumulation in the different rooms of a dwelling has led to the development of partial models and experimental studies that are focused on a given aspect. However, in order to model radon levels and dynamics in real houses, it is necessary to take into account all the parameters and processes affecting radon levels. This is the objective of the dynamic RAGENA model of radon generation, entry and accumulation indoors. The model has been adapted to a Mediterranean climate house under dynamic conditions, and the indoor radon and soil radon dynamics have been compared to experimental results. It has been found (i) that the model gives a soil radon dynamics similar to that obtained experimentally, (ii) a remarkable model-experiment agreement indoors and (iii) that the indoor radon dynamics is given by a permanent radon entry from building materials and a dynamic removal through ventilation, which is driven by indoorâ€“outdoor temperature differences and wind speed.

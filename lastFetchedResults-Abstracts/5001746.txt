A robust and fast method to assess the validity of a motor unit potential train (MUPT) obtained by decomposing a needle-detected EMG signal is proposed. This method determines whether a MUPT represents the firings of a single motor unit (MU) or the merged activity of more than one MU, and if is a single train it identifies whether the estimated levels of missed and false classification errors in the MUPT are acceptable. Two supervised classifiers, the Single/Merged classifier (SMC) and the Error Rate classifier (ERC), and a linear model for estimating the level of missed classification error have been developed for this objective. Experimental results using simulated data show that the accuracy of the SMC and the ERC in correctly categorizing a train is 99% and %84 respectively.

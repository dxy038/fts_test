Background: Comorbidity is prevalent among patients with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) and may influence patients’ subjective and objective domains of well-being.

Objectives: We aimed to investigate the associations between comorbidity and different measures of well-being (i.e. health related quality of life, psychological distress, sleep quality, and dyadic adjustment) among patients with IHD.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 796 outpatients with documented IHD were enrolled from an outpatient cardiology clinic in 2006. Comorbidity (Ifudu index), quality of life (SF36), psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale; HADS), sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index; PSQI), and dyadic adjustment quality (Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale; RDAS) were measured. Associations between comorbidity and different measures of well-being were determined.

Results: Significant correlations were found between comorbidity score and all measures of well-being. Comorbidity score was correlated with physical quality of life (r = -0.471, P  <  0.001), mental quality of life (r = -0.447, P  <  0.001), psychological distress (r = 0.344, P  <  0.001), sleep quality (r = 0.358, P  <  0.001), and dyadic adjustment (r = -0.201, P  <  0.001).

Conclusions: This study showed a consistent pattern of associations between somatic comorbidities and multiple aspects of well-being among patients with IHD. Findings may increase cardiologists’ interest to identify and treat somatic conditions among IHD patients.

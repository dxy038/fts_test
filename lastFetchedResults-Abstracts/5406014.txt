To improve efficiency and quality of case retrieval in case-based reasoning system, a case retrieval model based on the artificial neural network (ANN) and nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm is presented. Firstly, the indexes of cases are created in order to shrink the case-searching range, and the BP neural network is applied to memorize the product cases that are indexed. Secondly, the similar cases, which are retrieved by ANN for the first matching, are computed by NN for the second matching, while the weights of NN are given by customers. Thus, the retrieval efficiency and quality are improved through combining customerspsila subjective desire with the objective retrieval of ANN. Finally, an example of motorcycle is given to illustrate the working process of the model, which proves the effectiveness and feasibility of case retrieval model.

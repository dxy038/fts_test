There were two objectives of this paper. The first objective of this paper was to observe the brain activity of Asian athletes before the match. Second, the paper aimed to study the anxiety symptom showing on the brain via QEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalography) maps. The anxiety level for Asian athletes can be classified using the index of brain topographic map (Absolute power) relative to the normative database used for analysis. Firstly, Asian athletes have to complete revised competitive state anxiety inventory-2 (CSAI-2R) questionnaires. The Asian athletes then were recorded for their QEEG twice in 2 weeks (1 time/week) before competing in a match. In the competition, the anxiety symptom and performance of Asian athletes are observed and their feedbacks from the coach are asked. Lastly, the anxiety level is classified from results of QEEG maps, the CSAI-2R questionnaires and condition in the competition. The result of anxiety level showed that the quantity of alpha frequency band in posterior head region (parietal and occipital lobes) is less than the normal condition in term of brain topographic map. In addition, amateur Asian athletes have lower quantity of alpha frequency band than the experienced Asian athletes when the time of competition becomes nearer. Furthermore, the focal area that showed in brain connectivity (Coherence) was presented in lower interactions between position to position in the frontal lobe.

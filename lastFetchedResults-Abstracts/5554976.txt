We present an evaluation of the fault-tolerance characteristics of several important data center network topologies, including Fat-tree, DCell, HyperBCube and BCube using several metrics, including average path length, aggregated bottleneck throughput and connection failure ratio. These enable us to present an objective comparison of the network topologies under faulty conditions.

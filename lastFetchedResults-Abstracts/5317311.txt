The powered terminal in most wire communication systems needs to separate AC signals and DC supply power in its input part connected to the communication lines. Well-known separators usually utilize a combined circuit of inductors and capacitors. When the lowest frequency of the signal is low, the inductance becomes high and the size of the inductor increases. Our original communication system consists of low-power DC-DC converters. Because a converter in the powering terminal operates not only as power supply but also as transmitter, it is preferable that the electronic choke be bidirectional. A new balanced-type low-loss electronic choke having small inductors and an amplifier is proposed in this paper.

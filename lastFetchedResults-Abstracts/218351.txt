The increasing need for water in the arid areas of the world has resulted in the emergence of wastewater application for agriculture and landscape. Using treated wastewater in agricultural irrigation can provide more adequate supply ofhigh quality water for human consumption,
but their heavy metal appl ications effect must be regulated to ensure no physiological problems for both the plant and its consumer. The objective of the present research was to study the effects of treated wastewater on soil chemical properties and plant growth characteristics as well as
accumulation of heavy metals in plant tissues. This research was conducted at Qatar university greenhouse in the growing season of2007. Treated wastewater was obtained from Abu Nakhala
pond in Doha City, Qatar. The soil was a mixture ofsand and clay with ratio of(1:1). Two crop plants were used in this study; grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L).
Plants were irrigated with four different mixtures ofwastewater and sea water (1:0, 1:1,3:1, and 0:1) in addition to potable water as a control. The accumulation ofsalts and heavy metals in the soil as
well as concentration of the nutrients and heavy metal accumulation in the plant tissues were determined at the end ofthe experiment. Cr, Mn and Zn showed significant differences between soil irrigated with portable tap water and other irrigation treatments. On the other hand, AI, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd and Pb did not show significant differences among the irrigation water treatments. Sorghum soils have significantly less concentration ofCo, Cu and As compared to that ofSunflower
soils, Sorghum was found to accumulate significantly higher concentration ofMn and Zn (72.47 and 92.00 mg/L, respectively) than that ofSunflower. On the other hand, Sunflower has significantly
higher concentration of'Cr compared to that ofSorghum.

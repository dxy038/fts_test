The article includes a description of research results in the areas of neural networks and image recognition with applications in micro mechanics. The principle objective is to develop a recognition system of edges of micro components for use in measuring sizes of these micro components. In applications of this recognition system in real control systems the elapsed time is a critical point. Therefore, one of the lines of research is to implement the neural network in electronic schemes. To implement algorithms of neural networks we used the electronic schemes ALTERA.

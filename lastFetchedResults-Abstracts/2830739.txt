The objective of this paper is to investigate the output waveform distortion of high switching SiC matrix converter when commutation delay effect is taken into account. During the commutation time in matrix converter, unwanted voltage error occurs which destroys output waveform quality. Influence of commutation delay is more distinct in high switching frequency matrix converter. After presenting the relationship between the output voltage error with commutation delay and switching frequency theoretically, effect of commutation delay on output waveform distortion in low and high switching frequency is investigated experimentally. It has been relieved commutation delay value has to be minimizing as is possible to decrease distortion in output waveforms for high switching frequency matrix converter.

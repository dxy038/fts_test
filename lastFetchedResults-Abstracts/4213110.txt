An auxiliary resonant commutated snubber-assisted inverter with bidirectional active power switches and voltage clamping diodes is presented in this paper. The voltage clamping diodes protect the bidirectional active switches from spike surge voltage caused by recovery energy of the auxiliary inductors and parasitic wired inductances. Moreover, a variety of resonant snubber-assisted circuits with voltage clamping diodes are also classified and presented from a practical point of view. Finally, the performances of the proposed auxiliary resonant commutated snubber-assisted inverter with voltage clamping diodes is demonstrated and evaluated in order to prove its feasibility applying for X-ray high-voltage generator

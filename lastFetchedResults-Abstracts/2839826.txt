The security of the information stored or transmitted through a wireless sensor network against attacks is a primary objective. Key management includes many security services such as confidentiality and authentication. Under the constraints of WSN, designing a scheme of key management is a major challenge. In this paper, we improve the resilience of pool based on symmetric key pre-distribution scheme against capture nodes and secure connectivity coverage.

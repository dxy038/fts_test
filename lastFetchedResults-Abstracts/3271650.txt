This work presents an ongoing work on a new approach to perform craniometric analysis based on contactless 3D modelling of skulls. Beside the acquisition process with a 3D range sensor and initial results in the semi-automatic detection of features in the skulls, we also present some results in the development of a 3D interactive interface that eases interaction for users with little experience on digital 3D manipulation. The final objective is to provide an easy to use 3D interface to allow semi-automatic detection of features in skulls. It is our belief that this system might be the first step towards a new methodology for craniometric analysis that can solve several of the current problems such as repeatability, wide access to skull information or bone damage during measurements.

This study raised the most frequent clinical diagnoses recorded in the emergency room of the Medical Department of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. The main objective was to identify possible evidence of Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) within this institution. The method used consisted in the extraction of information contained in electronic medical records of emergency patients. It was found that more than 50% of occurrences are concentrated in only thirteen disease codes which are also related to SBS. Further studies are being conducted to evaluate whether the causes of illness are really related to SBS.

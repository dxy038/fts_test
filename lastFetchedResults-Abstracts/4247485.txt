A novel dynamic resource allocation algorithm is proposed for matching the OFDMA system in high speed mobile environment, which suffers from high inter-carrier interference and large dynamic range of mobile speed for versatile users. With the non-linear optimization, the objective function of the transmission power can be directly mapped with the variables, such as the mobile speed of users, channel state information, modulation and coding schemes etc. Compared with the hitherto resource allocation algorithms in IEEE 802.16e, the proposed scheme has even more comprehensive capability depicting the features for high speed mobile and better performance in BER and QoS guarantee, especially in case the speed is more than 300 km/h.

The objective of all simulation studies have been to provide decision support for design, planning or implementation of physical systems. The &#8220;Systems Simulation Group&#8221; at Gintic was set up to help local industry to do just that. To be effective in terms of providing timely and appropriate support based on needs, the group has come up with a framework for improving its efficiency. In this paper, we will describe the methodology and the supporting tools that have been developed or are under development within this framework

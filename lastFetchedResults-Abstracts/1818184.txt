Ameloblastomas are the most common odontogenic neoplasia in humans, and although typically considered locally invasive and benign, frequently recur subsequent to surgical resection. The Tg.AC transgenic mouse carrying the v-Ha-ras oncogene has been found to spontaneously develop ameloblastoma-like tumours (35% by 1 year of age) that are rare in the wild type FVB background strain. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterise the mRNA expression of genes in the mouse tumours that are either expressed in human ameloblastomas or essential for normal odontogenesis and to correlate the expression to the histological phenotype. Study methods: Histological, immunohistochemical and RT-PCR studies were used to evaluate clinically demonstrable odontogenic tumours occurring spontaneously in seven Tg.AC v-Ha-ras transgenic mice (homozygous, at 7 months of age or heterozygous at 11 months of age). Results: Most genes profiled were expressed in all tumour samples, however three (amelogenin, matrix metalloproteinase-20 (MMP-20) and Dlx7) displayed differential expression. In addition, only the most highly differentiated tumour stained positively for collagen. In most cases, the variable expression could be explained by reference to the histological phenotype, although differences in gene expression were apparent within the Type 2 and the mixed phenotype tumours. Conclusions: These data confirm that many of the genes thought to be important in odontogenesis and odontogenic tumour formation in humans are also expressed in these murine ameloblastoma-like tumours however genes associated with terminal differentiation of ameloblasts demonstrate differential expression between the tumour phenotypes.

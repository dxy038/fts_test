The paper examines the possibility to exploit the inductance of wound aluminum foil capacitors to yield an integrated component. Objective is the design of an integrated inductor/capacitor to filter harmonic modulations from the grid as an alternative to the conventional passive filter, consisting of capacitor and inductor as discrete components with the prospect of reducing size, material and consequently cost. The principle functioning of the integrated component resulting from the particular position of placing of the supply terminals on the aluminum foils of a capacitor is being demonstrated. An analysis of technical and geometric parameters as well as constructional aspects of wound aluminum foils leads through a calculation scheme to the design of such an integrated component indicating reasonable prospects to function as a filter in the grid absorbing harmonic modulations.

Study objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of helicopter EMS for trauma patients. Methods:  We applied a cost-effectiveness analysis from the service provider's perspective to cost and effectiveness estimates. The cost estimates comprise direct operating costs and additional survivors' hospital costs. The effectiveness estimates were calculated with the TRISS methodology from literature sources and data from a cohort of patients transported by helicopter during 1994 and 1995. Sensitivity analysis and discounting were used. Cost per life saved and discounted cost per year of life in 1995 US dollars were the main outcome measures. Results:  The reported literature survival benefit ranges from 1 to 12 additional survivors per 100 patients flown. Transport costs were $2,214 per patient, and each additional survivor's hospitalization averaged $15,883. For the base case (5 additional survivors per 100 patients flown), cost per life was $60,163 and discounted cost per year of life $2,454. Sensitivity analysis revealed that discounted cost per year of life could be as high as $9,677 or as low as $1,400 and that it was most dependent on the survival benefit. These results are comparable to a reported median discounted cost per year of life of $19,000 for other commonly used lifesaving medical interventions. Conclusion:  Assuming that helicopter air medical transport provides a substantial survival benefit for trauma patients, our findings suggest that this service is a cost-effective option for the treatment of trauma patients. The magnitude of the survival benefit is the most important factor determining cost-effectiveness.

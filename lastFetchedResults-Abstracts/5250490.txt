Under geometric algebra framework, generalized definition of instantaneous power quantity in the multiphase system without any co-ordinate transformation is possible. In the area of active power filtering, with an objective to reduce inverter capacity, the Series Hybrid Active Power Filter (SHAPF) has been taken into account increasingly. This paper proposes a novel concept of decomposing the multiphase voltage vector into different quantities that correspond to different components of the power quantity. The separated components of voltage vector are directly used to derive reference for SHAPF. The mathematical formulation of proposed control scheme with its applications to SHAPF is presented. The validity of the proposed control scheme is verified by the simulation study.

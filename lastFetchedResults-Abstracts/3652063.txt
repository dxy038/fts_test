Two control schemes, termed extended hybrid control and extended impedance control, respectively, are proposed for compliant motion control of redundant manipulators. In the two control schemes, the basic compliant motion task is accomplished while the redundancy is utilized to realize some additional constraints that optimize any user-defined objective function. Some experimental results on a three-DOF planar redundant manipulator are presented to illustrate the two proposed schemes and demonstrate their capabilities for optimizing various objective functions

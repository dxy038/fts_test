
The objective of this study is to describe the pattern of participation in leisure
activities in an older population in relation to contextual factors as well as to
mental and physical health. A cohort of 1,623 participants aged 75 or older living
in Stockholm, Sweden was asked to list all the leisure activities they were engaged
in. These were successively organised into 31 major categories and further
grouped into mental, social, physical, productive and recreational types. The
pattern of participation was examined in relation to age, gender, contextual factors
(education, social network) and health status (depressive symptoms, cognitive
impairment, dementia, somatic diseases and physical limitation). In spite of their
advanced age, the majority of the population was active, as 70 per cent had
participated in at least one activity. Reading (19%) was the most prevalent individual
activity, and mental activities (43%) the most prevalent activity type. Older
age, female gender, low education status, having a poor or limited social network,
mental disorders, and physical limitation, were all factors correlated with a decreased
engagement in ‘at least one activity ’. Contextual factors and healthrelated
factors were related to the five activity types in different ways. The pattern
of participation in leisure activities is associated with multiple factors and their
recognition is essential to the facilitation of an active lifestyle in the older population.

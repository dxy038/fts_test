The problem of estimating the difference in arrival times of signals at two separated sensors is considered. The method based on fourth-second order normalized cumulants and Least Mean Square algorithm. In this paper, we study the normalized cumulants of the two different received signals by sensors and minimize the mean square error using Least Mean Square algorithm for time-delay estimation. Creating a new objective function in adaptive process, when the filter converges, the weighted coefficient is calculated, while the estimation of the time-delay value is also obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that, with the normalized cumulants, convergence curve performance via the proposed method is good at the rate of convergence.

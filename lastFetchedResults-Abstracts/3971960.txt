This letter proposes a new method of improving the speech quality of VoIP by assigning a priority to each packet at the edge router of a DiffServ-based network. The proposed method determines the importance of a packet in the parameter domain by estimating the quality degradation caused by its loss and assigns a priority to the packet according to its importance, which ensures that important packets are more robust during transmission. The subjective and objective evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the VoIP speech quality in an environment prone to packet loss.

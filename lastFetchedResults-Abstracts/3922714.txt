The paper describes a novel, low-cost design for a powerful linear actuator. The actuator harnesses the highly unstable, normal force of magnetic attraction to produce linear motion by means of a simple mechanical integration. A simple ratchet mechanism allows bidirectional operation of the drive shaft when activated but prevents motion completely, in either direction, when not activated. A high specific force/volume ratio is obtained by use of the normal force of attraction. The operational principles are described in detail and practical static and dynamic results are presented. Simulated results include static modelling using a three-dimensional (3-D), finite-element (FE) software package

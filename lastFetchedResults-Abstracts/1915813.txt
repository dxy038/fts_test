
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the second common infection with high mortality (24-40%) in patients with tracheal intubation. One of the ways to prevent VAP is subglottic secretion drainage (SSD). This study was performed to determine the effect of subglottic secretion drainage on ventilator-associated pneumonia in ICU patients. 
METHODS: This interventional study was performed on 80 patients with ordinary tracheal tube and special tracheal tube for subglottic secretion at ICU of Hazrat Rasool Akram hospital of Tehran, Iran. They were randomly allocated to two groups (n=40). In case group, intermittent subglottic secretion drainage was performed every 1 to 2 hours during 18 hours at first three days and no intervention was done for control group. The incidence of early pneumonia in both groups was compared within the first five days of intubation.
FINDINGS: In each group, three patients were excluded from the study because of death following ventilator withdrawal. The incidence of early pneumonia with clinical pneumonia index score=?6 in case group with subglottic secretion drainage was seen in 4 patients (10.8%) and in control group with no drainage was seen in 7 patients (18.9%). Increasing rate of white blood cells (greater than 11000 ml) and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (greater than 90% or Bandemia greater than 10%) in case and control group was seen in 6 patients (16.2%) and 7 patients (18.9%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the incidence of early VAP with a special tracheal tube for subglottic secretion drainage decreased in ICU patients.

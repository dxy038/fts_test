Study objective: To test the hypothesis that ear irrigation with warmed normal saline solution is more comfortable and results in fewer side effects than irrigation with room temperature saline solution in normal volunteers. Methods:  The study was a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial in which each subject received 30 mL warmed normal saline solution in 1 ear and 30 mL room temperature saline solution in the opposite ear. The solutions (warmed versus room temperature) and the order of irrigation (right versus left ear) were separately randomized. Investigators obtaining scores were blinded to solution temperature. Subjects rated the discomfort of irrigation, using separate visual analog scales, from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain ever). Results:  Forty volunteers were enrolled in the study. The mean difference in visual analog scale scores favoring warmed over room temperature saline solution was 26 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 19 to 33 mm; P  <.0001). Twenty percent more patients reported dizziness with room temperature irrigation (95% CI, 6% to 34%). There was no gender effect or order effect for the 2 solutions. Conclusion:  Warmed normal saline solution was both clinically and statistically more comfortable than room temperature saline solution as an ear irrigant in normal volunteers. Significantly less dizziness was reported with the warmed solution.

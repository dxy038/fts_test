Background : The total main risk factors of cardiovascular systems increace the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the relative and absolute risk of death. Objective: To determine the incidence of CAD risk factors in patients with acute myocardial infraction (AMI) and its relation with hospital mortality.
Methods: Medical files of all AMI patients which were hospitalized in the 6th months of 1996 were studied and the information regarding age, sex , type of MI , risk factors of CAD , CPK level and hospital mortality was recorded in a questionnare.
Findings : Out of 190 patients , 137 were male (72%) and 53 (28%) female. Sexual incidence had a meaningful difference (P : 0.004). According to the riskfactors , cigarrete with 32% had the maximum and hypertrigly ceridemia with 15.3% had the minimum incidence. The maximum and hypertrigly ceridemia with 15.3% had the minimum incidence. The maximum incidence of MI and mortality was observed in 60-69 year age group. Hospital mortality was 8% which was more common among diabetic (P : 0.0008) and arrhythmic (P : 0.0004) patients.
Conclusion : One or more risk factors in AMI patients increased the incidence of CAD and deaths due to the presence of risk factors. It was concluded that the relationship between diabets and mortality was stronger as compared to other risk factors.

In this paper, a transitive closure graph (TCG)-based post-floorplanning repacking algorithm is proposed for power optimization of Multiple Supply Voltages (MSV)-driven application specific 2D NoC. Through a five-stage processing including floorplan representation, preconditioning, objective insertion point calculation, TCG modification and ILP-based incremental repacking, the total communication power can be optimized without changing much of the original floorplan. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the communication power by 28.3%.

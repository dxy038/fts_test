Abstract
This paper investigates the feasibility of promoting renewable generation of electricity and choice of optimal incentives for this purpose in Iran.  In order to achieve this objective we rank incentives used in the world, through developing a questionnaire and using Expert Choice software.
Analysis indicates that experts rank the following four methods as most effective: 1) purchasing power guarantees with a weight of 0.145; 2) production subsidies with a weight of 0.095; 3) tax allowances with a weight of 0.088; and loans or bonds with a weight of 0.082.
At the other end of the spectrum, professionals rate the following methods as least effective in current conditions in Iran: a) accelerated depreciation with a weight of 0.048; b) tradable certificates with a weight of  0.054; and c) public procurement preferences with a weight of 0.053.

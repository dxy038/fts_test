Despite its original use, which was very different, WordNet is used and used today as ontology. WordNet has a complex concepts concerning specific knowledge on semantic domain. The main objective is to analyze and recognize the most suitable and easier method for extracting WordNet lexicographer files which is very useful in developing the propose framework. In this paper, we describe the methodologies of this research. They are information binding, WordNet forensic, case analysis and method analysis. Some benefits are expected from this study are the development of framework for extracting WordNet lexicographer files for semi-formal notation, the development of middleware for extracting WordNet lexicographer files, the creation of own database for storing extracted lexicographer files from WordNet. The proposed framework will make WordNet efficiently exploitable in several applications.

A current initiative in fleet experimentation addresses systems integration of enterprise knowledge resources. The combined resources must synthesize, structure and archive quantitative and qualitative results and present findings in a manner appropriate for different levels of users. Security classifications and need-to-know criteria determine the types of information presented to a given user or user group. This paper advances a methodology currently in development to structure information around ontology with security assigned to specific vocabulary. The objective is to enable a more ready exchange of secured information within distributed environments. The referenced knowledge system currently supports a wide range of naval, joint forces, and coalition enterprise applications and information resources.

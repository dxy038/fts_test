Objective
pare the intermediate term outcomes of patients with clinical T1a renal tumors who were treated with nephron-sparing surgery by partial nephrectomy (PN), the preferred approach for small (cT1a) renal tumors, or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), recently offered to selected patients as an alternative, less morbid technique.
ts and Methods
ntified patients with stage T1a renal masses who had ≥2 years of follow-up; those with bilateral synchronous or metachronous tumors, metastatic disease at presentation, or a family history of renal cell carcinoma were excluded. From July 1996 to January 2004, 110 PNs were identified in our database; 37 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria had either open (30) or laparoscopic PN (7), and 40 had either percutaneous (26) or laparoscopic (14) RFA.
s
an (range) follow-up for the RFA and PN groups was 30 (18–42) and 47 (24–93) months, respectively; the respective mean tumor size was 2.41 and 2.43 cm. There was 1 incomplete ablation and 2 local recurrences in the RFA group, and 2 recurrences in the PN group (1 local and 1 in the contralateral kidney). There were no disease-specific deaths. The overall actuarial disease-free probability for the PN and RFA groups, respectively, was 95.8% and 93.4% (P = 0.67).
sions
nitial 3-year actuarial analysis showed that RFA for cT1a renal tumors has comparable oncological outcomes to PN; however, longer term data are still needed.

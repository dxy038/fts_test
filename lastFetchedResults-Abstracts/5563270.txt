Based on the improved genetic algorithm, a wind biomass co-generation system (WBCS) planning model is put forward. The expansion plan which minimize the total cost is introduced to increase the reliability of Micro-Grid(MG) and meet the nonlinear constraints of system planning and operation. In the process of planning the total cost, not only the unit construction cost and operation cost are considered, but also the outage loss cost of demand side caused by power supply shortage. Adaptive weight method is adopted to construct dual objective function and the relationship between unit cost and reliability are well balanced, the test results shows that the proposed model and algorithm are feasible, and can provide some theoretical basis and technical support for the planning and designing of smart grid and distributed generation.

Background: Pharmacy institutes need to take venom of a great number of alive scorpions so as to produce scorpion anti - serum. Keeping them in the same lab conditions, we will have much mortality & venom production rate will decrease.
Objective: To survey the effects of 8, 10, 12 & 14 hours days length's on the lifetime of 8 scorpion species & to determine suitable lab day length so as to take more venom. Methods: A total number of 40 scorpions of H. lepturus, S. maurus, M. eupeus & A. crassicauda species, 30 scorpions of O. doriae and B. sulcyi and 20 of B. schach and B. jayakari species were examined. All the groups were followed up under the each day length for 5 months & the mortality rate of each species was determined.
Finding: S. maurus, A. crassicauda & O. doriae scorpions, M. eupeus scorpion and B. suleyi scorpion had minimum rate of mortality in 8 & 10 , 10 & 12 & 10 to 14 hours day lengths respectively. In H. lepturus , B, sulcyi & B. jayakari scorpions no meaningful difference was seen.
Conclusion: Because of the minimum rate of mortality in above mentioned day lengths , they seem suitable to be considered in lab so as to take more venom.

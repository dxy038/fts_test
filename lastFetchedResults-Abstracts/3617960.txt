A new image restoration system for improving the image of a single-CCD color camcorder is proposed. The single-CCD color camcorder reconstructs red, green, and blue color channels from a color filter array followed by a CCD. During this reconstruction process, color cross-talk among channels (interchannel distortion) and periodically space-varying blur (intrachannel distortion) occur. The proposed restoration system reduces interchannel distortion, and then, restores each color channel by removing the corresponding intrachannel distortion. Experimental results show that the proposed system provides the improved images in both objective and subjecture senses. The proposed system can be implemented by using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter structure, which is particularly suitable for real-time image processing

Objective
tudy evaluated the relationship of coping style with quality of life (QoL) among women with congestive heart failure (CHF), and the role of illness knowledge in this relationship.
s
-five women with CHF completed measures of coping style (anger-in, alexithymia, and emotional expression), illness knowledge, and emotional/physical QoL.
s
ms of depression and anxiety were positively associated with anger-in (P &lt; .001) and alexithymia (P &lt; .01), and were negatively correlated with emotional expression (P = .05). Furthermore, illness knowledge moderated the relationship between anger-in and depressive symptoms (P = .01), such that high anger-in individuals with greater illness knowledge displayed greater depressive symptoms. Knowledge also moderated the relationship between emotional expression and anxiety (P = .02), indicating that low emotional expression was associated with greater anxiety among those with less illness knowledge. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, anger-in, alexithymia, and emotional expression were not correlated with physical QoL.
sion
s knowledge is associated with poorer emotional QoL among those using denial-based coping styles, but a better QoL among those avoiding communication of their emotions.

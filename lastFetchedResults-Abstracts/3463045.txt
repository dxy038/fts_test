A program is outlined to determine the lowest radiation upset levels or digital LSI devices. Upset levels can be sensitive to input conditions and an efficient strategy of testing is described, together with powerful instrumentation which meets the above objective. Some upsets can be internal to the device and found only by clocking through to an output. This instrumentation determines if upsets exist by comparison of outputs of device(s) under test with outputs of an unexposed (reference) device.

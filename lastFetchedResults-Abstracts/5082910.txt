It is hard to solve the problem well of large-scale water resource system of multi-water resources and multi-users with traditional planning method. The Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) on a rank-based fitness is put forward in this paper according to inherent parallel mechanism and overall optimization characters of Genetic Algorithms. We model the problem of optimal allocation of water resource with the problem of biological evolution, and eliminate the inferior by judging the optimization degree of each generation individuals, then produce a new generation, thus the optimal allocation of water resource is accomplished through iteration repeated. The results indicate: it is successful to use MOGA in optimal allocation of water resource.

Background: Patient-physician communication skill is one of the
basic competencies needed for health care professionals and so is
a basic part of medical core curriculum. Communication skills
have been increasingly paid attention in medical education. This
study was designed to evaluate the effect of teaching patientphysician
communication skills on the competency of
undergraduate medical students.
Methods: A field trial on 68 undergraduate medical students with
random allocation to case and control groups was carried out.
Teaching communications skills were performed through role
modeling in the control group. The same method along with
workshops on communication skills were performed for the case
group. Two sessions of communication skillsâ€™ workshop
performed one month apart the Competency of all 68 students
was examined by observation of their interview with simulated
patients (SPs) through an objective structured clinical
examination (OSCE) at the end of the 3rd month. Three stations
examined communication skills using Calgary-Cambridge guide,
modified ALOS global and patient physician relationship
questionnaires distributed by ABMS and assessed the examinees
through observation by professionals. Each station was ranked
from 0 to 10. Data were analyzed by SPSS-11.5 software.
Results: Students in case group obtained higher scores in
communication skills but the difference was not statistically
significant. However active listening(p=0.01) and patientphysicians
communication skills (p=0.009)mean scores were
significantly higher in Control group.
Conclusion: It is likely that social interaction treats of internal
validity has occurred. Diffusion of training material and
Compensatory rivalry could have probably happened.

Background: Admission of low birth-weight (LBW) neonates in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) causes their deprivation of tactile and sensory stimulation.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of body massage on growth parameters (weight, height and head circumference) gain velocity of LBW in Yazd, Iran.
Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial study was conducted on LBW neonates whom were admitted to NICU of Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Yazd, Iran from March to December 2011. Neonates were randomly assigned to two groups. In group one, 20 neonates were received massage three times in a day for consecutive 14 days by their mothers. In group two, intervention consisted of standard and routine care as control group. The primary endpoints were efficacy in increase of mean of weight, height and head circumference that were evaluated 14 days after intervention, at ages one and two months. Secondary outcome was clinical side effects.
Results: 17 girls and 23 boys with mean gestational age of 34.4±1.22 weeks were evaluated. In the body massage group, only weight at the age of two months was significantly higher than the control group (mean±SD: 3250±305 vs. 2948±121 gr, p=0.005). No adverse events were seen in the two groups.
Conclusion: Body massage might be used as an effective and safe non-medical intervention for increasing of weight gain velocity in LBW preterm neonates.

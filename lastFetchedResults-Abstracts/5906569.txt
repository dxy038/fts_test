In the third generation wireless access systems the objective of integrating service classes with different QoS requirements introduces efficient and fair capacity sharing issues. We present a general packet scheduling, called CHAOS (channel adaptive open scheduling) whose objectives are to be adaptive to traffic and so fair with respect to different users, to be adaptive to channel quality in order to improve the radio resources utilization, and to use simple algorithms to realize the previous two goals. One key point in the definition of such a scheduling is the knowledge of the channel state: in fact on the basis of the adopted channel model a prediction criteria must be identified

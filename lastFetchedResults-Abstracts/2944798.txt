A new design method for a generalized predictive control (GPC) has been proposed. The objective is to enhance the tracking performance of the GPC and to maintain the robustness of the control system. In our proposed method, the control system is based on a parametrization of two-degree-of-freedom integral controllers. The two parameters in the parametrization can be used to incorporate the GPC method into our control structure and to achieve low sensitivity properties via loop transfer recovery technique. A numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method

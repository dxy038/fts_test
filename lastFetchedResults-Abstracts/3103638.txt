The objective of this study was to control humanoid robot real-time by using surface electromyograms (EMGs). The requirements to the qualities of prepositive circuits acquiring surface EMGs were presented. A high performance pre-amplifier and a filter were constructed. A EMGs acquisition system using DAQ2006 had been built. Surface EMGs were detected and processed by the designed system. The processed surface EMGs were used to control the humanoid robot. Different muscles of those different subjects were used to control the humanoid robot to catch object. Experimental results show the failure rate of catching the object by the humanoid robot is less than 1%.

Objective To test the hypotheses that carers
of patients with schizophrenia (single diagnosis) and
schizophrenia and co-occurring drug or alcohol misuse
(dual diagnosis) will differ in terms of expressed
emotion (EE) and their attributions for patient problems.
Method In a cross-sectional study, two samples
of 42 single- and dual-diagnosis carers are compared
in terms of EE and attributions. Patient symptoms are
assessed to control for differences other than substance
misuse. Results The study supports the hypothesis
that high-EE, dual-diagnosis carers tend to see
patient problems as more blaming (internal, controllable
and personal) than do single-diagnosis patients.
This difference was particularly marked when making
causal ascriptions for deficit behaviours. Although
there were no differences in overall EE levels in the two
groups, there were significantly more carers who were
rated as hostile and rejecting in the dual-diagnosis
group. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance
of family intervention for this patient group

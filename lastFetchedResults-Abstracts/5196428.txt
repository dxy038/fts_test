We propose several improved error concealment (EC) algorithms based on the H.264/AVC non-normative decoder. The major differences are that motion compensated EC is introduced for intra frames, whereas spatial EC is introduced for inter frames. As for the EC of intra frames, scene change detection, motion activity detection and MV retrieval are hierarchically performed to decide whether spatial or temporal information is to be used. As for the EC of inter frames, scene change is also detected to avoid merging the scenes from different video shots. Therefore, the main idea of the proposed algorithms is that both spatial and temporal correlations are utilized for the EC of intra and inter frames. Both subjective and objective simulations under Internet conditions show that the proposed algorithm greatly outperforms that in the H.264/AVC non-normative decoder.

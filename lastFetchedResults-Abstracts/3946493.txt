In previous literature, the authors introduced the technology of the wireless transmission of power and information (WTPI). This paper introduces an effective application of WTPI technology to the safe and optimal power supply for battery charging systems. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed closed-loop charging through the WTPI coupling is highlighted. For the practical application of the proposed charging, the power transmission efficiency of the WTPI must be high, and data transmission by way of the WTPI coupling needs to be bidirectional and fast enough for the real-time data feedback and charging control. By analyzes on the transmission performance using equivalent circuits, the power transmission efficiency of about 92% and the data transmission bandwidth of 8.5 Mbps are obtained with the practical WTPI coupling configuration. The charging condition is optimized, according to the proposed estimation of the residual battery capacity. As a result, the time for completion of charging is minimized by 30% and the life of the battery is elongated by 20%

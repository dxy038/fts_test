In interconnected networks, it is impossible to satisfy all coordination constraints. Some methods have been proposed in the literature to determine the minimum break point set (MBPS) before the coordination procedure. In this paper, a new method is presented which coordinates overcurrent relays and simultaneously determines minimum unsatisfied constraints as broken constraints (BCs). For the implementation of this method, a new objective function (OF) is defined that also includes constraints with various weightings. These weightings determine the priority of constraints for being satisfied which are obtained by means of some expert rules. The expert rules of previous papers are modified and weighted to determine the priority of constraints. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the OF that has an internal feedback for determining the minimum BCs considering coordination criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated by comparing the results of two sample networks with those obtained by using the recently developed techniques.

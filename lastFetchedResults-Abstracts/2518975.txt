Background: The effect of exercise training on body weight and visceral fat have been examined in several studies, whereas those of aerobic training along with the different dosages of intramuscular vitamin D on body weight, visceral fat and food intake are unknown. The main objective of the study was to assess the effect of aerobic training and different doses of intramuscular vitamin D on body weight, visceral fat and food intake in female Wistar rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, seventy-two female Wistar rats were divided into 9 with 8 rats in each group, one group: aerobic training (3 days/week for 8 weeks), three groups: aerobic training and vitamin D supplementation (in high, moderate and low doses), three groups: vitamin D supplementation (in high, moderate and low doses) and two control groups. One-way ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA test were used to analyze the data.
Results: Results showed that body weight and visceral fat in aerobic training with high dose vitamin D supplementation group was significantly lower than other groups. Also, the mean food intake in three groups of (aerobic training with low dose vitamin D supplementation, low dose vitamin D supplementation and control) was significantly higher than other groups.
Conclusion: It seems that aerobic training with high dose vitamin D compared to using each of the strategies is more effective in decreasing body weight, visceral fat in female Wistar rats.

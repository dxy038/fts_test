Background: Smile is one of the most important factors determining the attractiveness of a person and has an important role in his mood and influence on others.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the smile satisfaction and its related indicators in the students of School of Dentistry affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences.
Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on 80 students of School of Dentistry in Qazvin during 2013-2014. Digital photograph was provided from students’ smile. Smile esthetics of pictures was evaluated by three faculty members of restorative and orthodontics departments based on visual analogue scale. Smile satisfaction was evaluated by the students.  Smile line ratio, buccal corridor ratio and symmetric ratio were measured by Photo shop CS5 software. Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 
Findings: Mean smile esthetics score was 59±10.5 and 71±9.4 in male and female students, respectively and the difference was statistically significant. Mean self-reported smile satisfaction was 73.7±7.8% and 72.4±17.9% in male and female students, respectively and the difference was not statistically significant. Smile line ratio was significantly different between male and female students, but the differences in buccal corridor ratio and symmetric ratio was not statistically significant. There was positive significant correlation between smile line ratio and smile esthetics score. Among the morphometric indices, only smile line ratio had significant correlation with smile satisfaction in male students.
Conclusion: The correlation between smile line ratio and smile satisfaction indicates the high capability of this morphometric index for evaluating smile satisfaction.

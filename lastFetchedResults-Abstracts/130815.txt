Introduction: The postoperative complications of a subcutaneous hematoma, seruma. or infection often deEay hospital discharge and requires interventive techniques that include evacuation. debridement and restoration of damaged tissue. Closure of the dead space in subcutaneous tissues is one of the methods to minimize wound infection after cesarean delivery.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the role of subcutaneous tissue closure with its non- closure of wound in infection after cesarean delivery.
Materials and Methods: The present study is a prospective randomized clinical trial. It assessed the risk of wound infection in females undergoing an elective or emergency cesarean section. Research population were 336 pregnant women who were divided randomly into two equal groups for closure or non- closure of subcutaneous tissue during the cesarean section. All women were given prophylactic antibiotics routinely. Outcome under study in present research was wound infection, which was diagnosed by emergence of signs such as discharge, swelling, tenderness, redness hardness of excision spots. Chi- square test and SPSS. 9 software was used for assessment of the data.
Results: Findings of this study indicated that there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic, obstetric and surgical characteristics. Extents of wound infection after the cesarean section were 11.3% (no-19) in the group with closed subcutaneous tissue and 6.5% (no=11) in the group of non- closed subcutaneous tissue.
Conclusion: It appears that there is no significant benefit in using a subcutaneous stitch closure in comparison with non- closure of it in cesarean section.

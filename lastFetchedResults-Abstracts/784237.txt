Objective The importance of genetic and environmental
influences on children’s behavioral and emotional problems
may vary as a function of environmental exposure.
We previously reported that 12-year-olds with divorced
parents showed more internalizing and externalizing
problems than children with married parents, and that
externalizing problems in girls precede and predict later
parental divorce. The aim of the current study was to
investigate as to whether genetic and environmental influences
on internalizing and externalizing problems were
different for children from divorced versus non-divorced
families.
Methods Maternal ratings on internalizing and externalizing
problems were collected with the Child Behavior
Checklist in 4,592 twin pairs at ages 3 and 12 years, of
whom 367 pairs had experienced a parental divorce between
these ages. Variance in internalizing and externalizing problems
at ages 3 and 12 was analyzed with biometric models in
which additive genetic and environmental effects were
allowed to depend on parental divorce and sex.Adifference in
the contribution of genetic and environmental influences
between divorced and non-divorced groups would constitute
evidence for gene–environment interaction.
Results For both pre- and post-divorce internalizing and
externalizing problems, the total variances were larger for
children from divorced families, which was mainly due to
higher environmental variances. As a consequence, heritabilities
were lower for children from divorced families,
and the relative contributions of environmental influences
were higher.
Conclusions Environmental influences become more
important in explaining variation in children’s problem
behaviors in the context of parental divorce

We present the &#194;&#191;Lecomps&#194;&#191; Web-based e-learning environment, that automates the construction of adaptive personalized learning paths, tailored over learning goals, learner´s knowledge and individual learning styles. A constraint logic based engine is used to perform the course construction and to support the teacher in the definition of the learning objects to be used (learning components). Learning objective templates are used to support the management of knowledge throughout the framework (in learning components, personal learner´s traits and course definition).

Inroduction& Objective: Possible toxic effects of silver nanoparticles on humans are a major concern that encountered the use of this nanoparticles with many challenges. Today, silver nanoparticles, mostly because of their antimicrobial effects have been discussed. But the possibility of their side effects, make its use doubtful. Among the main effects of silver nanoparticles that can have in the body, effects on the liver and its metabolism which has not been mostly considered. The aim of this study was to examine the injected effects of silver nanoparticles on plasma levels of liver enzymes such as AST, ALT and ALP that could open new horizons in relation to current challenges.
Methods: In this study, 21 female Wistar rats were used. The rats were randomly divided into 7 groups. The first group was sham group, the second group was control group, the third to seventh groups were tested, were treated with 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 ppm of silver nanoparticles, respectively. Treatment of mice continued for 10 days. Then the rats were killed with ether anesthesia. Blood samples were taken from the hearts of animals. Plasma levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT and ALP) were tested by diagnostic kit of Pars Azmoon company using indirect spectrophotometric method. 
Results: The results showed that there are no significant differences between the control and sham groups. But overall, silver nanoparticles at high concentrations cause significant changes in levels of enzymes. 
Conclusions: The results of this study showed that silver nanoparticles at high concentrations can have deleterious effects on the liver and should be used with caution in high concentrations.

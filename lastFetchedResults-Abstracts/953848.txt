Using scanning tunneling microscopy, the formation of the submonolayer InrSi 111.interface has been studied. The
main objective of this work is the determination of the composition of the forming surface phases, Si 111.'31 ='31 -In
and Si 111.4=1-In. As a result, the absolute In coverages and the top Si atom densities have been extracted from the
measured fractions of the surface area occupied by various structural domains and quantitative analysis of Si mass transport.
It has been found that the surface unit cell of the 4=1-In reconstruction contains three In atoms and two Si atoms, while the
unit cell of the'31 ='31 -In is built of 16–17 In atoms and 26–28 Si atoms. q2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

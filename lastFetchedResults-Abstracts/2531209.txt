Objective(s): Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) were prepared based on the ionic gelation of chitoan with anionic compounds of Ocimum basilicum leaf extract. Materials and Methods: After addition of Ocimum basilicum leaf extract to chitosan solution, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles were determined by Field Emission Scanning Electron microscope (FESEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) Pattern, and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). The antibacterial activity of CNPs was evaluated by agar disc diffusion method. Results: The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be nearly spherical shape with size in the range of 135-729 nm. FTIR analysis revealed the presence of polyphenolic; proteins and alkaloids compounds act as effective agents for converting chitosan to CNPs. Moreover, the synthesized nanoparticles showed potent antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Conclusion: These results reveal that natural sources of materials such as plants could be used for preparation of CNPs instead of use of chemical substances.

This letter addresses the problem of generating a super-resolution (SR) image from a single low-resolution (LR) input image in the wavelet domain. To achieve a sharper image, an intermediate stage for estimating the high-frequency (HF) subbands has been proposed. This stage includes an edge preservation procedure and mutual interpolation between the input LR image and the HF subband images, as performed via the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Sparse mixing weights are calculated over blocks of coefficients in an image, which provides a sparse signal representation in the LR image. All of the subband images are used to generate the new high-resolution image using the inverse DWT. Experimental results indicated that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of objective criteria and subjective perception improving the image resolution.

This paper proposes a methodology that integrates in-house placement heuristics with genetic algorithms to solve the nesting problems of shoe making. The problems are classified as placing a set of irregular patterns on a regular area and limited to at most two different types of patterns on the area. Because of the intractability of the nesting problem, our objective is to utilize genetic algorithmsâ€™ fast convergence and solution quality to improve material utilization and reduce the calculation time of the pattern. Using the real-life data of two international brands of athletic shoes, the empirical results show that our proposed methodology can reduce average material requirements by 2.64% and average nesting time by 69.15% compared to those of current in-house software. The reduction of materials is becoming more important given that the industry is facing continuingly declining profit margins.

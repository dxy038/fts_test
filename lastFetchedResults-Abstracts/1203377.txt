Web sites are being widely deployed commercially. As the widespread use and dependency on Web technology increases, so does the need to assess factors associated with Web site success. The objective is to explore these factors in the context of electronic commerce (EC). The research framework was derived from information systems and marketing literature. Webmasters from Fortune 1000 companies were used as the target group for a survey. Four factors that are critical to Web site success in EC were identified: (1) information and service quality, (2) system use, (3) playfulness, and (4) system design quality. An analysis of the data provides valuable managerial implications for Web site success in the context of electronic commerce.

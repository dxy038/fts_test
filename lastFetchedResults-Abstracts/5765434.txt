The objective is to develop a structured object-oriented modeling and design methodology for coupled knowledge-base/database (KB/DB) systems by exploring the useful principles and features of object-oriented modeling and software development techniques. The methodology uses a synthesize object-oriented entity-relationship model for representing the knowledge and the embedded data semantics involved in coupled KB/DB systems. An associated design procedure is presented. This methodology improves on existing coupled KB/DB design methods because of its well-defined constructs that deal with various forms of knowledge involved in data processing, knowledge-based problem solving and object-oriented reasoning

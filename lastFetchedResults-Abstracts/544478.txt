Objective: In all protocols for isolation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a few
days after culture initiation, the medium were discarded along with its contents
of non-adherent cells and the adherent cell population kept and expanded as
MSCs population. In the present study, attempt was made to expand the cells
suspended in removed medium of primary culture and compare them with the
adherent cell population.
Materials and Methods: Four days after rat’s bone marrow culture initiation,
medium of the culture was collected and its suspended cells were cultureexpanded
in parallel with adherent cells till passage 3. During the culture
period, the cells from either group were statistically compared with respect of
the time required for cell confluency (the stage in which cells cover the entire
surfaces) as an index of growth rate. At the end, the cells from both cultures
were evaluated in terms of their differentiation potential.
Results: The primary culture of the cells from removed medium contained large
colonies of spindle-shaped cells that reached into confluency after 5.36±0.5
days, while those from the adherent population possessed small colonies
reaching into confluency in 8.09±0.70 days. According to the results, at all
studied passages, the cells of removed medium were significantly (p < 0.05)
achieved confluency in shorter time than the adherent population. Moreover,
the cells from either culture could easily differentiate into bone, cartilage and
adipose cells.
Conclusions: It seems that some cells from removed medium, usually
discarded in medium substitution, are MSCs possessing more growth rate than
the primarily adherent cell population.

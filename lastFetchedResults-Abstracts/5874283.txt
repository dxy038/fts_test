The formula that is about amplitude value of signal which is reflected by objective platform is deduced. The graph of relation between amplitude value of signal received in the different off-axis distance and atmosphere visibility is showed. And then it gains the equation of light intensity of laser scattering in atmosphere received by detector. It offers the relation between the ratios of scattering light intensity with incident light intensity and off-axis distance d. In the end, the reconnaissance distance and sensitivity of system based on off-axis detection is analyzed. It offered performance guidance for design, development and optimization of laser warning system based on off-axis detection.

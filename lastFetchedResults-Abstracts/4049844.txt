A new method of optimal design of the excitation coil for an electromagnetic flow meter is presented, The main goal is to form an algorithm which will be able to deal with natural channels of any shape with conductive beds/banks. The presented method allows an engineer to design an optimal coil to obtain homogeneity of the special weight vector W. This homogeneity provides that the voltage measured between the electrodes of the flow meter will be proportional to the mean velocity of the liquid in the channel. The optimization of the coil shape is carried out through minimization of an objective function defined on the basis of a finite element method 2D model of the cross-section of the channel

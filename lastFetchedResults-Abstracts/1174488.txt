The main objective for development and introduction of the new cultivar was to a achieve a high yielding and adaptative to short growing period or a catch crop, suitable for growing in different areas of Iran. After preliminary selections carried out during 1998-2000, 72 foxtail millet populations which had been collected from different parts of Iran, were examined and based on different agronomic characteristics, fifteen superior genotypes were selected and evaluated in a randomized complete block design. Line No. 12, coded as TN-15-93-1 in National Plant Gene Bank, with 29.4 tha-1 forage produced the highest yield among the genotypes. This line with the new code of KFM9 was compared with eight other advanced lines and a local check cultivar in multilocational yield traits in Karaj, Gorgan and Dezful during 2001-2003. Based on the results of these experiments, line KFM9 with 30 tha-1 fresh forage yield, 3.2 tha-1 dry forage yield, 2.5 tha-1 seed yield, 1000 seed weight of 3.54 g and other good characteristics such as earliness and tolerance to lodging was selected as the superior line. The new line was officially introduced through Seed and Plant Improvement Institute in 2009 and named Bastan.

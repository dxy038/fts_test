Wireless Sensor Networks are limited in their energy, computation and communication capabilities. In contrast to traditional networks, sensor nodes are often deployed in inaccessible areas, presenting a risk of physical attacks. A secured system can be achieved only if the security is integrated into each and every component. Otherwise the unsecured components become a point of attack. Thus security and privacy plays a major role in the aspect of system design. Key predistribution is found to be a better choice for resource constrained environments like wireless sensor networks. Another significant information regarding network is the deployment knowledge which can be used to improve the performance of the key predistribution schemes. Some information on deployment knowledge is achievable if deployment follows a particular order. Deployment knowledge offers numerous advantages when used in networks such as achieving better storage, better resilience to node capture, minimizing the number of keys and reduce network overhead. All the deployment knowledge based schemes available are based on the basic scheme and the key generation is based on Vander monde matrix. The main objective of this work is to propose a new scheme where keys are generated using Elliptic Curve Cryptography and by making use of deployment knowledge, the resilience and connectivity will be improved further.

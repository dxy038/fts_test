Presents a dynamical anti-reset windup (ARW) compensation method for saturating control systems with multiple controllers and/or multiloop configuration. By regarding the difference of controller states in the absence and presence of saturating actuators as an objective function, the dynamical compensator which minimizes the objective function is derived in an integrated fashion. The proposed dynamical compensator is a closed form of the plant and controller parameters. The resulting dynamics of the compensated controller reflects the linear closed-loop system. The proposed method guarantees the total stability of the resulting system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by applying it to a servo motor control system

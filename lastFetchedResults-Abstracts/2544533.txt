Background: Establishing personal identity is one of the main
concerns in forensic investigations. Estimation of stature forms
a basic domain of the investigation process in unknown and
co-mingled human remains in forensic anthropology. The
objective of the present study was to set up standards for
estimation of stature from the foot length and breadth.
Methods: The study samples were constituted than 120
medical students (60 males and 60 females) of Sri Devaraj Urs
Medical College, Kolar. The participants were aged between
18 and 21 years. Two anthropometric measurements viz. foot
length and foot breadth will be taken independently on the left
foot of each individual. The results were tabulated and then
regression equation was derived.
Results: The correlation between stature and all the foot
measurements was found to be positive and statistically
significant (P value < 0.001). Regression equations were derived
for estimation of stature from the measurements of the foot.
Conclusion: The present study indicates that anthropometric
measurements of foot length and breadth are valuable in the
estimation of stature. Foot length measurements estimate
stature with greater accuracy when compared to foot breadth
measurements.

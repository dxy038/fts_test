In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling jobs on identical parallel machines with the objective of minimizing the total completion times of jobs where each machine is subject to one unavailability time interval. We provide a column generation based method to obtain a lower bound for the problem. Computational experiments show the interest and the versatility of the proposed method

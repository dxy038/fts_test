It has been shown in previous works that receiving diversity techniques can improve the average quality of the received signal in a wireless network. However there is not a clear answer when the assigned area for the antenna system is fixed and when the same topology and antenna elements are used. The reason is that most of the diversity schemes cannot be compared under the exact same conditions. This study was originally oriented for Bluetooth applications (2.44 GHz), where a wide bandwidth is required, but its result can be extended to other applications. The objective of this work was to establish a reference for a clear answer to the advantages of each diversity technique when an indoor environment is considered.

The algorithm analyzes the definition and description of subjective feeling of "brightness" combining with psychoacoustic parameters, it extracts modulation frequency, critical band, loudness level and spectral distance as characteristic parameters of the "brightness" evaluation model, and modify the spectral distance and function of sound pressure level to better suit for the feature of brightness. These features are weighted as the formula of brightness. Meanwhile, MOS(mean opinion scores) is applied to subjective evaluation to get subjective results, comparing with objective result, then their subjective and objective relevance will be obtained. The simulation result shows that the correlation of objection and subjection can reach up to 0.884.

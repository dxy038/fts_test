This paper studies a method of automatically creating a database and effectively displaying a visual summary of a lesson, using content taken from a vaulting horse class. The study aims at establishing a content creation tool that can provide practical functions such as content-based retrieval and summarization, and content that can be shared by teachers and students over the network. The study also aims at clarifying how effectively such tools assist education in an actual classroom. First, the system records the scenes of vaulting actions in the class using a camera fixed beside the vaulting horse. Then it automatically extracts each jumping behavior, puts indices on key actions, and registers them into the database. Indexing on key actions is done by analyzing spatial relations and their temporal transitions between featured points of the student´s circumscribed rectangle and those of a vaulting horse model. The system creates MPEG-7 based metadata for possible data exchange over the network. Experimental results show that the database registration of student ID according to the predefined recording of action sequence enables easy access and display of a student´s actions, and of specific vaulting actions for comparison. These results also indicate that the summarized display of a key action´s thumbnails promotes visual and objective understanding and confirmation of individual jumping movements and other key motions to improve performance.

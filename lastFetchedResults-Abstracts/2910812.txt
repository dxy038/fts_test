Voltage sags are one of the main problems in transmission and distribution networks. This study proposes a voltage support control scheme for grid-connected low-power rating inverters under voltage sags. Voltage support capability is provided thanks to reactive current injection. The main objective is to inject the maximum rated reactive current during the voltage sag. Second, to raise the higher phase voltage to a predefined maximum boundary, thus preventing over-voltage. Moreover, with this strategy the phase voltages can be equalised. The first objective can be always accomplished during voltage sags. Achieving the second objective depends on the grid characteristics, the sag profile and the power rating of the inverter. Selected experimental results are reported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

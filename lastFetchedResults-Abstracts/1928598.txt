The use of thermal processes for water purification is a good alternative to reduce primary energy consumption. The efficiency in heat exchange process by falling film plays a very important role in the performance of a heat pump. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of heat transfer on a tube bank, of a heat transformer designed for water purification with LiBr–H2O as absorbent mixture, by digital image processing. To analyze the wetting area and falling film behavior of the mixture on a bank of sixteen horizontal tubes, of 1.22 cm outer diameter and 30 cm in length, experimental tests were performed. The results show the distribution of absorbent mixture, along the tubes of the bank, with 0 and 5° inclination respect to the horizontal, and different mass flow rates per unit length (0.006–0.034 kg/m s). The film thickness of LiBr–H2O was determined by the digital image processing, obtaining an average value of 0.033 cm. The most regular fall of mixture, through the tubes of the bank, was obtained with the flow of 0.025 kg/m s. This mass flow was the one which gave the best results of efficiency of heat transfer, with values between 80 and 98%.

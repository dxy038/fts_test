Pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategies and methods for multilevel converters are usually developed for series converters. One of the aims of this paper is to show that they may be applied to parallel converters using interleaving techniques, given that these converters also have multilevel characteristics. PWM methods based on carriersÂ´ disposition and on zero sequence injection are studied for parallel multilevel inverters. Analysis show that the best method in terms of load current ripple (phase disposition (PD) centered space vector PWM) has, nevertheless, a bad influence on the current balancing between commutation cells of the same phase. Another objective is to analyze these problems and to propose a solution to cancel current imbalance when using PD strategy. Experimental results validate the analysis presented in this paper as well as the compensation of band transition of the differential mode current observed when PD strategy is used.

A flatness-based flight trajectory planning/replanning strategy is proposed for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the nominal situation (fault-free case), the objective is to drive the system from an initial position to a final one without hitting the actuator constraints while minimizing the total time of the mission or minimizing the total energy spent. When actuator faults occur, fault-tolerant control (FTC) is combined with trajectory replanning to change the reference trajectory in function of the remaining resources in the system. The approach employs differential flatness to express the control inputs to be applied in the function of the desired trajectories and formulates the trajectory planning/replanning problem as a constrained optimization problem.

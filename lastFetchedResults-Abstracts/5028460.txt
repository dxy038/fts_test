Augmented virtuality can be effective in the analysis of physics based computational simulations. By providing context and additional detail not always available in purely virtual systems, the effective addition of physical objects into a virtual scene greatly enhances the intuitive objective of the original calculation. The US Army Research Laboratory has developed an augmented virtuality system for the investigation of physics based simulations. Constructed from commodity components, unique projection screen material, and custom software, this system provides a novel approach to the investigation of results from a multitude of computational areas.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of cyclosporine in preventing primary postsurgical adhesions in the rat model.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral uterine horn injury with a combination of unipolar and bipolar cautery. Sixteen of the rats were randomized to the treatment group and received preoperative and daily cyclosporine dosing (10 mg/kg) by gavage for 14 days. At the end of the study all animals were killed, and a standard adhesion scoring system was applied by a blinded examiner.
RESULTS: Adhesions were present in 75% of rats in both groups. Treatment did not affect the total adhesion score.
CONCLUSION: Cyclosporine does not appear promising as a means to decrease postsurgical adhesion formation.

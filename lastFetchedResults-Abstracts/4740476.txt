This paper presents a microinverter to be integrated into a solar module. The proposed solution combines a forward converter and a constant off-time boundary mode control, providing MPPT capability and unity power factor in a single-stage converter. The transformer structure of the power stage remains as in the classical DC-DC forward converter. Transformer primary windings are utilized for power transfer or demagnetization depending on the grid semi-cycle. Furthermore, bidirectional switches are used on the secondary side allowing direct connection of the inverter to the grid. Design considerations for the proposed solution are provided, regarding the inductance value, transformer turns ratio and frequency variation during a line semi-cycle. The decoupling of the twice the line frequency power pulsation is also discussed, as well as the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) capability. Simulation and experimental results for a 100W prototype are enclosed.

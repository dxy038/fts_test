COOPERS, an EC FP6 funded IP, deals with co-operative systems, enabling the communication of real-time data between infrastructure and vehicle, based on the development of an innovative telematics application. The main objective of this undertaking is to increase road safety and road efficiency. Value chain activities and the building of an appropriate business model are key elements in the project itself and for the business development of future COOPERS services. This paper shows the main actors for a value network in the co-operative systems context. It reveals that besides traditional roles, such as content provider, application provider, service provider and data distributor, new roles, such as the role of a data clearance entity, are also needed. In the example analysed in this paper, a differentiation is made between a value network for safety-critical services and convenience services. In the safety-critical services case a traffic control centre plays the leading role, whereas in the case of the convenience services a Telco takes over the lead.

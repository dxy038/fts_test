Inonotus Obliquus is a medicinal mushroom that is widely used in folk medicine in Russia, North Europe and China. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and hypolipidemic capacities of Inonotus Obliquus polysaccharides(IOP). In vivo, the hyperlipidemic rats, induced by high-fat diet, were provided 100, 200, 500 mg/kg day of IOP for 8 weeks to evaluate their expected hypolipidemic activity. The results showed that Compared with MG, The administration of lOP did not show any effect on the body weight of the experimental rats, but significantly decreased the levels of LDL-C, TC, TG in serum, increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01) and decreased the contents of MDA in serum, livers and hearts. These findings were further supported that IOP showed a noticeable inhibition against lipid oxidation induced by free radicals caused by high-fat diet intake on the basis of their antioxidant activities.

This paper proposes an improved bidirectional LLC resonant topology with a new control scheme. All the switches in the proposed topology can achieve soft switching. Compared with traditional isolated bidirectional dc-dc converters such as dual active bridge converter, the reverse energy and turn-off loss are reduced dramatically, and the conversion efficiency can be much improved. With the proposed new control scheme, the power flow direction and output power of the proposed converter can be changed automatically and continuously, which is attractive for energy storage systems to balance the energy and to keep the dc-bus voltage constant. Performance of the proposed circuit is validated by the experimental results from a 1-kW prototype. Over 97% efficiency is achieved at full load condition based on the prototype.

Objective
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) occurs more frequently in male children and adolescents than in females, with a ratio of approximately 3 to 1. We determined whether psychophysiological differences are associated with the expression of ADHD in males and females, using simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and electrodermal activity (EDA).
Methods
Quantitative EEG and EDA measures were acquired simultaneously and continuously (2 min) during an eyes closed resting condition for 70 ADHD adolescents (48 males, 22 females) and their age- and sex-matched controls.
Results
Males and females with ADHD were differentiated by both EEG theta activity and EDA. ADHD males showed increased theta (widespread), whereas ADHD females showed a localised frontal enhancement of theta with reduced rate of EDA decrement. These sex differences were unrelated to ADHD subtype.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that different psychophysiological processes may underlie ADHD in each sex. The profile of theta enhancement in ADHD males is consistent with a developmental deviation model of ADHD, whereas ADHD in females may be better understood within an arousal model, which emphasizes both central and autonomic function.
Significance
These findings highlight the potential for concurrent EDA measures to inform EEG studies of ADHD, particularly in regard to sex differences.

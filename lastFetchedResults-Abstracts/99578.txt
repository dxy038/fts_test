The objective of this paper is to assess the joint use of the magnitude and the phase of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetric image for point target detection and analysis. We first consider a single-look complex (SLC), single polarized radar image including point targets embedded in clutter. A series of sublooks are generated from this SLC image, both in azimuth and in range in order to analyze the inherent speckle effects. The two-looks internal Hermitian product (2L-IHP) is defined and is further shown to qualitatively increase the target/environment contrast. The processing of azimuth and range spectra preliminary to the 2L-IHP derivation (spectral whitening, generation and overlapping of sublooks) is described. A simulation tool is developed to model a point target behavior. Then, the polarimetric extension of the 2L-IHP is proposed, and the optimized polarimetric 2L-IHP is defined. The gain is twofold: in comparison with single polarization, polarimetry is shown to enhance detection capabilities, but also to provide additional information for target analysis.

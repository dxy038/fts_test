Background and Aim: An association between periodontal and other bacterial infections and coronary heart disease/atherosclerosis has recently been observed in both cross-sectional and logitudinal studies. The objective of this study was to examine the association between periodontitis and (CHD) and coronary atherosclerosis. Material and Methods: A case-control study was arranged using 76 individuals (52 men, 24 women), with mean age: 51 years who were referred to general hospital for coronary angiography. Gingiva! attachment toss and coronary atheromatosis was assessed, together with measurement of the established coronary risk factors. Results: In the logistic regression analysis, odds ratioes were 11.7 and 13.14 for attachment loss and CHD and coronary atheromatosis. For patients with attachment loss of greater than 6mm. Compared to those with attachment loss of less than 6mm, odds ratio of CHD and "two and three vessels disease" were 11.7 and 13.4 respectively. Odds ratio of each milimeter increase in attachment loss, for CHD was 2.18 individuals with less than 10 teeth compared to those with more than 10 teeth had odds rotio of 3.77 and 4.4 for CHD and "two three vessels disease". No association was obserued between age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking and CHD, which is not quite reliable due to the small number of participants.
Conclusion: This observation shows an association between the severity of periodontitis and CHD and atherosclerosis, also supports the proposal that periodontal infections play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis.

A sensorless output feedback predictive controller for induction motors requires an accurate knowledge on the model at each sampling instant, to calculate predictions of future behaviour of the process. However, some critical parameters, such as rotor resistance and load torque which are subject to large variations during operation, beside the inaccessibility of all the state, constitute major challenges for the performance of such systems. In the spirit to achieve high performance control, the incorporation of an observer is proposed for recovering online all machine variables (the internal states and time varying parameters). To this end, this work highlights the capability of the adaptive interconnected observer to simultaneous estimation of the internal states and time varying parameters, only by using the current measurements. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the duality between control and the proposed observer to achieve high performance in the tracking objective.

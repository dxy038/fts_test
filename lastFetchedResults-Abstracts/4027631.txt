The method of linear programming described here is well suited to the design of open-loop or closed-loop sampled-data control systems with deterministic inputs. Linear equations are written to express the errors at sampling instants in terms of the undetermined coefficients of the over-all pulse transfer function. Other linear equations are written to impose any desired limits on errors or on coefficients. A solution is found which maximizes an objective function. The design method is explained and the results of a practical example are given.

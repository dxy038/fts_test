The objective of the present work is to show the influence of machining and anodizing processes on fatigue life of alloy 7010-T7451. Two different cutting conditions were employed to obtain two different initial surface roughnesses. Degreasing, pickling and anodizing were then carried out. In the as machined condition, surface roughness is clearly effective in reducing fatigue life in this material. As the surface roughness increases fatigue life decreases and this effect is found to be more pronounced in high cycle fatigue where major portion of fatigue life is consumed in nucleating the cracks. Effects of pre-treatments, like degreasing and pickling employed prior to anodizing, on fatigue life of the given alloy were also studied. Fatigue curves showed that pickling had negative impact on fatigue life of specimens while degreasing showed no change in fatigue life. The small decrease in fatigue life of anodized specimens as compare to pickled specimens is attributed to brittle nature and micro-cracking of the coating. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination revealed multi-site crack initiation for the pickled and anodized specimens. SEM examination also showed that pickling process attacked the grain boundaries and the inclusions present on the surface resulting in pits formation. These pits are of primary concern with respect to accelerated fatigue crack nucleation and subsequent anodized coating formation.

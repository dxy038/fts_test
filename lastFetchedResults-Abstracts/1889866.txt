Background
y and young patients alike are undergoing shoulder replacement at increased rates. In an era of outcomes reporting, risk adjustment, and cost containment, identifying patients likely to have adverse events is increasingly important. Our objective was to determine whether patient age is independently associated with postoperative in-hospital complications or increased hospital charges after shoulder arthroplasty.
s
d the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to analyze 58,790 patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty between 2000 and 2008. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression modeling was used to compare groups. Our objective was to determine whether age had an independent impact on the likelihood of postoperative in-hospital complications, mortality rate, length of stay, or charges after shoulder arthroplasty.
s
ts aged 80 years or older had an increased in-hospital mortality rate (0.5%) compared with patients aged 50 to 79 years (0.1%) and patients aged younger than 50 years (0.1%). Predictors of death included female gender, total shoulder arthroplasty versus hemiarthroplasty, and Deyo score. Increased age was associated with slightly increased hospital charges. Length of stay was longer in patients aged 80 years or older compared with younger patients. After shoulder arthroplasty, postoperative anemia occurred more often in patients aged 80 years or older. Other postoperative complications including pulmonary embolism, infection, and cardiac complications were similar among groups.
sion
patients tend to have longer hospital stays, an increased incidence of postoperative anemia, and slightly higher charges after shoulder arthroplasty. Advanced age is not associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary embolism, infection, and cardiac complications. Further research is warranted to explain the relationship between age and early postoperative outcomes.

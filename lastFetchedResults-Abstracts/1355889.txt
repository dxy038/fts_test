The objective of this study is to measure the performance improvement of supply chain (SC) stages through implementing the national standardization system (NSS) in an innovative way. There are many studies on the positive effects of standardization system on supply chain performance (SCP), but very few studies have measured and prioritized the impact of this system on SCP. This paper introduces a new approach to the performance improvement of each stage of SC through implementing the NSS. First, we use fuzzy analytical hierarchical process method to measure the relative importance of each stage and determine the characteristics of SC. Then, the amount of SC stages improvement after implementing the NSS is determined. Finally, using a combination of results, the stages of SC are ranked according to the effectiveness of NSS implementation. In order to validate the proposed approach, the case analysis of Iran NSS is carried out on broiler SC. The stages of SC are ranked according to the performance improvement through implementing standardization system, subsequently. This approach can be generalized to other standardization systems and SCs.

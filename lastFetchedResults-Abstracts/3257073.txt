Wireless ad-hoc networks are collections of devices which are able to communicate each other through wireless links. Those networks differ from infrastructure-based wireless networks for the absence of a centralized coordinator which handles all the communications among the devices. This leads to higher probability of packets collision, congestion of links, etc. Moreover, wireless links are characterized by an intrinsic high and time varying packet loss ratio, due to external noise and interferences. The objective of this paper is to present a new distributed multi-path algorithm (i.e., traffic is split among multiple paths) for wireless ad-hoc networks with the aims of (i) increasing the throughput of the applications running onto the network (ii) explicitly accounting for the packet loss of the wireless links and (iii) guaranteeing that the routing process converges to stable paths. The algorithm is developed by using the concept of Wardrop equilibrium. Simulation results show the higher throughput achieved by the proposed routing algorithm, compared to shortest path routing protocols, based on hop count and on packet loss metrics.

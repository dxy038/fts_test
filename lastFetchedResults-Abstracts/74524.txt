The most basic task in subaperture stitching test work is to confirm the precision of the system. We propose a method with which to calculate the system's precision. Statistical theory, especially regressive analysis, is employed. To discuss the statistical characteristics of all the random variables is the objective of the precision analyses. The results show that the number of sample points and the connatural error of the interferometer are the most important factors in the analyses.

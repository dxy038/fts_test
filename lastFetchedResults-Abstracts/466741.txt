Objective: This study describes a 24-hour assay of autonomic nervous system activity in human fetuses with the use of a power spectral analysis of heartbeat intervals. Study Design: The study included 6 normal fetuses and 11 growth-restricted fetuses, 3 of which were hypoxemic. Fetal heartbeats were continuously recorded for 24 hours, and a power spectral analysis was performed on the beat interval data. A low frequency domain of beat intervals was identified (0.025-0.125 cycles/beat) and evaluated at regular intervals over the 24-hour period. The cosinor method was used to detect rhythmic fluctuations in the resulting low frequency areas. The same procedures were also performed with the mothers of the fetuses. Results: We observed 2 diurnal rhythms of heartbeat activity (1 with a 12-hour period and another with a 24-hour period) in the normal and growth-restricted fetuses without hypoxemia. In contrast, these rhythms were not observed in the hypoxemic fetuses. In the mothers, only the 24-hour rhythm was observed. Conclusion: The 12-hour cycle of autonomic nervous activity is present in normal fetuses. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:1247â€“52.)

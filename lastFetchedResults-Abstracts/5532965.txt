Inspection challenges continue to increase as more composite components are introduced into DoD aviation, ground and sea platforms. Composite defects and artifacts introduced during production are not always readily detectable. It is difficult to assess the impact on structural integrity of the system; especially with the varying geometries, the variety of composite materials in use today, and differing issues with manufacturing defects/artifacts. Fiber/Ply distortions in complex geometries are just one of several defects difficult to detect; including marcel and composite bridging. The objective of this effort was to demonstrate a portable, field-deployable capability; suitable for manufacturing environments, that reliably inspects helicopter blades and dynamic components for defects and inherent damage; rapidly, cost effectively, and with multi-zone/single scan capability. This effort investigated an advanced, nondestructive inspection capability to provide significant improvement in composite and metallic damage detection in manufacturing/depot/field level environments. Two separate technologies were investigated, developed, and presented to the US Army. One is the Deep Focus (DF) probe capability and the other is the Laser Excited Pinducer Sensing system, or LEPS. These technologies could potentially remove the inherent issues involved with multiple scanning and the errors associated with detector repositioning, as the single DF multi-zone scan demonstrated a single reference with all &#8220;layers&#8221; of the scan within one data base. The LEPS technology provided an initial &#8220;Go-No Go&#8221; evaluation. Both technologies and their results will be discussed.

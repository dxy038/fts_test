In this paper, the concept of vulnerability is used to measure the capacity to withstand earthquake disasters in different regions. The purpose of vulnerability analysis is to identify appropriate actions that can be taken to reduce the vulnerability before the potential for damage is realized. The objective of this paper is to determine the vulnerability of different parts of a city against earthquake by data envelopment analysis (DEA). A numerical example demonstrates the application of the DEA for the 20th district of Tehran.

The main objective of this study was to compare the quality and effectiveness of the sedimentation velocity at unit gravity (SVUG) method with the percoll density gradient centrifugation method in the separation of spermatogenic cells in order to introduce a simple and cost-effective method.
In this study, the testes from male mice (NMRI strain) were obtained and transferred to Ham's F10 medium. With the use of the mechanical and enzymatic digestion meth- od, spermatogenic cells were isolated. Spermatogenic cell separation was undertaken with both the percoll gradient centrifugation and sedimentation velocity at unit gravity (SVUG) methods based on human serum albumin (HSA) gradients. Subsequently the May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) staining method was used to identify isolated cells. The combined method possibly could isolate a purer fraction of spermatogenic cells. This method (SVUG and Percoll Gradients Centrifugation combination) has the potential to be used as a simple and effective method for the isolation of spermatogenic cells for diag- nostic or research purposes.

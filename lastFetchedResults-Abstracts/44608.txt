There is a trend in current attitude research to move away from a simple unidimensional view of attitude, towards examining a more multivariate concept of attitude. An extensive array of attitudinal properties or dimensions has been provided, defined and categorised as `attitude strength'. Attitude strength has only recently been adapted as a conceptual framework for research in marketing and consumer studies. Our objective in this paper is to introduce some of the attitude strength concepts and literature in order to improve the measure and understanding of research dealing with measurement of food preferences, perceived food quality and satisfaction with food products, food suppliers, etc. The paper takes a particular focus upon problems in comprehending the middlemost choice or neutrality when measuring attitude items along a traditional bipolar semantic differential or a bipolar hedonic preference scale. Through several propositions, we have outlined how future research should note that both attitude ambivalence (mixed feelings) and non-attitude (lack of confidence in evaluation) could be threats to comprehending the middlemost response alternative on a questionnaire as neutral when measuring food attitudes or preferences in the traditional way. Our approach should also deal with some of the shortcomings of analysing attitude-behaviour consistency when modelling food consumption behaviour.

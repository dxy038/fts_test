In this paper, we address the problem of tracking a point target moving in two dimensions using an image sensor with a configurable active area. Our objective is to accurately track the target while minimizing the size of the image (and hence the amount of data) acquired by the image sensor. We propose an adaptive heuristic algorithm to configure the sensorÂ´s active area. The target tracker is implemented using a particle filter. Monte Carlo simulation shows that our adaptive algorithm requires a very small active area to provide performance very near that obtained when using the whole sensor field-of-view.

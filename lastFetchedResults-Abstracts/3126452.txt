In this paper, we propose an extraction method of ride comfort according to the difference of the tire by electroencephalogram (EEG). Recently, the sensory evaluation is used for development of the product. However, the sensory evaluation by a general user who doesnÂ´t have a clear standard is unstable. Moreover, ride comfort depends on the sensibility and the preference of the individual. It is considered that these psychological changes influence the brain that rules center of sensation. Therefore, we pay attention to the EEG. We use the EEG that it is possible to measure it simply in the brain function measurement technique as an objective evaluation. In this study, the feature of the EEG during the driving is extracted by the factor analysis (FA). Moreover, we investigate the correlation of the subjective evaluation and the EEG features. From the result, the EEG features and subjective evaluation features has correlation. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed method as an objective evaluation method was shown.

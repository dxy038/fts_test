Objective: We developed a probabilistic continuous sleep stager based on Hidden Markov models using only a single EEG signal. It offers the advantage of being objective by not relying on human scorers, having much finer temporal resolution (1 s instead of 30 s), and being based on solid probabilistic principles rather than a predefined set of rules (Rechtschaffen &amp; Kales) Methods and material: Sixty-eight whole night sleep recordings from two different sleep labs are analysed using Gaussian observation Hidden Markov models. Results: Our unsupervised approach detects the cornerstones of human sleep (wakefulness, deep and rem sleep) with around 80% accuracy based on data from a single EEG channel. There are some difficulties in generalizing results across sleep labs. Conclusion: Using data from a single electrode is sufficient for reliable continuous sleep staging. Sleep recordings from different sleep labs are not directly comparable. Training of separate models for the sleep labs is necessary.

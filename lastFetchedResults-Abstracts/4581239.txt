A techno-economic comparison of five different optical access network (OAN) architectures is presented. We consider several novel techniques that we have presented and demonstrated in previous works, offering more efficient fiber use than point-to-point (P2P) networks as well as power splitting passive optical networks (PS-PON). A total cost and cost-per-bandwidth value for the each architecture is calculated in order to have a fair comparison between them. Both CWDM and DWDM combined with bidirectional reflective optical network units (ONU) have been demonstrated to decrease the CAPEX of the network.

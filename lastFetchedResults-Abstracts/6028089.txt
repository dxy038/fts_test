The increasing interest in the development and eventual implementation of indoor radio systems in the millimeter wave frequency band has motivated research efforts with the objective of characterizing the channel at these frequencies. Measurements were conducted at 21.6 GHz, 37.2 GHz and 59.6 GHz using horn direction and omnidirectional antennas. Among the interesting parameters to be estimated, the received signal envelope, distance power law distribution, the cumulative distribution function of long and short term fading, edge diffraction and human absorption are the most important. For wideband systems, the behavior of the indoor channels within typical buildings must also be well understood. The acquisition of the experimental data requires valid experimental procedures to obtain the impulse responses, and the amplitude and phase profiles which can be interpreted in terms of the system parameters. This paper reports on some of the design guidelines for millimeter wave systems

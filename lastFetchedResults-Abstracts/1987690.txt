In this paper, Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) problem is formulated as an optimization problem in which the objective function is to minimize the total investment, operating, and outage (energy not served) costs of power system as well as the cost of DSM programs. Generation system reliability is assessed and provided by means of EENS and LOLP indices. For this sake, energy not served cost is added to the objective function, and LOLP is considered as a constraint. To solve the problem, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed. In order to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, it is applied to a test system with 15 existing power plants and 5 types of new candidates, for two planning horizons. The Genetic Algorithm (GA), as a mostly used method, is also applied to solve the IRP problem. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed ABC algorithm over the GA.

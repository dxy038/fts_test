Objective
To investigate the association of walking activity with inflammatory markers and fasting insulin in a bi-ethnic population screened for type 2 diabetes in Leicester, United Kingdom, between 2005 and 2006.
Method

Physical activity, adipocytokine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and fasting insulin measurements were available for 400 individuals screened for type 2 diabetes. Of the 400 participants, 56% were diagnosed with normal glucose control, 36% with prediabetes and 8% with diabetes.
Results

Multivariate statistical analysis showed that those who reported walking for at least 30min on at least 5days/week had lower levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α compared to those who reported lower walking activity levels, after adjustment for other modes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, age, ethnicity, sex, social deprivation and smoking status. Further adjustment for waist circumference attenuated the association of walking with tumor necrosis factor-α.
Conclusion

Walking activity, independent of other forms of physical activity, is associated with lower levels of circulating pro-inflammatory markers.

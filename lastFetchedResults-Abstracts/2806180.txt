The main purpose to plan the flight planning for Unmmaned Aerial Imagery Capturing System (UAiCs) is to find out the best flight path and camera exposure station. Besides that, flight planning can help in reducing operational cost and obtain the optimum result. Flight planning is the most important step in Photogrammetry and need to be planned properly before further operation is carried out. By utilizing these new technology of capturing the aerial imagery, the process becomes easier and the data captured is up to date. In terms of knowing the area need to be surveyed until the generation of the product. the process is more convenient and all is computerized now. The objective of this paper is to review the standard flight mission process in capturing aerial imagery using the UAiCs technology. The expected result will shows that the important of the flight planning process flow that will lead to a good result of data captured.

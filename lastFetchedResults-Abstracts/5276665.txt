In the integrated management system of construction projects, quality, schedule and cost are an entia in which they influence and restrict each other, and the change of anyone of the three objectives can induce the changes of the other two. So, how to make the performance evaluation of construction project integrated management objective and equitable, and provide a feasible reference benchmarking for integrated dynamic control, is a problem that should be studied carefully. Most previous project management performance evaluation method mainly adopted the single item linear analysis method. This method is easy, but can not reflect the complicated non-linear interaction between the evaluation indexes. In the light of the merit of BP artificial neural network method, the authors established a construction project integrated management performance evaluation model, which is based on the BP (back-propagation network) neural network, considering project time limit, quality requirements, cost, three major factors on construction project integration management. The analysis of a practical example shows that the evaluation results are more overall, scientific and objective.

This paper considers the solution of a real-time optimization problem using adaptive extremum seeking control. It is assumed that the equations describing the dynamics of the nonlinear system and the cost function to be minimized are unknown and that the objective function is measured. The main contribution of the paper is to formulate the extremum-seeking problem as a time-varying estimation problem. The proposed approach is shown to avoid the need for averaging results which minimizes the impact of the choice of dither signal on the performance of the extremum seeking control system. A simulation is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

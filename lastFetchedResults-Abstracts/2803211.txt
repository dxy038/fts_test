WIFI location service has become an attractive research filed for wisdom city nowadays. However, the precision is a challenging problem faced by researchers. In this paper, a new algorithm for indoor localization using WLAN signal strengths is proposed. The objective of the work was to design a simple and efficient indoor positioning algorithm with good accuracy. The proposed algorithm uses the fingerprinting technique as a pre-processing step. The second step is the application of a new model, named Distance Relative Attenuation Model, which both considers the nonlinear attenuation and the random noise from environment, to improve the veracity. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better accuracy compared with basic fingerprinting technique and basic Distance Attenuation Model. Thus, it is a simple and effective indoor positioning scheme.

The objective of this research is to study the influence of gas flow velocity on particulate fouling of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers. An experimental setup has been designed and constructed to simulate particulate fouling in EGR coolers in diesel engines. The setup consists of soot generator, gas/particle flow heater, testing section for EGR coolers and finally an exhaust system. Two sets of fouling experiments have been performed with and without water injection, and the gas velocity in each set has varied between 30, 70 and 120 m/s. The concentration of soot particles in the gas flow is 100 mg/m3, and the average diameter of the particles is 130 nm with a standard deviation of 55 nm. It has been found that the thermal resistance and thickness of the fouling layer and the fouling rate decrease as the gas velocity in the EGR cooler increases. If EGR coolers are operated with a gas velocity, which is just lower than the critical flow velocity for the largest particle in the flow, quick deterioration of the thermal performance of the heat exchanger will nevertheless occur. This strongly indicates that the gas velocity should exceed a certain critical flow velocity in order to prevent particulate fouling. In addition, the presence of water vapour in the gas flow improves the thermal performance of the cooler and decreases the fouling rate, and its influence decreases as the gas velocity increases.

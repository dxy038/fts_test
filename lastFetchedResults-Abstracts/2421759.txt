Cost minimization of shell-and-tube heat exchangers is a key objective. Traditional design approaches besides being time consuming, do not guarantee the reach of an economically optimal solution. So, in this research, a new shell and tube heat exchanger optimization design approach is developed based on imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). The ICA algorithm has some good features in reaching to the global minimum in comparison to other evolutionary algorithms. In present study, ICA technique has been applied to minimize the total cost of the equipment including capital investment and the sum of discounted annual energy expenditures related to pumping of shell and tube heat exchanger by varying various design variables such as tube length, tube outer diameter, pitch size and baffle spacing. Based on proposed method, a full computer code was developed for optimal design of shell and tube heat exchangers and different test cases are solved by it to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Finally the results are compared to those obtained by literature approaches. The obtained results indicate that the ICA algorithm can be successfully applied for optimal design of shell and tube heat exchangers with higher accuracy in less computational time.

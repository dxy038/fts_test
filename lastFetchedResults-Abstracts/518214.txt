 The paper presents the recent development and application of image analysis and computer vision systems in sorting and grading of products in the field of agricultural and food. Basic concepts and technologies associated with computer vision, a tool used in image analysis and automated sorting and grading is highlighted. For the ever-increasing population, losses in handling and processing and the increased expectation of food products of high quality and safety standards, there is need for the growth of accurate, fast and objective quality determination of the characteristics of food and agricultural food products. Computer vision and image analysis, are non-destructive and cost-effective technique for sorting and grading of agricultural and food products during handling processes and commercial purposes. Different approaches based on image analysis and processing identified is related to variety of applications in agricultural and food products.

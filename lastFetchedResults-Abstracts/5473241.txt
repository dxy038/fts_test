On this basis, discusses the adaptability of the five modes in China, and then finds out that the "public-managed" modes are effective ones. Finally, takes suburban railway Line S2 in Beijing as a case study, and study the investment, operation, management and capacity assignment for rebuilding the suburban railway lines which have superfluous transport capacity like S2 to join the urban railway system in megacities. The results provide decision supports for the government to build adapted companies to run railway lines after suburban railway participating in urban rail transit.

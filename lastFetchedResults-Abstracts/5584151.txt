On the basis of building city culture industrial cluster risk evaluation index system, triangular fuzzy function is used to handle the uncertain information in the process of evaluation and calculate the weight of evaluation index at all levels. Uncertain information is merged by the way of D-S synthesis method from Dempster/Shafe evidence theory after correction in the group decision-making process of city culture industrial cluster risk evaluation. Case study on risk evaluation of culture industrial cluster of XiÂ´an city shows that the method is simple and the results represent the risk level of city culture industrial cluster in an objective manner. The method has certain reference significance to other cities in risk evaluation of culture industrial cluster.

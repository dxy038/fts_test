This research concerns polymer matrix composite (PMC) materials having long or continuous reinforcement fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. The objective is to develop comparatively simple, designer friendly constitutive equations intended to serve as the basis of a structural design methodology for this class of PMC. Here (Part I), the focus is on extending the deformation model of an anisotropic deformation/damage theory presented earlier. The resulting model is a generalization of the simple Norton/Bailey creep law to transverse isotropy. A companion paper (Part II) by the writers deals with damage and failure of the same class of PMC. An important feature of the proposed deformation model is its dependence on hydrostatic stress. Characterization tests on thin-walled tubular specimens are defined and conducted on a model PMC material. Additional exploratory tests are identified and carried out for assessing the fundamental forms of the multiaxial creep law.

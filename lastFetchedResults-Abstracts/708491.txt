Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for prediction of complicated clinical course and in-hospital mortality in patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism (PE).
Methods and Results
This study was a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed as having PE, in whom cTnI testing was obtained at emergency department (ED) presentation between January 2002 and April 2006. Clinical characteristics; echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction; inhospital mortality; and adverse clinical events including need for inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and thrombolysis were compared in patients with elevated cTnI levels vs patients with normal cTnI levels. One hundred sixteen patients with PE were identified, and 77 of them (66%) were included in the study. Thirty-three patients (42%) had elevated cTnI levels. Elevated cTnI levels were associated with inhospital mortality (P = .02), complicated clinical course (P < .001), and right ventricular dysfunction (P < .001). In patients with elevated cTnI levels, inhospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-9.29), hypotension (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 2.31-23.28), thrombolysis (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.63-19.92), need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.42-17.57), and need for inotropic support (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.03-8.85) were more prevalent. The patients with elevated cTnI levels had more serious vital parameters (systolic blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation) at ED presentation.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that elevated cTnI levels are associated with higher risk for inhospital mortality and complicated clinical course. Troponin I may play an important role for the risk assessment of patients with PE. The idea that an elevation in cTnI levels is a valuable parameter for the risk stratification of patients with PE needs to be examined in larger prospective studies.

Formulates and studies a (sub)optimal H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control problem related to the attenuation of impulsive disturbances to a class of linear systems. The control objective is to design a stabilizing controller to minimize the induced operator norm from the impulsive disturbances to the controlled outputs. The authors derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a (sub)optimal controller, and give a procedure to compute such a controller when one exists

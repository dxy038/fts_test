In wireless networks, channel state information is hard to obtain in a reliable and timely manner due to the rapid change of wireless environments. In this paper we propose instead the use of source information, which is always available at the encoder and can be easily and accurately obtained from video sequences, to achieve error-resilience. With use of exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) estimation for the motion-level information associated with video frames, a source-adaptive intra-coding rate selection scheme is described to provide error-resilience to N successive video frames. Based on our proposed cross-layer packetization scheme, a novel intra-frame packet interleaving scheme is implemented together with a fixed FEC coding strategy at the application-layer to combat the severe bursty losses over wireless channels, and the performance of the combined approach is investigated. Our objective and subjective results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in dealing with the bursty packet losses on both wireless single-hop and multi-hop networks without any additional system complexity or delay.

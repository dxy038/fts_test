The main objective of the work reported was to develop and evaluate an algorithm merging data from a terrain reference navigation system (TRN), an inertial navigation system (INS), and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. This was accomplished by merging all available sensor data in one large Kalman filter. The navigation sensors were regarded as smart sensors, providing not only positional data but also an associated covariance matrix. The integration of these navigation sensors was accomplished around a MIL-STD-1553B data bus. Initial results show that the integrated navigation system showed good performance. In the case that the GPS was jammed and the TRN had a low accuracy, due to flying over flat terrain, the sensor models kept the accuracy of the integrated system to an acceptable level

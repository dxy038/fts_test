In order to reach to an energy-saving product design, this paper presents a mathematic energy model to calculate the total energy consumption within entire product lifecycle. Energy factor is the essential coefficient of this model to represent the energy consumption throughout the entire product lifecycle, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, assembly, use, disassembly, and recycling. With an aim to create a systematic approach to energy-saving product design, the authors integrate the axiomatic design and modularity design theories with energy factor, and the energy factor is eventually optimized together with other major design factors in a multiple objective decision making model.

Mechanical imbalance and eccentricity are usual faults in induction motors. These two faults can be identified by their effects in the stator current spectrum using motor current signature analysis. However, if the motor is supplied by electronic converters the identification of the fault is more complex, since additional harmonic components appear, caused by the converter. The main objective of the present work is to investigate the possibility of identifying these faults in a motor which is supplied by a power converter, specifically the slip energy recovery drive. To this purpose, the rotor current space vector modulus harmonic components are examined. The system is at first investigated through simulation in Matlab-Simulink. Thereafter, experimental tests are conducted. Characteristic results are presented and discussed

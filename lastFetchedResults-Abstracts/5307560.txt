The PLL response to heavy ion radiation is investigated. Firstly, the radiation currents in transistors are introduced at the schematic level thanks to sources modeled in HDL-A. Secondly, the radiated block is simulated at the transistor level while the other blocks are replaced by a behavioral model in HDL-A. This allows the authors to simulate the whole PLL in order to examine the effects of radiation at its output. The objective is to obtain a complete HDL-A behavioral model of the PLL, including heavy ion effects

The surgical management of atrial fibrillation is becoming more commonplace with the procedure of pulmonary vein isolation forming the cornerstone of the treatment of atrial fibrillation. In this article a technique is described to introduce a dry bipolar radiofrequency clamp into the chest through a lateral port sized incision to safely effect pulmonary vein isolation in patients with low ejection fractions undergoing a concomitant mini-maze procedure. Confirmation of the transmurality and effectiveness of the lines of ablation is shown by the demonstration of bidirectional block to and from the pulmonary veins.

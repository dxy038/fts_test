History and Objective: Human hydatid disease has been world widely spread and its frequency ,clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment and recurrence rate were reported variously. For determining the frequency, surgical results, and recurrence rate, this study was performed in Kashan area.
Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study on patients with hydatid disease was carted out. Age,sex,living side, clinical loboratory , imaging finding, anatomic location. and operation procedure, were all considered.At the end of the investigation for recurrency, chest X-rey pA Ultra sonography of abdomen and indirect hemagglotination test IHT was performed.
Finding: From 135cases (62.2%) were female,FM/M 1.6/l the incidence pick was in (2-30). 58. % living in rural area 68% of cyst was in abdomen (liver) and 30% pulmonary, caught and then sputum was the most frequent symptom in pulmonary hydatid disease, abdominal pain and fever in liver hydatid disease was more frequent.

The most common procedure in liver was cystectomy and omentoplasy ,in lung was systectomy.
We did not use any scolocidall agent and had 4 patients recurrence in liver 3% but no any patient had pulmonary Recurrent. indirect hemagglotination test IHT after 5 years operation in 88.4 was positive Conclusion: ft seams that after perfect surgery no scolocidal drug administration is necessary and indirect hemagglotination test IHT is an excellent sero diagnostic means.

Considering the difficulties of calculation and the defects that the relationship among evaluation objects are ignored when using Fuzzy synthetic Evaluation Method to determine weights to the multi-factors, this paper put forward a new idea of determining weights to the Multi-objective evaluation factors using information entropy. The differences of determining weights using Entropy method and the method of over standard with weight was compared in the weight calculation of evaluating indicators by using the fuzzy mathematics through using the atmosphere monitoring data of 10 monitoring points in the city of Changchun. The results showed that when the evaluation involves a number of evaluation objects using this method was very convenient for fuzzy synthetic evaluation. Only one calculation was enough and it need not to calculate every monitoring point. This method predigested the fuzzy synthetic evaluation process greatly and the evaluation results were objective and reasonable.

The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a distributed multiagent sensory information fusion system which integrates data from multiple sensors such as laser radar, weather radar, forward looking infrared sensors (FLIR) and associated important sensory information located in different agents to accomplish requested tasks cooperatively. We have developed a system based on the concept of offboard augmented theater surveillance (OBATS) and Internet network architecture to make the multiagent resource management system in practice. The architecture of distributed fusion system, the coordination strategy of the global decision agent (GDA) and the communication between service agents (SAs) and GDA have been developed. Furthermore, a scenario application has been implemented to demonstrate the concept of this multiagent system. Other potential applications have also been discussed

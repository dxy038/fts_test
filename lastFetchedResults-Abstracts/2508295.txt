Background: Accelerated partial breast irradiation via interstitial balloon brachytherapy
is a fast and effective treatment method for certain early stage breast cancers
however skin, chest wall and Lung doses are correlated with toxicity in patients treated
with breast brachytherapy.
Objective: To investigate the percentage of the dose received by critical organ
(skin), thermoluminescence detector was used in MammoSite brachytherpy and the
ability to control skin dose between MammoSite and MultiCatheter brachytherapy was
compared with each other.
Method: Dosimetry is carried out using a female-equivalent mathematical chest
phantom and Ir-192 source for brachytherapy application.
Results: Our initial results has shown good agreement with surface doses between
those calculated from the treatment planning results and those measured by the
thermoluminescence detector. The mean skin dose for the experimental dosimetry in
MammoSite was 2.3 Gy (56.76% of prescription dose).
Conclusion: The results show that the MultiCatheter method is associated with
significantly lower mean skin and chest wall dose than is the MammoSite. The Multi-
Catheter technique is quite flexible and can be applied to any size of breast or lumpectomy
cavity, But in MammoSite technique, verification of balloon symmetry, balloon/
cavity conformance and overlying skin thickness is essential to assure target coverage
and toxicity avoidance.

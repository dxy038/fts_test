Background and Aim : Hemiplegic shoulder pain is a common problem that its prevalence varies from 48% to 84%. This disorder limits the patient’s ability to achieve the optimal function. The objective of study was to assess the relationship between hemiplegic shoulder pain with neuromusculoskeletal disorders in post stroke hemiparesis   Materials and Methods: This study was an observational-analytic that fullfilled on fifty patients with acute stroke. The post stroke period was 28 days. The following items were evaluated:shoulder subluxation with X-ray, shoulder spasticity with Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS), soft tissue injury with orthopaedic tests and RSD with clinical features.   Results: Hemiplegic shoulder pain was present in 28 patients(56%). Seventeen patients (85%) showed shoulder subluxation, 18 patients (72%) had supraspinatus tendonitis ,13 patients (65%) had biceps tendinits, 4 patients (14/2%) had ACJ involvement, 3 patients (10/7%) had elbow flexor spasticity, 2 patients (7/1%) had shoulder adductor spasticity ,2 patients (7/1%)had shoulder internal rotators spsticity , 4 (14/2%) patients had RSD.   Conclusion: Results from this study show that one factor does not play role in causing hemiplegic shoulder pain and this disorder is multifactorial. Prevention of shoulder pain and performing appropriate physiotherapy can play a role in improving stroke patients’ function.   Keywords: Stroke, Shoulder pain, Sublxation, Muscle tone, Shoulder –Hand syndrone

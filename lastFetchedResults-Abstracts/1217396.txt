Due to holistic necessary in understanding the problems and the complexity and multi-dimensionality nature of the issues which the researchers are faced, the idea that  the effort of scientific researchers to solve a range of issues based on their expertise without the collaboration of experts from other disciplines and even when the solutions provided; particularly in research related to social issues - may instead of providing solutions for all aspects of the problem, causing multiple solutions without effectiveness. In order to reduce this matter the social researches may assist researchers from other fields of science in their studies and a convergence between different fields of studies is needed. The main aim of present research is providing solutions to convergence the field of humanities, natural and engineering.

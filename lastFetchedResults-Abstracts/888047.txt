Objective: The aim of the present study wasto designPersian versionof time discrimination task.Method: Thirty-onevolunteer elementary school students participated in this experiment. By means of a computerized test, selected pictures of International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) were projected to all participants in both1000and 2000milliseconds (ms) and discriminationthreshold ofsubjectswas calculated by the formulaproposed byLevitt(1971).Results:Participants need 261/5msand 373/06msto differentiatecomparative stimulus from target stimulus in 1000 ms and 2000 ms, respectively. These values are considered as timediscriminationthreshold.Conclusion:In conjunction with classic findings in psychophysics, the results of this research indicate that as the intensity of stimulus increased, the magnitude of discrimination threshold increases, but doubling the intensity does not necessarily double the perceived discrimination threshold. We suggest that time discrimination could be studied in a prospective paradigm by using our task.

The objective of this study is to propose a project management model which includes the unified process (UP) and UML language, for e-business software development in a physically distributed environment. The research is a qualitative study, aiming to develop methods and models. The main research method is the case study, according to Yin (1992). Initial results point towards a model, which includes the spiral life cycle type, the development process of object-oriented systems (using UML specification language and the unified process as proposed by RUP), and the incorporation of the procedural approach proposed by PMBOK (2000). The proposed model is divided into 6 phases, where each one of these phases contains a set of associated activities. In the future, the intention is to develop a support software for the model and apply this software into the environment in study. This extremely important study line demonstrates that the business world and business practices in the software development area are moving ahead of existent theories and conceptual models in this area. This study, yet in its initial phases, starts to bring significant results that contribute to meet market expectations nowadays.

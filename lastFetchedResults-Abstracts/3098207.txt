In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm is introduced for the NP-hard multi-criteria no-wait flow shop scheduling problems. Both makespan and total flowtime are taken into account. The proposed algorithm makes use of non-dominated sorting strategy. Corresponding objective increment properties are analyzed to improve efficiency for searching Pareto solutions. Experimental results show that the proposal outperforms the other three heuristics currently available.

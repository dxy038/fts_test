The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to analyze a transmission line model used in electromagnetic transitory simulators, called equivalent impedance test. Initially the definition of equivalent impedance reference test is shown. Soon after this methodology is applied to a transmission line model, the "quasi-modes model". The studies were accomplished in a hypothetical nontransposed three-phase transmission line of 440 kV. The line length is 500 km, and it was modeled through cascades of /spl pi/-circuits (with 50 /spl pi/ circuits, each with 10 km length).

The present paper reviews the potential for applying a CNC robot system to advanced machining techniques, with the aim of optimising company resources in the early stages of new product development. Due to the large dimensions of the robot working envelope, it is possible to totally machine large prototypes at full scale. The experimental work was based on the normal process of model generation through CAD geometric design and CAM toolpath creation, but with subsequent production through robotics CNC machining. The research was undertaken with the objective of characterising the most adequate model materials, tools, and process variables for the rapid machining of prototypes on a CNC robot system at full scale. Initially, the analysis focused on a 3-axis CNC machining operation. With the information achieved in this first stage of the investigation, it was possible to demonstrate the relative importance of adopting 5-axis and high speed CNC machining operations. The research confirms the great advantages attained through this more advanced approach to the industrial production of prototypes. Topics identified for further work are described.

We consider a wireless multirate CDMA system with perfect successive interference cancellation (IC). Different services have different rates, quality of service (QoS) requirements. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the total transmission power. An optimal power control strategy is derived. We find that ranking users in descending order of channel gain can minimize the total transmission power of the users, regardless of the usersÂ´ data rate and QoS requirements

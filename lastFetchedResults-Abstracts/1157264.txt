In this paper we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to generate Mamdani fuzzy rule-based systems with different good trade-offs between complexity and accuracy. The main novelty of the algorithm is that both rule base and granularity of the uniform partitions defined on the input and output variables are learned concurrently. To this aim, we introduce the concepts of virtual and concrete rule bases: the former is defined on linguistic variables, all partitioned with a fixed maximum number of fuzzy sets, while the latter takes into account, for each variable, a number of fuzzy sets as determined by the specific partition granularity of that variable. We exploit a chromosome composed of two parts, which codify the variables partition granularities, and the virtual rule base, respectively. Genetic operators manage virtual rule bases, whereas fitness evaluation relies on an appropriate mapping strategy between virtual and concrete rule bases. The algorithm has been tested on two real-world regression problems showing very promising results.

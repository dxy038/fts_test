In the paper author show a new approach to the line balancing of security inspection lines. In this approach there is a particular combination of simulation of metaheuristics and modeling and simulation. Simulation is used directly during the metaheuristics process for evaluating the objective function. In this manner it is possible to obtain more effective objective function. This process can be quite fast in many situations where simulation calculation can be done very effectively. In particular simulation is used for the computation of the objective function. In particular in the paper a tabu search based algorithm is considered. The application concerns a problem of line balancing. Same algorithm is applied to a conventional objective function in order to show benefits of the new approach.

In the case of Sufism, it is a series of linguistic figures which express the relation of man and God, a collection of images that are God's objective manifestation. The present article shows the relationship of rhetoric figures (irony, metaphor and etc.) to symbol and the place of symbol in epic and lyric poetry, and tries to indicate the role of symbol and symbolism in mystical poetry.

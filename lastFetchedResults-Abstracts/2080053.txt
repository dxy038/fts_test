The physical and psychological characteristics of children in different stages of their development are the basis
of space planning and designing for them. This research studies the relation between design, green space and
children's awareness and studies children's behavior in green spaces and investigates their mental image from
ideal space to access an applied and effective method for promotion of the quality of places made for children.
Paying attention to environment is considered as an integral part of sustainability and accomplishment of urban
sustainability in theory and practice taking into account the environmental problem in this paper. The objective
of this paper is to access a pattern of landscape design towards education and promotion of environmental
concepts through practical experience of children in educational environments, learning from nature and
integrating them with educational spaces in order to emphasis on sustainable development, promotion of
environmental ethics culture and environment friendly living methods in children. One of the important
applications of green space is its social – psychological application and it is required to change the mental
structure about the anatomical and structural space of that environment in order to fulfill the social -
psychological needs of children. This study is a descriptive – applied study and the information and data are

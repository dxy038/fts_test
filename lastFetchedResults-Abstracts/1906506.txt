The main objective of the present study was qualitative and quantitative assessment of
common kilka stocks in Iranian waters of the Caspian Sea during 1996-2011. The catch of
common kilka fluctuted from 5000 tones to 9000 tones in 2000- 2003 and then increased and
was between 14000 tones to 27000 in 2004-2011. In the years 1996-2010, Catch Per Unit
Effort (CPUE) was ranged between 0.07- 3.4 tones/(VesselsÃ—Nights) which decreased to 2.7
tonnes in 2011. The total biomass and spawning stock biomass (SSB) had a same trend as
CPUE. During 1996-2010, the total biomass of common kilka was ranged between 16580-
97000 tones which declined to 51280 tones in 2011. The SSB was ranged between 7513-
38932 tones which declined to 28609 tones in 2011. In the age compositions of catch, age 2+-
4+ was the largest age group. From 2001 and later, age 3+ and 4+ predominated and the
frequency of young specimens 1+ and elderly 6+ strongly declined (  <  %1). The age range of
restriction and may continue in the coming years it will cause serious damage to reservoirs.

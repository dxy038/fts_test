This paper discusses the DC-DC power electronic interfaces of batteries used in microgrid. This study is necessary because the stability of the islanded microgrid depends on its response speed to the transients. Here the modeling and control of the DC-DC bidirectional converters of batteries in microgrids are discussed. The hybrid modeling is extended to the bidirectional converters. The paper focuses on inner and power controllers of the DC-DC bidirectional converters for interfacing batteries in microgrid. The inner control techniques are discussed and a control strategy for batteries operation in different modes is proposed.

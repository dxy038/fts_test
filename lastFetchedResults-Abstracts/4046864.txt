The far-field patterns of an extended hemispherical-lens/objective-lens antenna system fed by a double-slot antenna is computed using the hybridisation of ray-tracing and diffraction techniques. The difference patterns computed for a monopulse antenna are also presented. The computation results show that this antenna has good performance. Although the double-slot antenna is used as a feed antenna, other antennas such as slot-ring or bow tie antennas can also be used. This antenna can be used in many millimetre-wave systems

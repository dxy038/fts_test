We deal with the problem of intrapulse radar-embedded communication, and propose a novel waveform design procedure based on multi-objective optimization. Precisely, under both energy and similarity constraints, we devise orthogonal signals aiming at maximization of the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and minimization of a suitable correlation index (related to the possibility of waveform interception). The problem can be cast into a non-convex multi-objective optimization and solved via the so-called scalarization technique. Finally, performance of the proposed waveform design scheme is assessed in terms of both Symbol Error Rate (SER) and the so-called &#8220;intercept metric&#8221;.

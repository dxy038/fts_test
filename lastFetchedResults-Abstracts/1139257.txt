A study was carried out on the dehydration behaviour, texture, color and sensory acceptability of mango leather. Soy protein concentrate, skim milk powder and sucrose were added at levels of 0%, 4.5% and 9% to improve nutritive value and sweetness of the product. It took 7.60 h of drying time at 60±1°C for mango leather to reach 10% moisture content (wb). The three ingredients lowered the drying rate of mango leather with soy protein concentrate having the most significant effect followed by sucrose and skim milk powder. An objective method for studying the texture of mango leather is presented. The mango leather had an extensibility and energy to rupture of 10.71 mm and 0.1503 J and the extensibility and energy to rupture decreased with increasing levels of soy protein concentrate, skim milk powder and sucrose. Mango leather had L, a and b values of 42.58, 12.58 and 26.89. The yellowness of mango leather as indicated by b values decreased with increase in soy protein concentrate and increased with increase in sucrose. Soy protein concentrate lowered the sensory acceptability of mango leather whereas sucrose and skim milk powder at levels of 4.5% each resulted in mango leather with the highest acceptability. A regression model was developed and coefficients had high R2 values (>0.85) and can be used to predict texture, color, drying time and sensory acceptability.

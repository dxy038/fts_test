It is demonstrated that a depropanizer distillation column can be controlled by a distributed control system coupled with product analyzers with a four-minute cycle time in an industrial environment. The primary objective of the control schemes is to maintain the composition of iso-butane in the top product at its specification and the propane composition in the bottom product at its prescribed setpoint. The implementation of the composition controllers is described, and control strategies and performance evaluation are discussed

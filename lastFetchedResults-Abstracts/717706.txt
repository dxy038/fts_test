During development of nitroheterocycles with potential antimycobacterial activities we have tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis a number of pyrroles strictly related to pyrrolnitrin, an antifungal antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces pyrrocinia. Some of the tested arylpyrrole derivatives and pyrrolnitrin have shown appreciable inhibiting activity against M. tuberculosis and M. avium. SAR studies well correlate antimycobacterial potency with the presence of halogens in the phenyl ring and a nitro group at position 3 of pyrrole.

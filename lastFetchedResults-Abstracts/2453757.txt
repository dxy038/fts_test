Measurements of neutron and gamma dose-equivalents were performed in the test cell, at the outer test cell wall, in nearby work areas, and out to the nearest property lines at a distance of 180 m. Argon ionization chambers, moderated 3He proportional counters, and fission chamber detectors were used to obtain measurements of neutron and gamma dose-equivalents per D-T neutron during individual tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) discharges. These measured neutron and gamma D-T dose-equivalents per TFTR neutron characterize the effects of local variations in material density resulting from the complex asymmetric site geometry. The measured dose-equivalents per TFTR D-T neutron and the cumulative neutron production were used to determine that the planned annual TFTR neutron production of 1 Ã— 1021 D-T neutrons is consistent with the design objective of limiting the total dose-equivalent at the property line, from all radiation sources and pathways, to less than 10 mrem per year.

In this paper, a new procedure for generating a mesh structure of image representation has been proposed. The proposed algorithm employs a feature map extraction with a specific threshold level to place initial nodes densely in regions that contain high frequency features and nodes are placed coarsely in smooth regions. After that, many insignificant nodes are removed using node elimination scheme. The proposed algorithm is well suited for usage at very low bit-rate image and video coding as processing results have demonstrated that it provides a good subjective and objective image quality at a lower number of required nodes. Moreover, comparison shows that the proposed method provides comparable image quality while requiring fewer mesh nodes than the several existing methods.

Object tracking is a key objective of research in image engineering and considerable research has been directed toward developing tracking techniques based on particle filtering [1], which generally utilizes similarities in color, shape, texture, and other attributes of a target in likelihood calculations. However, partial occlusion of the target tends to reduce the accuracy of target recognition and is thus a significant obstacle to effective tracking. We therefore propose a technique for robust object tracking even when the target is partially occluded. It employs hierarchical likelihood calculations in particle filtering.

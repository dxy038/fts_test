Objective
To compare the clinical efficacy of the GaAlAs laser and dentin bonding agent in treating dentin hypersensitivity.
Methods

One hundred and forty teeth from 70 patients diagnosed with dentin hypersensitivity, were divided into two groups: In group I, teeth were irradiated with 30 mW GaAlAs laser for 1 min and in group II, teeth were applied with dentin bonding agent. Sensitivity was assessed by tactile and thermal tests, measured with the criteria proposed by Uchida at baseline and after treatment; immediately, at 15 and at 30 days.
Results

The reduction of dentin hypersensitivity was observed in both treatments using the GaAlAs laser and dentin bonding agent. However, a greater reduction was observed over time up to day 15 and no significant change was observed between days 15 and 30. Statistically significant differences in the level of dentin hypersensitivity between bonding agent and the GaAlAs laser were found at each observation period (p < 0.05).
Conclusion

The GaAlAs laser had less desensitizing efficacy compared with dentin bonding agent. However, the desensitizing effect of the GaAlAs laser still could be considered an effective therapy for treating dentin hypersensitivity.

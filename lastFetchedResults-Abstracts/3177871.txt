The objective of semantic segmentation in microscopic images is to extract the cellular, nuclear or tissue components. This problem is challenging due to the large variations of these components features (size, shape, orientation or texture). In this paper we improve the technique presented in [17] used to identify the epithelial nuclei (crypt) against interstitial nuclei in microscopic images taken from colon tissues. In the proposed enhanced approach, the crypt inner boundary is detected using the closing morphological pyramid instead of morphological hierarchy. The outer crypt border is determined by the epithelial nuclei, overlapped by the maximal isoline of the inner boundary. The use of sampling in building the pyramid offers computational efficiency, reduces the amount of used memory, increase the robustness and preserve the quality results. An analysis of the two approaches is performed considering the number of pixels processed to create each level. Also the relation between the levels of the hierarchical structures is established.

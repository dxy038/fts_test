Water is a sort natural resource that canÂ´t be replaced. It is also one of the important supports for the sustainable development of society and economy. According to characteristics of urban water resources system, an optimal allocation modal of water resources is built considering coordinative development among multi-objective and regions such as the production, living and ecology. Taking gray theory as the basis, we apply maximum entropy principle to find the solution and contrast with gray clustering method. Consequently, this paper provides a basis for urban water resources carrying capacity assessment.

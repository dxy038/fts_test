Diminution of workers´ efficiency and increase of health and safety hazards are among the topmost problems faced by present manufacturing industry. Therefore manufacturing industries are continuously exploring new avenues to improve factors that affect workers´ efficiency, health and safety while improving the overall productivity. The main objective of the research was to address such problems by introducing ergonomically sound work environment and practices through action based case study. This paper elaborates how thermal comfort, design of work places and practices influence the overall productivity of an apparel manufacturing factory in Sri Lanka. Data related to design of work environment and human comfort were gathered by means of a questionnaire survey and on-site experimental observations. Then the data were analysed by comparing them with the industry standards and theories of ergonomics. Based on the resulting conclusions an action plan was developed and recommended solutions for the identified issues.

In active queue management (AQM), core routers signal transmission control protocol (TCP) sources with the objective of managing queue utilization and delay. It is essentially a feedback control problem. Based on a recently developed dynamic model of TCP congestion-avoidance mode, this paper does three things: 1) it relates key network parameters such as the number of TCP sessions, link capacity and round-trip time to the underlying feedback control problem; 2) it analyzes the present de facto AQM standard: random early detection (RED) and determines that REDs queue-averaging is not beneficial; and 3) it recommends alternative AQM schemes which amount to classical proportional and proportional-integral control. We illustrate our results using ns simulations and demonstrate the practical impact of proportional-integral control on managing queue utilization and delay

A kind of new linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based formulation is presented for multiobjective
H1/a-stability controller synthesis of linear time invariant (LTI) systems. New
LMI-based conditions enable to parameterise controllers without involving the Lyapunov variables
in the formulation. With this feature, multi-objective controllers can be designed, with noncommon
Lyapunov variables and two additional adjustable scalars. Furthermore, to find the
minimum possible cost, LMI-based conditions can be solved by the grid of the space which is composed
of these scalars. When compared with previous results based on a common Lyapunov function,
this provides less conservative results. Finally, two numerical examples are included to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposals.

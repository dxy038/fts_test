The objective of this paper is to utilize the SIPOC, flow-chart and IDEF0 modeling techniques combined to elaborate the conceptual model of a simulation project. It is intended to identify the contribution of these techniques in the elaboration of the computational model. To illustrate such application, a practical case of a high-end technology enterprise is presented. The paper concludes that the proposed approach eases the elaboration of the computational model.

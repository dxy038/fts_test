Method : Determination of operation according to kit. Results : Scavenging free radical ability experiments in vitro showed: took Vc as the contrast, RP had some superoxide anion radical, alkyl radical scavenging capacity, but the scavenging ratios were lower than VC; strongly hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, higher than Vc . Reduced blood glucose study in rats showed: RP had significantly capacity in reduced blood glucose concentration, increased serum SOD activity and decreased serum total cholesterol. Conclusion: RP had some antioxidant and reduced blood glucose ability.

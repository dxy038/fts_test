Route optimization of urban multi-modal travel is important to multi-modal travel network design and information supply system development. Firstly, this paper put forward reasonable route distinguish indicators and threshold of multi-modal travel from logical, behavior, time and space constraints; then taking minimum travel time as objective function and considering various constraints, this paper built multi-modal travel route optimization model and solved it by improved genetic algorithm. Finally, taking XiÂ´an multi-modal travel network which bases on Metro Line 2 and includes 24 origin-destinations for example, the validity of proposed model and algorithm was verified. Research result shows: solution based on constraints and improved genetic algorithm is closer the global optimum solution than classic genetic algorithm.

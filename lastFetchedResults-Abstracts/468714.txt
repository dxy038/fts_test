Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two different misoprostol regimens for second-trimester pregnancy termination.
Study design
We performed a randomized clinical trial in patients who were at 14 to 23 weeks of gestation and who were admitted for medical termination of pregnancy. All patients received 800 μg of vaginal misoprostol and were assigned randomly to 400 μg of oral misoprostol or 400 μg of vaginal misoprostol every 8 hours. Efficacy and side effects were compared. The mean induction time of the study group was compared with that of an historic control group that had received 400 μg vaginally every 12 hours.
Results
Forty-three women were assigned randomly, 22 women to vaginal misoprostol and 21 women to oral misoprostol. Induction time and hospital stay were slightly shorter for the oral group; however, the differences were not significant. Side effects were similar for both groups.
Conclusion
After an initial 800 μg dose of vaginal misoprostol, a regimen of 400 μg of oral misoprostol every 8 hours is as effective as the same dose of vaginal misoprostol with no additional side effects, which provides a convenient alternative for midtrimester pregnancy termination.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Wound healing is a complex, regular, and dynamic response to damage, involving interactions between different cell types, structural proteins, growth factors, and proteinase. Caffeic acid for years, and laser since the late 60s have been used for the treatment of skin conditions. This study aimed to review the combined effect of caffeic acid and laser on wound healing in male Wistar rats.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 36 male Wistar rats, weighing 200-250 g, were divided into four groups of 9 rats. The control group received no interventions, the second group was treated by laser, the third group received caffeic acid, and the fourth group was treated by both caffeic acid and laser. The laser-treated groups were locally treated by laser and caffeic acid after ulcer formation. On days 4, 7, and 10 after the intervention, the wound area was measured. For histological evaluation, tissue samples were obtained and the amount of hydroxyproline in urine samples was measured on day 10 via biochemical methods; afterwards, the groups were compared.
FINDINGS: The obtained results showed that the percentage of wound healing on days 7 and 10 in all treatment groups (groups 1, 2, and 3) was more significant than that reported in the control group. Measurment of hydroxyproline showed increased concentration in the second (8.9±0.4), third (8.3±0.29), and fourth (9.3±0.27) groups, unlike the control group (7±0.36) (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this research, the wound healing effect of caffeic acid and laser, specifically their combination, was confirmed by histological studies and biochemical evaluations; moreover, hydroxyproline concentration increased in all treatment groups.

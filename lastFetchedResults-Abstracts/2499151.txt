<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a frequent disorder of the skin that is distinguished by the development of erythematous patches and yellow-gray scales. It is a multifactor disease that requires predisposing factors for its progress. Presence of these factors leads to reproduction of opportunistic yeast <em>Malassezia </em>spp.The aim of the present study was to isolate and identify distribution of <em>Malassezia </em>species on the scalp of SD patients in Ahvaz using modified Dixons agar.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>A total of 110 patients diagnosed with SD were sampled. The sampling was carried out by brushing the hair and collecting the dandruff in paper pockets. For identification of <em>Malassezia </em>species, the scalp scales were cultured in Dixons agar. A combination of different characteristics including yeast cell morphology, ability to grow on Sabouraud dextrose agar, catalase test and ability to utilize individual Tweens (20, 40, 60 &amp; 80) were used for identification of species.<br />Â <strong>Results: </strong>Twenty-seven of 110 (24.5%) SD patients had positive cultures for <em>Malassezia </em>species of which 17 (63%) were male and 10 (37%) were female. The most commonly identified <em>Malassezia </em>species was <em>M. globosa </em>(40.7%) followed by <em>M. pachydermatis </em>(22.2%), <em>M. furfur </em>(11.1%) and <em>M. restricta</em>(7.4%) and <em>Malassezia </em>species (18.5%).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong><em>Malassezia globosa </em>was considered to be the most important <em>orgaism involved in cases </em>with Seborrheic dermatitisin this study.</p>

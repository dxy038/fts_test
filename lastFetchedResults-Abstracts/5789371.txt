In this paper, adaptive state feedback control is presented for a class of single-degree-of-freedom (1DOF) electrostatic microactuator systems which can be actively driven in both directions. The control objective is to track a reference trajectory within the air gap without knowledge of the plant parameters. By a suitable change of coordinates, the system is represented in parametric strict feedback form, for which adaptive backstepping is performed to achieve asymptotic output tracking. To deal with the constrained position space, which precludes contact of the movable plate and the electrodes, special barrier functions are employed in Lyapunov synthesis. All closed loop signals are ensured to be bounded. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

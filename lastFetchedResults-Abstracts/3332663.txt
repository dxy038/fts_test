This paper presents a new idea in image segmentation algorithm driven by human visual system segmentation techniques and has been widely studied in the visual attention. The human eyes fixate at important locations in the scene, and every fixation point lies inside a particular region of arbitrary shape and size. we propose a method to segment the object of interest by finding the optimal closed contour around the fixation point in the polar space, The human visual system has two types of attention: overt attention (eye movements) and covert attention (without eye movement). For evaluating the segmentation result, from both region-based and boundary-based perspectives, are integrated into an objective function .Our approach can be complemented in a variety of ways, An interesting avenue has to do with learning models of the world. For example, if we had a model of a &#8220;squirrel,&#8221; we could segment the &#8220;squirrel,&#8221; more correctly in the region.

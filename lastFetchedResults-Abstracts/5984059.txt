This paper discusses the design and implementation of a monolithic gate driver for an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). The objective is to implement a high voltage (25 V) monolithic gate driver with an efficient protection circuit in a conventional low-voltage (5 V) high-density (0.8 &#956;m) BiCMOS process. Extended drain MOSFETs are used to implement the high-voltage capability in this design

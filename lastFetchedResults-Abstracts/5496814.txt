Nowadays, the increasing diversity of wireless technologies opens the possibility for a mobile device to exploit the aggregated capacity of multiple wireless networks. This aggregated capacity gives different possible assignations of ongoing flows to the available interfaces, that may depend on user-imposed restrictions, applications QoS or energy constraints. In this paper, we model the flow-to-interface assignation problem considering bandwidth and energy constraints as a multi-objective optimization problem and use genetic algorithms to search for optimal solutions. We discuss optimal solutions found through the proposed model.

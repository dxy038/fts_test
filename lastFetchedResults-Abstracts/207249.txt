The main objective of this research has been the estimation of price elasticity of labor demand in the industrial sector of Iran by using the flexible profit model. By using simultaneous equations (seemingly unrelated equations), the structural equations of the model are estimated. Then, the direct price as wess as cross price elasticity of labor demand have been derived
The major findings indicate that the labor demand is relatively inelastic in the industrial sector of Iran. In other words, the change of wages by government intervention will not increase the level of employment. The cross price elasticity of labor demand with respect to the capital price is negative which shows that labor and capital are rather substituted. The elasticity of labor demand with respect to the product price is relatively elastic. Moreover, the elasticity of labor demand with regard to the prices of energy inputs is relatively low which explains energy price increase can not effectively affects the labor demand.

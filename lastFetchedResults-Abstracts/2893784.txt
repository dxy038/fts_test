In this paper, a new Second Order Generalized Integrator - Phase Locked Loop control algorithm for reactive power compensation, load balancing, harmonic elimination and neutral current compensation is presented. The strategy is proposed for DSTATCOM to function under distorted load conditions and to improve the power quality at the supply mains. This control algorithm extracts the fundamental component of the load currents for estimating the reference currents based on three single-phase SOGI-PLLs. The main objective of the SOGI-PLL is regulating the DC voltage required for compensation. A ripple filter is used in parallel with the source to eliminate high frequency noise. During the design procedure, the effects of load unbalancing and sudden increase/decrease in loads are also taken into account and performance is found satisfactory. The effectiveness of the design is simulated and shown using MATLAB/Simulink.

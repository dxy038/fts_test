The objective of this contribution is to describe thermal degradation of pistachio shells by a detailed reaction mechanism. Pistachio shells are assumed to be composed of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin of which degradation is described by relevant kinetics based on experimental data. The mechanism yields a detailed composition of product gases, and therefore, is well-suited to predict evolution of both thermal decomposition and products. Thermal degradation is described by a system of coupled differential conservation equations for mass, momentum, species, and energy for a pistachio shell particle. The relevant conservation equations are discretised by the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and solved within the conversion module of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM). A comparison between experimental data and predicted results yielded good agreement.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine neonatal outcomes among women with a planned cesarean and a planned vaginal delivery at term.
Study design
This prospective survey was conducted on 18,653 singleton deliveries that represent 24 maternity units during a 6-month period. The data were retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and analyzed according to intended mode of delivery.
Results
Compared with planned vaginal deliveries, planned cesarean delivery increased transfer rates to the neonatal intensive care unit from 5.2% to 9.8% (P< .001). The risk for pulmonary disorders (transient tachypnea of the newborn infant and respiratory distress syndrome) rose from 0.8% to 1.6% (P = .01). There were no significant differences in the risks for low Apgar score and neurologic symptoms.
Conclusion
A planned cesarean delivery doubled both the rate of transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit and the risk for pulmonary disorders, compared with a planned vaginal delivery.

Objective
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become a useful tool for investigating and even modulating human brain function. RTMS of the human motor cortex can produce changes in excitability that outlast the period of stimulation. To investigate the persistent effect of high-frequency rTMS of sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on somatosensory function.
Methods
We evaluated the thermal thresholds (cold and warm sensation) in 14 normal subjects before and after a short train of 5 Hz rTMS over the SM1 or occipital cortex (OC).
Results
Threshold for cold perception was increased immediately after rTMS of the left SM1 and no effects at all were noticed after OC stimulation. There was a slight, not significant, increase of warm threshold immediately after the rTMS of the left SM1 and no effects at all were noticed after OC stimulation.
Conclusions
High frequency rTMS over primary sensorimotor cortex seems to modulate sensory function related to thermal (cold) perception.
Significance
The method may be useful for both the study of normal human physiology of temperature perception and for rTMS based manipulation of brain plasticity in patients with sensory disturbances.

As HLA effectively supports the reuse and simulation component interoperability, it has been widely used in civilian and military field. However, many problems have been exposed in pure HLA-based simulation as further expansion goes with the application of simulation, such as poor portability of RTI, less reusability of federate general code, and the limitation among the field of cross majors, interdisciplinary and the application. In the developing of the federation, the simulation technique based on the automatically generation of federate framework has greatly reduce the repeated achievement of common function, The use of Web service also solve the current limitations of HLA applications. This paper propose a solution to the development of HLA federate framework code based on the Web service, and design a kind of tool which makes federal developer do not have to take into account the RTI and underlying interface when the simulation system was developed. The difference on platform and development environment in the reuse of resources wonÂ´t be a consideration, neither. In order to achieve better between applications in the simulation system and change function calls into service calls within the systems into and publish the service interfaces to the Internet, to fulfill the objective resource sharing and Cross-platform Interaction.

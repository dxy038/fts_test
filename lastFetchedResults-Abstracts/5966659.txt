Air temperatures ranged at levels of 10, 20 and 30&#176;C, and relative humidity ranged at levels of 65, 75 and 85% under storage conditions. The result showed that (1) the counts of moulds were 2.27 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>, 5.12 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>, 6.84 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>, 2.57 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g under storage conditions of 10&#176;C, 65, 75 and 85% RH, 20&#176;C, 65%RH on the 17th day, respectively. The levels of AflatoxinB1 (AFB1) were 10.2, 11.6, 12.0, 13.8 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The levels of ochratoxin A (OTA) were 69.8, 68.9, 74.1, 75.4 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The levels of deoxynivalenol (DON) were 1012, 1428, 1502, 2600 &#956;g/kg, respectively. (2)The counts of moulds were 1.07 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>, 1.21 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>, 7.96 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g under storage conditions of 20&#176;C, 75% 85% RH, 30&#176;C, 65% RH on the 10th day, respectively. The levels of AFB1 were 16.5, 12.0 &#956;g/kg, 15.2 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The levels of OTA were 73.6, 73.1, 78.1 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The levels of DON were 1250, 1220, 2800 &#956;g/kg, respectively. (3)The counts of moulds were 3.37 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>, 4.00 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g under storage conditions of 30&#176;C, 75% 85%RH on the 5th day- respectively. The levels of AFB1 were 26.2, 11.7 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The levels of OTA were 69.8, 77.2 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The levels of DON were 3015, 1650 &#956;g/kg, respectively. The total mould counts above were more than the limit of national feed standards. AFB1 and OTA did not exceed the limit. National feed standards did not clearly defined for feed corn and broiler concentrated feeds on the DON. (4) Species of F.moniliforme - nd P.viridicatum have been isolated and identified as the predominant moulds of some mould-contaminated broiler concentrated feeds.

Background and purpose: The gastroretentive drug delivery systems can be retained in the
stomach due to low bulk density. This assist in improving the oral sustained delivery of drugs that have
an absorption window in a particular region of the gastrointestinal tract. These systems release the drug
content before reaching the absorption site and provide optimal bioavailability. Several approaches are
currently utilized to prolong gastric retention time. These include floating systems, polymeric
bioadhesive, and swelling and expanding systems. The objective of this study was to develop and
characterize gastroretentive floating matrix tablets from propranolol HCl.
Materials and methods: Propranolol floating matrix tablets, containing HPMC K15M or
Carbopol and gas-generating agent were prepared using direct compression method. The drug release
profile of tablets was evaluated based on USP method. The in vitro floating characteristics of these tablets
were studied in pH 1.2.
Results: The release rate decreased when the amount of polymer increased. The drug release also
increased in the presence of gas-generating agent. The results showed that tablets containing HPMC
had better floating properties than tablets containing Carbopol. Adding gas generating agent to
the formulations modified the floating properties of matrices.
Conclusion: These results proved the effect of polymers and floating agents on drug release
profile. The use of HPMC K15M and gas-generating agents can lead to suitable floating formulation of
propranolol HCl.

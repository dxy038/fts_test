Objective This study investigated the
frequency of episodes and subsyndromal symptoms
based on employment status in patients with bipolar
disorder. Methods Patients with bipolar disorder
(n = 281) provided daily self-reported mood ratings
for 5 months, returning 46,292 days of data. Data
were analyzed using three employment status
groups: disabled (n = 75), full-time employee or fulltime
student (n = 135), and other (n = 71). Demographic
characteristics were compared by employment
status. A univariate general linear model with
employment status and other demographic variables
as fixed factors and covariates was used to analyze
the percent of days in episodes and percent of days
with subsyndromal symptoms. Results While there
was no significant difference in the percent of days
in episodes among the employment groups, disabled
patients suffered subsyndromal symptoms of
depression twice as frequently as those in the fulltime
group. Disabled patients spent 15% more days
either in episodes or with subsyndromal symptoms
than those in the full-time group, equivalent to about
45 extra sick days a year. Conclusion Frequent
subsyndromal symptoms, especially depressive, may
preclude full-time responsibilities outside the home
and contribute to disability in bipolar disorder.
Additional treatments to reduce the frequency of
subsyndromal symptoms are needed

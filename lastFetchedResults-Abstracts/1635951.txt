The objective of this study is to investigate the use of ground palm oil fuel ash with high fineness (GPA) as a pozzolanic material to produce high-strength concrete. Samples were made by replacing Type I Portland cement with various proportions of GPA. Properties such as the compressive strength, drying shrinkage, water permeability, and sulfate resistance, were then investigated. After aging for 28 days, the compressive strengths of these concrete samples were found to be in the range of 59.5â€“64.3 MPa. At 90-day the compressive strength of concrete containing GPA 20% was as high as 70 MPa. The drying shrinkage and water permeability were lower than those of high-strength concrete made from Type I Portland cement. When the concrete samples were immersed in a 10% MgSO4 solution for 180 days, the sulfate resistance in terms of the expansion and loss of compressive strength was improved. The results indicated that GPA is a reactive pozzolanic material and can be used as a supplementary cementitious material for producing high-strength concrete.

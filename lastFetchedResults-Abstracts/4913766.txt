This paper presents IMS architecture resulting from SYSTERMIN@L, a project running from mid 2007 to mid 2009. The project addresses services and network convergence from the customer terminals point of view: ldquoselect all your services on the terminal wherever you are.rdquo The basic idea is to consider terminals interacting in a system configuration as opposed to independent standalone devices. The objective of the project is to specify and validate that concept with prototypes of next generation terminals.

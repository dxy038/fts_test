Cluster-based Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (CMWSN) has become promising research domain for researchers in the field of ICT. CMWSN has found its way directly into the real world applications only because of the availability of low-cost Sensor nodes. In the last decade, most of the researchers assumed WSN as a collection of homogeneous and stationary sensor nodes. Mobility and heterogeneity of the sensor nodes have imposed new research challenges and demand for new energy efficient solutions in order to increase network lifetime. In this paper, the authors offer a novel Heterogeneous Multi-Objective Hybrid Routing Algorithm (H-MOHRA) for MWSN. H-MOHRA uses hierarchical clustering. H-MOHRA routes the data packets to sink using a cost function based on many metrics such as Mean Energy Utilization, Control Overhead, Response Time, Connection Quality Measure, and HOPs. The authors study the impact of Energy heterogeneity and mobility of sensor nodes on H-MOHRA. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of H-MOHRA. H-MOHRA simulated and compared SHRP and DyMORA. H-MOHRA drops the Average Energy Consumption by 7.06% related with SHRP and 8.34% related to DyMORA. H-MOHRA outperforms SHRP and DyMORA in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) by 9.50% and 7.9% respectively.

Abiotic reduction of nitrobenzenes by Fe+2 adsorbed to various surfaces has been demonstrated by others. The objective of this study was to describe abiotic TNT transformation as a function of pH and confirm the possibility of an abiotic Fe+2 reduction pathway in reduced soils.Effects of pH on abiotic transformations of TNT were examined in buffered batch tests with montmorillonite and Fe+2. Results indicated that TNT was rapidly reduced under abiotic conditions, with the rate of reduction highest at pH 8. Mass balance experiments indicated that unextractable or unknown transformation products were produced. Suppression of the abiotic Fe+2 reduction mechanism in anaerobic soil by complexing Fe+2 with EDTA demonstrated the presence of the pathway in a soil.

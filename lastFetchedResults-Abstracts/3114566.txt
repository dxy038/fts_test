Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) has higher efficiency and lower emissions compared with the internal combustion engine vehicles. But, the fuel cell has a slow dynamic response. Therefore, a secondary power source is needed during start up and transient conditions. Ultracapacitor can be used as secondary power source. By using ultracapacitor as the secondary power source of the FCEV, the performance and efficiency of the overall system can be improved. In this system, there is a boost converter, which steps up the fuel cell voltage, and a bidirectional DC-DC converter, that couples the ultracapacitor to the dc bus. This paper proposes a new control method based on dynamic evolution control bidirectional DC-DC converter for interfacing ultracapacitor energy storage to a fuel cell system. The whole system with fuel cell model was simulated in Simulink for step change in load current.

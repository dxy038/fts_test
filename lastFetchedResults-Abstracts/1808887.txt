The main objective of this study was assessment of hormonal treatments effects on sperm quality improvement in Barbus sharpeyi. Results showed differences in effects of treatments with LHRHa2, LHRHa2 combined with a dopamine antagonist (MET), and CPE (Carp Pituitary Extract) on parameters of sperm volume, motility, spermatocrit, biochemical indices of seminal plasma and sperm efficiency on artificial propagation, incubation survival, and deformities. Biochemical analysis of seminal plasma showed that the majority of parameters were affected by different hormonal treatments. In conclusion, the highest sperm quality of Benni fish could be achieved by application of LHRHA2 (10 µg kg-1+MET), LHRHA2 (5 µg kg-1+MET) and LHRHA2 (5 µg kg-1) at 8, 12, and 16 hours PHS, respectively.

This paper considers the effects of some frequently used utility functions in portfolio selection by comparing the optimal investment outcomes corresponding to these utility functions. Assets are assumed to form a complete market of the Black–Scholes type. Under consideration are four frequently used utility functions: the power, logarithm, exponential and quadratic utility functions. To make objective comparisons, the optimal terminal wealths are derived by integration representation. The optimal strategies which yield optimal values are obtained by the integration representation of a Brownian martingale. The explicit strategy for the quadratic utility function is new. The strategies for other utility functions such as the power and the logarithm utility functions obtained this way coincide with known results obtained from Merton’s dynamic programming approach.

The problem of reconstructing the location, the shape, and the dielectric permittivity distribution of two-dimensional dielectric objects from measurements of the field scattered is addressed in this paper. The approach is based on the integral equations of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem. The numerical approach is developed in the spatial domain by using a multi-illumination multiview processing. In particular, the inverse problem is recast into a global nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved by a stochastic method based on a genetic algorithm. The final objective of the approach is the image reconstruction of highly contrasted bodies

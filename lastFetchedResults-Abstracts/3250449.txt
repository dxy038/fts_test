Carotid artery (CA) located on either sides of the neck supplying blood and oxygen to the brain, neck and face is more prone to `atherosclerosisÂ´. The main characteristics of the disease are formation of calcified plaques thereby narrowing down of the diameter of the vessel and hardening the arteries. These results in a deficit blood supply to vital organs like brain may leads to stroke. The objective of this study was to create patient specific CAD model of carotid artery with and without with plaque at internal carotid artery near bifurcation region. The CT image of CA of Indian male individual was analyzed using dedicated softwares. First, patient specific 3D model of right side CA was created using the image analysis by software (MIMICS, Materialse NV, Belgium). Secondly, geometry of different regions of the CA were measured from the CA model using a software (3-Matic, Materialse NV, Belgium). Finally, patient specific computer aided design (CAD) models of CA with and without plaque at ICA near bifurcation were created based on its measured geometrical values using software (CATIA, Dassault System, France). The created CAD models can be used to carry out computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies in future for studying hemodynamic properties of blood, and the obtained results would be useful for the surgeon to pre-plan surgery successfully to treat atherosclerotic condition.

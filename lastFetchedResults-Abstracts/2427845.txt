The use of solar energy has been adduced as an alternative way for generating electricity. This electricity is generated by solar panel but as temperature increases efficiency of panel decreases too. The main objective of this research paper is to minimize the use of the amount of water, electrical energy and required time needed for cooling of a solar panel. This paper discusses a new approach by acquiring water as a coolant for accomplishing Photovoltaic panels at their moderate temperature and limits it from overheating. It is the cheapest method to enhance the efficiency of the Photovoltaic panel in developing countries like India. This paper also analyses the material used in increasing the efficiency of PV panel.

Ovarian morphogenesis and physiology in mammals take place in the context of hormones, paracrine factors and extracellular matrix molecules. Both fibrillar type I collagen and the multidomain tenascin-C are matrix molecules capable of modulating the behavior of both normal and neoplastic cells in many organs. Therefore, the objective of this qualitative study was to simultaneously examine the distribution of both tenascin-C and type I collagen in ovarian follicles and corpora lutea induced to develop in response to gonadotropin treatments. In preantral follicles both matrix proteins were present in the focimatrix, theca externa and the interstitium. Equine gonadotropin induced the appearance of both proteins in the theca interna. Subsequent to administration with human chorionic gonadotropin, tenascin-C appearance in the thecal capillaries preceded type I collagen expression. Tenascin-C was also observed in the capillaries of functional and regressing corpora lutea, while type I collagen was predominantly present in the interstitium and tunica albuginea. Western blots showed both an increase in and degradation of tenascin-C in the regressing corpora lutea. The ovarian surface epithelium also showed immunoreactivity for both tenascin-C and type I collagen. The study reveals that tenascin-C and type I collagen may participate in the morphogenesis of ovarian follicles, and in the formation and regression of corpora lutea.

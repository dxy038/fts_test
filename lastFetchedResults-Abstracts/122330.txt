BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy at age 35 or older has increased in recent decades. Women over 35 years who postpone childbearing be faced with more special risks. This study was done to compare the pregnancy complications before and after the age of 35 years old. METHODS: This study was randomly performed on 200 cases of 20-34 years and 200 cases of 35 years and older in Babol Shahid Yahyanejad hospital during 2000. Frequency of hypertension, diabetes, cesarean section, hospital admission during pregnancy, placenta abruption and previa, congenital malformation and fetal death were compared in both groups. The data were statistically analyzed by Chi-square test.
FINDINGS: At the 20-34 age group, hypertention was (4%), low birth weight (10%), macrosomia (4.5%), preterm delivery (4.5%), post term pregnancy (4%), cesarean section (44%), placenta abruption (1.5%), intra uterine fetal death (1%), hospital admission (1%) and diabetes was not seen in this group. At age over 35, hypertention was (7.5%), diabetes (2.5%), low birth weigth (10%), macrosomia (11.5%), preterm delivery (12%), post term pregnancy (1.5%), cesarean section (60%), placenta abruption (1%), intra uterine fetal death (2%), hospital admission (2.5%), placenta previa and congenital malformation were not seen in both groups.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings, hypertention, diabetes, cesarean section, macrosomia, preterm delivery in pregnancies at age over 35 years in comparison with those under 35 years was more. There was not a statistically significant difference between two groups in hospital admission, placenta abruption, still birth, post term pregnancy and low birth weight.

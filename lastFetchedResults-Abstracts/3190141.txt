This paper describes a data collection distributed platform composed of various high interaction honeypots deployed in different locations, along with our first analyses of this data. This deployment follows a previous experiment conducted with the same honeypot that was deployed at a single location (cf. [1]). The objective is to check if the results of our first experiment can be generalized.

Bidirectional errorfree 140 Mbit/s OQPSK-signal transmission with optically generated microwaves in the 18-19 GHz-band is reported. Two microwave carriers one for the radio link to the mobile receiver (down link) and one for the uplink-microwave mixer in the base station are generated by a simple optical upconversion technique.

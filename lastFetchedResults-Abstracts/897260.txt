Introduction: Statistics indicate increase of HIV/AIDS incidence in Iranian youth. Knowledge and high risk behavior assessment in youth is important in preventive planning of HIV/AIDS. 
Objective:  Present study aimed to determine knowledge and frequency of  high risk behaviors  about HIV/AIDS among newly accepted students at Tehran University in 2009 in order to use study findings in designing preventive educational programs on AIDS. 
Methods: A total of 664 students from 12 faculties of Tehran University were chosen using random stratified systematic sampling. Data collection instrument consisted of 29 questions regarding transmission and prevention and high risk behaviors of this disease. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (tables, central criteria and frquency) and analytical tests (Chi-square).
Results: Based on findings  92% of them reported their knowledge level regarding AIDS as satisfactory and about 71.1% of them identified themselves to be at low risk of HIV/AIDS. The most previous information source was media including television and publications ( 93.1% and 82% respectively).  However more than 20% of students had high risk behavior towards HIV/AIDS and almost 45.6% didn't have satisfactory knowledge on ways of HIV/AIDS transmision. In addition there was a significant relationship between knowledge level and age and field of study (p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: Considering the results, students had appropraite knowledge level on HIV/AIDs  but they are unware of STDs and preventive behaviors. In addiation, many of students had high risk behavior toward HIV/AIDs. It is recommended to implement university STDs and HIV/AIDs educational programs by emphasizing  preventive behaviors  for newly entered  students.

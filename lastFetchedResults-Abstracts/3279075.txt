This paper deals with actuator fault tolerant tracking controller design for a vehicle lateral dynamics represented by the uncertain Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The main idea is based on the use of a Proportional Integer Observer (PIO) to estimate both constant faults and faulty system states combined to the descriptor redundancy property. The objective of this approach is to synthesize a Fault Tolerant Controller (FTC) ensuring trajectory tracking of a desired reference vehicle model. To take account variation of tire slip angles, the case of unmeasurable premise variables is considered and a solution is then proposed in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Nowadays, the CRT display devices are rapidly substituted for LCD display devices. In LCD panel production, the inspection process relies on human vision. So, the results of inspection is likely to be subjective. Therefore, we need the automated inspection system for LCD devices by obtaining objective decision level. In this paper, we propose an efficient automated inspection algorithm using polynomial approximation and optimal thresholding technique. The experimental result shows us that our proposed system can have enough performance for substitution of human inspectors.

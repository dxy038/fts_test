Two methods of the multi-objective design optimization of switched reluctance motor with 8 stator and 14 rotor poles (SRM 8/14) are compared in this paper. The first optimization method is based on using the results of Two-Dimensional Finite Element Method (2D FEM) parametric analysis of SRM 8/14. Augmented Lagrangian Genetic Algorithm (ALGA) and 2D FEM are coupled in the second optimization process. The optimization objectives are to minimize torque ripple and maximize average steady-state torque, torque factor, torque quality factor, torque density and losses factor. The optimization variables are the stator and rotor poles arc angles, the taper angles of the stator and rotor poles, stator yoke radius, rotor yoke radius, and stator coil height.

The main objective of this work is to present an exploration of potential applications of online trained neural networks. In particular the work contains computer simulation results obtained from: implementing an internal model neural network-based control scheme, and a model reference neural network-based adaptive control scheme. The design of the online learning algorithm used to adapt the neural networks weights is based on the theory of continuous-time variable structure control systems. Both the selection of the neural network adaptation gain and the parameters of the low-pass filter involved in the scheme have been selected by trial and error. Only stable open-loop systems have been studied

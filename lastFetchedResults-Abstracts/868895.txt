This paper considers a two-machine flowshop group scheduling problem. The jobs are classified into groups and the jobs in the same group must be processed in succession. Each group requires a set up time and removal time on both machines. A transportation time is required for moving the jobs from machine 1 to machine 2. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). A polynomial time algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. This generalizes the algorithms proposed by Baker and others.

Objective
Hyperextension of the big toe is described here as a simple and reliable sign to 
predict undercorrection of cavus deformity of clubfoot in the Ponseti Method.
Materials & Methods
This retrospective study was conducted on children with clubfoot who were 
treated successfully by Ponseti Method in the King Fahad Hospital, Saudi Arabia, 
and Emam Reza Hospital, Mashad, Iran, from 2003 through 2008. The total 
number of the patients in our study was 191, with 306 affected feet. Of them, 
115 children had bilateral clubfeet (230 feet) and 76 had unilateral clubfoot. 
There were 119 males and 72 females. Hyperextension of the big toe at MTPJ 
was present in five cases of clubfoot. The average follow-up period was 20
months (range: 8-38 months).
Results
The authors observed that hyperextension of big toe at MTPJ had a linear 
relationship with the severity of cavus deformity of clubfoot. On the other hand, 
the big toe had a normal relationship with other toes after satisfactory treatment 
of the initial or relapsed cavus deformity by Ponseti Method.
Conclusions
Hyperextension of the big toe at MTPJ can be regarded as a reliable prognostic 
sign for detecting the severity, correction, and the number of castings needed 
for cavus deformity correction in clubfoot treatment in the Ponseti Method.

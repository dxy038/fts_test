Compared with the conventional Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), the Plug-in HEV (PHEV) has the battery with higher capacity, which could be charged from power grid. It brings the importance for battery charge and discharge technique. In the paper, a bidirectional battery energy controller for the PHEV is introduced, which could not only charge the battery efficiently, but also discharge the battery and transfer the energy to the power grid. The system controls the charging voltage and charging current based on the direct current control strategy and intelligent Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller. Through this way, the system could charge the battery from constant current charge mode to constant voltage charge mode smoothly. The simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of system.

Objective: The feasibility of early diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma was studied by least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) and fuzzy rule-building expert system (FuRES) that classified near infrared (NIR) spectra of tissues. Methods: NIR spectra of 77 specimens of endometrium were collected. The spectra were pretreated by principal component orthogonal signal correction (PC-OSC) and direct orthogonal signal correction (DOSC) methods to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and remove the influences of background and baseline. The effects of modeling parameters were investigated using bootstrapped Latin-partition methods. Results: The optimal LS-SVM model of the PC-OSC pretreatment method successfully classified the samples with prediction accuracies of 96.8 Â± 1.4%. Conclusions: The proposed procedure proved to be rapid and convenient, which is suitable to be developed as a non-invasive diagnosis method for cancer tissue.

Among the wide range of substances discharged continuously in the environment, alkylphenols became a major focus of environmental research in the last decades, as it was found that they possess endocrine disrupting properties. Knowledge about the occurrence and levels of alkylphenols in environment is critical for the risk assessment of these compounds on both ecosystem and human health. However, the analysis of traces of alkylphenols in environmental matrices is a very difficult task, and the suitable methods involve generally an extraction followed by an extensive sample clean-up before detection, steps often time-consuming and costly.

er to reduce the analysis time, obtain a high throughput of analysis and thus improve work efficiency, the objective of the present study is to investigate the use of immunochemical technique (ELISA) for the determination of nonylphenol and octylphenol in soils and various kinds of water. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the determination of alkylphenols in soil using immunoassay technique is described. A methodology is developed, based on the combination of a single preparation step and the use of a simply ELISA kit. The performances of the method are compared with LC–MS/MS, considered as reference. The developed procedure offers the sensitivity and selectivity necessary for the detection of the target alkylphenols in the ng/g or ng/L range, and is successfully applied to the analysis of several samples. Results indicate that alkylphenols are quantified with concentrations in the same order than LC–MS/MS, meaning that ELISA may be useful not only in screening the samples and get a positive/negative response, but also it allows a good approximation of the concentrations.

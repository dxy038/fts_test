The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on neutrophilic functions and as an antioxidant. NAC, 600 mg daily, given orally to healthy individuals for a period of 2 weeks, affected some functions of human neutrophilic granulocytes when tested in vitro. NAC treatment caused a decrease in the production of superoxide anions by stimulated neutrophils and the improvement of their phagccytic capacity although it did not affect their random or chemotactic migration. The level of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) in thrombocytes of the NAC-treated individuals was increased in comparison with the activity before treatment. These results suggest that NAC might act as a scavenger of oxygen-derived free radicals released by stimulated neutrophils and thereby protect the tissue against the radical caused injury as well as optimize phagocytosis

The main objective of this research is to find the optimal design point of the proposed solar receiver concept to heat up compressed air. Within a tubular receiver made of stainless steel, a porous medium is filled to enhance the heat transfer via the large contact area and thereby to increase the system efficiency. Due to the low melting point associated with the selected material, a numerical simulation is conducted to pre-evaluate the effects of various controlling parameters on the maximum temperature and pressure loss of the system. The design factors expected to influence the system performance were the length, porosity, and thermal conductivity of the porous medium as well as the number of inlet pipes. The effect of each variable on the maximum temperature and pressure drop of the system is numerically investigated and the optimal design point is selected. The results of this study offer a valuable design guideline for future manufacturing processes.

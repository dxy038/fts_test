The objective of this research work is to study thermodynamic behaviour of activated carbon from sewage sludge with gatifloxacin. The activated carbons we reproduced from exclusive sewage sludge by chemical -physics methods using ZnCl2 as modifier. Study results on the adsorption isotherm equations and adsorption thermodynamics at different temperatures show that (1)The interaction pattern of gatifloxacin was temperature-depandent Freundlich isotherm, the adsorption included physical process and chemical process together, mainly a physical adsorption process. (2) The adsorption is endothermic process and the adsorption is strength as temperature raise.(3) The adsorption enthalpy values is gradually smaller, the more is close to saturated, the less is the increase of adsorption, the smaller is making the adsorption heat.

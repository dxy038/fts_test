Blocking effect is the major drawback in DCT-based (discrete cosine transformation) codecs at low bit-rates. In this paper, a post-processing filter is proposed in DCT frequency domain. The proposed algorithm uses a shift block within four adjacent DCT blocks to reduce computational complexity. By slightly modifying several DCT coefficients in the shift block, the artifacts that result from quantization and dequantization process are alleviated. The simulation results show that both visual perception and objective image quality are improved noticeably.

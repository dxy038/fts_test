This paper presents the development of web logistics system to collect products, whose objective to minimize the transport cost and finding the best routes and represent them graphically on a map. The routing problem studied in this paper uses vehicle capacity constraints, time windows and dynamic constraints based on the domain model of the system. The method proposed of resolution was genetic algorithm, which is widely used in complex problems of combinatorial explosion. The results show that the system is efficient to find good route and the model is flexible the restrictions imposed the problem and future.

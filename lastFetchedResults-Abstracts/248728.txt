This paper proposes an e¦cient, systematic and generalized multicriteria fuzzy optimum design method for
the structural systems, using the suboptimization concept, introduction of measure membership functions
and fuzzy decision-making techniques. Each objective function is suboptimized Þrst for all discrete sets of
common design variables and design parameters. In order to make the relative evaluation of suboptimized
data of objective functions rationally and systematically, and involve the fuzziness or tolerance in the
decision-making process and design emphases, the measure membership functions are introduced for all
objective functions. The membership functions of the suboptimized objective functions are determined
systematically using the corresponding measure membership functions as datum. A hybrid decision-making
process is developed combining the weighted operator method, comparison processes of maximum membership
values and backward interpolation processes for the determination of the global optimum solution. The
weighted operator method can also involve the relative emphases of each objective function simply. A design
example of a practical prestressed concrete bridge system, in which the total expected cost after an
earthquake and the aesthetics of the bridge system are the primary objectives, clariÞes the applicability to
any convex and non-convex design problems, rationality, systematic design process and e¦ciency of the
proposed design method

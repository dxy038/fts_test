We address the problem of Bayesian image reconstruction
with a prior that captures the notion of a clustered intensity
histogram. The problem is formulated in the framework
of a joint-MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation with the prior
pdf modeled as a mixture-of-gammas density. This prior pdf has
appealing properties, including positivity enforcement. The joint
MAP optimization is carried out as an iterative alternating descent
wherein a regularized likelihood estimate is followed by a mixture
decomposition of the histogram of the current tomographic image
estimate. The mixture decomposition step estimates the hyperparameters
of the prior pdf. The objective functions associated with
the jointMAPestimation are complicated and difficult to optimize,
but we show how they may be transformed to allow for much easier
optimization while preserving the fixed point of the iterations. We
demonstrate the method in the context of medical emission and
transmission tomography.

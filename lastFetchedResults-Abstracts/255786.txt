Fibre-reinforced cements are of potential value in geothermal well cementing jobs due to
their ability to withstand higher tensile stresses than conventional cements. Screening tests
were performed to evaluate different fibre types with the objective of identifying systems
offering the greatest improvement in cement tensile strength. The fibres investigated included
steel, stainless steel, carbon, basalt and glass. The baseline cement matrix was standard Class
G cement/40% silica flour and variations on this were latex-modification and lightweight
formulations incorporating either perlite or microspheres. The fibres that showed the best
performance at low volume fraction were 13 mm brass-coated round steel fibres. Steel and
carbon microfibres also improved the tensile strength provided the volume fraction was high
enough. Thermal and hydraulic properties of cements reinforced with steel fibres were measured
and compared with unreinforced mixes. Based on the results, selected fibre types will be
used in further property characterization studies and engineering analysis of geothermal wells
completed with fibre-reinforced materials.

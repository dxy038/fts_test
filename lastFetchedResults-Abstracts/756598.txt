Objective
To evaluate the epidemiology and status of atrial fibrillation in China.
Methods

Retrospective analysis of hospital records of patients with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, discharged between January 1999 and December 2001.
Results

Data were analysed from 9297 patients (mean age 65.5 years) from 41 hospitals in mainland China. During the period studied, atrial fibrillation admissions (mean 7.9%) increased as a proportion of cardiovascular admissions. The distribution of atrial fibrillation increased with age. Causes and associated conditions were advanced age (58.1%), hypertension (40.3%), coronary heart disease (34.8%), heart failure (33.1%), rheumatic valvular disease (23.9%), idiopathic atrial fibrillation (7.4%), cardiomyopathy (5.4%) and diabetes (4.1%). Permanent atrial fibrillation accounted for almost half of the patients (49.5%), and paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation the remainder (33.7% and 16.7%, respectively). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was treated mainly by rhythm control (56.4%). In 82.8% of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, a rate-control strategy was used. The prevalence of stroke was 17.5%. In non-valvular atrial fibrillation, risk factors associated with stroke included advanced age, history of hypertension, coronary heart disease and type of atrial fibrillation. A total of 64.5% of patients received antithrombotic therapy, predominantly with antiplatelet agents. Patients managed with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs had a significantly lower stroke rate than those receiving neither treatment, but there was no significant difference between antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents.
Conclusion

Most of the atrial fibrillation-related epidemiological factors in this population were similar to those reported in other countries. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment both reduced stroke rate significantly.

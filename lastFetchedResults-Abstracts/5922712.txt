Nowadays, in the fast changing phase of technology many countries have used photovoltaic (PV) to generate energy. PV modules are very versatile and easily fixed on the top of buildings, residential areas, and other structures. PV capable to produce a clean energy and it can be fixed up at location where the system grid not available. However, for producing optimum energy, PV modules must be mounted with correct PV direction and angle. The objective of this paper is to find out the correlation between difference PV angle and PV direction for maximum energy generation. The data have been collected through out a day. The measurement results on difference angles and direction of PV show that the voltage generates are quite similar. However the PV modules direct to north and south produced more power compared to east and west. The result of data collection is suitable for application in the Malaysia and similar environment.

This paper proposes a unique topology of voltage fed high frequency series load resonant inverter with an edge resonant lossless snubbing capacitor and an auxiliary switch cell for induction heating appliances. The main objective of this paper is to present a modification of previously developed ZVS PWM high frequency inverter circuit along with its unique features. The operation principle of the proposed inverter circuit is based upon asymmetrical duty cycle PWM control scheme. The steady state operating principle of the high frequency resonant inverter treated here is illustrated by using periodic switching mode equivalent circuits. The operating performances of high-frequency AC regulation and power conversion efficiency characteristics are discussed from a computer aided simulation and an experimental point of view together with soft-switching operating ranges.

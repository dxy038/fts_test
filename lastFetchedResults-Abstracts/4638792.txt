With ever-increasing demand of electricity consumption and increasing open access particularly in restructured environment, transmission line congestion is quite frequent. For alleviating congestion, proper locations of DG are important. This paper focuses a comparative study between a novel bus reduction approach and modified load flow with optimization for determination of the optimal placement of single distributed generator in power systems. The objective of optimal placement of DG is aimed at &#194;&#191;reduction in power losses&#194;&#191;. The two approaches are tested on IEEE 6 bus, IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 30 bus test systems and verified by Power World Simulator software. The voltage profile of the whole system after placement of DG at optimal location is also focused here.

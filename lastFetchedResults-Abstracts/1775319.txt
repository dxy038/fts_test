The interference of a chronic disease on the aging process reduces patients efficiency in confronting everyday life events and their Quality of Life (QOL). The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction between cognitive problems and emotional difficulties as related to several chronic diseases commonly present among aged patients in contributing to their QOL reduction. Diseases considered were: chronic cerebro-vascular disorders non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Memory characteristics and subjective evaluation of several areas of daily living where problems could be present were assessed. Severity of cognitive and behavioral deterioration emerged as a major component independent from type of disease, contributing to reduction of QOL. Disease type determined the different risk of presence of an objective reduction of memory efficiency. The QOL of aged patients was identified as a multidimensional array of different components among which cognitive deterioration assumes a primary role. These results, together with analogous findings from previous studies, underline the importance of considering cognitive efficiency in aged patients even with chronic diseases not directly affecting CNS in order to evaluate their needs.

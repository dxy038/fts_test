Porous calcium–silicate–hydrate was synthesized and used to recover phosphorus from wastewater. The principal objective of this study was to explore the phosphorus recovery performance of porous calcium–silicate–hydrate prepared by different Ca/Si molar ratios. Phosphorus recovery mechanism was also investigated via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy Dispersive Spectrum (EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The law of Ca2+ release was the key of phosphorus recovery performance. Different Ca/Si molar ratios resulted in the changes of pore structures. The increase of specific surface area and the increase in concentration of Ca2+ release were well agreement together. The Ca/Si molar ratio of 1.6 for porous calcium–silicate–hydrate is more proper to recover phosphorus. The pore structure of porous calcium–silicate–hydrate provided a local condition to maintain a high concentration of Ca2+ release. Porous calcium–silicate–hydrate could release a proper concentration of Ca2+ and OH− to maintain the pH values at 8.5–9.5. This condition was beneficial to the formation of hydroxyapatite. Phosphorus content of porous calcium–silicate–hydrate reached 18.64% after phosphorus recovery.

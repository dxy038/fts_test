Objective
We examined the relationship between periodontal disease and different types of diabetes in pregnant and nonpregnant women.
Study design
This study was based on the data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), including 256 pregnant and 4234 nonpregnant women. Women were classified into those with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in current pregnancy, with GDM in previous pregnancy, and with type 1 or 2 diabetes.
Results
In pregnant women, the prevalence of periodontitis was 44.8% in women with GDM and 13.2% in nondiabetic women, with adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 9.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-74.9). In nonpregnant women, the prevalence of periodontitis was 40.3% in women with type 1 or 2 diabetes, 25.0% in women with previous history of GDM, and 13.9% in nondiabetic women, with aOR of 2.76 (1.03-7.35) for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes.
Conclusion
We found an association between periodontal disease and GDM.

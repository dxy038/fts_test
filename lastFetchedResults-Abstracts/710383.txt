Study Objective: To compare the outcomes of women aged 15â€“21 yr to those of older women in a multicenter case series of early medical abortion.
Design, Setting, Participants: We enrolled 1973 women at 34 outpatient Planned Parenthood sites in a case series for medical abortion in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. We used methotrexate (50 mg/m2) and misoprostol (800 mg vaginally, repeated as needed). We compared women who started the abortion prior to their 22nd birthday to older women. Outcomes of abortion were classified as documented or presumed complete medical abortion, and documented or presumed suction curettage. During the first half of the study, we did an exit interview assessing patient satisfaction.
Results: A total of 330 women were under 22 yr and 1641 women over 21 yr. Younger women presented for abortion at the same gestational ages. Overall, younger women had a higher rate of complete medical abortion than did older women (89.4% vs 83%). However, the multiple regression model demonstrated a significant adverse effect of prior live birth (P = 0.006), but not patient age, on outcome. Younger women were less likely to have had prior live births. Younger women were more likely to return for follow-up (96.4% vs 92.9%); the regression model demonstrated a significant effect (P = 0.001) of prior birth on rates of follow-up. Side effects and satisfaction were similar for older and younger women.
Conclusions: Younger women having medical abortion with methotrexate and misoprostol have better outcomes and similar satisfaction levels as do older women

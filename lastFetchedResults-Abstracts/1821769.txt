Objective
rpose of the study was to investigate whether dentine irradiation with a pulsed CO2 laser (10.6 μm) emitting pulses of 10 ms is capable of reducing dentine calcium and phosphorus losses in an artificial caries model.

 dentine slabs obtained from bovine teeth were randomly divided into six groups (n = 15): negative control group (GC); positive control group, treated with fluoride 1.23% (GF); and laser groups irradiated with 8 J/cm2 (L8); irradiated as in L8 + fluoride 1.23% (L8F); irradiated with 11 J/cm2 (L11); irradiated as in L11 + fluoride 1.23% (L11F). After laser irradiation the samples were submitted to a pH-cycling model for 9 days. The calcium and phosphorous contents in the de- and remineralization solutions were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer – ICP-OES. Additionally intrapulpal temperature measurements were performed. The obtained data were analysed by means of ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05).
s
 demineralization solutions the groups L11F and GF presented significantly lower means of calcium and phosphorous losses than the control group; and in L11F means were significantly lower than in the fluoride group. Both irradiation parameters tested caused intrapulpal temperature increase below 2 °C.
sion
 be concluded that under the conditions of this study, CO2 laser irradiation (10.6 μm) with 11 J/cm2 (540 mJ and 10 Hz) of fluoride treated dentine surfaces decreases the loss of calcium and phosphorous in the demineralization process and does not cause excessive temperature increase inside the pulp chamber.

Objective
 oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors are reported to protect against the local tissue damage in gingivitis and periodontal disease by reducing nitroxidative stress during inflammation, but their systemic effects are not well investigated.

hibitors systemic effects were investigated in a murine chronic oral inoculation model using live Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 (0.3 ml; 109 cfu/ml) or sterile broth (0.3 ml). Organ nitric oxide (NO) and plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx) were determined in mice treated with non-selective NOS inhibitor l-NAME (50 mg/kg/24 h i.p.) or selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W (10 mg/kg/6 h i.p.) for the last 5 days of the experiment. Differences between groups were evaluated by nonparametric Wilcoxon's rank-sum one-sided two-sample test and the results compared to those obtained from sham-treated (sterile broth) sham-inoculated animals (water for injection i.p./6 h).
s
ed ingestion of P. gingivalis resulted in generalized production of NO in organs and NOx in plasma, the levels of both typically being reduced in P. gingivalis-inoculated-1400W-treated mice, whilst the use of l-NAME was largerly ineffective, even promoting NO/NOx formation. Application of either inhibitor to sham-inoculated animals enhanced NO/NOx formation, due only in part to the repeated i.p. injections.
sions
stemic use of 1400W or l-NAME differently affects systemic nitric oxide formation in mice orally challenged with P. gingivalis, but the sequelae of such an intervention should be evaluated further.

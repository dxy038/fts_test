The physical properties of TiO2 nanomaterials are determined quantitatively using a method that combines imaging by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with semi-automatic particle detection and analysis. The method is applied on four powdered TiO2 nanomaterials, NM-102, NM-103, NM-104 and NM-105, dispersed in distilled water.

ative analysis shows that the stability and polydispersity of the dispersed nanomaterials are influenced by the material from which the vial used for dispersion, is made. In glass vials, the uncoated nanomaterials, NM-102 and NM-105, precipitate immediately after sonication, while the coated nanomaterials, NM-103 and NM-104, remain stable in dispersion. In polypropylene vials, stable dispersions are obtained for all nanomaterials. It is shown that the vial material alters the pH of the dispersions, which in turn influences the agglomeration state of the nanomaterials.

tative analysis of stable dispersions, based on TEM imaging combined with semi-automatic image analysis, results in number-based distributions of characteristic parameters, measuring the size, shape and surface topology of the unbound, aggregated and agglomerated TiO2 particles. Iterative curve fitting is applied to the number-based distributions of selected parameters and allows objective comparison of the distributions based on the properties of the fitted curves. Using this method, it is shown that the size, the shape and the surface properties of NM-102 and NM-105 and of the coated nanomaterials, NM-103 and NM-104, are significantly different. The physical characteristics of NM-103 and NM-104 are similar. This supports the validity of the method as these are in fact the same material with a different coating.

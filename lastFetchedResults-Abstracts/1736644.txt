Objective
jective of the present study was to investigate if arsenate V exposure results in glutathione efflux from human erythrocytes.
ure
anges in intracellular and extracellular nonprotein sulfhydryl and glutathione levels were determined in arsenate (V) exposed erythrocytes. Presence of any cellular membrane damage was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase activity measurement in the supernatant.
s
rythrocytes were exposed to 10 mM of arsenate (V) for 4 h, the intracellular NPSH level decreased to 0.28 ± 0025 μmol/ml erythrocyte. In contrast, extracellular nonprotein thiol level was increased to 0.180 ± 0.010 μmol/ml erythrocyte in 4 h. Extracellular glutathione levels reached to 0.028 ± 0.001, 0.052 ± 0.002, and 0.054 ± 0.004 μmol/ml erythrocyte with 1, 5, and 10 mM of arsenate (V), respectively. Utilization of MK571 a multi drug resistance-associated protein 1 inhibitor decreased the rate of glutathione efflux from erythrocytes suggesting a role for this membrane transporter in the process.
sion
sults of the present study indicate that erythrocytes efflux glutathione when exposed to arsenate (V).

For at least a decade or more, multimedia developers have taken for granted, that each generation of microprocessors would lead them to modify their application, in order make them run substantially faster. This so-called ´free´ ride seems to be coming to an end, with results in increased clock speeds, the widening of the gap in processor and memory performance, and the tradeoffs that are needed to meet the former two points. In this paper, we propose a ubiquitous multicore (UM) design, in order to speed up computations and allow real-time multimedia. To accomplish this objective, we separate out the different multimedia and place them on their own separate core processors. For example, a manager trains his/her staff on security, by utilizing different multimedia. For example, showing a visual documentary on security which asks staff members questions, records their answers and updates the manager in real-time. As our experiments show, our UM system increases performance speeds at an average of 100%, with the average execution cost of 1.4 ms, which shows multimedia resources are being used more efficiently and effectively.

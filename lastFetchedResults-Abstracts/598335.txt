The main objective of the study is to examine the determinants of household's food security in Pakistan using a logistic regression procedure. The analysis is based on micro data taken from Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement Survey (PSLM) 2007-08. Five main variables were used out of other demographic indicators that can affect food security. These include: place of residence, dependency ratio, social capital, employment status and educational attainment level of the head of household. Three factors were found to be significant and had expected signs. The analysis found that place of residence (Urban) has a significant and negative effect on household's food security status. Dependency ratio has a significant impact on food security and has expected sign that is, negative. Educational attainment level of household's head beyond intermediate level has also significant and positive impact on food security status of household. While social capital and employment do not effect household's food security significantly. Different policies and programmes are needed to address these characteristics using a direct yet incorporated approach.

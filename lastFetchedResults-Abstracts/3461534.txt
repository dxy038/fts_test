This paper presents a method for designing optimal passive and active shields for axisymmetric induction heaters. Such shields are needed to protect human operators and external electronic equipment from stray magnetic fields. The method uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize an objective function. This function reduces the magnetic field in the target area, the power dissipation in the active and passive shields, and the influence of the shields on the heating process. The GA returns the position and height of the passive shield, the optimal current for the active shield, and the number of turns of all coils. The paper describes two optimization modes: 1) optimization of only the active shield with fixed passive shield and 2) global optimization of both active and passive shields. Several passive shields are studied: electrically conductive shields and both electrically and magnetically conductive shields. The field reduction depends on the optimization mode and the passive shield properties, but always exceeds 25 dB for combined active and passive shields. Finally, the paper compares the results of the simulations to experimental measurements.

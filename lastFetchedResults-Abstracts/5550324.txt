Series compensation technology can improve a transmission capacity and system stability of long-distance transmission lines. The objective of this paper is to design a test circuit for a 1100kV Ultra high voltage alternating-current series capacitor by-pass switch. In order to test the performance of the ultra high voltage Series Capacitor with by-pass switch, The author proposed according to IEC62271-109 and two circuits were used for type test of 1100 kV by-pass making current and insertion current test circuits.

This paper presents the results of a survey of the ethical attitudes of information systems (IS) professionals conducted during 1998. Surveys of attitudes reported in the literature are outlined, then the research objective and methodology are described and the main findings are discussed. While the survey indicated a high level of ethical awareness among respondents, it also highlighted a number of problematical areas, tending to confirm the findings of previous surveys. Finally, suggestions for further research in this area are made.

Background and Objective: There are different personality variables such as happiness and self-efficacy that can influence on academic achievement of students. The aim of the study was to investigate relationships among these variables, academic achievement, and some demographics. 
Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed on 180 students from Baqiyatallah university of Medical Sciences. The sample was selected using systematic random sampling method.A  demographic questionnaire along with Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI) and General Self-efficacy Scale (GSE) were used to collect data from students. Academic achievement was determined by the mean of grade point averages from two last semesters. Analyses were performed using student t-test, one way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation tests. All statistical analyses were executed by SPSS for windows version 20. 
Results: The mean standard score of happiness was 4.36 (SD=0.58) and the mean total score of self-efficacy was 61.60 (SD=9.09). The mean of grade point averages of two last semesters was 15.41 (SD=1.81).  Factors such as marital status, age, academic grades and disciplines as well as academic achievement were related to happiness significantly. Similarly, marital status, age, academic grade and academic achievement were also related to self-efficacy. In addition, positive correlations were found between the main variables of the study, i.e. happiness, self-efficacy and academic achievement.  
Conclusion: Happiness and self-efficacy were related to various demographic and academic factors. Identifying and modifying these factors can lead to improvement of mental function and health among medical sciences students. Therefore, doing more studies to better understand such factors toward enhancement of education is suggested.

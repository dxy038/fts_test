This paper examines the ability of standard
economic factors to explain the growth of real
house prices in Australiaâ€™s capital cities. Dynamic
models are estimated for each city with
the objective of identifying the major drivers of
house price growth rates. The variable mortgage
rate is found to be an important influence
on growth rates in all eight capital cities. However,
the size of the mortgage rate effect can
differ substantially between cities. For example
a 25 basis point rise in the mortgage rate
reduces the long-run quarterly growth rate of
real house prices by about 1 per cent in Sydney
compared with only 0.4 per cent in Adelaide.
The effects of other economic variables are less
systematic, significantly affecting the growth
rate of capital gains in some cities but not in
others. Nevertheless, for most Australian cities
economic factors are found to explain around
40 to 60 per cent of the variation in the growth
rate of house prices.

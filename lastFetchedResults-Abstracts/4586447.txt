Practical methods and strategies for implementing and using h-p adaptive finite element analysis, for electromagnetic device modeling and simulation, in large scale parallel computing environments are developed and investigated. The primary focus of this research is to explore and evaluate the theory and practice of developing and exploiting advanced adaptive techniques within supercomputing range parallel processing systems. The essential objective of this contribution is to assess the potential advantages and related costs of employing broad-breadth and deep multilevel refinement trajectory trees with self-adjusting pruning strategies, for expediting h-p adaptive solution convergence, and to facilitate the assessment of solution integrity, stability and accuracy. The CLUMEQ Supercomputer Centre at McGill was used for all large scale computations; process management was handled using MPI

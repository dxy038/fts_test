Effective personal dietary guidelines are essential for health management and preventing chronic diseases. The objective of this research is to achieve nutrient-balanced food recommendations for each individual, while considering individualÂ´s requirements at the same time. To reach this goal, we developed a location-aware interactive diet consultant named SmartDiet based on the multi-objective optimization. The proposed personalized diet planning approach not only translates nutrient recommendations into realistic dish choices, but also accepts feedbacks from users to fine-tune their meal plans. The results showed that daily nutrition needs can be fulfilled by the designated meals, and the interactive diet planning scheme helps a user adjust the plan in an easier way. The guidelines generated by SmartDiet are expected to potentially improve the overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases of individuals.

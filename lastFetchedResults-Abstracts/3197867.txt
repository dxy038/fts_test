Infrastructure protection [1] has become obvious that the successful use of unmanned aerial vehicles is now a requirement in homeland security. The success lies with the fact that these vehicles collect and process data, gather intelligence, and execute commands with feedbacks. The feedbacks are sent to different platforms for further analysis, which reveals that the infusion of such technology into homeland security management is a strong statement of needs and purpose. To meet the challenges posed by technology modeling in homeland security, a mission that measures or countermeasures terror plots must deploy a vehicle of a transportation system against the target-and-delivery systems (TADS) terrorists use in plotting and reaching their targets. This paper examined threats and counter responsibilities that require the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The objective is to identify domestic/international threats and special missions of UAVs that measures or counter-measures defined threats, without collateral loss or compromise of the safety and privacy of the general public. The result restricted UAVsÂ´ special missions to border counties if/when necessary. Acknowledgement: This material is based upon work supported by the US.

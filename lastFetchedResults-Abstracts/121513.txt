Objective(s): To investigate health-related quality of life among an elderly population in Tehran, Iran and to study its relationship to co-morbidity and demographic variables.
Methods: Using a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling method, a sample of people aged 60 years old and over was studied. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Iranian version of The Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). Data on co-morbidity were collected for both short-term and chronic diseases. The latter included hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancers, neurological disorders, respiratory diseases and low back pain.
Results In all, 396 individuals were interviewed. The mean age was 67.9 (SD-+9.6) years, most were married (80 %) and the mean duration of their formal education was 5.3 years. The results showed significant gender differences in all quality of life dimensions and for both short-term and long-standing diseases (P values ranging from 0.008 to<0.001). Also, it was found that demographic variables including age, employment status, marital status and educational level were significantly associated with most quality of life dimensions.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that health-related quality of life in elderly people is highly dependent on both co-morbidity and demographic variables. Indeed, establishing effective geriatric health services for this vulnerable age group is essential.

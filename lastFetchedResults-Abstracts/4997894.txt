This paper describes a unifying data management concept for feedback assistance systems. The assistance system is to be integrated into existing system scenery. During the use of a hydraulic system, objective feedback such as sensor data or service data is captured and managed in local databases by the machine operators. The aim is to lead such Product Use Information (PUI) back into product development. That way, the product developer uses the information to derive additional and innovative potential to improve next generation products. The information flow is related in various systems i.e. the operator of the machine and the manufacturer. Furthermore, the PUI is managed inside the assistance system based on a data warehouse. The data warehouse is coupled with a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, a well-known system to product developers. Within the PLM system, product master data is created and managed. This also serves as the basis for the assistance system, so that the data models for both systems have to be amalgamated.

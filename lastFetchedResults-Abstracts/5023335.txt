The European network for test education described in this paper addresses the shortage of skills in mixed-signal production testing by encouraging students at pre- and post-doctoral levels to attend innovative training courses in the field. The objective of the present educational experience is to strengthen in the critical field of mixed-signal testing leading educational centres in Europe, with the active support and guidance of industry. The project is an expansion of the successful French experience of CRTC which allows any distant student to have a remote access to a unique test resource centre equipped with up-to-date/high-tech test facilities

Having adopted experiment analysis means for Lute instrument ´flipping´ method, this paper has complied lute acoustic analysis procedures by MATLAB for extracting 26 ´flipping´ parameters such as duration, energy, spectrum, etc. It gained that: 1) with the reduction on pitch, the duration of sound becomes successively longer and the energy reducing speed is lower; 2) it has also proposed four energy reducing models including sawtooth model, bridge arch model, curve model and linearity model according to chord vibration theory. All these experimental parameter analysis not only provides new research methods for musical instrument acoustics, but also do much help with more objective theory and standard for instrument design and manufacture.

Objective
abic is a natural polysaccharide exudate from Acacia senegal and other related African species of Acacia. Gum arabic is considered to have an ability to enhance remineralization, because of its high concentration of Ca2+. However, the caries preventive capacity of gum arabic has been scarcely investigated. We evaluated the cariostatic activities of gum arabic using histopathological methods to determine its effects on remineralization.

ing incubation in demineralization solution, human third molars were exposed to 10 mg/ml of gum arabic, sodium fluoride at 1000 ppm (NaF), or double distilled water (DW, negative control), then subjected to demineralization–remineralization cycles. Before and after demineralization–remineralization cycles, contact microradiographs of each sample were taken and mineral distribution quantities were calculated.
s
mineralization ratio of the molars exposed to gum arabic was similar to that of those exposed to NaF, while the ratios of both were significantly greater than that of those exposed to DW.
sions
abic enhanced the remineralization of caries-like enamel lesions in vitro, suggesting its inhibitory effects towards dental caries.

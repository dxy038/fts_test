Objective:
The study focused on the correlation between maternal polymorphisms of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and the risk of having a child with CL/P in the Polish population.
Method:
PCR–RFLP analysis was used to analyze polymorphisms of MnSOD2 (c.47T>C), CAT (c.− 330C>T) and GPX1 (c.599C>T) in mothers of children with CL/P and control mothers.
Results and Conclusion:
Polymorphic variants of genes for main antioxidant enzymes were determined not to be a maternal risk factor for having a child with CL/P in the investigated group of women.

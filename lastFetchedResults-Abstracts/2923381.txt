A bidirectional associative memory (BAM) with high capacity for storage of pattern pairs is proposed. The associative memory takes advantage of the exponential nonlinearity in the evolution equations such that the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) is significantly increased. The increase of SNR consequently enhances the capacity of the BAM. An energy function is defined. The energy of the exponential BAM decreases as the recall process proceeds, ensuring the stability of the system. The monotonic decrease of the energy of the exponential BAM during the recall process ensures it will reach a local minimum

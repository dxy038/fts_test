In this paper, a frame rate up-conversion method that uses a texture adaptive motion estimation technique is proposed for reducing motion-blur problems in liquid crystal displays. Conventional bilateral motion estimation techniques have a major common drawback to hardly detect true motion vector if there are blocks with simple texture within the search range. To solve this problem, a texture adaptive bilateral motion estimation method that increases cost value of block with simple texture is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional methods in both objective and subjective image quality.

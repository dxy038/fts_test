Advances in remote sensing (RS) and computer technology have given the tools needed to monitor and assess the status of natural resources like natural vegetation and agroecosystems. The scientific bases of the potential usefulness of multispectral reflectance in agriculture and natural resources is based on the fact that different objects as well as different organisms reflect the energy of Sun in different way. Several RS techniques has been used for several applications, including: identifying crops, evaluating grassland condition and productivity, monitoring vegetation and providing indicators of the yield of crops. The objective of this study is to classify the type of crops and to estimate their production using Landsat image data for Kanazawa area, Japan. Estimates of crop production are compared with the available statistics data for this zone

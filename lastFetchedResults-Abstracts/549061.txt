Parasitism is one of the major problems affecting goat's health. It causes a considerable economic loss in small ruminants of worldwide. The main objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence andintensity of gastrointestinal and external parasite infections ingoats of North-West of Iran. In spite of the importance of goats in this region, there is no detailed quantitative study on prevalence of goat parasites. Fecal samples were collected from 403 goat %ti identification of gastrointestinal parasites and presence of external parasites. Seven different specks of gastrointestinal parasites including Strongylida, Marshalagia, Nematodirus, Triehuris, C^sstocoulus, MonimsjidFasciola, were identified in fecal samples. Hie number and percentage of imtoted goats these parasites were 206 (51.11%) for Strongylida, 37 (9JS%) for Ma^MIagia, 12 (2#7%)fbr Nematod»ms,58 (14.39%) fa Triehuris,3 (0.7%) forCysrtocoulus, 23 (5..77%)for Moniaiamnd4; (1 %) for Fasodla. The number (of eggs ranged from 3 to 172-eggs.per gram<stf!faees. A numter of lli12 samples (27.79%) were positiwe for Eimeria with oocystseumber of l-3»Dper gram of fiaofiB.(bwas also fouodtfhat 12 (3%), 203 (50.4%) an d 131 (32.5%) of goats were imtfeated by Sarcoptes s.cabeii, D amalima caprae and Riipicephalus b ursa, respectively. On each gdsatt II tto 5 hard ticksweorelfound at diffaentsites of their toody. Result showed that intensity of gastHMflBtestinal parasite infection of goats were low in the ragion therefore intensive parasitic treatment sBosiuld not be recommended, It can be concluded fltot fecal examination should be considered tofore applying aiiyparasitic treatment.

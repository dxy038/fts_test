Effluent of an anaerobic sulphate-reducing wastewater treatment process was used to stabilise bottom ash. The effect of stabilisation on the concentration and binding of Ca, P, S, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Cr, and Mo were studied by comparing results of sequential extraction from fresh and stabilised bottom ash. The stabilisation treatment improved the retention of Ca, Cu, Pb, S, and Zn in bottom ash compared to a treatment with ion-exchanged water. In addition to retention, Cu, S, and Zn were accumulated from the anaerobic effluent in the bottom ash. Concentrations of As, Cr, and Mo remained on the same level, whereas leaching of P increased compared to control treatment with ion-exchanged water. Improved retention and accumulation were the result of increased binding to less soluble fractions. The highest increases were in the sulphide and organic carbon bound fraction and in the carbonate fraction. Enhanced carbonation was probably due to CO2 deriving from the degradation of organic carbon. Flushing of stabilised bottom ash with ion-exchanged water ensured that the observed changes were not easily reversed. Most of the sulphide in the anaerobic effluent was removed when it was passed through bottom ash. The objective was to study the feasibility of sulphide-rich anaerobic effluent in bottom ash stabilisation and changes in the binding of the elements during stabilisation. In addition, the ability of the process to remove sulphide from the effluent was observed.

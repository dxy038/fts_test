<p><strong>Objective: </strong>This study aimed to<strong> </strong>evaluate the correlation between plasma lipid levels at first trimester of pregnancy and results of Oral Glucose Challenge Test (OGCT).<br /><strong>Materials and methods:  </strong>In a<strong> </strong>cross - sectional descriptive analytic study, two hundred eligible primigravida women without history of Diabetes Mellitus referring to Vali-e-Asr Hospital were evaluated. Plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol were measured at first trimester of pregnancy and Oral Glucose Challenge Test was done for all women at  24<sup>th</sup> - 28<sup>th</sup> gestational week. Pre-pregnancy BMI, and plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol at first trimester of pregnancy were compared with the results of OGCT. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 14. p-values ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> In 45 (22.5%) of the women OGCT was positive.  Pre pregnancy BMI and the rate of positive result for OGCT were both correlated with the plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol at first trimester of pregnancy.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Plasma lipid levels in first trimester can predict the result of OGCT at 24- 28 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

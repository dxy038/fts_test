In this article theoretical and mathematical studies were performed to define integration prospects of electric drives based on back to back converters in an industrial smart grid. Back to back converters can be actively used in operation of supply power system of enterprise as they are able to provide controlled power factor and bidirectional power flow. A back to back converter contains PWM boost rectifier which can carry out a compensation of reactive power in the grid using the increase of the direct current voltage level on the value of the voltage drop on the input inductor. The principle of maximum using consumption current of back to back converter to improve the efficiency was proposed. This principle most appropriately applied for parallel working with a nonlinear load.

Clinical data is generated in large volume in hospital sector where analysis of clinical experimental data for diagnosis of disease for doctors becomes essential. Data mining concepts are used extensively for analysis of clinical attributes. Biclustering algorithms are commonly applied to group clustering with different conditions simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to analyse breast cancer clinical dataset using biclustering approach. Breast cancer has become one of the threatening diseases to women in India. This paper uses biclustering algorithms to find the attribute clusters. The experimental results found that the identified biclustering patterns helps to find patients who are affected with breast cancer based on the attribute patterns.

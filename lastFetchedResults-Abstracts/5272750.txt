As international corporate activities increase and specialization develops, the prevailing competitive relationship in the logistics industry is no longer the simple competition between enterprise and enterprise, but becoming the competition among strategic alliances. So the selection of alliance partners has become the most important problem for the core enterprise in logistics strategic alliance to make decisions. PartnersÂ´ performance decides the effectiveness of the logistics strategic alliance and can lead to the success and failure of strategic alliance. The evaluation and selection of appropriate partner is a multi-objective and multi-layer comprehensive problem, and some evaluation factors are subjective. To evaluate the partners objectively, this paper establishes the index system of partners in logistics strategic alliance according to SCOR index model. In the process of evaluating and selecting partners based on AHP method, we import the TOPSIS method to standardize the evaluation result so that we can get more objective and effective evaluation result and get the final appropriate partner.

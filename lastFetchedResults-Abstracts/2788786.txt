In Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANET), Network nodes move randomly so the topology changes unpredictably and faster. Due to the changing topology, packet loss is a common phenomenon. Routing protocols used in such type of networks generally based on the assumption that, all participating nodes will be fully cooperative. But, due to the open structure, node misbehavior may exist and so the packet loss occurs. We propose a 2ACK scheme in OLSR protocol with an objective to reduce the node misbehavior. In this paper, we conduct the experiments on NS-2 on existing 2ACK scheme as well as enhanced 2ACK scheme based on OLSR. Our results prove that the proposed scheme is better option than the existing 2ACK scheme.

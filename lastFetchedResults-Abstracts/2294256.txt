The objective of this work is to present a low-cost methodology to monitor the displacement of continuously active landslides from ground-based optical images analyzed with a normalized image correlation technique. The performance of the method is evaluated on a series of images acquired on the Super-Sauze landslide (South French Alps) over the period 2008â€“2009. The image monitoring system consists of a high resolution optical camera installed on a concrete pillar located on a stable crest in front of the landslide and controlled by a datalogger. The data are processed with a cross-correlation algorithm applied to the full resolution images in the acquisition geometry. Then, the calculated 2D displacement field is orthorectified with a back projection technique using a high resolution DEM interpolated from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. The heterogeneous displacement field of the landslide is thus characterized in time and space. The performance of the technique is assessed using differential GPS surveys as reference. The sources of error affecting the results are then discussed. The strongest limitations for the application of the technique are related to the meteorological, illumination and ground surface conditions inducing partial or complete loss of coherence among the images. Small movements of the camera and the use of a mono-temporal DEM are the most important factors affecting the accuracy of the ortho-rectification of the displacement field. As the proposed methodology can be routinely and automatically applied, it offers promising perspectives for operational applications like, for instance, in early warning systems.

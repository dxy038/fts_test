This demonstration aims at presenting the MobiCAP prototype. MobiCAP is a mobile application system for management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). The system supports experienced end beginner physicians to deal with the CAPÂ´s diagnosis process problem. Thus, MobiCAP enables physicians to handle a high amount of variables and take a quick and precise diagnosis based on rules described by the internal guidelines previously established by hospital physicians. MobiCAP was designed and developed in conjunction with specialist physicians from the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceicao (HNSC)-placed in Porto Alegre city-and based on HNSC internal guidelines for diagnosis and management of the CAP. The system was written in the Objective-C language using a development approach called Model View Controller (MVC). The application was implemented to run on the iOS platform, more specifically under iPhone type devices. As programming environment, it was used the Xcode 5.0.2 for the overall development of the application. In summary, three graphical interfaces correspond to the core functionality of the application, namely: (a) a graphical user interface for the risk stratification of pneumonia; (b) a graphical interface for the algorithm treatment; and (c) a graphical interface to the treatment according to etiology.

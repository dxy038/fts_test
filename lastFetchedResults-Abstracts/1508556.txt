Preparative chromatography, especially simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography, is a key technology for the separation of fine chemicals on a production scale. Most of the design methods for batch and SMB processes proposed in the open literature deal with the optimisation of the operating conditions for a given chromatographic unit only. Therefore, a comparison of the process economy may lead to incorrect results. In this contribution, an effective strategy for the optimal choice of all process parameters (operation and design parameters) is proposed. The main idea of this strategy is to apply a detailed and experimentally validated process model and to reduce the number of influencing parameters by introducing and optimising dimensionless process parameters. It is shown that there is an infinite choice of design and operating parameters to achieve maximum productivity or minimum separation costs and not at the maximum pressure drop only. The detailed design of the chromatographic unit and the selection of the operating conditions can be adjusted by considering the availability of columns and packing materials. As the model system, the separation of a racemic mixture (EMD53986) on Chiralpak AD was investigated. After complete optimisation of a batch and a SMB unit, a real comparison of the process economy can be achieved. Finally, the influences of two different objective functions, productivity and specific separation cost, are analysed.

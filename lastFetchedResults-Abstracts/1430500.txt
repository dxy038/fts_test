Abstract
Background and purpose: Climate change has an important role on the health and productivity
of the occupant of the building. The objective of this study is to estimate the effects of climate
change on thermal comfort in hot and wet areas, as in the case of the city of Douala.
Materials and Methods: The general circulation model (CSMK3 Model, Scenario B1) was
adopted for this purpose. Outdoor daily parameters of temperature, sunshine, and precipitation of
last 40 years were analyzed and allowed us to make forecast on this area. The past (1990-2000),
the present (2001-2011), and the future (2012-2022) were considered in the hypotheses.
Results: It has been found that Douala like some large cities of Africa is already and will be
severely hit of advantage by climate change if anything is not going to slow. By 2033, it is
expected to have an increase of more than 0.21Â° C of temperature; thus, a decrease of
precipitation.
Conclusion: In 2023, total discomfort will reign in the dry season, especially in January where
humidex could reach 42.9. On the other hand, in the rainy season, humidex will increase of 0.91
compared to year 2013. This effect will have an increase of temperature. When we maintain
relative humidity, and we increase temperature, humidex varies enormously and displays a
maximum value, with maximum temperature.

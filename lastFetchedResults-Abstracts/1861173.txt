Background
fects of losartan (Los) on ventricular remodeling (VR) remain controversial. The objective was to determine whether early administration of Los to rabbits with myocardial infarction (MI) modifies VR.
s
aland rabbits underwent left coronary artery ligation. Four groups were analyzed: Sham (G1; n=13), MI (G2; n=13), Sham+Los (G3; n=13), and MI+Los (G4; n=13). Los (12.5 mg/kg/day) was administered from 3 h post-MI and during 35 days. At the end of the protocol, the hearts were isolated and perfused to determine pressure–volume curves (P/V). Hearts were weighed, cut, and stained with picrosirius red. The heart weight (HW)/body weight (BW) ratio was determined. Infarct size (IS;%), septum (SeT, mm) and scar thickness (ST, mm), myocyte area (μm2), and width (μm) were measured.
s (X±S.E.M.)
ifted the diastolic left ventricular (LV) P/V relationship to the right in sham and MI (P&lt;.05 vs. sham), with no changes in the systolic relation. IS was G2=25.38±5.31 and G4=21.85±4.13 (NS); HW/BW was 0.34±0.01, 0.35±0.02, 0.29±0.02 (P&lt;.05 vs. G1 and G2), and 0.32±0.02 in G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively. Scar collagen concentration (%) was lower in G4 (P&lt;.05 vs. G2). SeT was lower in G3 and G4 (P&lt;.05 vs. G2). The width and area of the septum myocytes increased in the untreated infarct, and Los suppressed that increase.
sion
rly administration of Los unfavorably modified post-MI VR, increasing ventricular dilation, reducing scar collagen concentration and thickness, and inhibiting myocytes width and area increase. The dilation observed in sham animals' hearts suggests that infarct was not the main factor in the dilation of the cavity.

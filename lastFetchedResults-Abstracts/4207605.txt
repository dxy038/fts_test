This paper proposes an approach which is based on a multi objective genetic algorithm to resolve the vehicles routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). The context of this problem is to plan a set of routes to serve heterogeneous demands respecting several constraints (only one depot, vehicles limited capacity, windows of time). We used an approach based on a multi-objective optimization to resolve this problem. The criteria to be optimized are the number of used vehicles and the total required distance. We propose a method of resolution which is based on a hybridization of a genetic algorithm NSGAII (Not dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) and the BCRC algorithm (Best Cost Route Crossover).

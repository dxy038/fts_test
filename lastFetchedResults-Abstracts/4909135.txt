In this project a computer simulation for hemodialysis was implemented. One objective of the project was to create a graphical user interface for the computer model that facilitates specification of the dialysis session to be simulated. A top-down stepwise refinement approach was used to develop the simulator. The simulator can be used as an educational tool for understanding hemodialysis and will allow physicians to develop strategies for varying the ultrafiltration rate with the goal of achieving an acceptable blood volume profile

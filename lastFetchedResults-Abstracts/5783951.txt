The aim of this paper is to present a new method for process diagnosis using a Bayesian network. The mutual information between each variable of the system and the class variable is computed to identify the important variables. To illustrate the performances of this method, we use the Tennessee Eastman Process. For this complex process (51 variables), we take into account three kinds of faults with the minimal recognition error rate objective.

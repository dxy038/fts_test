The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effectiveness of chitosonium acetate films on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The samples were tested in both laboratory conditions using Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) and in a real food system using fish soup. The study was carried out at different temperatures (4, 12, and 37 Â°C) in order to discern the influence of such variables. Moreover, a sensory evaluation of the final product was performed as a parameter of consumer acceptance. The results showed a significant reduction of the bacterial growth, which greatly depended on the bacteria type, the temperature of incubation and the food substrate. Although the effectiveness of chitosan films decreased in the fish soup, neither the sensory properties nor the pH of the soup was affected upon their addition. The application of chitosonium acetate as an internal coating of the packaging material could be a very suitable means to assure safety of liquid food products such as fish soup at the range of temperatures studied.

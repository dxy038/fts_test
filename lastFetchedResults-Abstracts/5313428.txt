Cluster supply chain is a complicated network structure, the enterprises in it not only have to coordinate with enterprises in the same single chain, but also have to compete and cooperate across chain. In this paper we study mainly on how core manufacturers in different single chains cooperate and compete with each other, in order to realize the minimal cost under the premise of cluster supply chainpsilas normal operation. We establish mathematical models with respect to perfect competition and cooperative decision respectively, whose objective function is minimal cost and constraint conditions are supplying capability, inventory capacity, and no shortage. Based on these we figure out the optimal solutions of two models, and deduce that the cooperative decision is the optimal decision by comparison.

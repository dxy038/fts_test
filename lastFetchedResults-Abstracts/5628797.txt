Video denoising is an important feature of many modem video encoding architectures since it can considerably enhance coding efficiency while at the same time improving objective and subjective quality. In this paper, a new scheme for video denoising based on spatio-temporal filtering is presented, which can be used as a preprocessing stage within a video encoder. Spatial filtering is performing through the adaptive selection and combination of a wavelet based and a 2D Wiener filter, while for temporal filtering we employ bidirectional block based motion compensation using the Enhanced Predictive Zonal Search (EPZS) algorithm. Experimental results are presented which show a significant improvement in video quality when the denoised video sequence is encoded with an H.264 encoder.


Objective: This study aimed to investigate the prediction of asthma control on the basis of
perceived stress, locus of control, and self-efficacy in adult patients with asthma. Methods: This was a descriptive-correlative and cross-sectional study.The solecty of this
study is all asthmatic patients in Tehran. our sample consisted of 100 participants who were
selected by purposeful sampling method. A total of 100 patients with asthma were selected
among outpatients of Masih Daneshvari Hospital. Participants included 52 women and 48
men. Their mean (±SD) age was 36.12 (±9.82) years. Sociodemographic data were collected
and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC),
Asthma Self-efficacy Scale (ASES), and Asthma Control Test (ACT) were applied. Data
were analyzed by Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. Statistical analysis was
performed using the SPSS ver. 16.0. Results: The results indicated that there were negative significant relationships between
perceived stress, dimension of external control (chance) and asthma control, but positive
significant relationships between self-efficacy and asthma control. In regression analysis, the
perceived stress was the predictor of asthma control. Conclusion: In this study, our findings suggest that perceived stress has an important role
in the development and maintenance of asthma symptoms. In addition, self-efficacy and a
tendency to externally attribute the locus of control (chance) are significantly associated with
asthma control.

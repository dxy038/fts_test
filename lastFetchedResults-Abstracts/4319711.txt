This paper presents a new bidirectional hybrid three-phase rectifier suitable for medium and high power applications. The rectifier employs a three-phase diode bridge rectifier and a boost-type three-phase PWM rectifier. The proposed rectifier is capable of providing sinusoidal input currents with low harmonic distortion and DC output voltage regulation. The rectifier topology generation, the principle of operation, control scheme and simulation results are described in the paper

An improved ant algorithm is brought up to minimize the delivery time of vehicle routing problem (VRP) in distribution center. Firstly VRP whose objective is to minimize the delivery time is given, then the optimal vehicle distribution route division approach of distribution center for given customer array is defined, and the ant colony algorithm for VRP with objective to minimize the delivery time is presented. The research of this paper is based on the information and application case of tobacco network in Hangzhou city. By investigating, we created two different system models. One is division of distribution route of distribution center, and the other is optimization of single vehicle route. The computational example tests and verifies the solution.

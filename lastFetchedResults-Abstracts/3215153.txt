Hyperspectral images (HSI) classification is a high technical remote sensing tool. The main goal is to classify the point of a region. The HIS contains more than a hundred bidirectional measures, called bands (or simply images), of the same region called Ground Truth Map (GT). Unfortunately, some bands contain redundant information, others are affected by the noise, and the high dimensionalities of features make the accuracy of classification lower. All these bands can be important for some applications, but for the classification a small subset of these is relevant. In this paper we use mutual information (MI) to select the relevant bands; and the Normalized Mutual Information coefficient to avoid and control redundant ones. This is a feature selection scheme and a Filter strategy. We establish this study on HSI AVIRIS 92AV3C. This is effectiveness, and fast scheme to control redundancy.

Partial nephrectomy is the gold standard treatment for renal cell carcinoma. This procedure requires temporary occlusion of the renal artery, which can cause irreversible damage due to warm ischemia after 30 min. Open surgical procedures use crushed ice to induce a mild hypothermia of 20 °C in the kidney, which can increase allowable ischemia time up to 2.5 h. The Kidney Cooler device was developed previously by the authors to achieve renal cooling using a minimally invasive approach. In the present study an analytical model of kidney cooling in situ was developed using heat transfer equations to determine the effect of kidney thickness on cooling time. In vivo porcine testing was conducted to evaluate the cooling performance of this device and to identify opportunities for improved surgical handling. Renal temperature was measured continuously at 6 points using probes placed orthogonally to each other within the kidney. Results showed that the device can cool the core of the kidney to 20 °C in 10–20 min. Design enhancements were made based on surgeon feedback; it was determined that the addition of an insulating air layer below the device increased difficulty of positioning the device around the kidney and did not significantly enhance cooling performance. The Kidney Cooler has been shown to effectively induce mild renal hypothermia of 20 °C in an in vivo porcine model.

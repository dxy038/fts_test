A key technique for protein analysis is the geometric alignment of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE), i.e. 2-D PAGE image registration. In this study, according to the characteristics of 2-D gel image registration, a fuzzy-inference-rule based flexible model (FIM-FM) is proposed to model the complex geometric transformation and intensity variation between 2-D gel image pairs. Then, by introducing the concept of motion estimation and the corresponding sum-of-squared-difference (SSD) objective function, the parameter learning rules of the proposed model are derived for registration. Accordingly, an adaptive FIR-FM-based automatic elastic image registration algorithm is presented for 2-D gel image registration here. It is distinguished by its strong ability in approximating complex nonlinear transformation inherited from fuzzy inference and its efficiency and adaptability in obtaining precise model parameters through effective parameter learning rules. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm is highly effective for registration of 2-D gel images.

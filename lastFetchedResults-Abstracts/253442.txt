The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Glomus
deserticola can alleviate the deleterious effect of Verticillium
dahliae on the growth and yield of pepper when
pathogen attack occurs during the vegetative stage of
growth. As biotic stresses can alter the activity of reaction
oxygen species scavenger enzymes, our first objective
was to determine if V. dahliae caused biochemical
changes in asymptomatic leaves even before the onset
of first visible symptoms of the disease in plants, laying
special emphasis on antioxidant enzymes. The second
aim was to assess if AMF modified the metabolism in
leaves of Verticillium-inoculated plants. Results
showed that V. dahliae caused metabolic changes in
asymptomatic leaves even before plants had developed
disease symptoms, but there were some differences
between non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants.
Non-mycorrhizal pepper inoculated with the pathogen
exhibited an early enhancement of superoxide dismutase
(SOD) activity, which was not co-ordinated with
increases in any peroxidase activity. The presumably
subsequent accumulation of H2O2 could be related to
the quick progress of the disease observed in these
plants. On the other hand, mycorrhizal plants did not
show simultaneous co-ordination among different antioxidant
enzymes, but they had more balanced SOD,
catalase and guaiacol peroxidase activities in leaves
during the first month after pathogen inoculation than
non-mycorrhizal ones. This fact could be related to the
longer maintenance of photosynthetic rates in pathogen-
infected plants associated with AMF observed in
previous studies.

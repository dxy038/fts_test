The primary purpose or objective of the Advanced Power and On-Board Propulsion Thrust is to provide critical technology advancements to meet the needs of the NASA Enterprises and Strategic Technology Areas. Where appropriate, the Thrust will also consider the needs of the commercial industry and the DOD from the point of view of leveraging resources, and more rapid technology infusion. These objectives will be obtained through a combination of contracted, in-house and/or cooperative efforts that evolve the technologies identified as critical by the NASA mission planners from the earliest levels of technology readiness to technology infusion. The latter stages of development will of course be significantly co-funded by the users through the middle technology readiness levels (TRLs) and they will assume total financial responsibility as the technologies are moved to flight demonstrations or mission use. Activities in the Thrust will be maintained as long as there are critical NASA needs to be met

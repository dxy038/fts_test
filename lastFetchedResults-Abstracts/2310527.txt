The systematic design of an autonomous platform for robotic weeding research in arable farming is described. The long term objective of the project is the replacement of hand weeding in organic farming by a device working autonomously at field level. The distinguishing feature of the described design procedure is the use of a structured design approach, which forces the designer to systematically review and compare alternative solution options, thus preventing the selection of solutions based on prejudice or belief. The result of the design is a versatile research vehicle with a diesel engine, hydraulic transmission, four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering. The robustness of the vehicle and the open software architecture permit the investigation of a wide spectrum of research options for intra-row weed detection and weeding actuators.

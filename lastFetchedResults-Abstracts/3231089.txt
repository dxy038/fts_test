In this paper, we propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm based on the transmission rate adaptation to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) for multi-services in heterogeneous wireless networks. Based on the proposed transmission rate-based priority decision model, an optimal bandwidth reallocation matrix can be obtained by adaptively adjusting usersÂ´ transmission rates according to the variations of resource availability. The mobile terminals with the multi-homing capabilities can use higher transmission rates when there are much more available bandwidth resources, and can use lower transmission rates when there are so little available bandwidth resources. The objective of the bandwidth reallocation algorithm is to maximize the defined utility function under the transmission rate QoS requirements and heterogeneous network capacity constraints based on an iterative procedure. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm not only meets the transmission rate QoS requirements, but also maximizes the network utility and reduces the new calls blocking probability.

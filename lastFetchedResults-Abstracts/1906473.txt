With regard to the society’s need for complicated software and high level of expenses on its development, it is necessary to take all stakeholders’ requirements and the demands into consideration, before any investments and put on the design and utilization stages. Software architecture is a technical description of a software system that indicates components and their relationships between them. In fact architecture style is a set of principles used by a software architect to design software architecture. Nowadays, this is a common behavior among the software architects in designing any software. As “Performance” is the most important qualitative features chosen for the assessment, the main objective of this research is studying the effect of various styles on its non-functional requirements, using Markov model, so that the architect can choose a suitable style based on qualitative and precise criteria. In this paper with regards to the results obtained based on homogeneous style, an algorithm has been presented to generalize the assessment method for the heterogeneous styles. Finally, to represent the correctness of the proposed algorithm, an illustrative example has been presented.

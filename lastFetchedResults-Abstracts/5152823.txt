In the web services domain, answering users´ needs sometimes requires the construction of new services based on existing ones. This problem is known as services composition. It consists in combining existing basic services into more sophisticated ones, which are able to meet users´ needs. The composition may be driven by various motivations. In the present paper we focus our attention on the problem of services composition driven by a set of independent objectives. In this context, we present a new evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm.

This paper proposes a three-phase input indirect matrix converter topology for a dual ac-drive system with modified switch control schemes, along with addition of a leg. This topology is developed based on a very sparse matrix converter with addition of a leg in the inverter stage, which can reduce the amount of power transistors compared to the conventional dual matrix converter system and; therefore, can achieve the realization of highly compact ac drives. A control strategy for the system, which combines vector control technology for loads and the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm for a matrix converter with a four-leg inverter, is proposed. The proposed control and modulation schemes guarantee sinusoidal input/output waveforms and bidirectional power flow. Finally, the proposed system and independent control algorithm are verified by simulation using the very sparse matrix converter, which is implemented with 14 IGBT switches and 32 diodes connected to a three-phase and single-phase loads.

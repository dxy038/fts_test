Personal Health Record (PHR) systems provide patients with access to their own records, as well as control over who accesses their record. There are many PHR system providers available on the market. These PHR systems, however, have little means to integrate with healthcare facilities in the healthcare system network. This paper proposes a Personal Health Record (PHR) system solution which allows for exchange of patient data at the point-of-care using the patient´s mobile device. The objective is to outline and address the issues that arise when adopting an hybrid PHR architecture that comprises a mobile component and an online remote server component. Preliminary tests are conducted in order to assess the system´s usability.

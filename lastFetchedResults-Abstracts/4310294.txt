TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is an innovative spaceborne radar interferometer that is based on two high-resolution radar satellites in close formation flight: TerraSAR-X (launched on June 15, 2007) and TanDEM-X (launched on June 21, 2010). The primary objective of the TanDEM-X mission is the generation of a consistent global digital elevation model (DEM) with height accuracy of 2 meters and posting of 12 meters. It is expected that this data set will become a reference in geosciences and remote sensing applications.

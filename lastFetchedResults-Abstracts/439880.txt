Background. The purpose of this study is to report our 15-year experience treating chronic empyemas after pulmonary resection and tuberculosis.

Methods. Open-window thoracostomy and thoracomyoplasty were used to treat 40 patients with chronic pleural empyema characterized by residual empyematic cavity, bronchopleural fistula, and persistent pleural infections that were secondary to tuberculosis (n = 22) or pulmonary resection (n = 18). Between 2 and 7 months after thoracostomy, thoracomyoplasty was performed to eliminate a persistent pleural cavity. In 2 patients with postpulmonary resection empyema and a large bronchopleural fistula, intrathoracic transposition of the latissimus dorsi flap and open-window thoracostomy were performed simultaneously to close the fistula.

Results. The pleural space was eliminated per primam intentionem in 21 of 22 patients with tuberculosis and in 14 of 18 with a postpulmonary resection empyema. Another myoplasty was performed in an additional 3 patients to eliminate the pleural space. During open-window thoracostomy, the latissimus dorsi muscle was preserved with minimal injury to the anterior serratus muscle. One patient died postoperatively.

Conclusions. Successful treatment of chronic pleural empyema requires adequate timing of surgical procedures. Our two-procedure technique is relatively simple and safe.

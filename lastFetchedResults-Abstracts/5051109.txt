The objective of this paper is to reduce the development time of PLC (programmable logic controller) by automating the task of controller logic design and implementation. For this purpose we applied the t-MPSG, an extended finite state automaton, to model the sequence of operations. It is developed for generating execution module for the real-time shop floor controller system. The t-MPSG supervises the flow of part from one state to another state considering the precondition of the system. It can be used to model the controller logic, which can be consequently translated to textual code, and finally translated into IEC standard PLC code. The generated code can be downloaded to PLC for the purpose of simulation or execution.

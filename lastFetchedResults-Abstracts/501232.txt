Objective: The global HIV epidemic continues to expand and exceeding previous predictions. An effective vaccine represents the best hope to curtail the HIV epidemic. DNA vaccines induce humoral and cellular responses and mimic live vaccines without their pathogenic potential. The importance of CD8+ CTL responses in controlling HIV and SIV viremia has led to production of a series of vaccine candidates that effectively induce these responses. It is now widely believed that an HIV vaccine strategy must stimulate both a strong humoral (antibody) as well as cell-mediated (CTL) immune response. The p24 and gp41 play many important roles in host-virus interaction and pathogenesis. These proteins are considered as attractive vaccine candidate in which their immunogenecity and immunomodulatory effects have been confirmed.

Materials and Methods: In this study, a construct, pcDNA3.1Hygro- (p24-gp41), was evaluated as a DNA vaccine candidate in Balb/C mice for generation of effective cellular immune responses. For immunizing, we used dendrosome, a novel family of vehicles for transfection and therapy. IFN-y cytokine production and total antibody were detected by ELISA. Lymphoprolifration assay was performed by MTT test. Results: ELISA and MTT assays confirmed that the cited p24-gp41 fusion gene is able to enhance immune responses in mice.

Conclusion: The construct that was used in this research can be a good candidate for DNA vaccine against HIV-1, if the future complementary tests demonstrate the same trends of immunogenic responses shown in this study.

This paper derives a &#195;&#159;-order perceptually motivated minimum mean square error (MMSE) spectral estimator of the short-time spectral magnitude of speech, aimed to improve the performance in speech enhancement. The performance of the proposed estimators with different values of &#195;&#159; has been evaluated by two kinds of objective measures. We have also compared the waveforms of perceptually motivated MMSE (PM) estimated speech and &#195;&#159; -order PM estimated speech. The results showed the proposed estimator with different constant &#195;&#159; value could focus on either noise reduction or preventing speech distortion. With an adaptive value of &#195;&#159;, the proposed estimator have better performance in noise reduction than PM estimator.

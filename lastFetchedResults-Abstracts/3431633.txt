A novel actuation mechanism that utilizes the inherent piezoelectric properties of Al <sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub> As compounds is presented for short-wavelength microelectromechanical systems tunable vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser centered at 850 nm. Piezoelectric actuation can provide precise bidirectional displacements and linear tuning characteristics with respect to the applied voltage, does not suffer from travel limitations and catastrophic electrical damage, consumes low power (~1 muW), and has a relatively fast response compared to thermal actuation. In addition, piezoelectric actuation based on Al<sub>x</sub>Ga <sub>1-x</sub>As films offers a large piezoelectric coupling coefficient comparable to those of zinc oxide and quartz, and it can be integrated with high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices. Single-mode emission with a linear continuous tuning range of 3 nm and low power consumption were experimentally obtained

This paper presents a fast, simple router design for implementing the Red Rover algorithm for a bidirectional ring. This design is very suitable for the Data-Intensive Architecture (DIVA) system, a system which demonstrates the benefits of embedded DRAM technology, because of its high performance as well as simple architecture and low cost. The key attributes of this router are one clock node-to-node latency, high channel throughput, and simple hardware implementation. The router architecture employs short-cut FIFO data paths, which makes the router speed independent of the channel buffer size (in terms of flits). A prototype implementation of the router achieves a maximum channel bandwidth of 5.12 Gb/s and runs at 80 MHz using 3.3 V CMOS signaling in 0.5 &#956;m technology. This high throughput and low latency were achieved without resorting to the use of complex high-speed signaling technologies

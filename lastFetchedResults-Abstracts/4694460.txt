A novel application of the adaptive genetic algorithm in designing high performance multilayer electromagnetic absorbers is discussed in this paper. Based on the different requirements of strong-absorption and broad-band, two types of objective functions are proposed accordingly. Considering both perpendicular and parallel polarizations, numerical results based on existing lossy materials are presented for wide-angle incidence over a wide frequency range, and they demonstrate the obvious efficiency of the new synthesis method.

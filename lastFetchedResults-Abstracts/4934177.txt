The objective of this paper is to provide an effective and accurate analytical solution to compute the spreading thermal resistance of a vapor chamber thermal module, as well as the surface temperatures and the heat flux distributions at the heating surface. The analytical solutions are expressed in a reduced unit system with the governing parameters of the corresponding distance between heat sources, dimensionless plate thickness of the vapor chamber. This paper also presents vapor chamber temperature distribution, and it is correlation to heat source sizes, hence, spreading thermal resistance decreases with the increasing lateral length. There is the obvious difference between spreading thermal and conductive thermal resistance as lateral length is disproportion to heating area. Therefore, spreading thermal resistance is an important factor when design the thermal solution of a high density chipset power, and it caused high temperature in heat sources by embedded a thinner heat sink base. According to Fourier conductivity theorem, spreading thermal resistance is disproportion to sink base, then thermal resistance is not only parameter for vapor chamber module design, it needs to consider spreading resistance of vapor chamber and fin performance for cooling LEDs array, in order to prevent mismatch on numerical analysis and mathematical calculation. Thermal simulation is used as a design tool, and it is close to experimental data. The difference is within 5.9%, and it presents a precise result.

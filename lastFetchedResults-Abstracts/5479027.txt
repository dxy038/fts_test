This paper proposes two PWM strategies and related programming methods for DC-to-three-phase AC voltage-source-inversion and three-phase AC-to-DC voltage-source-rectification respectively. They are based on the general direct space vector modulation approach derived from matrix converter theory, and sharing the same algorithm in calculating vector duty-cycles. The one for DC-AC inversion can accommodate maximum constant boost control for impedance-source (z-source) inverter. Both the two PWM strategies were verified by simulated implementation in a single-stage bidirectional converter, in which a variety of matrix converter and a z-source inverter were used, for the study of ISA 42 V system

The objective of this study was to use a new subtyping technique to determine the identity of five Streptococcus equi isolates from four outbreaks of strangles in Colorado during 2005âˆ’2006. All five of the isolates from the four strangles outbreaks in Colorado contained SeM allele 28. This SeM allele is typical of American isolates of S. equi and has previously been linked with strangles outbreaks in Minnesota in 1994 and Kentucky in 1995. Use of the new S. equi strain subtyping method allowed for characterization of recent S. equi isolates associated with outbreaks of strangles in Colorado. To our knowledge, this is the first report of typing of more recent isolates from North America. This approach, however, has been used in situations in the United Kingdom to differentiate the vaccine strain of S. equi from that of the wild type of the bacteria.

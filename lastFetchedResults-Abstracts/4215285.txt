The objective of this work is to point out the advantages offered by the temperature dependent dielectric spectroscopy in frequency domain, as a possible diagnostic tool for power transformer lifetime prediction. Characterization of the insulating oil has been carried out for a wide selection of transformers and their gas concentrations were monitored. The work correlates gas chromatography data to the dielectrometry ones.

The recent development of powerful mobile devices is encouraging people to take them as a computing platform. Users are expecting to personalize services to meet their individual needs and will no longer accept &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach. On the other hand, there is contention between personalization and privacy. This leads to the question of how to maximize the user´s experience of personalized mobile services while keeping their privacy. One possible solution is to provide user´s control of their personal data by keeping their user model on their personal mobile devices. In this way, a user can scrutinize the data while sharing with service providers depending on her/his requirements. The client-side personalization approach can shift the control of privacy to the users and can involve them in personalization process. In this paper, we have proposed a solution with the objective of scrutable client-side personalization while keeping the user in control of both privacy and personalization. Moreover, the objective is to provide a conceptual layer of privacy enhanced personalization for future mobile services.

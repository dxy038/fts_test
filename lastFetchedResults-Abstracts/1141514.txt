The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the parameters involved in the processing of de-boned chicken breast, with a view to reducing weight loss during cooking. The following were examined: the effect of chicken breast maturation time (0 and 24 h), the quantity of brine used in the curing (12% and 15% in relation to the raw material) and the curing time (2 and 7 h). The data were analyzed with the software Statistica version 6.0. The surface response method was also used in the analysis. The lowest water loss during cooking (highest cooking process yield) was obtained with 12% brine and a curing time of 2 h, where the water loss was around 39%, regardless of the chicken breast maturation time. Analysis of the sensory parameters color, aroma, flavor and texture, indicated that there was no significant difference (p > 0.10) between the treatments studied.

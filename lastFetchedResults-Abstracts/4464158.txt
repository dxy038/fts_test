Current-limiting fuses and circuit-breakers are evaluated on the basis of objective data. The author evaluates performance characteristics such as I<sup>2</sup>t limitation, peak current limitation, and interrupting capacity. He also reviews the test standards and discusses base criteria, such as availability, initial cost, and size. It is concluded that the key indicator of current-limiting performance is the I<sup>2</sup>t let-through value. Current-limiting fuses provide a much higher degree of thermal energy restriction. Class J fuses provide the highest degree of current-limitation. It is also noted that, until the issues of the lack of formal performance umbrellas and device interchangeability are addressed, the current-limiting circuit breakers might not enjoy the universal acceptance of the current-limiting fuse

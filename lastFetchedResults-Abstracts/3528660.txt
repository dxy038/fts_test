The very large increase in the use of the radio spectrum has resulted in numerous cases of spectrum congestion, and the continuing growth in spectrum-using devices can only result in increasing instances of congestion. With the objective of gaining fuller and more detailed understanding of spectrum congestion than has previously been available, Stanford Research Institute has been making an intensive study of the general problem of adequately defining and evaluating the characteristics of radio spectrum usage. An important element of this study has been the acquisition of a significant data base on channel occupancy and message characteristics in a large block of spectrum. To obtain pertinent data, a scanning receiver monitoring system was designed and placed in operation in selected areas of congested spectrum.

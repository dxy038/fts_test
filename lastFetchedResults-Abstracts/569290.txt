Abstract
Background and Objective: Recently, this hypothesis suggests that increased consumption of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (unsaturated fatty acids with long-chain omega-3) a notable effects on the outcome of pregnancy, but evidence about the effects of this acid on the duration of pregnancy and birth weight is limit and contradictory.Therefore the present study aimed to examine the effect of supplementation  of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid on the gestational length and birth weight.
Methods: In this clinical trial study, 120 healthy pregnant women were  randomly divided into two groups of 60 persons. Prenatal care, while the same for both groups was performed, only the intervention group  , from  16 weeks to the end of pregnancy, a daily fish oil capsules 1000 mg Salm Containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 129 mg docosahexaenoic acid was given. Samples until delivery for the gestational length and birth weight were followed. Birth weight and gestational length , by geram and  week day was recorded in list. Then data using the software SPS, with T Test and Mann-Whitney test analysis, parametric tests were analyzed in comparison.
Results: In 48 control samples and 44 intervention samples group, the average gestational length in the control group, 39.13±1.20 weeks and days, in the intervention group was 39.12±0.93. T test showed no significant difference between the two groups. Average birth weight infants in the control group 3367.08±441.07 g and intervention group 3083.64±452.43 g. T-test showed significant differences between the two groups (P=0.003). So average weight of infants in the intervention group, 284 g less of controls.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that adding supplements docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in the diet of pregnant mothers was associated with reduce birth weight and  has not  effect on the gestational length.

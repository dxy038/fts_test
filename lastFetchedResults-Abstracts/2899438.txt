In this paper we have proposed an electronic circuit, which can be used to introduce a phase lead independent of frequency. The design is achieved using a simple frequency to voltage converter and using it to control the resistance of a voltage controlled resistor, which has linear dependence. Previous efforts in building such a circuit were capable of providing a constant phase lag only. Thus, only half the problem was solved, since we did not have any method when the application demanded a constant phase lead. The proposed network is both a practical and relatively simple to understand, at least at functional level. The blocks used, along with the previous attempts have been cited and the results presented, using a standard and well known circuit simulation software. With a slight modification the proposed work can be translated to provide both a phase lead and lag of desired values. Thus, in short a multipurpose objective has been satisfied. The performance of the circuit has been graphically presented for different parameters of the circuit, over a wide range of frequencies. The performance is satisfactory and can be used for introducing frequency independent constant phase lead in various control circuit applications.

Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to compare bite force in different mandibular angle fracture patterns after reduction and fixation with miniplate osteosynthesis with intact mandibles using finite element analysis (FEA).
Subject and Methods: Three-dimensional finite element models of human mandible was prepared using CBCT. Simulated intact mandible and 4 different types of angle fractures were fixed with 5 different fixation methods of titanium miniplates. The finite element analysis was performed to determine bite force during clenching in the intercuspal position under loading with full masticatory forces.
Results: Bite force in the mandible reduced with 2 miniplates were closer that in the intact mandible. The use of double miniplates on the inferior border of the lateral cortex and external oblique ridge showed the best bite force and the single plate on superior border of the lateral cortex pattern was the worst.
Conclusion: This study presented a FEA based indirect method to estimate bite force. Finite element method can be effective tool in maxillofacial researches. Double miniplate fixation method for patients with mandibular angle fracture have a biomechanical advantage over 1 miniplate on the restoration of bite force.

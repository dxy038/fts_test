An objective of the study was to identify leaf morphophysiological characteristics indicative of high aboveground woody biomass production of Salix clones growing in the vegetation filter of a wastewater purification system. It was hypothesized, that in these extra irrigated stands, the characteristics of photosynthesis are stronger determinants of the production than the characteristics of leaf water relations. The biomass production of the clones was correlated with numerous characteristics of leaf water relations and photosynthesis. Significant correlation was found between the biomass production and the following characteristics of top foliage leaves: daily decrease in water potential, stomatal conductance, stomatal sensitivity to increase in light intensity, and hydraulic conductance (positive); daily minimum and maximum water potentials, instantaneous water use efficiency, and stomatal sensitivity to decrease in leaf water potential (negative); maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport, chlorophyll content, and the partitioning coefficient for leaf nitrogen into bioenergetics associated with electron transport (positive). In the most productive clones, the vertical gradient (through foliage) of values of almost all the characteristics was the smallest. The biomass correlated more strongly with the characteristics of photosynthesis light stage than with the characteristics of water relations. We conclude that the characteristics of photosynthesis light stage â€“ high maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport, high chlorophyll content, and also flat vertical gradient (through foliage) in values of the characteristics could be the strongest indicators of high biomass production of Salix clones growing in vegetation filter.

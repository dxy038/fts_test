Background and Objective: Tofu (soybean curd) is one of the most important soya protein products. It has a low-energy content and is a very suitable replacer for cheese and meat for persons who are sensitive to lactose, cholesterol and saturated fatty acids contained in these animal products. In this research, the effects of a hydrocolloid, namely, carrageenan, at a concentration of 0.1% and 0.2% (w/w of soya milk) and two coagulants, namely, glucono-Delta-lactone (GDL) and calcium chloride (CaCl2), on the quality characteristics of Tofu were investigated.
Materials and Methods: Soya milk, carageenan and the 2 coagulants, GDL and CaCl2 ,were used in the formulation of Tofu.  Soya milk samples were heated at 100?C and then carageenan and coagulants were added and mixed to obtain soya curd. This was followed by removing the serum phase of the soya curd specimens and measuring the quality parameters (yield, color, texture and sensory properties) of the final product..
Results: Addition of carageenan brought about increases in the yield, lightness (L*- hunter parameter), softness and flexibility of the Tofu produced by using GDL and CaCl2. The CaCl2-Tofu specimens showed more hardness (fracture force) than the GDL-Tofu samples. The results of sensory evaluation showed that addition of carageenan caused decreases in hardness and elasticity and increases in freshness and moisture of the samples, the effects being more pronounced in the GDL-Tofu specimens.
Conclusion: The types and amounts of hydrocolloids and coagulants, as well as interaction between them, in making Tofu can have important effects on its yield and quality parameters. In this study, carageenan (at a level of 0.1%) and GDL showed the best results.

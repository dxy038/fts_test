The flow of compressible and incompressible fluids through channels with wavy walls is encountered in many engineering applications. There have been attempts to predict the distribution of fluid parameters like pressure, temperature etc using numerical and experimental investigations. In some cases mass flow estimation is the objective of analysis and in other cases heat flux enhancement is the objective. The present study aims at finding the mass flux through channels of varying wall surface geometry. The flow behavior through wavy channels changes drastically as the spacing between surfaces is reduced. Hence, in present work channels with sinusoidal, triangular and rectangular wavy surfaces are considered. The effects of wavelength, amplitude and pressure ratio on flow rate through wavy channels are analyzed. Correlations for non-dimensional mass flux are proposed for sinusoidal, triangular, rectangular wavy channels, which may be used in case of crack geometry.

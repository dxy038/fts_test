This paper proposes soft-switching interleaved bidirectional DC-DC converter suitable for advanced vehicle Applications. The proposed converter integrates interleaved synchronous buck and ZVT-cell with a single resonant inductor. ZVS is guaranteed with wide load range in CCM as well as wide output voltage range by current injection method. Also, switching losses and reverse recovery effects can be minimized. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce diode drop voltage occurred during dead time of conventional synchronous buck converter. The validity of the proposed converter is verified through experimental results.

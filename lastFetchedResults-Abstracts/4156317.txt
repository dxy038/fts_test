When optimizing designs for practical electromagnetic problems, the number of design constraints and variables is increased drastically. The construction and step-by-step creation of an electrical system, in practice, is a trial and error process. The design may lead to a sub-optimal solution since the success of a design depends on the experience of the designer. Optimization requires that all design goals, of a device, be connected into a single objective function with all independent variables and constraints, In practice, effective pre-processing and post processing of data are necessary In addition to the requirements of high performance computing capabilities. To achieve this process, we propose the utilization of the generalized design optimization environment or the virtual designer described in this paper

Objective
Patients with haematoma secondary to middle cerebral artery aneurysm often require urgent surgical treatment consisting of evacuation of the haematoma and aneurysmal clipping.
Methods
. We present our experience over 5 years with 12 patients who underwent surgery before the first 8 h of bleeding. Surgery included craniotomy, evacuation of the haematoma, and aneurysmal clipping. Preoperative angiography was performed in all cases.
Results
All patients had a score of 4 or 5 on the scale of the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons. Five of the patients were evolving well after 1 year. Clinical status upon admission, temporal lobe versus sylvian location of the haematoma, right-hemisphere involvement, and a midline deviation of less than 2 cm, were all most frequently associated with a good prognosis.
Conclusions
In our experience, and in the literature available to us, early surgery in patients with haematoma secondary to middle cerebral artery aneurysm offers acceptable results in patients with World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scores of 4 or 5.

In this paper, we address the problem of topology control in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Taking energy consumption and reliability into account, we consider topology control to be a problem of multi-objective degree-constrained minimum spanning tree (mcd-MST) and present an improved discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for generating such topology schemes. The simulation results compared with genetic algorithm (GA) show that this algorithm could obtain higher robust structure and lower contention topology schemes.

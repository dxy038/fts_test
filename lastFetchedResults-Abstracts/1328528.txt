Background and Objective: In Iran, prenatal Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening of pregnant women and neonatal eye prophylaxis are not routine practice. The present research aimed to identify bacterial agents of neonatal conjunctivitis.
Materials & Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on all babies born over a period from April 2007 to April 2008 in Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences. Babies presenting clinical signs of erythema and edema of eyelid and purulent eye discharge were considered as clinical conjunctivitis. Specimens were obtained in all cases with conjunctivitis and were performed gram staining and cultures in specific media. A simple ELISA has been performed for measurement the immunoglobin M antibody to C. trachomatis and positive result rechecked by indirect immunoflurescent test.
Results: During the period of one year, 223 neonates have revealed bacterial conjunctivitis. The incidence rate of neonatal conjunctivitis was 2.8%. Chlamydia conjunctivitis was identified in 13.6% of cases and gonococcal conjunctivitis was identified in 5.5% of cases.
Discussion: The high incidence rate of Chlamydia and gonococcal conjunctivitis, have revealed that the eye prophylaxis from ophthalmia neonatorum is needed promptly.

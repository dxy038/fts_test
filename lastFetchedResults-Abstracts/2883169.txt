The objective of this methodology is to illustrate how one can separate the radar return signals from WiMAX communication signals, preventing interference of these two signals within the same frequency band. A parametric estimation technique will be presented to illustrate how these two signals can be separated. Because in this analysis, the frequency bandwidth of the WiMAX signal will be broader than the typical radar signal, one approach to achieve this separation would be to extrapolate the communication signal from the radar-free frequency bands into the interference band; subtracting the extrapolated and measured communications signal from the measured (combined radar and communications) signal in the time domain, would yield the un-obscured radar signal. Specifically, the noise free WiMAX signals will be approximated by the respective polynomial and then extrapolated to generate the truncated portion.

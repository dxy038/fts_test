Cloud computing is a new computing model that may offer numerous benefits to potential users. The sharing of dynamically scalable resources such as computing, storage, and infrastructure via the internet could enhance an organisationÂ´s growth through the reduction of IT costs. However, research has shown that cloud computing has various security and compliance concerns. The ancillary objective of this paper is to identify the security and compliance concerns that organisations are likely to encounter when choosing to adopt and use cloud services. Consequently, the main contribution of this paper is the identification of roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders who are central in addressing these security and compliance concerns in the cloud platform.

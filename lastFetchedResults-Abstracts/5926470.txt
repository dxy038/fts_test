Data fusion techniques combine data from multiple sensors and related information from associated databases, to achieve improved accuracies and more specific inferences than could be achieved by the use of a single sensor alone. Objective of this paper is to implement data association algorithms for target tracking based on range only measurements given by multiple sensors located at different positions using a TMS processor, first in a single target scenario and then in a multi-target scenario where ranges obtained from each sensor are required to be associated to the correct targets. In case of a single target multi-sensor (STMS) scenario, Gauss-Newton iterative method based Data Fusion is carried out to determine the target position. In case of multi-target multi-sensor (MTMS) scenario, each radar provides data regarding range of targets as detected by it. Considering all possible combinations of ranges, the probable fused target positions are estimated using Gauss-Newton technique. The near approximated fused position is then determined from probable positions by Minimum Mean Square Estimation (MMSE).

The two terms "objective" and "subjective" nowadays mean, respectively, "external" and "mental". But these terms in their primary usage in Middle Ages (from Dunes Scotos) have had exactly the opposite of today's meaning: "objective" has meant "mental" and "subjective" has meant "external". These old (and nowadays completely strange) meanings have been current in philosophical literature, especially in Descartes and his contemporaries, e. g. Spinoza and Berkley. This paper tends to argument that the word "objective" must be taken as meaning "mental" in Descartes' philosophy (and other philosophers' up to 19th century), and not to confused with its modern meaning (i. e. "external').

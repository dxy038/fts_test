The paper presents the design, implementation of the a unique type of computer controlled wireless mobile surveillance robot equipped with intelligence. Building an experimental autonomous mobile wireless vehicle, which has the ability to perform in real time environments is both a technical and scientific challenge and demands the development of systems for perception, modeling, planning and navigation. Within this scope, this paper describes the construction of a low cost mobile autonomous robot, intended for educational and surveillance purposes. This is a technology demonstration work. The objective of the work is to design, fabricate each part and construct a mobile robot and control it with a computer through wireless link which would accomplish two dimensional motion on a horizontal plane, moving from one place to another, avoiding obstacles in its path of motion by using infra-red sensors and performing the pick and place motion.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate various outcome measures of stimulation with highly purified subcutaneous follicle-stimulating hormone (Fertinex, a urofollitropin) compared with first- and second-generation urinary human menopausal gonadotropin standards (Pergonal, Metrodin).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis was restricted to our most efficient in vitro fertilization age group (23-34 years). Data from Institute for Assisted Reproduction in vitro fertilization cycles 1 through 11 with Pergonal, Metrodin, or both were tabulated for hormonal values, oocyte quality, and embryo outcome as baseline data. Patients in cycles 12 through 13 were treated with Fertinex and Pergonal or Fertinex alone and then reviewed for the same parameters.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-eight in vitro fertilization records with embryo transfer were analyzed. Clinical pregnancy rates per embryo transfer in an optimal age group were similar despite use of first- through third-generation urinary gonadotropin preparations: Pergonal and Metrodin, 67%; Metrodin, 64%; Fertinex and Pergonal, 62%; and Fertinex, 54%. There were no discernible differences in hormonal response, oocyte recovery, or embryonic growth.
CONCLUSION: Administered subcutaneously, the third-generation urinary gonadotropin preparation Fertinex is effective in in vitro fertilization treatment in young women. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:299-307.)

This paper studies the problem of optimizing the sum of multiple agents´ local convex objective functions, subject to global convex inequality constraints and a convex state constraint set over a network. Through characterizing the primal and dual optimal solutions as the saddle points of the Lagrangian function associated with the problem, we propose a distributed algorithm, named the distributed primal-dual subgradient method, to provide approximate saddle points of the Lagrangian function, based on the distributed average consensus algorithms. Under Slater´s condition, we obtain bounds on the convergence properties of the proposed method for a constant step size. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

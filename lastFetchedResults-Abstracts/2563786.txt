Introduction: Nowadays, rising of cancer prevalence has increased the importance of its treatment. Leukemia is the cancer of blood-forming tissues which derives from red and white blood progenitors cells. Prednisolone (Family members of glucocorticoid drugs) with anti-tumor and apoptotic effects has been considered by many researchers.
Objective: The aim of this study was the investigation of the effect of prednisolone on K562 cell line.
Materials and Methods: First, The K562 cells were cultured. After, by using different concentrations of prednisolone, anti-tumor properties of this drug on K562 cells was measured by MTT assay after 72 hours. Finally, Hoechst (33342) staining and DNA electrophoresis were used for study of apoptosis.  Data analysis was performed using SPSS software and ANOVA test (P < 0.05).
Results: In this study, anti-tumor effect of prednisolone on K562 leukemia cell line was confirmed. The results also showed that prednisolone, compared with the control group, had cytotoxic activity that is highest in 100ÂµM at 72 hours.Statistical analysis indicated that this drug inhibited the growth of K562 cells (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Based on the results, prednisolone is an effective agent for chronic myeloid leukemia therapy and prevention. We suggest that further studies on the effects of this drug on animal models and human be done.

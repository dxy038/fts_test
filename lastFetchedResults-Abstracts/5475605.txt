Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) have received much interest in recent years, as concerns about environmental quality, energy security and economic development have risen. Diverse strategies are adopted today by the industry to overcome the new challenges in this emerging market ranging from battery ownership, to charging, to demand response and to billing. However, strategy selection is not well designed and there isn´t a clear understanding of strategies´ impact on business. To support the critical strategy choices that the PEV industry faces, we present in this paper a framework for their objective assessment against success criteria. We identify and compare several competing strategies that can be adopted by key industry players such as auto and utility industries, as well as new entrants into the market. We then recommend directions industries should take in order to achieve business success.

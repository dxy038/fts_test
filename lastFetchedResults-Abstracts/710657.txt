Study objective
To understand factors influencing use and nonuse of contraception in young, low-income Latina adolescents through focus group conversations.
Design
We conducted seven focus group discussions with Latino females in an outpatient clinic and community setting. Qualitative data analyses techniques were used.
Setting
Participants were recruited from the outpatient gynecology clinic at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and from the Easter Seals Day Care Center.
Participants
Women were recruited if they were Latina and between the ages of 18â€“26 (n = 40).
Results
Due to lack of information and family beliefs prohibiting birth control use and sexual activity, sexually active teenagers had high rates of contraceptive non-use and relied on irregular use of condoms and withdrawal for pregnancy prevention. Following pregnancy, participants had greater access to contraception and more determination to use it. Yet, persistent use of withdrawal and irregular use of hormonal contraception may place Latina mothers at risk for repeat pregnancy.
Conclusions
Different approaches are needed for prevention of the first pregnancy compared to subsequent ones among Latino adolescents and young adults.

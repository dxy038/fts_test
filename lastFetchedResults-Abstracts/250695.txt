Robust design seeks an optimal solution where the design objective is insensitive to the variations
of input variables while the design feasibility under the variations is maintained. Accurate robustness
assessment for both design objective and feasibility usually requires an intensive computational effort. In
this paper, an accurate robustness assessment method with a moderate computational effort is proposed.
The numerical Gauss–Hermite integration technique is employed to calculate the mean and standard
deviation of the objective and constraint functions. To effectively use the Gauss–Hermite integration
technique, a transformation from a general random variable into a normal variable is performed.
The Gauss–Hermite integration and the transformation result in concise formulas and produce an
accurate approximation to the mean and standard deviation. This approach is then incorporated into
the framework of robust design optimization. The design of a two-bar truss and an automobile torque
arm is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results are compared with
the commonly used Taylor expansion method and Monte Carlo simulation in terms of accuracy and
efficiency.

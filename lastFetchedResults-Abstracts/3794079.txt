Supplementing the "AIEE Lightning Reference Book" and "Lightning Reference Bibliography 1936-1949," the present work lists 452 references on lightning and related subjects. New sections included are "Books and Bibliographies" and "Switching Surges." The objective has been a useful document for American transmission and development engineers rather than a complete listing of domestic and foreign references. For the engineer wanting more complete references, the "Supplement to Lightning Reference Bibliography 1950-1960" has been prepared and placed in the Engineering Societies Library. It contains an additional 571 references classified mostly as follows: (1) foreign language 58%, (2) foreign periodicals in English 22%, (3) cloud physics and meteorology 11%. The Supplement can be obtained from the library for the cost of copying it.

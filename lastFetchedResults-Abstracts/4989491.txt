The objective of unifying the electricity networks to create a single electricity market represents a complex process. Thus, it requires simplification. In last years, a large number of State Members consider transmission corridors being an optimal solution for integration into a common electricity market. Currently, real power exchanges between regions are achieved through another intermediary region. This paper contains an analysis of transmission cost allocation to market participants in case of indirect transfer using an interconnected system. Case study is carried on a real system, including west, southwest and northwest parts of the Romanian Power System.

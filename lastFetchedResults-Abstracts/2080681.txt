Objective
ential topical application of calcium and fluoride–phosphate solutions was reported to occlude open dentin tubules, mainly with fluoroapatite precipitates by a rapid ionic reaction, and to be effective at treating dentin hypersensitivity. However, its ability to reduce dentin permeability (Lp) is unknown. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of this treatment on Lp.
s
xtracted human third molars were sectioned transversely to obtain 0.5 mm-thick discs, which were then etched and rinsed. Aqueous solutions of 5% (w/w) disodium phosphate containing 0.3% (w/w) sodium fluoride (A) and 10% (w/w) calcium chloride (B) were prepared. The sequential application of the A&amp;B solutions was repeated three times on each disc, which was then rinsed with distilled water. The Lp of the discs was measured before and after the application using a modified Pashley's fluid flow measuring system. The differences in the Lp values between the conditions before and after the solution applications were analysed using a generalized estimating equation method and paired t-test. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the dentin surfaces.
s
ne discs consistently indicated reduced Lp following the application of the A&amp;B solutions. There was a significant decrease in the mean Lp [μL/(cm2 s cm H2O)] from baseline (−0.27 ± 0.25, p = 0.011). Overall, an average decrease of 34% Lp occurred after the application of the A&amp;B solutions. SEM observation indicated that the reaction products covered the entire dentin disc surface.
sion
plication of the A&amp;B solutions was effective at reducing the Lp of the dentin discs.

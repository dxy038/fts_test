In this paper, the average behavior of a bidirectional AC-DC converter is analyzed and simplified to an equivalent single-switch model. Based on this single-switch model, new current sensorless control without any current loop is developed and implemented. Compared with the conventional multi-loop control, the proposed current sensorless control is able to regulate DC-side voltage and yield sinusoidal current in phase with the AC input voltage simultaneously. The provided simulation and experiment results also demonstrate the proposed current sensorless control.

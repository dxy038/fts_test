In this model, there are some vehicles with unit capacity that travel between the machine and the holding area, and the waiting time of each job before processing can not be greater than a given upper bound. The batching machine has a capacity limit and incurs a processing cost. The objective is to minimize the sum of the total completion time and the total processing cost. We analyze the optimal properties and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We also provide a pseudo- polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem and prove that it is ordinarily NP-hard. Our work has implications for the coordination of production scheduling and transportation to improve ideal overall system performance in logistics and operations management, especially to reduce fuel consumption in the system with limited time constraint.

In this paper an outer rotor Interior Permanent Magnet generator for automotive applications is presented. The rotor geometry has been optimized by means of a Multi-Objective algorithm. The aim is to maximize the output power of the generator and to minimize the permanent magnet volume. In any case, the machine has to yield the largest constant power region after the base speed, so as the generator can operate at the nominal power for a wide speed region. The result of the optimization is the optimal Pareto front that gives a set of optimal solutions. After considering different rotor topologies, the criteria to select a proper machine are given.

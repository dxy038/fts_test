The first objective of this study is to understand the interaction between the industrial and agricultural sectors of Iran, and the second is to evaluate the relationship between tomato production, and the GDP industrial growth. It uses a simultaneous analysis of the impact of agricultural and industrial GDP on one another.
The data were collected from PDS information bank and FAO and cover the period 1978-2000. Estimation was done by the ordinary least squares (OLS) method and two-stage least squares (2SLS).
Results show that these sectors are complementary to each other, but agriculture tends to benefit more from industrial growth. Also, the results indicate that the tomato production can be affected by industrial growth, but the tomato production coefficient is small in tomato - dependent GDP industrial equation, meaning that tomato production has little impact on industrial growth.

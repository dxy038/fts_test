Conducting polymers are excellent candidates for applications in displays, mirrors, windows, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, near-infrared devices and electrochromic devices. From these potential applications, in this article, we will focus on the electrochromic polymers and devices. Although several objective studies have been conducted in the last decade, bringing to light many advantages over other types of electrochromics, polymeric electrochromics have not yet received the industrial attention that they deserve. One of the most important and dazzling advantages of polymers over the other types of electrochromics is the ease of modification of a polymer's backbone, that changes almost the entire properties of the material and switches many disadvantages into advantages. Our recent completion of the deficient third leg of additive primary colour space was a very good example of tailoring the polymer backbone. This discovery could be considered as one of the milestones of commercialization of polymeric electrochromics. In this article, we will also discuss the completion of the additive primary colours, red, green and blue (RGB), in polymeric electrochromics and their ways of commercialization.

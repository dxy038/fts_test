Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) can result in accumulation of soluble salts at or near the soil surface. In the southwestern USA, rainfall is usually inadequate for stand establishment, thus supplemental irrigation is necessary. Use of sprinklers to minimize salt concentrations near the soil surface is an alternative to using SDI for stand establishment. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of germination method (irrigation with SDI or sprinklers), depth of SDI tape (0.18 and 0.25 m), and irrigation water salinity (1.5 and 2.6 dS m−1) on salt and Br distribution after each of two consecutive growing seasons. Treatments consisted of factorial combinations of these three factors. Bromide was used to trace salt accumulation from the drip tape. After season 1, the highest salt concentrations (ECe up to 11 dS m−1) were in the top 3 cm of soil. Below 3 cm, soil EC dropped significantly and remained constant to 1.05 m. Similarly, Br concentrations were highest in the top 3 cm of soil. The mass of salt and Br recovered in the top 3 cm were significantly affected by tape depth, and water EC significantly affected salt mass. Salt present in the soil after season 1 adversely affected crop emergence in season 2, where SDI was used for stand establishment. After season 2, the highest salt and Br concentrations were at about 25 cm depth, probably due to ∼210 mm of rainfall that occurred near the end of the growing season. There were no significant differences among treatments in the mass of either salt or Br in the top 3 cm or 16 cm of the soil profile after season 2. Timely rainfall, transplanting rather than direct seeding, and changing bed geometry can reduce dependence on sprinklers for stand establishment.

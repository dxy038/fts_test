In recent years, due to environmental concerns together with rising costs of the fossil fuels, the wind energy usage in electricity generation of various countries has experienced a growing trend. Owing to inherent characteristics of wind turbines output generation, i.e. uncertainty in their output level as well as being undispatchable, the rapid growth of installed wind farms, however, has caused some new challenges in operation and planning studies of power systems. Among the major challenges in operation of high wind penetrated power systems, wind energy curtailment has been considered as an attractive ongoing area of research which can significantly determine the capacity credit of wind farms. In this regard, this paper at first tries to model the uncertainty in wind farms output level exploiting an analytical method and then it proposes an innovative fossil units redispatch algorithm as a short term solution in wind energy curtailment issues. The wind energy maximization is introduced as the objective function of the redipatch problem. In order to investigate the abilities of the proposed method in reducing the curtailment level of wind farms, various cases are applied to the modified IEEE 24 bus Reliability Test System (IEEE-RTS) and the obtained results confirms its applicability.

Bicycling is one of the most important modes of urban transportation in China. The objective of this study is to develop a procedure to identify the factors affecting travelersÂ´ choice of the park-and-ride trip mode. Two trip alternatives were considered, including the bicycling and the park-and-ride trip mode. In this study, a multinomial logit model structure was proposed and the use of the model was explained using a case study. The factors considered in the model include the travel time, travel cost, walking distance, the need for second transfer, and the health condition of travelers. Even though the data used for model specification was not real survey data, the modeling procedure proposed by this study can be followed by transportation planners to develop discrete choice models to help make various design decisions regarding the application of the park-and-ride mode.

In recent years, technical challenges are emerging on how to efficiently distribute the rapid growing user-generated contents (UGCs) with long-tailed nature. To address this issue, we have previously proposed cloud centric media network (CCMN) for cost-efficient UGCs delivery. In this paper, we further study the content placement problem in CCMN. Our objective is to minimize the monetary cost incurred by using cloud resources to orchestrate an elastic and global content delivery network (CDN) service. In particular, this objective is achieved via a two-step method. First, for a single content, we map it into a k-center problem, and find a logarithmic relationship between the mean hop distance from users to contents, and the reciprocal of replica number. Second, for multiple contents, we formulate a convex optimization with storage and bandwidth capacity constraints, which can be solved by our proposed algorithm. Finally, we verify the algorithm based on real-world traces collected from a popular video website in China. Our numerical results suggest that, the optimal number of replica for each content follows a power law in respect to its popularity, under feasible storage and bandwidth constraints, in a set of deployed backbone networks.

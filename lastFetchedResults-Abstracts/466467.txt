Objective: Our purpose was to determine the association of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) with the proinflammatory response among women in preterm labor. The binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with LBP and sCD14 activates macrophages at LPS concentrations up to 1000 times lower than required with LPS alone. LBP and sCD14 in amniotic fluid could explain the high concentrations of cytokines present in the amniotic fluid of culture-positive women and the presence of cytokines in the amniotic fluid of culture-negative women. Study Design: A cohort of 169 afebrile women in preterm labor with intact membranes had amniotic fluid collected by transabdominal amniocentesis for culture and for LBP, sCD14, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) determinations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 levels of >2 ng/mL were considered elevated. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance, multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction, and linear regression. Results: All 169 amniotic fluid samples had measurable LBP and sCD14. Subjects were categorized by amniotic fluid culture results and IL-6 concentration into 3 groups: (1) positive amniotic fluid culture, (2) negative amniotic fluid culture, elevated IL-6 concentration, and (3) negative amniotic fluid culture, low IL-6 level. Geometric mean LBP and sCD14 levels differed significantly among groups such that levels were approximately twice as high among pregnancies with positive amniotic fluid culture or elevated IL-6 compared with those without evidence of inflammation (both P< .001). sCD14 was inversely associated with enrollment gestational age independent of amniotic fluid culture results and IL-6 concentrations. Among culture negative, low IL-6 pregnancies, sCD14 decreased 3.5% for each additional week of gestation (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01%-6.4%; P = .02). LBP levels showed a similar trend in this group (P = .09). One hundred eleven subjects had detectable IL-6 levels. Among these subjects, IL-6 increased by 2.1-fold for every 10-fold increase in LBP (95% CI, 1.1-4.0; P = .02) and by 28.4-fold for every 10-fold increase in sCD14 (95% CI, 10.4-77.4; P< .001) with adjustment for gestational age by linear regression. Conclusions: LBP and sCD14 are present in amniotic fluid of preterm pregnancies and are linearly associated with amniotic fluid IL-6 concentrations. These molecules may amplify the cytokine response and thereby help explain the presence of cytokines in amniotic fluid when culturable quantities of microbes are absent.

Objective: Squamous cell carcinoma comprises approximately 94% of all oral cancers. One reason for this cancer is human papilloma virus (HPV) and its different genotypes. Determining the most common genotypes can assist with control and prevention of squamous cell carcinoma.
Methods: We obtained 70 paraffin blocks from the Oncology Department at Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran. All samples included the histopathological report of dysplastic lesions. Samples were deparaffinated. Four primers were designed for PCR of samples. Positive samples were sequenced.
Results: We have observed that 8 samples were HPV posetive, from which there were 3 HPV6 and 5 HPV16. HPV6 is one source for genital warts that can be spread by skin contact or oral-sexual behavior. There were 3 positive samples found in women, whereas the remainder were from men (2% more in men). People between the ages of 30 to 45 have increased sensitivity for HPV compared to the other group. People up to 60 years of age are also sensitive. All samples have been collected from different cities in Iran, however most of the positive samples were found in Tehran and Islam Shahr. 
Conclusion: These data confirmed that HPV infection with high risk types (6, 16) could be one of the risk factors for oral cancer which could be spread by genital warts.

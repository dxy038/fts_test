The general objective of this presentation is to demonstrate the great potential of III-V semiconductor -membrane photonic devices, with a special emphasis on InP and related materials in the prospect of new developments in the field of micro-nano-photonics. Various classes devices will be presented, which will have the communality of being based on the use of high index contrast structuration of semiconductor materials. The structuration is achieved vertically for the first class, by forming thin semiconductor membranes surrounded by low optical index material, or laterally for the second class via a two-dimensional (2-D) lateral structuration of the membranes (thus, resulting in 2-D photonic crystal (PC) structures); both structurations are also combined, according to a "2.5-dimensional" approach, which should broaden considerably the combinations of functionality beyond those presently contemplated with the two first classes. The general technological scheme of the membrane approach is fully compatible with planar technology which is widely in use in the world of silicon microelectronics and with heterogeneous integration of III-V active microphotonic devices with silicon microphotonics and microelectronics (e.g., molecular bonding of InP active membranes on silica on silicon substrate). A variety of devices will be presented, featuring micro-lasers based on 2-D PC micro-cavities as well as on 2-D Bloch modes (2-D distributed-feed-back micro-laser) for in plane and surface emission.

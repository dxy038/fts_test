During 1950' and I960', Tehran painting biennial exhibitions paid little effort in development and verification of modernistic painting in Iran. The first objective of these biennials was to introduce modern art to the Iranian cultural community, which followed the same common aim in all five periods of biennial. Another aim of this event was the unity of following western avant-garde styles and freedom of art creation. However, these aims were not able to influence the main part of the community in biennials and led to failure. Actually, these biennials were not directed toward social needs and demands and didn't make deep effort and subtle investigation in introducing modernistic painting to the society; therefore, they couldn't gain public acceptance and satisfaction. In fact, organizers, sponsors and referees of these biennials maintained different objectives and policies, sometimes without any cultural and artistic motivations which were not consistent with cultural and aesthetic needs. So they were not appreciated or welcomed by the audience. Despite all these defects, biennials had a great influence on the verification of modernistic painting so that after eight years, they could obtain certain achievements and innovations by gathering modern artists with more powerful goals and motives. Among modernists, there were certain artists who could create a bridge between the past and present by leaning on artistic traditions and giving an independent identity to their modern artistic movements apart from biennial exhibitions. The significant effort of these artists was to get rid of absolute imitation of Western contemporary art and achieve limited innovations by making use of visual national-religious elements. Practice of this group of artists was entitled as "Sagha-khaneh School" and "Calligraphy- Painting". This type of painting was developed in extended forms in future decades.

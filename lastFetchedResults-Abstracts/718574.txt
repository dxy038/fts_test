Background and Objective: Considering the increasing, nowadays, trend toward aesthetic surgeries, this study is aimed to evaluate the relationship between body image and request and tendency toward rhinoplasty in female students.
Subjects and Methods: The research sample was consisted of 111 young female students, of which, 26 had done rhinoplasty before, 34 were willing to do it in the future, 27 had no tendency toward it, and 24 were referred to the rhinoplasty clinic. BICI Questionnaire was used to measure body image. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe post hoc test. 
Results: The results showed that there are significant difference between students who are not surgical and reluctant to have surgery and students who have not had surgery but tend to do and students have referred for cosmetic surgery, in terms of body image.
Conclusion: The rhinoplasty candidates are better to be evaluated before any surgical intervention regarding their body image and any possible mental issues that may need to be addressed professionally.

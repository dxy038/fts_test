Linear regression-stepwise technique was used to test the research hypotheses of this study. The result indicated that the intention to use electric vehicles in Malaysia can be explained by environmental concern, consumer knowledge, psychological benefits and demographics. This paper is a useful source of information on the consumer intention for automotive players planning to market electric vehicles in Malaysia. It offers practical guidelines for formulation of marketing strategies that will address the real wants and needs of their future clients. Policy makers should address the appropriate intervention and policy to encourage the growth of electric vehicles in Malaysia as part of the strategy to increase energy efficiency and to reduce emissions and the reliance on fossil fuel within the transportation sector.

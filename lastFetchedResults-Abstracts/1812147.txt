Background
vascular (CV) risk factors are influenced by behavioral, cultural, and social factors, suggesting that acculturation plays a significant role in the emergency and growth of chronic disease. The objective of this study was to determine the relation between CV risk factors and the main components of acculturation, in Yaquis and Tepehuanos Indians from Mexico.
s
as a cross-sectional population-based study in Yaquis and Tepehuanos communities from the Yaqui Valley in Sonora and the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in Durango, in northwest Mexico. Acculturation status is different in both ethnic groups, with Tepehuanos living in small and remote communities retaining their traditional lifestyle and Yaquis living in well-communicated communities that have assumed Westernized lifestyles.
s
l of 278 indigenous (120 Tepehuanos and 158 Yaquis) were randomly enrolled. Prevalence of obesity (48.1 and 6.7%, p &lt;0.001), diabetes (18.3 and 0.83%, p &lt;0.001), hypertriglyceridemia (43.0 and 15.0%, p &lt;0.001), alcohol consumption (46.8 and 26.6%, p &gt;0.001), and smoking (29.7 and 15.0%, p = 0.006) were significantly higher in Yaquis Indians. High blood pressure (6.3 and 3.3%, p = 0.40) and low HDL-cholesterol (42.4 and 34.2%, p = 0.22) were similar between Yaquis and Tepehuanos. Multivariate regression analysis adjusted by sex and age showed a significant association between calorie intake from saturated fat, but not other nutrients of customary diet, with hyperglycemia (OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.6–20.1), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5–6.3), and obesity (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.6–10.1).
sions
the components of acculturation, intake of saturated fat is the most strongly associated with the development of CV risk factors.

This paper presents an analytical approach for evaluating network costs caused by integrating wind power. This approach is based on a network optimization method for long-term transmission network planning using Genetic Algorithms (GA), which calculates networks with minimum costs in an objective manner. A case study for the northern German transmission network shows a significant rise in costs depending on the amount of installed wind generation capacity. Additionally, network costs are analyzed for different wind situations. The results are used to discuss different possibilities for TSOs to handle this development.

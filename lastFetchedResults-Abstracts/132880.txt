Background : Aging is associated with changes in drugs responsiveness.
Objective: To determine the effects of aging on cholinergic and adrenergic systems of rat isolated atrium.
Methods:In this study isolated atrium of male albino rats were prepared. The rats were randomly selected & divided into 3 groups of 10-20 days (A), 2 months (B) & over 6 months old (C) (6<n<10). Determining the Ed50 of acetylcholine, epinephrine, atropin & propranolol , their contraction responses were measured.
Finding:The sensitivity of muscarinie acetylcholine receptors (m-AdRs) decreased and that of Beta-Adrenergic receptors (Beta-AdRs) increased in relation to age. ED50 of Acetylcholine of the were 9.8*10^-8 , 1.7-*10^-4 and 1.5x 104 respectively , while the ED50 of Adrenaline in the
same groups of rats were 1.2* 10^-6 , 1.69x I 0^-7 and 2.99* 10^-6 respectively. The maximum
responses for m-AchRs and (Beta)-Adrs, were observed in 2-6 & 6-12 months old rats.
Conclusion : The changes of responsiveness (decrease in cholinergic system & increase in adrenergic system) appear to be the result of age-related changes in cholinergic and adrenergic neuromuscular transmission.

The research presented in this paper focuses on the conceptual design of an innovative Air Traffic Management (ATM) system featuring automated 4-Dimensional Trajectory (4DT) Planning, Negotiation and Validation (4-PNV) functionalities to enable Intent Based Operations (IBO). In order to meet the demanding requirements set by national and international organisations for the efficiency and environmental sustainability of air transport operations, a multi-objective 4DT optimization algorithm is introduced that represents the core element of the 4DT planning functionality. The 4-PNV system interacts with airborne avionics also developed for 4DT-IBO such as the Next Generation Flight Management System (NG-FMS) on-board manned aircraft and Next Generation Mission Management System (NG-MMS) for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). In this article we focus on the 4-PNV algorithms, and specifically on the multi-objective 4DT optimization algorithm for strategic and tactical online operations. Simulation case studies are carried out to test the key system performance metrics such as 4DT computational time in online tactical Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) operations.

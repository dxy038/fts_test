The paper presents a back propagation based artificial neural network learning algorithm for recognizing human faces. We have worked on eight features for recognition. A facial recognition system has been proposed to recognize registered faces in the database &amp; new faces that are not part of the database. The basic objective is to understand the ability of back propagation learning algorithms for face recognition task. Few experimental observations have also been provided.

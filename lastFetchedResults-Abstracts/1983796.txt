Soil organic carbon is one of the most important soil characteristics, and any changes in its ‎content and composition, affects soil physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. ‎Enhancing soil organic carbon improves soil structure, increases water and nutrients in ‎soils, reduces soil erosion and degradation and thus greater productivity of plants and ‎water quality are expected in watersheds and ultimately soil and ecosystem reclamation ‎happens. Climatic, topographic and managerial factors affect soil organic carbon content. ‎In local scale, climatic factors have not high efficiency on soil organic carbon and ‎topographic factors play more important role compared to climate on soil organic carbon ‎variability. The objective of this study was to predict and evaluate the effects of ‎topographic factors such as elevation, slope percent, aspect, hill shade, and curvature on ‎the soil organic carbon content of a rangeland in Mereg watershed, Kermanshah, Iran. ‎Stepwise Multi Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were ‎employed to develop models to predict soil organic carbon. A Multi-Layer Perceptrons ‎‎(MLP) ANN with back-propagation error algorithm was applied to this research. The ‎result showed that the multi linear regression and ANN models explained 53 and 77 ‎percent of the total variability of soil organic carbon, respectively. The calculated RMSE ‎and MBE were 0.40 and 0 for the MLR and 0.16 and 0.003 for MLP models. Results ‎indicated that designated ANN model with 5-9-1 arrange was more feasible than multi ‎linear regression for predicting soil organic carbon. Elevation with 0.79, hill shade with ‎‎0.64 and slope percent with 0.24, were identified as the important factors that explained ‎the variability of soil organic carbon.‎

Rational functions have been introduced into the performance analysis and evaluation of stochastic discrete event systems. In this paper we consider the problem of real rational function approximation. We are given a strictly proper real rational function with denominator degree equal to n, and the objective is to generate lower order rational function approximations. We suggest a system theoretic approach for generating such approximations and in addition provide error bounds

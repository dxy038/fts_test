In this work an analysis of four methods for temporal displacement measurement of ultrasonic echoes is presented, to determine their precision and sensibility to different noise levels, with the main objective to evaluate their potential application on non invasive internal temperature estimation. Procedures and methodologies to perform this analysis are described, using different ultrasonic signals acquired, in the hyperthermia temperature range (25 - 50degC), from biologic media that mimic soft tissue. Finally obtained results with each method are shown and a conclusion about methods performance is exposed.

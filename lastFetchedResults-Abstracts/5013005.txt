We present a compact antenna assembly for UUVs (unmanned undersea vehicles) that supports UHF line of sight (LOS), DAMA (demand assigned multiple access) and MUOS (mobile user objective system) SATCOM communications. We have incorporated new size reduction and performance enhancing techniques to create one wideband, small volume antenna assembly that can be mounted directly to the UUV mast. The antenna achieves an electromagnetic performance that enables an efficient solution to be realized for UUV RF communications without the need for expensive antenna beam steering electronics. A proof of concept version of the compact mast mount antenna assembly with form factor suitable for integration on a 21" UUV, has been prototyped and tested.

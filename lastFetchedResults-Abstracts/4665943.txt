The objective of this paper, is to compare two mathematical model order reduction (MOR) approaches - Balanced Truncation and Krylov subspace. The application of these approaches to large power systems is studied. The main focus has been to show how the two approaches are effective in finding dynamic patterns such as coherency between generators. The performance has been studied under changing system damping conditions.

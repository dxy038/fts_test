Background & Objective: Inflammatory markers predictive of Cardio - Vascular disease than lipid profile in the diagnosis of these diseases are highly sensitive. Provide a suitable model for determining the type of training will play an important role in public health. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two methods of intermittence and continuative exercise on new and traditional inflammatory indices of cardio â€“vascular system in women.
Material & Methods: This quasi-experimental study involved the population of women (aged 35 - 45 years old) in Kashan, Iran. Among volunteers for participating in the study, 20 were selected as samples and randomly assigned into two groups: intermittence (N=10), and Continuative Exercise (N=10).
The training program was run for 8 weeks and 3 sessions per week. Blood samples were obtained from Subjects before starting an exercise program and 24 hours after the last session under 14-hour fasting.
Data were analyzed by using Kolmogorov - Smirnov, Independent and dependent t-test to investigate the changes between and within groups at a significance level of 0/05 through SPSS.16 software.
Results: After 8 weeks, in two groups of periodic training and continuing significant reduction Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), High Sensitive C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), Total Cholesterol (TC) in serum and the High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) were significantly improved in both groups.
However, the Triglyceride (TG) and very low density lipoprotein Cholesterol (VLDL-C) in both groups after 8 weeks of training did not significantly change.
Conclusion: Both the Continuative and intermittence aerobic exercise was associated with a significant reduction in TC, hs- CRP, and LDL-C and significant increase in HDL-C. There was no significant difference between two methods of training on traditional and new inflammatory indices of Cardio - Vascular disease

The computation of the optimal operating profile for batch processes through the maximum principle depends on the model involved. The real process, however may deviate from the assumed model due to external disturbances or parameter variations. In this paper we examine the effect of the above on the value of the objective function, when the nominal optimal policy is applied, as well as the effect on the optimum of the objective function. We present relations between quantities of the perturbed and the nominal problems and demonstrate their use through a number of examples.

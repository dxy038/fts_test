Despite the widespread application of the concept of quality of life in mental health evaluation, it has been observed that subjective quality of life measures do not reliably capture changes expected to result from intervention efforts. Moreover, because the domains selected to assess subjective life quality are typically generated by investigators or health professionals, the validity of subjective quality of life measures has also been questioned. Although it represents a conceptual shift from investigator-generated domains to client-elicited domains, it is suggested that a client-elicited approach to measuring subjective quality of life may provide fruitful avenues for resolving some of the conceptual and practical issues associated with understanding and measuring the impact of community-based programs on clients with serious mental illness. Accordingly, while acknowledging the utility of assessing the objective circumstances of people's lives, this paper suggests that client-elicited subjective quality of life domains have the potential to resolve the failure of existing measures to register meaningful change. Unlike previous general reviews of quality of life that have emphasized measurement issues, the present review considers some of the fundamental barriers to our ability to adequately understand and document the experiences of people adjusting to community living with a psychiatric disability.

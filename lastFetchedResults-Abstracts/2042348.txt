The use of ultrasound to enhance the transport phenomena in food processes has been well recognised in recent times. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sonication on hydration rate and pasting profile of navy beans. The hydration kinetics for control and ultrasound assisted soaking was mathematically described using mechanistic (Fickian diffusion) and empirical (Peleg’s equation, Weibull model and First Order equation) models. Ultrasound enhanced the rate of hydration which was evident from the plot of kinetic data and model parameters. The effective diffusivities for water transport without and with ultrasound application were estimated to be 1.36 × 10−10 m2/s and 2.19 × 10−10 m2/s respectively, considering Fickian diffusion. The Weibull model was concluded to best predict the hydration kinetics of navy beans in an ultrasonic field. Significant increase in peak viscosity of sonicated bean powder was observed compared to control.

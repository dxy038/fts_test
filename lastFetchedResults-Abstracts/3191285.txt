This paper describes the state of the art and future trends of adaptive protection systems, aimed at strengthening the penetration of Dispersed Generation (DG) units considering bidirectional power flows, while improving their operational behaviour within high network reliability and stability levels. Short-circuit currents, anti-islanding detection, voltage, current and frequency safe operation limits are addressed within the Distribution Grid Area concept.

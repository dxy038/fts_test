The paper concerns the task allocation problem for dynamic mesh structured systems. Three allocation algorithms have been evaluated, including well-known Full Search (FS), and Window-Stack Based Algorithm (WSBA) as well as Random Node Check (RNC) designed by the authors. The objective of the paper was a comparison of algorithms efficiencies on the basis of the results of simulations made using multi platform experimentation system designed and implemented in Python environment. The reported investigations have shown that the WSBA algorithm seems to be the most promising.

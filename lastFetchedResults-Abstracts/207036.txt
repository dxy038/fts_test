The objective of this paper is to minimize makespan in a single bottleneck no-wait m-machine flowshops with lot streaming. Lot streaming is splitting a lot in sublots (or transfer batches) to move the completed portion of production sublots to downstream machines so that operations can be overlapped. We present a heuristic method for splitting lots and computational results indicate that this heuristic method has optimal solution in 98% problems with difference less than 0.013%. Comparison of this heuristic method with a linear programming (LP) model shows that CPU time in this method is 30 times less than linear programming.

The main objective of this review is to apportion current and new insight into the biodistribution, radiopharmacokinetics, dosimetry and cell targeting of rhenium-188 labeled radiopharmaceuticals used as therapeutic drugs. The emphasis lies on the generator obtained rhenium-188, its physical, therapeutic, dosimetric and coordinated compounds. Its use in radioimmunotherapy for lymphoma and other hematological diseases with monoclonal antibodies is discussed. Radiolabeled peptides to target cell receptors are an important field in nuclear medicine and in some research facilities are already being used, especially, somatostatin, bombesin and other peptides. Small molecules labeled with 188Re are promising as therapeutic drugs. A review about some of the non-specific targeting molecules with therapeutic or pain palliation effect such as phosphonates, lipiodol, microparticles and other interesting molecules is included. Research on the labeling of biomolecules with the versatile rhenium-188 has contributed to the development of therapeutics with favorable pharmacokinetic and dosimetric properties for cancer treatment.

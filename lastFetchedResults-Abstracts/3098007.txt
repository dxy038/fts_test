Web2.0 intranet communities constitute one of the ways the IBM software group addresses the issue of identifying, managing, and employing software group intellectual capital. Members of these communities share practices and interests, and are encouraged to collaborate across all organization and software brands. This presentation objective is to provide a frame for conceptualizing and assessing the organization, use, design, and value of social networking communities in a business organization. The presentation will also demonstrate ways these communities can be used in the larger context of the information economy.

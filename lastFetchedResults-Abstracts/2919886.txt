In order to obtain bidirectional working, additional splitters or WDM multiplexers need to be installed on the fibre, either by splicing or by the use of optical connectors. The authors describe a novel transceiver design in which the separation of send and receive signals is performed after the incoming signal has passed through the `send´ laser. This technique, `optical feedthrough´, enables bidirectional links to be configured without the need for line side components such as couplers, thereby reducing costs and network complexity. Two systems are described, one operating in a WDM mode transmitting digital data at 2 and 140 Mbit/s, and an alternative technique employing similar wavelengths for both directions but using analogue subcarrier modulation to provide simultaneous telephony channels

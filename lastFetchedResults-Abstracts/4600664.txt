Considering a tandem network of queues (each representing the buffer in a router) our objective is to allow each individual queue to dynamically control its own parameters (in this paper the buffer size) using only information available locally and from neighboring nodes. For each node we adopt control approaches that are based on Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) estimates of certain performance measures. In this family of approaches we investigate collaboration schemes that can lead us to global optimal (or near optimal) solutions. The contribution of the paper is the design of a simple protocol that allows neighboring nodes to collaboratively exchange information in order to converge to a global optimal solution.

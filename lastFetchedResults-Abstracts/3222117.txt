The frequency of natural disasters has been increasing for the last 30 years in the world, having caused great damages and losses. Among those damages and losses, about 90 % are concentrated in the Asian region where natural disasters bring about the loss of lives, property, employment and damage to the physical infrastructure and the environment. Disaster management (DM) including disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts aim to minimize or avoid the potential losses from hazards, assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims of disaster, and achieve rapid and effective recovery. While data, information, knowledge and resources sharing can enhance the process of DM, there is a perceived gap in government collaboration and coordination within the context of natural DM. The objective of this paper is to present the literature findings on success factors that ensure the quality of government information sharing (GIS) in supporting effectively DM. Accordingly the identified factors were classified into major categories, namely political leadership support, inter-agency collaboration, individual agency capacity including ICT, and agency benefits.

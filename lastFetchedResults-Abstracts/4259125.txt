We consider dynamic resource allocation (DRA) for the reverse-link of a multiuser packet DS-CDMA system with voice and data traffic. Our objective is to minimize the total received power for voice users, and allocate all remaining power to data users so as to maximize throughput. The performance of a DRA scheme depends on how frequently resources are reassigned. We compare the performance of an "aggressive" scheme, in which the processing gain (PG) is reassigned to all users each time a packet arrives or departs, with "timid" schemes, in which the PG cannot be changed in the middle of a packet ("packet-timid") or a session ("flow-timid"). For the parameters considered, our results show that aggressive and packet-timid DRA perform similarly. Flow-timid DRA performs significantly worse than the other two schemes, and the difference in performance increases with traffic intensity.

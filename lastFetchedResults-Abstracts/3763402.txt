An approach for online identification and control that requires weaker excitation than the existing approaches based on least-squares schemes and closed-loop systems is examined. It uses multiple-objective optimization theory to resolve the conflict between identification and controller performance as they compete for the only available resource, the inputs to the aircraft. The approach is applied to a longitudinal model of a representative linearized high-performance aircraft model. Simulation results compare the final controller with a conventional gain-scheduled pitch command augmentation system. It is demonstrated that by allowing some control input to be given to the identification process, the controllerÂ´s overall performance is improved.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The development and application of an interactive multiple-objective linear programming algorithm are considered. The displaced worst compromise is used as a reference point, to select the most preferred decision alternative. This point represents the undesired target values, which a decision-maker would prefer to avoid. To reflect the dynamics of a decisionmakerÂ´s preferences, use is made of the concept of a displaced point which captures changes of reference during the decision process. An illustrative example is presented to show the process of reaching a final compromise decision

The cooling system of the superconducting toroidal field coil for the Next European Torus fusion reactor was investigated as part of the preliminary design activity. This system is based on the two-in-hand double-pancake-winding technique. The main objective of this study, based on the NET double- configuration, was the evaluation of the cooling characteristics during normal operation of the coil, under steady-state conditions, and the quench characteristics, assuming correct operation of the protection system. Results of the analysis have shown that the proposed cooling system is adequate and no critical condition occurs during a quench.

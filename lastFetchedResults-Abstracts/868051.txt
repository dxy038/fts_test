In this article, we obtain a better timer design for a pretimed traffic signal of an intersection located in the urban area of Touliu, Taiwan, by using computer simulation. The objective of this study is to reduce the average waiting time per approaching vehicle during peak hours by redesigning the current signal timer. The validation procedure of a simulation model and the application of orthogonal arrays in experiments are briefly reviewed, and the data collection and output analysis procedure are presented. From the result of this study, a better signal timer design for this intersection is proposed. If the signal timer is appropriately set, the average waiting time per vehicle of this intersection during peak hours is expected to have a reduction of about 20.74%.

The Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem. A salesman collects a prize for each visited city and pays a penalty for each non visited city. The objective is to minimize the sum of the travel costs and penalties, but collecting a minimum pre-established amount of prizes. This problem is here addressed by a simple, but efficient tabu search approach which had improved several upper bounds of the considered instances.

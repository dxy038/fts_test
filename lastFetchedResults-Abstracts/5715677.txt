The principal objective of the standard IEC 61508 is to development of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic (E/E/PE) safety-related systems so that functional safety is achieved. IEC 61508 aims to encompass all those factors which influence functional safety. These include the design and implementation of the hardware and software of the E/E/PE safety-related systems as well as the impact of human factors and management at all stages of the safety life cycle from initial concept through to eventual decommissioning

Distributed Video Coding (DVC) is an emerging video coding technology that utilizes the distributed source coding principles to build very low cost video encoders, yet with remarkable error resilience. In the common DVC framework, the reconstruction function plays a vital role that has a direct impact on the output video quality. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for the reconstruction function, particularly focusing on the unidirectional DVC architecture. The proposed technique exploits the variations of the bit error rate of the Wyner-Ziv decoded bit stream and the side information stream. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields a significant improvement of the objective and subjective video quality at no additional bit rate cost.

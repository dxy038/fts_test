Optimize the output power from Photovoltaic system (PV system) is an important issue in using efficiency renewable energy sources. The purpose of this paper is to investigate a method to optimize the output power from the system. And the method is applied to calculate energy produced in Hanoi city in year 2009. In order to calculate the output power and the annual energy from Photovoltaic array, an hybrid system is built and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The use of equivalent switching boost converter is performed with the objective of calculating the power generated by the PV system and estimating the losses in the components of the converter during a given time. Also, there is a comparison between the using of boost converter circuit with Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) generator which controls the state of the MOSFET in the converter and its equivalent. The comparison proved that it could be applied to compute losses for a long period with the equivalent circuit.

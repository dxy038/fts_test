BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Worldwide hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 300 million persons infected. Health care workers are at higher risk for HBV infection. Vaccination and then evaluation of their antibody response is important for viral control. This study was done to evaluate anti HBS response following HBV vaccination in health care workers of Yahyanejad hospital in Babol.
METHODS: This descriptive and analytical study was performed on 220 health care workers of Yahyanejad hospital. Anti HBS and anti HBC positive cases were excluded from the study. HBSAb was measured in all cases 3 months after the latest vaccination.
FINDINGS: From 204 cases, non responders were seen in 52(25%) cases. Poor and good responders were seen in 18 (41.9%) and 25(22.9%) males and in 25 (58.1%) and 84 (77.1%) females, respectively (p<0.05). Totally, 74.5% were antibody positive.
CONCLUSION: Health care workers are at high risk group for HBV infection. The non-responders need additional vaccination.

Background : Colorectal cancers  (CRCs) tumors are diagnosed by  microsatellite instability (MSI) due to  accumulation of insertion/deletion mutations in tandem repeats of short DNA motifs (1 - 6bp) called  microsatellites.Microsatellite instability (MSI) is not only a halkmark marker for screening of hereditary  nonpolyposis colorectal cancer(HNPCC),but also a prognostic and predictive marker for sporadic colorectal cancer.Our objective was to determine and study the status of five mononucleotide microsatellite  status among Iranian patients with sporadic colorectal cancer .
Material and Methods : In the current investigation 80 sporadic CRC  patients were evaluated for MSI. The pentaplex panel consisting of 5 quasi mononucleotide microsatellite markers (NR-21,BAT-26,BAT-25,NR-27 and NR-24) was used .
Results: Our findings reveals  that the NR-21 was the most frequent unnstable marker among the other markers (23%).69.6% of  specimens had instability in sporadic colorectal cancer.Furthermore,the frequency of instability BAT-25 was determined in 20% sporadic CRC  samples .Interestingly our results demonstrated that the frequency of instability NR-24 was 20% that was so close to istability of BAT-25 Marker. Moreover,percentage of NR-27  was  0% in sporadic CRC.Finally , we could find 6.6% instability for BAT-26 in sporadic cases.
Conclusion : It seems that among 5 mononucleotide markers NR-21 was the most useful marker for determining the status  of  sporadic colorectal  cancer.Following NR-21,BAT-25 and NR-24 are the most effective  markers.Therefore using a triple panel consisting 3 mentioned MSI markers shoud be more promising markers for identifying MSI status in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.

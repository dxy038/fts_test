A new configuration and control mechanism for an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with a bidirectional cycloconverter are described. When commercial AC power is operating normally, the load is supplied by commercial AC power and the bidirectional cycloconverter operates as a battery charger. During interruptions of commercial AC power, the bidirectional cycloconverter operates as an inverter and supplies AC power to the load. Unlike conventional UPS, this new configuration does not require a battery charger, so it can be small, light-weight, cost-effective, and highly efficient. The output characteristics during the commercial AC power interruptions are also discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Introduction & Objective: Due to the patients’ growing interest in the use of dental implants, medical staff should be completely aware of treatment success and prognostic factors to pre-vent failures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different crown to im-plant ratio (C / I Ratio) in the posterior areas of the maxilla and mandible as one of the most important principles of biomechanics on marginal bone loss around the implant neck (MBL).
Material & Methods: This study was conducted as a prospective cohort study. In this study, pa-tients treated at a private dental implants office during the years 2013-2014 were selected. Parallel digital radiographs 6 months and 12 months after loading the implants were measured to evaluate the effects of prosthetic implants on posterior areas of the maxillary and mandibu-lar crowns by a digital caliper. All patients were evaluated radiographically and data were col-lected and analyzed by SPSS 16 with non parametrical tests.
Results: A total of 48 fixtures of SIC Implant System in 18 patients, including 28 pcs in max-illa and 20 pcs in mandible were evaluated. Statistical analysis of marginal bone level around the implant neck in radiograpy taken showed no significant difference in the effect of differ-ent C/I Ratio of marginal bone loss around implants (P=0.094). Comparison of posterior areas of the maxilla and mandible also showed no difference between the effects of different amounts of C/I Ratio of the marginal bone.
Conclusion: The present study showed that the marginal bone loss was not statistically signifi-cant after the placement of implants in the posterior region of the jaw with a different range of crown – to- implant ratio from 0.87 to 2.55. Thus, it seems that there is no relationship be-tween marginal bone loss around the implant neck with different proportions of crown - im-plant and with the location of the treatment (P > 0.05).

The body of revolution (BoR) moment method is used to do the optimization design of circular aperture horn. The symmetrical excitation results in the field distribution to be E<sub>0m</sub> modes of a circular waveguide on the aperture. This aperture field distribution produces the circular symmetrical hollow conical beam which is required for the shell-borne millimeter wave fuze. To increase the degree of the freedom in the design, a conducting annular bulge is placed on the inner wall of the horn. The location and the size of this structure, the size of the horn are parameters to be optimized. The objective of the optimization is the shape of the radiation pattern. The extremely high computational efficiency of BoRMoM makes the optimization realizable. The comparison between the numerical results from BoRMoM and HFSS&#8482; shows good agreement. The designed antenna is useful to enhance the warhead-fuze matching effectiveness of shell-borne fuze.

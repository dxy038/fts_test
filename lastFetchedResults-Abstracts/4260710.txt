We present a computational model of creative design based on collaborative interactive genetic algorithms. We test our model on floorplanning. We guide the evolution of floorplans based on subjective and objective criteria. The subjective criteria consists of designers picking the floorplan they like the best from a population of floorplans, and the objective criteria consists of coded architectural guidelines. We support collaboration by allowing individual designers to view each othersÂ´ designs during the evolutionary process and the sharing of designs via case injection. This methodology supports team design, and reflects the view of creativity that collaboration accounts for much of our intelligence and creativity. We present a description of the model and a comparative study of floorplans created individually versus collaboratively. Our results show that floorplans created collaboratively were considered to be more ldquorevolutionaryrdquo and ldquooriginalrdquo than those created individually.

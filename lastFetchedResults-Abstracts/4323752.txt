In this paper, a novel radio admission control (RAC) scheme is proposed for handling multiclass services in Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. An objective function of maximizing the number of admitted users is proposed to evaluate the system capacity. To solve the optimization problem, we present a combined complete sharing (CS) and virtual partitioning (VP) resource allocation model and develop a service degradation scheme in case of resource limitations in the proposed RAC scheme. Call blocking probability, system resource utilization and system capacity are used as performance metrics and are evaluated by using a K-dimensional Markov Chain model. Numerical results show that an optimal proportion of resource deployment for different service groups can be identified to maximize system capacity while at the same time maintaining quality of service (QoS) constraints of all admitted users.

One of the modular design´s objective is to obtain an appropriate product modular platform, which can offer a large variety of product quickly to satisfy customer´s need. A new product modular platform design´s method, which combines the simulated annealing (SA) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, is proposed in this paper. An optimization function for elements clustering, based on the axiomatic design theory, is established. The optimization process of modular platform design is given by particular analysis. This optimization approach is tested several times with an example and compared with PSO algorithms. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approaches.

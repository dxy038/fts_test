A set of video signal processor VLSIs has been developed using 2-&#956;m p-well CMOS technology. These VLSIs perform bidirectional transformation between NTSC (National Television System Committee) composite video signals and component video signals, both of which contain luminance signals and two kinds of color signals. A special circuit configuration is used for the line memory, and an automatic layout program for uniformly structured circuits is developed for the layout design of the digital filters. A design effort of only 12 man-months, which includes logic, circuit, and layout design, is required for each VLSI using CAD systems. These VLSIs have proved effective in reducing the cost of video signal transmission systems.

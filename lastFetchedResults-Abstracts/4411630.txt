The objective of this study is to predict the pressure gradient for gas-liquid bubbly flow along a vertical pipeline by using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation. The CFD simulation is compared with experimental data obtained from the literature, which involves a vertical pipe with a length of 1.52 m and an inner diameter of 11.68 mm. Empirical correlations available in the literature are also applied for validation of simulation results. Pressure gradients predicted by the CFD model show a good agreement with the experimental data.

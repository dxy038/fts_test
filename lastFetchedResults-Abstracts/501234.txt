Objective: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells which results in increase of myeloid cells, erythroid cells and platelets in the peripheral blood and hyperplasia in bone marrow. Investigations have shown different types of BCR- ABL variants in these patients. In Iran only 3 types of these variants have been identified because most of the clinical laboratories usually use only few sets of primers which can not detect all types of the variants simultaneously. In this study we developed a method with which all types of variants in chronic Myeloid leukemia patients can be recognized.

Materials and Methods: blood samples from 100 persons who were under treatment or diagnosis for CML were received from Clinical laboratory. RNA was extracted from 600 ^l of each sample using Roche Commercial kit and converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase enzyme the cDNAs were analyzed for BCR- ABL variants using two sets of primers. All samples were also studied by RT-Multiplex Nested PCR method.

Results: RT-Multiplex PCR could detect BCR-ABL in all samples which were positive for these Fusion Gene mRNA. From 100 collected samples 46 percent were positive and 54 percent were negative by RT-Multiplex PCR method and 44 percent were positive and 56 percent were negative by RT-Multiplex Nested PCR method.

Conclusion: By using one step PCR we detected more variants of BCR- ABL in one tube at shorter time and lower cost. This method showed 100 percent specificity and can further be improved by taking more samples and also real time PCR for quantitative analysis.

The objective of the present study was to measure the relationship between selenium status and oxidative stress in two rat models of thermal injury. A non-lethal third-degree burn injury involving 20% (experiment 1) or 40% (experiment 2) of total body surface area (TBSA) was applied to male Wistar rats. Selenium level, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in plasma, red blood cells (RBC) and tissues (liver, kidney, muscle, and brain), and plasma selenoalbumin (Se-alb) were measured in control rats and in burned rats respectively 6 hours after injury and daily from day 1 to day 5. In parallel, lipid and protein oxidative damages, monitored by plasma and tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARs) levels and plasma total thiol groups were assessed.

erved a decrease of plasma Se and Se-albumin 6 hours after burn injury. In parallel, plasma GPx activity rapidly decreased and remained significantly lower than in control rats. These alterations were enhanced by the burn injury severity. Plasma TBARs followed the same pattern as that of plasma cholesterol, with an initial decrease and an increase at day 3 in 40% TBSA burned rats. Plasma thiol groups decreased in the two experiments indicating plasma protein oxidation.

results confirm an early oxidative stress in burn injury, and suggest an early selenium mobilization, which might counteract this oxidative stress. These data underline the crucial need of a restored selenium status in burned patients immediately after the burn injury.

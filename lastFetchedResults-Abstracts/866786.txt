The purpose of this paper is to solve multi-job order release problem whose objective is to minimize the sum of mean shop floor flow times (SFFTs) of orders subject to due-date constraint. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for the problem by decomposing the load profile of the shop. The load profile is divided into two parts. One is for the planning orders (new orders and unreleased orders) and the other is for the current orders being processed. The advantage of decomposing the load profile is to reduce computational complexity in the estimation step of order completion time. A job dispatching rule is also suggested to synchronize part flows in the shop floor. The experimental results show that work-in-process (WIP) in both bottleneck stations and assembly station, the SFFT of orders, and the percentage of tardy orders are significantly reduced.

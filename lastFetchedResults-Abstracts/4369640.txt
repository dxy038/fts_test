The main objective of a consolidation algorithm in the point-to-multipoint available bit rate (ABR) service is to avoid `feedback implosion´. Existing consolidation algorithms suffer from various undesirable effects, such as consolidation noise, slow transient response etc. In this paper, we first identify the fundamental responsibilities of a branch point in a point-to-multipoint ABR connection and then propose a new efficient consolidation algorithm. The motivation behind our proposed algorithm is that a backward resource management (BRM) cell from a downstream node should be passed to the upstream node immediately if it contains `critical information´, otherwise, it should be discarded at the branch point. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides faster and more accurate feedback with excellent scalability, in comparison to the existing algorithms

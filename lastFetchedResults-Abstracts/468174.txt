Objective: Neonatal group B streptococcal infections can be prevented by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Beginning in 1992, women with obstetric risk factors at University of Miami–Jackson Memorial Medical Center were targeted to receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. We evaluated these preventive efforts. Study Design: A case was defined as isolation of group B streptococci from a sterile site in an infant <7 days old born during the study period, 1992-1995. We reviewed systematic samples of women with preterm delivery and prolonged rupture of membranes to assess use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Results: Group B streptococcal cases declined from 1.7 cases/1000 live births to 0.2 cases/1000 live births (Poisson regression, P = .002). Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis use increased from 13% of preterm deliveries in 1992 to 42% in 1995, and from 20% of deliveries with prolonged rupture of membranes in 1992 to 72% in 1995 (χ2 test for linear trend P = .007 and P< .001, respectively). Conclusion: Provision of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on the basis of risk factors was associated with decreased group B streptococcal disease. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:1568-71.)

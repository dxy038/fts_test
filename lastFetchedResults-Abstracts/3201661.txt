Embedded applications are usually coming with stringent constraints in term of cost, energy consumption and realtime. Consequently, fixed-point arithmetic is mainstream for their implementation into embedded systems. Hence, the main objective of the french ANR project DEFIS is to provide a complete design flow for fixed-point refinement of complex applications. This tool flow is like the missing link between high-level application specification tools and low-level implementation.

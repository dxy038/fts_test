Fault indicator (FI) is used in impedance-based methods for improving fault section estimation in power distribution feeders. The location and number of FIs affects on the reliability indices and can extra charge the distribution companies and consumers. In this paper, the optimal location and number of fault indicator (FI) are determined in Power Distribution Network (PDN) with special economical combined objective function. In this objective function, four imposed costs on distribution companies and consumers are taken into account. For solving this problem, a powerful method i.e. Genetic Algorithm ( GA) is used. Then the proposed method is tested on the two case studies, which one of them is a real distribution feeder of Bushehr power distribution company in Iran. At the end the results are presented discussed.

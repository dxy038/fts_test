The main objective of this paper is to devise a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to assess team performance. The DEA model in this study uses slack based measure (SBM), a method which deals directly with the input excesses and output shortfall. An explanatory example has been given to demonstrate the applicability of the model to evaluate team performance. From this study, it is found that DEA is suitable to measure team performance. The model is able to provide improvement targets to the inefficient teams. Lastly, a few directions for future research have been identified.

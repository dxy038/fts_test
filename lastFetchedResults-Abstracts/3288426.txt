Quantitative color tissue analysis in endoscopy examinations requires color standardization procedures to be applied, so as to enable compatibility among computer aided diagnosis application from different endoscopy labs. The objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of different color correction algorithms (thus facilitating color standardization), evaluated on four different endoscopy cameras. The following five color correction algorithms were investigated: two gamma correction based algorithms (the classical and a modified one), and three (2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> order) polynomial based correction algorithms. The above algorithms were applied to four different endoscopy cameras: (a) Circon, (b) Karl-Stortz, (c) Olympus, and (d) Snowden-Pencer. The color correction algorithms and the endoscopic cameras evaluation, was carried out using the testing color palette (24 colors of known digital values) provided by the Edmund Industrial Optics Company. In summary, we have that: (a) the modified gamma correction algorithm gave significantly smaller mean square error compared to the other four algorithms, and (b) the smallest mean square error was obtained for the Circon camera. Future work will focus on evaluating the proposed color correction algorithm in different endoscopy clinics and compare their tissue characterization results.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the relationship among plasma oxytocin levels, metabolic clearance rate of oxytocin, and uterine activity in gravid women undergoing labor induction. STUDY DESIGN: Ten women receiving oxytocin for labor induction and agreeing to participate had blood sampled before initiation of oxytocin and at different levels of uterine pressure. Samples were analyzed with 200 Î¼l extracts from 1 ml of plasma with an oxytocin radioimmunoassay. The intraassay coefficient of variation was <3%. Sensitivity of the assay was 1.5 pg/ml. Pharmacokinetic parameters including plasma levels and metabolic clearance rates were calculated. Data were analyzed with the paired t test and linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean oxytocin levels and metabolic clearance rates were 26.6 pg/ml and 7.97 ml/min. There was no correlation between changes in oxytocin level and metabolic clearance rate. Increases in infusion rates were correlated with increases in oxytocin levels (r = 0.71, p< 0.001). Cervical dilatation and uterine contraction pressures did not correlate with oxytocin levels. CONCLUSION: Peripheral plasma levels of oxytocin may not accurately reflect uterine activity or progress in labor. Plasma levels of oxytocin may merely reflect the rate of oxytocin infusion.

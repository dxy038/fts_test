This paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on Bayes with decision graphs, namely BSPEA, which replaces crossover and mutation operators in traditional EAs by building and learning Bayesian Networks, and avoids setting a lot of parameters manually and destroying some important building blocks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of converging on the better Pareto front quickly, and has a strong robustness.

Background and aim: HIV positive patients encounter a number of social problems in Iran such as discrimination or rejection at their workplace.  Lack of knowledge about labour and social security regulations (LSS) among these sufferers make them incapable of restoring their rights.  The main objective of this study is to measure the level of awareness of LSS laws among the HIV-positive, employed men at Imam Khomeini Hospital HIV Clinic in 1391. 
Methods: A descriptive-analytic survey was conducted among 113 patients. The collection of data was through the Researcher-Made Questionnaire using the consecutive non-probability sampling.
Results: Most of HIV-positive employed men (61.9%) were highly aware of labour and social security regulations, and only a limited number of them (5.3%) had low level awareness of the issues. Most of the subjects in the study had good knowledge of the principles of labour regulations, work and wellbeing services, and occupational health (75.2%, 86.7%, and 61.1% respectively); although in terms of regulations on employment and work of foreigners and dispute regulations facilities, they had fair awareness. 
Conclusion: knowledge of labour and social security rights could offer a great support to the HIV-positive employed men. It seems that the use of mass media in sending out information along with planning educational program is necessary to promote the awareness of the patients of their rights.

The main objective of the present work is to investigate the robust stability analysis aspect of Sun Seeker System (SSS) under parametric uncertainties. In this paper robust stability analysis of closed loop block diagram of a SSS is presented with and without proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Transfer functions are derived for both SSS systems i.e., with and without PID controller. The stability is computed using both Arguon and Kharitonov method. A comparative analysis is done and the method that is more efficient and less time consuming is found out for both the cases: with and without PID controller. The Stability Margin (SM) is found out for the SSS with PID and is analyzed.

This paper presents a multi-objective path relinking algorithm for solving bi-objective flow shop problem, where we aim to minimize the total completion time and total tardiness. In this algorithm, we integrate path relinking techniques into hypervolume-based multi-objective optimization. We propose a method to construct a path and select a set of non-dominated solutions from the path for further improvements. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm is very effective in comparison with the original multi-objective local search algorithms.

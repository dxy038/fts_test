Constructing maps of loss or deterioration of power quality, due to stationary and non-stationary disturbances, is of great importance for the control, protection and analysis of power systems. Therefore, a technique for two- and three-dimensional maps visualization of the deterioration of power quality in electrical networks based in the power tensor theory is proposed. The objective of the technique is to provide images of the electrical network with easily identifiable characteristics through the construction of graphic schemes (maps) of power quality loss. Finally, the effectiveness of the tool is illustrated via different scenarios which are created using the IEEE 13-bus test feeder as an example.

In this paper, we report on our work of embedding a self-recovery algorithm into a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board, as a means of radiation pattern recovery after failure of any antenna array element. In the previous work, the principle approach was laid out and sample failure cases discussed, followed by an example of a successful recovery of the pattern using a genetic algorithm (G A)-based solution. The next objective then was to load that self-recovery code onto an FPGA board to take advantage of the FPGAÂ´s speed, reconfigurability, and potential for autonomous operation. However, that is not a straightforward task to do, as it will be discussed below, regardless of the particular approach taken to link and match the software (SW)and the hardware (HW)part of this job.

The laser-induced incandescence (LII) method is applied to the in situ size analysis of aerosol particles of different origin at room temperature. A detailed theoretical model of the particle heating and cooling for the different size fractions incorporating a solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind is used to retrieve the particle size distribution from the time-dependent aerosol thermal emission detected after a ns laser pulse. The results are compared with TEM data of deposited aerosol particles along with online measurements employing a differential mobility analyzer (DMA). Besides the size distribution, the LII signal contains information on the internal structure of particle agglomerates, which can be obtained by analyzing the changes in the measured size distribution with the laser pulse energy. The objective of the paper is an evaluation of LII for its capability to measure the size distributions of various types of aerosols in the size range about 5â€“200 nm and to determine the primary particle sizes in the case of agglomerated particles.

The objective of this study was to measure the birefringence of different ferrite configurations in circular waveguide. Large differential phase shifts relatively independent of frequency have been obtained with low external magnetic fields. A half-wave plate requiring an external magnetic field of 210 oersteds has been designed with a conversion loss of 3 db or less over the frequency range 9.0 to 9.7 kmc

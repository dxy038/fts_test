The brewing industry produces large quantities of waste co-products. There is increasing pressure to ensure total utilisation of such products to address economic and environmental concerns. Brewerâ€™s spent grain (BSG) the main by-product of the brewing industry is rich in dietary fibre and has a strong potential to be recycled. The overall objective of this study was to incorporate BSG into wheat flour breads together with a range of different enzymes (Maxlife 85, Lipopan Extra, Pentopan Mono BG and Celluclast) and evaluate the bread quality. A number of nutritional and textural properties of the finished product were studied. The incorporation of BSG significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) improved the dietary fibre but the major difficulty encounted was to achieve a good structure and high loaf volume. Increasing the level of dietary fibre significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased dough development time, dough stability and crumb firmness but decreased the degree of softening and loaf volume. It was found that addition of Lipopan Extra (LE), Pentopan Mono (PE) and a mixture of Pentopan Mono and Celluclast (PCE) enzymes improved the texture, loaf volume and shelf life while Maxlife 85 enzyme (ME) was not significantly different from control samples (wheat flour breads containing 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% BSG). Image analysis of the bread structure obtained from the C-cell analyzer showed that the most significantly (P &lt; 0.001) open network was obtained using LE, followed by PE and PCE.

Digital Radar Transceivers providing precise digital control over waveform amplitude, frequency and phase is critical for modern Phased Array Radar systems. A Plug-and-Play (PNP) Transceiver was developed to support the Air Force´s objective to develop a Hybrid Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Phased Array Radar (HMPAR) system, where the full array is partitioned into multiple sub-arrays which can be driven by mission specific waveforms. This PNP Radar Transceiver has been integrated with the Lockheed Martin´s Portable Search and Target Acquisition Radar (PSTAR) antenna array. Advanced Radar capabilities including transmit-receive digital beam-steering, direct digital L-band receiver and real-time digital signal processing with the integrated system have been successfully demonstrated. This paper discusses the overall PNP Radar Transceiver concept and highlights the successful phased-array test results when integrated with the PSTAR array.

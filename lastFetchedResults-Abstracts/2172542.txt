Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a metabolite of dimethyl sulfoxide, and occurs naturally at low levels in many foods. MSM has received wide attention as a dietary supplement to promote joint health. The objective of these studies was to determine the developmental toxicity potential of MSM when administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of major organogenesis and histogenesis. In a preliminary dose-finding study, distilled MSM microprill (i.e., microspherical pellets of MSM) was administered by oral gavage at dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 50, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day to 8–9 sperm-positive female Sprague–Dawley rats/group/day on gestation days 6–20. No evidence of maternal or fetal toxicity was observed. For the definitive developmental study, four groups of 24–25 timed-bred primiparous female rats were administered 0, 50, 500, or 1000 mg MSM/kg/day via gavage on gestation days 6–20. Maternal feed consumption, body weight, body weight gain, uterus weight and corrected body weight/body weight gain were unaffected by treatment. No evidence of maternal toxicity, and no significant differences in litter viability, litter size, or litter body weight were detected. Fetal evaluations failed to show any biologically significant increase in the incidence of anomalies in the MSM treated groups, and no malformations were seen in any of the fetuses. No evidence of fetal mortality, alterations to growth, or structural alterations were observed in the fetuses of dams administered 50–1000 mg/kg/day. Therefore, under the conditions of this study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and developmental toxicity was 1000 mg/kg/day.

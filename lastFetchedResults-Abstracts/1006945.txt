The objective of this study is to investigate the heat/mass transfer characteristics on various impinging jets under rotating condition. Two cooling schemes related to impingement jet are considered; array impingement jet cooling and impingement/effusion cooling. The test duct rotates at Ro = 0.075 with two different jet orientations and the jet Reynolds number is fixed at 5000. Two H/d configurations of 2.0 and 6.0 are conducted. The detailed heat/mass transfer coefficients on the target plate are measured by a naphthalene sublimation technique. The rotation changes the local heat/mass transfer characteristics due to the jet deflection and spreading phenomenon. For H/d = 6.0, the jet is strongly deflected at the leading orientation, resulting in the significant decrease in heat/mass transfer. At the axial orientation, the momentum of jet core decreases slightly due to jet spreading into the radial direction and consequently, the value of stagnation peak is a little lower than that of the stationary case. However, reduction of heat/mass transfer due to rotation disappears at a low H/d of 2.0. In the averaged Sh, the leading orientation with H/d = 6.0 shows 35% lower value than that of the stationary case whereas the other rotating cases lead to a similar value of the stationary case.

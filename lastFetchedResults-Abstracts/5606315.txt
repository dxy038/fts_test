In this paper we give an algorithm for computing a bidirectional minimal polynomial (a characteristic polynomial with not only minimal degree but also a nonzero constant term) of a given finite-length multisequence by modifying a lattice-based linear feedback shift register synthesis algorithm for multisequences. We also describe the set of all such polynomials for a multisequence.

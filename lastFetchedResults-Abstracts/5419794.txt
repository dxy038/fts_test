Three-dimensional modeling is the true simulation of reality, especially if it is relatively accurate. On the other hand, using 3D modeling in GIS environment offers a flexible interactive system for providing the best visual interpretation, planning and decision making process. The 3D models are becoming one of the most efficient technologies for spatial data management and analysis. The objective is to demonstrate the usefulness of three-dimensional modeling, and explore the capabilities of current technologies. Through this, the corresponding required production workflow for building three- dimensional GIS Model of Al-Balqa Applied University (BAU) using new up-to-date digital camera technology and adding true texture mapping will be discussed

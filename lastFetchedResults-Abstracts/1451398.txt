The use of stem cells for therapeutic applications is now an important objective for the future. Stem cell preparation is difficult and time-consuming depending on the origin of cells. Sedimentation field flow fractionation (SdFFF) is an effective tool for cell separation, respecting integrity and viability. We used the human neuroblastic SH-SY5Y clone of the SK-N-SH cell line as a source of immature neural cells. Our results demonstrated that by using SdFFF cell sorter under strictly defined conditions, and immunological cell characterization, we are now able to provide, in less than 15 min, a sterile, viable, useable and purified immature neural cell fraction without inducting cell differentiation.

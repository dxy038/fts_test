OBJECTIVE

To determine the effect of pulmonary blood flow (Qp) on nitric oxide (NO) production in patients with increased Qp due to an atrial septal defect (ASD).

BACKGROUND

Alterations in pulmonary vascular NO production have been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension secondary to increased Qp. In vitro, acute changes in flow or shear stress alter NO production. However, the effect of Qp on lung NO production in vivo is unclear.

METHODS

Nineteen patients (2.4–61 years of age, median 17) with secundum ASD undergoing device closure were studied. Before, and 30 min after ASD closure, exhaled NO and plasma nitrate concentration were measured by chemiluminescence (NOA 280, Sievers, Boulder, Colorado).

RESULTS

Before ASD closure, all patients had increased Qp (Qp: systemic blood flow [Qs] of 2.0 ± 0.7) and normal mean pulmonary arterial pressure (13.4 ± 3.1 mm Hg). Atrial septal defect device closure decreased Qp from 6.0 ± 2.5 to 3.6 ± 1.3 L/min/m2 (p < 0.05). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was unchanged. Associated with the decrease in Qp, both exhaled NO (−22.1%, p < 0.05) and plasma nitrate concentrations (−17.9%, p < 0.05) decreased.

CONCLUSIONS

These data represent the first demonstration that acute changes in Qp alter pulmonary NO production in vivo in humans. Exhaled NO determinations may provide a noninvasive assessment of pulmonary vascular NO production in patients with congenital heart disease. Potential correlations between exhaled NO, pulmonary vascular reactivity and pulmonary hypertension warrant further study.

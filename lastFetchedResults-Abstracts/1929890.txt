The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the addition of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) to semen, to increase reproductive performance in sows. Sows in 11 large production units, were inseminated (AI) either with PGF2α enriched fresh semen (group 1, n=1258) or with untreated fresh semen (group 2, n=1101).

tion rate, regular return to estrus, farrowing rate, subsequent total and live-born litter size, subsequent weaning to estrus intervals, pigs born and pigs weaned per sow per year were evaluated.

tion and farrowing rates, as well as regular returns to estrus were altered beneficially (P&lt;0.001) with PGF2α supplemented semen. Subsequent total-born (P&lt;0.06) and subsequent live-born (P&lt;0.15) litter size, as well as subsequent weaning to estrus intervals (P&lt;0.22), were not affected to the same extent. Total pigs born (P&lt;0.05) and pigs weaned (P&lt;0.04) per sow per year were increased by using PGF2α supplemented semen.

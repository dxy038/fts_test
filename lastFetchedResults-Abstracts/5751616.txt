A dynamic model of active vibration isolation system is established, and on the basis a multi-objective model for active vibration isolation system is set up. The improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm has been adopted to do the optimization. The paper carries out performance active vibration isolation system integrated optimization. The results show that this way can effectively enhance effect of the active vibration isolation system.

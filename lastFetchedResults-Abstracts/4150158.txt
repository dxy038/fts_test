Vector network analysers (VNAs) employ static error models that allow for the removal of static instrumentation errors, thereby enabling the accurate measurement of vector scattering parameters for devices under test (DUTs). Since standard VNA error models are inherently based on relative measurements (i.e. either the reflected or transmitted signal is measured relative to the incident signal at the same frequency), they typically do not provide information about the magnitude and phase of the signal that is input into the DUT, or the signal that is transmitted through the DUT into the second receiver. Such information is crucial for VNA measurements of frequency-offsetting DUTs like mixers. In previous papers, the authors demonstrated how the inclusion of an additional bidirectional signal path allows for the absolute vector error correction (AVEC) of a one-port transmitter/receiver module, thereby allowing for the accurate vector measurement of the signals that are flowing into and/or out of the test port. The authors show how the AVEC method can be used to calibrate multi-port systems, thereby allowing for vector measurements of mixer DUTs (MUTs).

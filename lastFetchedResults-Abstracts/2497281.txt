Background: The objective of the health system reform plan is to review individuals’ satisfaction in the field of health and to reduce their concerns and medical expenses. The disregarding of some workers in this plan seems to have resulted in their dissatisfaction, which can in turn cause problems such as neglecting of patients and patients' dissatisfaction. Therefore, the identification of the requirements of this plan from the perspective of nurses, as one of the main members of the healthcare team, can have a significant role in enhancing, promoting, and sustaining the objectives of this plan. This study aimed to evaluate the satisfaction of healthcare workers with their working conditions after the implementation of the healthcare reform plan in Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.
Materials and Methods: The participants of this descriptive study consisted of 191 medical personnel. Their satisfaction with their working conditions after the implementation of the healthcare reform plan was evaluated using a researcher-made questionnaire. The validity of the instrument was confirmed through content validity and immediate reliability was confirmed through Cronbach's alpha. Data were analyzed using independent t-test and ANOVA in SPSS software. 
Results: The overall mean satisfaction was 2.22 ± 0.66 (out of 5). The lowest satisfaction score was related to the area of salary and welfare status and the highest satisfaction score was related to the work environment and conditions, and the health system reform plan. 
Conclusions: Given the key role of the medical personnel in the health system reform plan, creating opportunities to improve their welfare and rights is recommended and must be considered by authorities.

Testosterone is secreted by testis Leydig cells has an important role in increasing muscle mass and the diameter of bone and function of the brain. Objective :
In this study the effect of testosterone hormone was investigated in in vitro conditions on newborn lO days old NMRI mice thigh's muscle. For this purpose ,newborn mice thigh s skeletal muscle of male and female with lxl mm dimensions was removed and on appropriate organ culture medium .tight muscle samples were exposed to testosterone hormone with doses of 1,5,20,and 500 micro liters in experimental group of 1,2,3 and 4 respectively the culture dishes ,were placed in a co2 incubator with temperature 37 Â° C for 3 days.Histological sections for microscopic studies of the samples were carried out. for evaluations of the effects of implemented testosterone hormone ,nuclear diameter ,the diameter of muscle fiber ,and the number of muscle fiber nuclei were measured and compared with control samples. Results:
Microscopic studies showed a significant increase in the diameter of muscle fiber and the number of muscle fiber nuclei in the experimental groups compared with control samples.

Background: Nocturnal enuresis is one of the most common disorders of childhood after allergic disorders. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare parent functioning and behavioral problems in children with and without primary nocturnal enuresis.
Methods: This case-control study was conducted in 292 children aged 5-15 years old (146 with primary nocturnal enuresis and 146 without primary nocturnal enuresis) referred to Amir Kabir hospital in Arak during 2011-2012. Data were collected by Child Behavioral Check List (CBCL) and Global Assessment Functioning (GAF) questionnaire for parents. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test and T-test.
Findings: In both groups of children with and without primary nocturnal enuresis, the most common problems were mental, anxiety-depressive and the least common problems were attention deficit-hyperactivity and physical. Differences in internalizing, externalizing, anxiety-depressive, isolation-depressive and affective-behavioral problems were statistically significant between the two groups; but differences in parent functioning were not statistically significant.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, parental intervention for early treatment of children with primary nocturnal enuresis is necessary to prevent future behavioral problems.

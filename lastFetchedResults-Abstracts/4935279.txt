People have a particular way to describe objects into a scene. Our work will be trying to learn these ways with their special characteristics and describe new images automatically. For that, we need to learn the syntax of these descriptions, and generate new syntax-correct phrases, the main reason for this paper. The final objective of this work will be describing new scenes automatically that could be understood by humans.

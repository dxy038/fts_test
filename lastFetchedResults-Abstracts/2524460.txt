 The discourse objective of this research was to determine the impact of free cash flows on 
the profitability of firms listed at the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). The population
consisted of 580 companies listed in KSE as on March 7
, 2015. A stratified sampling
method was used to pick a sample of 30 companies listed at KSE. Data were collected from
financial statements and published accounts. The amount of free cash flows that was
available per year was used. Secondary data were extracted from audited annual reports
and financial statements of firms sourced from KSE for a period of five years (2010 – 2014).
Data were sorted, cleaned and coded, and then entered into statistical package for social
science (SPSS). Data was of quantitative nature. So, data analysis was done by using
correlation and regression model. The results revealed that free cash flow and size of firm
influence firms’ profitability while capital liquidity does not influence much on dependent
variable profitability. This research will be useful since it will add more knowledge on the
influence of excess cash on profitability of those firms which are listed at the KSE. Foreign
and local investors would be able to get deep insights on the effect of free cash flow on
investment while considering investment decisions and diversification for portfolios to
increase profitability.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for evaluation of 7, 8, X chromosomes and EGFR, LPL, MYC, AR genes in 79 neoplastic foci from 56 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer was performed. We found aneusomy for chromosome 7, 8 and X in 74/77 (96.1%), 56/76 (73.7%), 26/70 (37.1%) of examined foci respectively. No specimen was amplified for EGFR and AR genes, only 2/71 (2.8%) specimens showed MYC gene amplified. LPL deletion was present in 52/76 (68.4%) specimens. Statistically association between Gleason score and both chromosome 7 aneusomy and 8p21 deletion was present. The frequency of chromosome 7 aneusomy was statistically higher in T3-4 cases than T2c and T2a-T2b ones. We considered as unfavorable a genetic set if aneusomy for at least two chromosomes and one altered gene were present. The percentage of tumors, with unfavorable genetic pattern, increased from 36.4 to 75.0% in those with Gleason &gt;7 and from 40.0 to 73.7% in those with stage T3 or more. These alterations could be considered potent genetic markers adjunctive to conventional prognostic parameters. Our objective was to establish specific genetic profiles which may discriminate favorable and unfavorable genetic prognosis tumors.

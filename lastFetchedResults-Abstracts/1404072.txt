The paper describes an experimental and theoretical study of the deposition of small spherical particles from a turbulent air flow in a curved duct. The objective was to investigate the interaction between the streamline curvature of the primary flow and the turbulent deposition mechanisms of diffusion and turbophoresis. The experiments were conducted with particles of uranine (used as a fluorescent tracer) produced by an aerosol generator. The particles were entrained in an air flow which passed vertically downwards through a long straight channel of rectangular cross-section leading to a 90Â° bend. The inside surfaces of the channel and bend were covered with tape to collect the deposited particles. Following a test run the tape was removed in sections, the uranine was dissolved in sodium hydroxide solution and the deposition rates established by measuring the uranine concentration with a luminescence spectrometer. The experimental results were compared with calculations of particle deposition in a curved duct using a computer program that solved the ensemble-averaged particle mass and momentum conservation equations. A particle density-weighted averaging procedure was used and the equations were expressed in terms of the particle convective, rather than total, velocity. This approach provided a simpler formulation of the particle turbulence correlations generated by the averaging process. The computer program was used to investigate the distance required to achieve a fully-developed particle flow in the straight entry channel as well as the variation of the deposition rate around the bend. The simulations showed good agreement with the experimental results.

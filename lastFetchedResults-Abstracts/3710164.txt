A system experiment which uses integrated optics to effect bidirectional transmission on a single-mode fiber is described. The system has practical applications and provides more functionality than previously reported experimental systems. The system consists of a video link (180 Mbit/s) and a voice/data link (1.54 Mbit/s) to the end user and a return voice/data link (1.54 Mbit/s) from the end user. Two LiNbO <sub>3</sub> devices are used to externally modulate lasers and a third is used in a novel way to demultiplex the incoming signals and to eliminate the need for an optical source at the userÂ´s end. The system operated over 4 km of standard single-mode fiber with a BER&#10877;10<sup>-9</sup> and excess margins (4.9, 9.3, and 28.1 dB) on the three links

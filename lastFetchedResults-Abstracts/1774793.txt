Oviduct tubal motility is thought to be controlled by hormones and nerves and has been associated with endometriosis. However, it is still not known whether the fallopian tubes in women with endometriosis demonstrate an abnormal distribution of nerve fibers. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of nerve fibers in the oviduct isthmus in women with and without endometriosis. Histological sections of the oviduct isthmus tissues were obtained from women undergoing hysterectomy for endometriosis (n = 24) and other benign gynecologic diseases (n = 24). The tissues were immunohistochemically stained for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to reveal all nerve fibers, sensory nerve fibers and sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers. Nerve fibers stained with PGP9.5, VIP and NPY in the oviduct isthmus were all significantly decreased in women with endometriosis as compared with women without endometriosis (P &lt; 0.05). In women with endometriosis, reduced nerve fibers stained with PGP9.5 and SP in the serosal layer, NPY in the muscular and mucosal layers, and VIP in the mucosal layer of the oviduct isthmus were all associated with the severity of the disease (P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that decreased nerve fibers in the oviduct isthmus in women with endometriosis in comparison to women without may imply a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.

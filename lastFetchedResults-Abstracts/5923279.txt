Modern distribution systems are implemented through micro grids: small power networks where generation is close to consumption and ICT supports the coordinated management of the different energy resources. In such systems, the central control unit manages energy dispatch from the different sources according to different criteria (technical, economical and environmental) and takes care of tertiary regulation. Such optimization for the tertiary regulation is performed with a time interval that typically is of 24 hours. This is due to the fact that it is necessary to take into account the charge and discharge cycles of storage systems. On the other hand, such long time leads to large errors in the prediction of energy generation and consumption. In this paper an algorithmic approach allows to overcome this problem. It is indeed possible to integrate uncertainty within the problem formulation attaining a dispatch plan for all the energy sources that will not lead to constraints violations even if the objective functionÂ´s variables and parameters are affected by uncertainty. The results on a medium size system show the ease and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

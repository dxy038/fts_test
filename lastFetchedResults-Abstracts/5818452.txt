Objective: To prepare and analyse Lactoferrin/Nanosized hydroxyapatite/Collagen I (CMs-loaded LF/nHA/Co-I) composite materials. Methods: Tripolyphosphate (TPP) was used as cross-linker to make CMs-loaded LF. nHA was prepared through chemical precipitation. Collagen I (Co- I) was extracted from fresh bovine tendon through acid dissolution and protease digestion. CMs, nHA and collagen could be crosslinked by Genipin to be tissue engineering materials. The composite materials would be tested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, X-ray analysis, infrared spectroscopy, average bone density X-ray and analysis by computer software. Results: Genipin could effectively crosslink CNs, nHA and collagen together to form engineering material to repair bone defect.

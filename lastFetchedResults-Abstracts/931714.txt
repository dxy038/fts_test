The objective of this work was to study the effect of three linear temperature profiles (heating rates of 1.5, 1.8 and 2.6 °C/min, from 20 to 65 °C) on Listeria innocua inactivation in liquid medium. The inactivation was also analyzed in artificially contaminated parsley (heating rate of 1.8 °C/min) and throughout a frying process, using a pre-cooked frozen food as case study. Inactivation showed a sigmoidal behaviour and all data was fitted with a Gompertz-inspired model. Results demonstrated that, in liquid media, Listeria inactivation is influenced by the temperature profile used. As heating rate increases, the shoulder decreases and the tail effect disappears. If Listeria was in parsley, its heat resistance increased (for identical experimental conditions in broth). Besides model adequacy was proven in all studied situations, the heating rate affected parameters’ precision.

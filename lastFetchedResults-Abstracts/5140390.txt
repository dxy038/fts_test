This paper presents a game theoretic solution for joint channel allocation and power control in cognitive radio networks. The problem is analyzed under the physical interference model. The objective is to find a distributed solution that maximizes the network utility with limited information. We consider different criteria to define this network utility: capacity in bps and number of links fulfilling the SINR requirements. We propose a game with local information that provides similar performance to a potential game that requires global knowledge. The obtained results are compared with a heuristic genetic algorithm to show the correctness of the proposals.

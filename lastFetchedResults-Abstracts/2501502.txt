Objective: Orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption (OIIRR) is an undesirable
sequel of tooth movement after sterile necrosis that takes place in periodontal ligament
due to blockage of blood vessels following exertion of orthodontic force. This study
sought to assess the effect of an angiogenic cytokine on OIIRR in rat model.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental animal study, 50 rats were randomly divided
into 5 groups of 10 each: E10, E100 and E1000 receiving an injection of 10, 100
and 1000 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), respectively, positive control group
(CP) receiving an orthodontic appliance and injection of phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
and the negative control group (CN) receiving only the anesthetic agent. A nickel titanium
coil spring was placed between the first molar and the incisor on the right side of maxilla.
Twenty-one days later, the rats were sacrificed. Histopathological sections were made to
assess the number and area of resorption lacunae, number of blood vessels, osteoclasts
and Howship’s lacunae. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey’s honest
significant difference (HSD) test.
Results: Number of resorption lacunae and area of resorption lacunae in E1000 (0.97 ±
0.80 and 1. 27 ± 0.01×10-3, respectively) were significantly lower than in CP (4.17 ± 0.90
and 2.77 ± 0.01×10-3, respectively, P=0.000). Number of blood vessels, osteoclasts and
Howship’s lacunae were significantly higher in E1000 compared to CP (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Tooth movement as the outcome of bone remodeling is concomitant with
the formation of sterile necrosis in the periodontal ligament following blocked blood supply.
Thus, bFGF can significantly decrease the risk of root resorption by providing more
oxygen and angiogenesis.

Prostaglandin E2 has been shown to increase the ovine embryo hatching rate, and PGF2  to reduce the development of rabbit,
bovine, and rat embryos. The objective was to determine the effects of PGE2 and PGF2  on development of caprine embryos. Estrus
was synchronized in does (n = 25) with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) intravaginal sponges for 12 days, and superovulated
with 20 units of FSH. On day 6 following estrus, embryos were flushed (n = 128) and incubated individually per well in 25  l
droplets of TCM-199 and BSA (8 mg/ml) for 6 days at 38.5 ◦C in a 5% CO2 : air with one of the following treatments: (1)
control (0.0002% EtOH), (2) PGE2 (7 ng/ml), (3) PGF2  (7 ng/ml), (4) low PGE2:high PGF2  (3.5 ng/ml:14 ng/ml), (5) balanced
PGE2:PGF2  (7 ng/ml:7 ng/ml), or (6) high PGE2:low PGF2  (14 ng/ml:3.5 ng/ml). Treatment with PGE2 alone reduced (P < 0.05)
the hatching rate (1/15; 7%). The hatching rate of embryos treated with PGF2  alone (9/18; 50%), lowPGE2:high PGF2  (8/16; 50%),
and balanced PGE2:PGF2  (11/16; 69%) were similar to control (6/18; 33%). In contrast, the hatching rate was non-significantly
increased (13/18; 72%) with the high PGE2:low PGF2  treatment. None of the treatments affected development from the morula
to blastocyst stage. From the current data, it can be concluded that PGE2 alone reduced hatching rate, and PGF2  alone had no
effect on the development of caprine embryos. High concentrations of PGE2 with PGF2  improved the hatching rates. Thus, uterine
concentrations of PGE2 may need to reach a threshold level to improve embryo hatching, as previously reported, while increased
uterine concentrations of PGF2  during early pregnancy would not affect development of the embryo.

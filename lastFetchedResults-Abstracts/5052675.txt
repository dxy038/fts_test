Thanks to the rapidly-developing Web, pervasive computing and mobile technologies, learning activities are being shifted to a new era which is characterized by ubiquitous adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT). ICT-based Learning (IBL), like mobile-learning, fosters high quality learning practices offering great freedom to learners while, at the same time, coming along with undesirable side-effects. This paper focuses on these issues after a brief summary of IBL background and gives possible solutions to them. The paper concludes with an objective view towards IBL and calls equal attention to the other side of IBL research, so that a balanced research can be achieved and better IBL system solutions can be reached.

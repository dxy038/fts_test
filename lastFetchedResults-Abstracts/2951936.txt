A test apparatus for online damage sensing/life prediction has been constructed around a fatigue testing machine. The objective is to cause and measure damage and predict remaining life for metallic specimens. The paper presents the design of a robust adaptive controller to accommodate the major variation in the dynamics of the fatigue test machine, namely the compliance of the specimen

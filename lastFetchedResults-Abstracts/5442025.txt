The subject of the paper is a control scheme that allows achievement of a unity power factor value for a class of power converters commonly addressed as power factor pre- compensators. The primary control objective is to provide a constant level output voltage while keeping a power factor value close to unity, in the presence of unknown parameter uncertainties. Such uncertainties are identified using the sliding mode parameter observer, while the main regulation problem is addressed via the sliding mode control. Numerical simulation is furnished for assessing the performance of the proposed control method.

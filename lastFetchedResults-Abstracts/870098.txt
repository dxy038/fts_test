Although the lately evolved manufacturing technologies such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) provide a unified platform for managing and integrating core business processes within a firm, the decision-making between marketing and production planning still remains rather disjoint. It is due in large parts to the inherent weaknesses of ERP such as the fixed and static parameter settings and uncapacitated assumption. To rectify these drawbacks, we propose a decision model that solves optimally the production lot-size/scheduling problem taking into account the dynamic aspects of customer's demand as well as the restriction of finite capacity in a plant. More specifically, we consider a single product that is subject to continuous decay, faces a price-dependent and time-varying demand, and time-varying deteriorating rate, production rate, and variable production cost, with the objective of maximizing the profit stream over multi-period planning horizon. We propose both coordinated and decentralized decision-making policies that drive the solution of the multivariate maximization problem. Both policies are formulated as dynamic programming models and solved by numerical search techniques. In our numerical experiments, the solution procedure is demonstrated, comparative study is conducted, and sensitivity analysis is carried out with respect to major parameters. The numerical result shows that the solution generated by the coordinated policy outperforms that by the decentralized policy in maximizing net profit and many other quantifiable measures such as minimizing inventory investment and storage capacity.

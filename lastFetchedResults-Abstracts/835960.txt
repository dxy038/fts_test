Confining "being existent" in the sense of "having objective realization" to the essence of Almighty God and attributing all other than God to Him, Muhaqqiq Dawani considers quiddity as the made one. Mulla Sdra has criticized his foundation and principles. However, it seems that the theory of Muhaqqiq Davani is the same as the final theory of Mulla Sadra concerning the unity of Allah. Thus Muhaqqiq Davaniâ€™s views are susceptible of true interpretation, since in case of accepting the particular unity of existence, existence cannot be subject to making. However, quiddities would have manifestations and all other than God are considered manifestations of Almighty God attributed to Him. Principality of quiddity requires that the made one is quiddity rather than requiring quiddities to have external and objective realization next to Almighty God

Rational development and utilization of water resources in the Qaidam Basin is the most important prerequisite to realize the goal of the regional econonyÂ´s sustainable development. This paper takes the Qaidam Basin for example, studies the water points coverage by GIS spatial analysis. The water resources optimal allocation model in the Qaidam Basin is discussed. Then the flowchart of the water resources optimal allocation in the Qaidam Basin based on GIS is introduced. Analysis on the water resources optimal allocation of the drinking water project in the Qaidam Basin shows that the proposed method realizes the seamless integration of geographic models and professional models by GIS spatial analysis functions. The experimental results are actual and practical, and it is a good method to solve the problem of multi-water, multi-user and multi-objective water resources allocation model in the Qaidam Basin.

Without the boundedness assumption for the activation functions and without any extra constraints on variable delay functions, based on Lyapunov functional, homeomorphism map, techniques of inequalities and linear matrix inequality(LMI), a new delay-dependent stability criterion for (i) existence (ii) uniqueness and (iii) globally exponential stability of equilibrium point, of a class of discrete-time bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with variable delays is derived.

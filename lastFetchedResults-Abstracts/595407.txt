Objective: The study aims to describe the complications and hospital stay associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Material Â£ Methods: During the period from 01 August 2007 to 31 July 2009, all patients who were operated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included. The age, gender and other related data including the outcome and complications in 245 laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases were recorded. The findings documented in numbers and percentages were compared and discussed with those of other studies. Results: 194(78.79%) were females and 51(21.21%) were males. Ages of female patients ranged from 2551 years and of males from 28-54 years. Most of the patients were discharged on the 1" post-operative day. There were 13 cases converted to open surgery (5.3%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully completed in the remaining 232 patients with an average operating time of 93.74 + 21.7. Twenty four patients experienced morbidity. These included infections (n = 10), bleeding (n=4), biliary peritonitis (n=5), visceral injury (n=1), pneumonia (n=2) and partial small bowel tear (n=2). No bile duct injury or mortality was seen. Conclusion: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is being performed in this setting with acceptable morbidity, mortality and conversion rates. A concerted effort to increase the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy may increase cost effectiveness in this setting.

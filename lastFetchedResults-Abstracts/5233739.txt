The objective of this study is to distinguish efficient cane grower from the less efficient ones using qualitative and data envelopment analysis. Using this method, thirty efficient growers were identified. The strategic plan drawn from comparing efficient growers and inefficient ones is as follows. 1) Using efficient growers to benchmark farm activities that need to be improved, including activities relating to tillage, plant, herbiciding, fertilizing, irrigating. 2) Strengthening the farming skills of growers who own land with sandy loam soil that is susceptible to weather condition change. 3) Making the expansion of the millÂ´s cane-growing land a priority, expanding to loamy clay to sandy loam, implementing irrigation system. 4) Develop business process mapping of efficient growers to improve inefficient ones individually.

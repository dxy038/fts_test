Robust design optimization holds the multiple aspects of the objective. In this paper the basic robust design model was established based on maximum variation estimation method; the multi-objective attribute of robust design was analyzed; the Pareto robust set was defined; the values of performance functions were adjusted with the combination of linear physical programming. Finally multi-objective robust design model which doesn´t require presumed probability distribution of uncertain factors or continuous and differentiable of objective and constraints functions was constructed. An engineering example was provided and the results show that the proposed approach can ensure success of optimization and obtain the solution which reflects decision-maker´s preference.

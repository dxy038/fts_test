In this paper, ACOT was provided to advise for employees in selecting the training courses (TCs). The courses planning process needs to abide the companyÂ´s policies regarding training hours and costs. In order to avoid the courses of an employee are confined to only one or two areas, we stipulate that the selected TCs cover three or more areas. This paper uses ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to generate packages of TCs for individual employees with the maximization of utility (costs * hours) as the objective function values. Moreover, we also use an enumerate algorithm to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our ACO algorithm. The two measurements are related to the solution quality and run time required by our algorithm.

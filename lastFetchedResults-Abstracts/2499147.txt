<p><strong>Background and Objective:</strong> Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is an important enteric pathogen in human causing bloody or nonbloody diarrhea, which may be complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Cattle are an important reservoir of EHEC. This research aims at vaccination with a divalent chimer protein composed of EspA 120 and Intimin 282 and its preventive effect of EHEC O157 colonization in mice rectal epithelium.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> A divalent recombinant EspA-Intimin (EI) protein containing EspA 120 and Intimin 280 attached with a linker was amplified from a trivalent construct and cloned in pET-28a (+) vector. The immunization was conducted in mice after expression and purification of the recombinant EI (rEI).<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Mice subcutaneously immunized with rEI, elicited significant rEI specific serum IgG antibodies and showed significantly decreased E.coli O157:H7 shedding compared to the control group.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The chimeric recombinant protein induced strong humoral response as well as protection against oral challenges with live E.coli O157:H7.</p>

The objective of this article is to study and model the annotation context, to be used as a basis to design context- aware annotation functionalities dedicated to the teacher into the MemoNote tool. MemoNote tool is a semantic and personal annotation tool dedicated to teachers,. Starting from a specification of context and more precisely annotation context, we define how to capture it from elements of the teaching situation and to model it with ontologies. Annotation context can then be used by the two MemoNote annotation functionalities, manual annotation and pattern-based annotation.. It is done by selecting a set of ontologies and patterns suited for the current context.

This paper describes the production of various prealloyed Nb–Ta–Al powders through the simultaneous aluminothermic reduction of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 and subsequent comminution, with the objective of producing highly porous anodes for application in electrolytic capacitors. The morphological, chemical, and electrical characteristics of the powders are described. These powders, which have low production costs, have low apparent density and high specific surface as well as a high specific charge of 12,992 to 25,253μF · V · g−1.

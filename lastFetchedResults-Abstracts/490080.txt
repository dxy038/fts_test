Background/ Objective: In this study, we investigated the effect of Low- Intensity Ultrasound on Osteogenic differentiation of rat bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs).
Material and Methods: Ultrasound instrument with 3MHz frequency was calibrated by radiation force method. rMSCs isolated from rat's Tibia and Femur central canal were cultured in medium complemented with FBS. We promoted rMSCs for three successive passages in order to purify them. The ultrasound (US) group received US stimulation at a frequency of 3 MHz and intensity of 355 mW.cm2' continuous mode, for 5 min every day up to 2 weeks, while the control group had no US stimulation. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay and semi-quantitative RT-PCR for alkaline phosphatase, Osteocalcin and Osteopontin expression were made at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 14th days post-stimulation, respectively.
Results: Our results showed that alkaline phosphatase activity in US group was significantly more than that of control (88.6±12% versus 30.14±23%) (p<0.005). According to semi quantitative RT-PCR data, group differentiation gene expression was significantly different in two groups (p<0.005).
Conclusion: This study suggests that ultrasound may have some stimulatory effects on the Osteogenesis of rMSCs in vitro.

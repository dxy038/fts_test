A software reliability growth model incorporating the amount of test effort expenditures during the software testing phase is described. The time-dependent behavior of test-effort expenditures is described by a Weibull curve due to the flexibility. Assuming that the error detection rate to the amount of test-effort spent during the testing phase is proportional to the current error content, the model is formulated by a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Using this model, the method of data analysis for software reliability measurement is presented. Also, this model is applied to the prediction of additional test-effort expenditures to obtain the objective number of errors detected by software testing and the determination of the optimum time to stop software testing for release

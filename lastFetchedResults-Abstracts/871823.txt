The objective of this study was to determine the effect of rice husk and microorganism addition on solid waste
degradation rate. In this study, some efforts were made to increase compost process by adding rice husk and
microorganisms into the domestic solid waste. The addition of rice husk aimed to obtain C/N ratio due to the
composting criteria and reducing the moisture content in the compost material. The addition of microorganisms
aimed to shorten acclimatization time and increased pH of compost material. The experiment was carried out by
mix of raw material, rice husk and microorganisms. Five reactors were carried out on aerobic condition and
solid waste pile was turned once a day. Rice husk and microorganism was added to reactor as followed, R1:
without rice husk and microorganism; R2: 4 kg and 1 ml/kg; R3: 8 kg and 1 ml; R4: 4 kg and 2 ml/kg and R5: 8
kg and 2 ml/kg raw material. The composting period was 30 days in batch process.The results showed the best
waste solid waste degradation rate occurred in reactor R3, which composting rate increased by 11.7% when it
compared to the control reactor.

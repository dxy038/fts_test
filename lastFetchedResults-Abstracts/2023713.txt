The objective of this study was the evaluation of pH, Color parameters [lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma (C*), hue (H*), a*/b* ratio, and color differences (?E)], Mb, MetMb, OxyMb, DeoMb and WHC in minced meat. Three types of meat ( Beef, camel and ostrich) and four mincing processes (three using a grinder with 7.5, 4 and 3 mm diameter holes in the plate, and a fourth in which a cutter was used to obtain a finely minced product) were studied. The intact meat was used as the control. Significant differences were observed in the pH, Color parameters [lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma (C*), hue (H*), a*/b* ratio, Mb, MetMb, DeoMb and WHC of various types of meat (P? 0.05). WHC and chroma showed statistically significant differences (P? 0.05) for the mincing treatment. The ?E and OxyMb  showed  no significant differences (p > . 0.05) for mincing and also in meat types. High correlation between pH and L* (R2=0.999), pH and WHC (R2=0.997) confirms the decrease in L* and increase in WHC along with increase in pH.

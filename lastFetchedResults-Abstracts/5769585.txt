As a time-efficient and cost-effective EMC test facility candidate, the reverberation chamber has attracted much attention from academia and industries. The objective of the paper is to introduce its general background, standardisation status and practical applications, highlighting some of merit and non-merit associated with the reverberation chamber test method. A mini-reverberation chamber made of aluminium with two orthogonal and mechanical stirrers is also presented.

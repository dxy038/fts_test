A high level synthesis for testability method is presented with the objective to generate testable RTL designs from behavioral descriptions. The approach is formulated as an allocation problem and solved using an efficient genetic algorithm. We follow the allocation method with an automatic test point selection algorithm. The method has been implemented and design comparisons are reported.

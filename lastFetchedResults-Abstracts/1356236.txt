Maternal  recognition  of  pregnancy  (MRP)  manifests  the  various  ways  in  which  the  mother  responds  to  the
presence  of  a  conceptus  within  her  reproductive  tract.  Corpus  luteum  produces  progesterone,  the  hormone  of
pregnancy, which is required to stimulate and maintain endometrial functions that are permissive to early embryonic 
development, implantation, placentation, and successful fetal and placental development. The interaction between a 
competent embryo and a receptive uterine environment is responsible for successful growth and development of the 
post-hatching blastocyst and pregnancy establishment. Certain hormones, enzymes, cytokines, interleukins and gene 
transcripts  contribute  and  regulate  the  bidirectional  channel  of  communication  during  the  pregnancy  period  in 
ruminants.  During  Maternal  recognition  of  pregnancy some  genes  like  interferon-tau  (IFNT),  Ubiquitin  Cross 
Reactive  Protein  (UCRP),  Ghrelin,  Aldoketoreductase-1B5  (AKR1B5),  SERPINA14  are  appear  to  have  role  in
successful establishment of pregnancy and expression of the cascade of signaling molecules. These genes regulate 
the endometrial environment to establish pregnancy  in farm animals. MRP in ruminants requires that theconceptus 
elongates  from  a  spherical  to  a  tubular  and  then  filamentous  form  to  produce  IFNT  which  is  the  pregnancy 
recognition signal. Genetic factors of both embryo  and motherâ€™s endometrium are also responsible for successful 
embryo development.

The recent push for electrified vehicles, including both plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicle may further increase peak electrical load if left unmitigated, resulting in more demand for generation and transmission capacities. Fortunately, PEVs can be treated as controllable loads or even power sources under extraneous situations for demand side management (DSM). Although centralized approach certainly performs an effective demand side management, an important concept regarding the privacy of the information access is not already considered. The objective function for this multi objective problem of demand side power management and decentralized control is the total electricity generation cost and cost associated with implementing the demand side management programs. Thus saving a unit of electricity because of implementing demand side management can be treated like producing a unit of electricity by a power plant. The main constraint related to DSM is that the maximum expected saving that could be achieved by implementing DSM is capped to a realistic maximum limit. The framework is flexible and could incorporate any meta-heuristic for multi-objective optimization. This multi objective approach is applied on a test system comprising of 2516 domestic consumers, 296 small consumption firms, 150 medium consumption firms and 4 large consumption firms. It is observed that PEVs could utilize information transfer with the grid to shape the effect exhibited on the overall load. Also the obtained numerical results show that this approach will improve PEV market penetration, especially relative to centralized strategies that could deter consumers who wish to independently determine their charging strategy.

This paper presents an linear-quadratic-regulator-based proportional-integral-differential equivalent controller design method for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The disturbance rejection is achieved based on a multi-objective observer in which observation error is purposely retained and utilized in load disturbance compensation. This makes disturbance rejection tuning independent of the adjustment for speed command tracking; and the disturbance compensation is an integrated part of the controller output, which reduces the chance of input or state saturation. A robust stability analysis is also included for the modeling error. The proposed methodology is implemented through the dSPACE digital signal processor system, and the experimental result confirms its effectiveness

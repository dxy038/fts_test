There is some evidence on the effects of organic acids on the functional properties of native starches. However, there is little information on such effects on modified starches. The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of L-ascorbic acid (150 mg kg-1, as the permitted level in bakery products) on functional properties of cross-linked wheat starch. Once the starch was treated with L-ascorbic acid, some spots and cracks appeared on the surface of the starch granules, as observed under a scanning electron microscope. Besides, the water solubility increased while water absorption decreased, but intrinsic viscosity of the samples, as determined by a U-tube viscometer, remained unchanged. Also, gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of gelatinization, measured by differential scanning calorimetery, as well as the hardness and elasticity of the starch gels decreased, while adhesiveness and cohesiveness of the gels remained unaffected. In general, it was concluded that the ascorbic acid had some degradation effect on cross-linked wheat starch molecules that could further affect its functional properties.

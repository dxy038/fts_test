Objective: This study used the Brief Version of The World Health Organization’s Quality of Life
Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess and compare the quality of life in older people who live at home and
older people who live in public assisted-living facilities for the elderly. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Data
were collected by a research nurse in each home and in the assisted living facility. Participants: Participants were
60 years old and older. The sample included 37 people who were living in a public assisted-living facility and 37
elderly people living in their own homes. Measurement: The WHOQOL-BREF was used to measure participants’
quality of life. Results: The groups were similar according to gender, literacy, existence of chronic diseases, and
general perceived health. However, quality of life scores for social relationships and environment domains were
lower in those living in an assisted living facility than those living in their own homes. The scores for elderly
females staying in the assisted living facility were lower compared to the scores of males in the facility.
Conclusion: The results suggest that social and environmental domains of life quality are low in elderly assisted
living facilities. Social activities should be diversified for elderly people staying in assisted living facilities to
improve social relationships. Physical and psychological health of females in assisted living facilities should be
comprehensively supported by professionals. Alternatively, elderly people may be professionally supported to
live in their own homes

  Main objective in wheat breeding programs is to improve high yielding and stable varieties possessing desirable morpho-physiological traits. This study was conducted to determine the stability of 18 winter and facultative bread wheat genotypes. The experiments carried out in 9 experimental stations (Karadj- Arak- Ardebil- Jolgerokh- Miandoab- Hamedan- Mashad- Qazvin- Khoy) using a randomized complete block design with three replications during 2006-2008 cropping seasons. Result of combined ANOVA showed highly significant effects for genotype, year × location and genotype × location × year interactions. Using method of simultaneous selection for yield and stability (YS) revealed that genotype 3 (C-85-3) and 8 (C-85-8) with YS=13 were the most superior genotypes. Genotype 5 (C-85-5) had the lowest grain yield and its YS was -8 which selected as the least stable genotype. Based on AMMI analysis, genotype 9, 13, 18 and 8 were more stable than the others and had general adaptability. AMMI was able to categorize the environments into different groups, so that in each environment genotype (s) with specific adaptability can be determined. Results of contribution of pre-anthesis assimilate to grain (CPAAG) showed that genotype 17, 5, 8, 18 and 3 had the highest remobilization among the genotypes. Correlation coefficients between the traits showed that correlation of grain yield with biomass weight at anthesis and maturity, spike weight at maturity and grain number per spike were significantly positive, however, correlation between grain with CPAAG was significantly negative.

System simulation in power electronics is characterized by a large number of different circuit elements. One can generally distinguish between passive and active components, any kind of switch (i.e. power semiconductors), control elements and electrical machine. The behaviour of these elements is defined by different time constants. A PWM drive can operate with a fundamental frequency of some kilohertz feeding an electrical drive with a time-constant of some seconds. This high ratio shows that a large number of simulation steps must be carried out in order to obtain useful information. Both the large number of elements acting in parallel and the large number of switching transients during the simulation make it necessary to take a close look at computer simulation models with respect to accuracy and speed. The primary objective is to find models which allow fast system simulation

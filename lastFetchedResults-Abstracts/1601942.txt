We introduce a new geometric method to generate sphere packings with restricted overlap values. Sample generation is an important, but time-consuming, step that precedes a calculation performed with the discrete element method (DEM). At present, there does not exist any software dedicated to DEM which would be similar to the mesh software that exists for finite element methods (FEM). A practical objective of the method is to build very large sphere packings (several hundreds of thousands) in a few minutes instead of several days as the current dynamic methods do. The developed algorithm uses a new geometric procedure to position very efficiently the polydisperse spheres in a tetrahedral mesh. The algorithm, implemented into YADE-OPEN DEM (open-source software), consists in filling tetrahedral meshes with spheres. In addition to the features of the tetrahedral mesh, the input parameters are the minimum and maximum radii (or their size ratio), and the magnitude of authorized overlaps. The filling procedure is stopped when a target solid fraction or number of spheres is reached. Based on this method, an efficient tool can be designed for DEMs used by researchers and engineers. The generated packings can be isotropic and the number of contacts per sphere is very high due to its geometric procedure. In this paper, different properties of the generated packings are characterized and examples from real industrial problems are presented to show how this method can be used. The current C++ version of this packing algorithm is part of YADE-OPEN DEM [20] available on the web (https://yade-dem.org).

One of the most commonly known weaknesses of Evolutionary Algorithms (eas) is the large dependency between the values selected for their parameters and the results. Parameter control approaches that adapt the parameter values during the course of an evolutionary run are becoming more common in recent years. The aim of these schemes is not only to improve the robustness of the controlled approaches, but also to boost their efficiency. In this paper we investigate the application of parameter control schemes to address a well-known variant of the Frequency Assignment Problem (fap). The controlled ea is a highly efficient diversity-based multi-objective memetic scheme. In this work, a novel general parameter control method based on Fuzzy Logic is devised. In addition, a hyper-heuristic is also considered as an established parameter control scheme. An extensive experimental evaluation of both methods is carried out that includes a comparison to a wide-range of fixed-parameter schemes. The results show that the fuzzy logic method is able to find similar or even better solutions than the hyper-heuristic and the fixed-parameter methods for several instances of the fap. In fact, this method yielded frequency plans that outperform the best previously published solutions. Finally, the generality of the fuzzy logic-based scheme is demonstrated by controlling different kinds of parameters.

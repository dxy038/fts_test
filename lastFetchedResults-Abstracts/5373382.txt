This paper proposes a method for constituting the formation of a multi-robot system according to dynamically changing environments. First, we apply a method of multi-objective behavior coordination for integrating behavior outputs from the fuzzy control for collision avoidance and target tracing. Second, we apply a spring model to calculate the temporary target position of each robot for the formation behavior. Third, we discuss multi-robot behaviors based on the concept of coupling. The tight coupling is realized by the spring model while the loose coupling is realized by the individual decision making based on connection and disconnection with other robots. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to the exploration in unknown environments. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method through several simulation results.

HF radars are large and expensive systems whose performance is strongly dependent on the scattering geometry. There have been several cases where such radars have been poorly deployed, with consequent failure to achieve the surveillance objectives. This paper formulates the problem of radar site configuration in terms of objective mission-related metrics and outlines the optimisation procedure.

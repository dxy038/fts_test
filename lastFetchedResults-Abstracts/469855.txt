Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether reagent strip testing can predict bacteriuria in urogynecology patients.
Study design
All women undergoing urodynamic evaluations from June 1997 to October 2001 were identified by using a computerized database. Urine culture results were compared with reagent strip testing. Significant bacteriuria was defined as greater than 105 colony-forming units per milliliter.
Results
Bacteriuria prevalence was 8.6% (n = 51). Sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were 0.51, (95% CI, 0.31-0.66) and 0.991, (95% CI, 0.974-0.998), respectively. Blood had a lower sensitivity (0.35, 95% CI, 0.20-0.54) and specificity (0.80, 95% CI, 0.75-0.84). Leukocyte esterase was similar to blood with a sensitivity of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.14-0.45) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.87). No combination of tests offered improved sensitivity or specificity over nitrites alone.
Conclusion
Nitrite dipstick testing has excellent specificity for bacteriuria in urogynecologic patients. These results support the treatment of women with positive nitrites who are preparing to undergo urodynamics without obtaining culture.

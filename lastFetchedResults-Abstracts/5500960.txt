In this paper the modeling and the application of robust control design techniques to the attitude control of a mini-rotorcraft are discussed. More specifically, for controlling attitude, a controller is proposed by applying the robust control technique which is based on an inverse dynamics control law that cancels the mathematical model of the system. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the use of robust control techniques applied to the mini-rotorcraft UAV, when considering uncertainty in the mathematical model. The results are supported by simulation and experimental tests.

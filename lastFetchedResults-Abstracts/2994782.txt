This paper presents results of a study whose objective is to show if there is an interest to use the superconducting magnetic storage (SMES) and the global control to improve the inter-area oscillations stability. Geometric measures of controllability and observability are used for input/output selection. The linearized model of a two areas four generators power system obtained by using SDYN software is used in this work. Effects, on the input/output pairs selection, of the excitation systems, the power how and the SMES sites on the network are highlighted. It appears that the power flow influences the measurements choice in comparison with the excitation system which has an impact on control signal selection. For all the studied cases, the results obtained show that the global control is well suited to solve the problem of inter-area oscillations stabilization

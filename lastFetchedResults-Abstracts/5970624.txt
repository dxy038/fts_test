Checking fixture design (CFD) is an intricate and high-precision work, however, it is hard to control development cycle and the quality of the product by handwork which is not only a complex and high workload operation but also completely dependent on designersÂ´ experience. To obtain locator layout in CFD automatically, a multi-objective locator continuous searching algorithm (MOLCSA) is proposed. Base on the point-wise kinematic location theory, the stability evaluation goal is introduced to solve the problem of irrational distribution of locator layout which arises from the previous theory only considering local contact conditions. In addition, the algorithm implements a continuous searching method with surface parametric technology, which makes up the deficiency in manually generating candidate points in the discrete searching method. Based on CAD and NSGA-II, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed and a case study is presented to verify the feasibility of the method.

The objective of this manuscript is to examine the performance improvement of a class of nonlinear transport processes subject to spatiotemporally varying disturbances through the employment of a comprehensive and systematic actuator activation policy. To do so, it is assumed that multiple groups of actuators are available with only one such actuator group being active over a time interval of fixed length while the remaining actuator groups are kept dormant. Using enhanced controllability and performance improvement measures, the candidate actuator groups are first placed in locations that individually provide certain robustness with respect to an appropriately defined "worst" spatial distribution of disturbances. Once the multiple actuator groups are in place, a switching scheme is developed that dictates the switching of a different actuator group at different time intervals and the corresponding control signal supplied to it while being active. Embedded in the decision policy is the activation of actuators that lie spatially closer to the spatiotemporal disturbances, thereby improving the control authority of the actuators and enhancing the ability of the system to minimize the effects of the above class of disturbances.

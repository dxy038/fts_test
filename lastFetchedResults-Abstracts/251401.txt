The objective of this work was to test a novel experimental technique to determine
the thermal conductivity of low-thermal conductivity materials and tropical
foods. The experimental method was based on the Peltier effect and its
application to the thermoelectric heat pump. This device became practical
recently with the development of semiconductor thermocouple materials. The
module assembly used in this work had 127 thermocouples connected in series
electrically and in parallel thermally. The heat transfer area of the module was
3.96x3.96 cm2. The equipment was calibrated using standard materials of known
thermal conductivity: Plexiglas and Bakelite. Then the K values were easily computed
from a steady-state energy balance equation.

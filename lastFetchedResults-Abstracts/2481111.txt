Abstract 
Introduction: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into osteogenic cells. Today, biocompatible scaffold has emerged as a novel treatment for replacement of lost bone tissue.
Objective: This study evaluated the repairment of bone defect using bone marrow stromal cells and gelatin-chitosan membrane in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, sixty male adult Albino Wistar rats were equally divided into five groups as follows: Group 1 (control group) received no treatment after bone defect. Group 2 (sham group) after bone defect, the culture medium was injected at the site of bone defect. Group 3 (gelatin-chitosan group), with gelatin-chitosan membrane used into bone defect. Group 4 with BMSCs transplanted into bone defect and Group 5 with cell transplantation with chitosan - gelatin membrance used into bone defect.
Results: No significant difference was found between the controls and Sham group, according to radiopacity test but  radiograph bone opacity increased in chitosan - gelatin and cell groups, compared to control group but the differences were not significant. On the other hand, in cell-GC group compared to control group, radiopacity decreased but was not significant. Our biomechanical results showed the mean of F max was significantly increased in cell group compared to control group, and in Gelatin-Chitosan group compared to control group was increased but the difference was not significant and in cell-GC group compared to control group it was decreased but the difference was not significant, either.
Conclusion: It seems that gelatin-chitosan membrane transplantation can partly be useful for repairing of bone defect. Although the use of bone marrow stromal cells with the membrane could help a little to repair of bone defects, cell transplantation alone is better for repairing the bone defects.

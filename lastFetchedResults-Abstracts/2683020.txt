Background and Objective: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that is associated with dysfunction and impairment of vascular system. Exercise training in diabetic patients improves angiogenesis, which helps treatment of diabetes. The purpose of this study was investigation of aerobic exercise effect on cardiac expression of the proteins Spred-1, Raf1, and VEGF in diabetic rats.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 50 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups of diabetic, intact aerobic exercise (8 weeks for 6 sessions per week), diabetic, and intact control. Cardiac muscle was removed and placed immediately in liquid nitrogen. Protein expression of VEGF, Raf-1 and Spred-1 was investigated by ELISA method. Data were analysed using SPSS (version 16.0) at a significance level of p  <  0.05. One way ANOVA was used for data analysis with Tukeyâ€™s test to find differences between groups.

Result: Results showed that diabetes leads to decreased cardiac expression of Raf-1 (p < 0.05) and VEGF (p < 0.05) proteins and increased cardiac expression of Spred-1 protein (p < 0.05). As well, eight weeks of aerobic training led to increase of cardiac expression of Raf-1 (p < 0.05) and VEGF (p < 0.05) protein and decreased cardiac expression of Spred-1(p < 0.05) protein in diabetic rats.

Conclusion: Aerobic exercise training increases expression of VEGF and Raf1 protein and decreases expression of Spred-1 in cardiomyocytes, therefore, the effect of diabetes on these proteins in the presence of aerobic exercise is attenuated.

The objective of the study was to investigate bone strength at four different skeletal sites in a chronic animal model of urinary diversion. Young male Wistar rats (120) were allocated randomly to four groups undergoing ileocystoplasty; ileocystoplasty and resection of the ileocecal segment; colocystoplasty; or sham operation (controls). After 8 months the lumbar vertebrae, femora, and tibiae were harvested at necropsy. Bone strength was assessed biomechanically at four different skeletal sites: vertebra L3, femoral middiaphysis, femoral neck, and distal femoral metaphysis. Bone mass and architecture were assessed using standard static histomorphometry of the proximal tibial metaphysis (trabecular bone volume [BV/TV]; trabecular number [Tb.N]) and ash weight. Statistically significant differences of biomechanical parameters between groups were observed at three skeletal sites with corresponding changes in tibial histomorphometry. Isolated ileocystoplasty resulted in decreased maximum load values of L3 (−16.4%; p< 0.0035) and a substantial reduction in tibial BV/TV (−34.7%; p< 0.05). Ileocystoplasty combined with resection of the ileocecal segment led to a significant loss of bone strength of L3 (−32.4%; p< 0.0015) and a dramatic reduction of tibial BV/TV (−45.9%; p< 0.01). Loss of tibial metaphyseal bone mass was predominantly caused by a decrease in Tb.N. (p< 0.01). Colonic augmentation had no significant effect on bone strength or histomorphometric values. In conclusion, this is the first experimental study to demonstrate the relevance of histomorphometrically proven bone loss after enterocystoplasty in terms of biomechanical variables.

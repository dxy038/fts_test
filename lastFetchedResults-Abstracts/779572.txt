SALIS is a repository of open source software along with
metadata information. It is a pilot project covering the areas of computer
networks and information systems. The objective is to demonstrate the
usefulness of such repositories to the Indian academic and developer
community in making informed decisions while using open source software.
To enable organization and retrieval of the information stored in
the repository, a modified CCS (Computing Classification Scheme) by
ACM(Association of Computing Machinery) was used. Since a sizeable
section of the end-user community was familiar with the USPTO classification
scheme, a need was felt to classify the software by the USPTO
scheme also. Instead of classifying by two schemes, it was decided to
have a mapping or a concordance between the two schemes so that the
classification process can be simplified. The approach used to derive a
concordance between two diverse classification schemes is described.

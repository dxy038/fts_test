Background: The theory of selective photothermolysis led to the development of a variety of different laser systems which range from the shorter spectrum of 694 nm ruby laser to the middle with the 755 nm alexandrite and 810 nm diode lasers to the long end with the 1064 nm (Nd: YAG) laser. Objective: A systematic review on the clinical trials with use of various laser sources for hair removal Methods: All clinical trials related to hair removal lasers in 1998-2003 were selected. After elimination of heterogenicity sources in data, results were synthesized on the basis of laser type and were compared using ANOVA and t tests, p value < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Hair reduction at least 6 treatment 
months after the last treatment and after 3 sessions were 57.5%± 14% , 42.3%±24% , 54.7%± 17%, 52.8%±6% for diode, Nd: YAG, alexandrite and ruby lasers, respectively. Diode laser was the most effective and Nd: YAG had the least effect in hair removal.Conclusion: The most effective laser for hair removal is diode, but higher fluences is needed in the darker skin types and this is accompanied with more complications, so it is advised to use this laser for light skin types.

We consider a production control problem in a manufacturing system with failure-prone machines and a
constant demand rate. The objective is to minimise a discounted inventory holding and backlog cost over an
infinite planning horizon. The availability of the machines is improved through a corrective maintenance strategy.
The decision variables are the production and the machine repair rates, which influence the inventory levels and
the system capacity, respectively. It is shown that, for constant demand rates and exponential failure and repair
times distributions of the machines, the hedging point policy is optimal. Such a policy is modified herein and
parameterised by factors representing the thresholds of involved products and switching inventory levels for
corrective maintenance. With the obtained policy, simulation experiments are combined to experimental design
and response surface methodology to estimate the optimal production and corrective maintenance policies,
respectively. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

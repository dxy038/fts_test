The authors examine the possible structure of the high-frequency link system as a composite DC-to-AC converter, as well as the different topologies for primary and secondary converters. The load-dependent frequency of the self-oscillating primary inverter is examined, and a method is found to synchronize the operation of the direct converter with this varying source frequency. The possible topologies for the bidirectional direct converter are examined, the controller as developed is explained, and the results for a system with 1.5 kW input power at 24 V DC and 220 V, 50 Hz sinusoidal output are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

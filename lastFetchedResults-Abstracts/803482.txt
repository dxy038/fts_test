Background: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency or cellular resistance. Silymarin is an effective agent that reduces cell resistance to insulin and improves lipid profile.
Objective: In this study the effects of silymarin on insulin resistance and blood lipid profile in first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients were evaluated.
Methods: This randomized clinical trial was performed on first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients (n=60) with BMI above 25 kg/m2. After completing questionnaire and obtaining written consent, participants were randomly assigned to give placebo or silymarin group. The patients in silymarin group received two 140 mg capsules of silymarin daily and placebo group 140 mg placebo capsules similarly for 12 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL, HDL, insulin and 2hpp blood glucose level were determined before and after the study.
Results: In silymarin treated group, insulin resistance and serum insulin level were reduced significantly (p  <  0.05) compared with beginning as well as compared with placebo group. The blood glucose level and lipid profile didnâ€™t change significantly after silymarin therapy compared with placebo group.
Conclusion: According to our results silymarin positively influence insulin resistance and insulin level in first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients but its effect on lipid profile need further studies.

Background & Objective: This study was carried out to examine the relationship between the scores of various food groups and the adequacy of specific nutrients in Tehrani women.
Method: In this cross-sectional study, 286 females aged 18 and over from district 13 in Tehran - chosen as representatives for Tehrani female population - participated. We assessed their food intake through a validated semi-quantitative food frequency and two 24-hour recall questionnaire. Two different dietary diversity indices named dietary diversity score (DDS) and food variety score were used. Mean adequacy ratio(MAR), i.e. the mean ratio of intake to recommended amount of 12 nutrients and their calories, was calculated as an indicator of nutrient adequacy.
Results: The mean ± SD of age and body mass index was 41±13 years and 27±4 kg/m2 respectively. The mean of DDS was measured to be 6.11± 1.02. DDS correlated with MAR(r=0.4, p<0.05), the NAR (Nutrient Adequacy Ratio) of Thiamine(r=0.3, p<0.05), vitamin A(r= 0.4, p<0.05), Calcium(r=0.4, p<0.05), Phosphorus(r=0.4, p<0.05) and total intake of fat(r=0.3, p<0.05). Variety of whole grains correlated mostly with the NAR of protein(r=0.3, p<0.05). Variety of vegetables and fruits had the highest correlation with the NAR of vitamin C(r=0.3, p<0.05) as well as; vitamin A(r=0.3, p<0.05). In the forth quartile of variety score of food groups, the intake of most macro-and micro-nutrients made the highest amount. Variety score of meat and milk was the most important predictor of MAR.
Conclusion: Variety of different food groups is a useful indicator of specific nutrients adequacy. Hence to determine the adequacy of a specific nutrient, the variety score of specific food groups can be considered.

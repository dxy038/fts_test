This paper considers the problem of leader-follower formation control for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in spatial motions. The objective is to derive a leader robot along a desired trajectory, and make the follower robots keep a desired formation with respect to the leaderÂ´s configuration in 3-dimensional spaces. Unlike previous studies on formation control of multiple AUVs, hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties of the AUVs is incorporated into the formation control law. To deal with such uncertainties, an adaptive control rule mainly based on inverse dynamics of the plant is developed. A Lyaponov based close-loop stability analysis is also fully presented in the paper. In order to approve the capability of the proposed controller, some illustrative cases are considered. The results of the simulations are very promising.

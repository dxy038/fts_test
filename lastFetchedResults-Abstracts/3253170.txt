Static allocation of phased array radar resources for the surveillance of low earth orbit objects is addressed in this paper. The objective of the optimization is to utilize prior knowledge of likely target trajectories to maximize the expected cumulative detection probability of an object as it passes through the field-of-regard. The problem is complicated as the tasks (surveillance sectors) share a inter-dependence. A greedy optimization method is proposed which applies sequential stages of increasing resource allocation. Despite the simplicity of this method it is shown to give significant improvements in the expected cumulative detection probability, in contrast to a conventional uniform allocation.

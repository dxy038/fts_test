In this paper, a reflex charging strategy with the energy recovery function for a bidirectional converter (BC) is proposed to build a novel reflex-based BC (RBC) for increasing the battery charging efficiency in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The proposed RBC can provide a reflex charging current profile to charge the battery to obtain a high battery charging efficiency and prolong the battery life cycle. In particular, the negative pulse energy of the reflex charging current profile in the proposed RBC is recovered to reduce the battery charging dissipation. A soft transfer method is also developed in this paper to really erase the spike current in the RBC. A 400 W prototype is designed and implemented to verify the feasibility of the proposed RBC. Compared with a typical bidirectional converter, the battery charging efficiency, the battery charging speed, and the battery thermal deterioration effect are improved by about 10%, 8.8%, and 7%, respectively, with the proposed RBC.

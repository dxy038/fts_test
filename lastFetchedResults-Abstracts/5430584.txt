In the context of the development of e-commerce on the Internet, a lot of electronic payment systems have been set up in order to secure online payments. To understand the success of Internet payment systems it is necessary to analyse the strategies of e-commerce actors: consumers, "cyber merchants", managers of networks (telecommunications and payment), suppliers of electronic payment services and banks. Our results provide objective explanations of the success factors of Internet payment systems, and the domination of SSL card payment in the market. Only Paypal could, in the middle term, compete with the SSL card payment. Moreover, unsuccessful experiences show that it is necessary to consider network effects and which business models to implement in order to avoid killing a new Internet payment system before it is launched.

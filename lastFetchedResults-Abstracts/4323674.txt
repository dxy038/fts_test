This paper presents a new approach for tracking multiple persons in a single camera. This approach focuses on recovering tracked individuals that have been lost and are detected again, after being miss-detected (e.g. occluded) or after leaving the scene and coming back. In order to correct tracking errors, a multi-cameras re-identification method is adapted, with a real-time constraint. The proposed approach uses a highly discriminative human signature based on covariance matrix, improved using background subtraction, and a people detection confidence. The problem of linking several tracklets belonging to the same individual is also handled as a ranking problem using a learned parameter. The objective is to create clusters of tracklets describing the same individual. The evaluation is performed on PETS2009 dataset showing promising results.

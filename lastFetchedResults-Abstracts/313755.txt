The head, containing the gravity sensors (vestibular system) and the visual system, must be stabilized in space to provide a steady reference. During walking, the head also needs to be free to move to allow scanning of surrounding objects and steering of locomotion. With aging, deteriorations in motor and sensory systems and their integration are commonly observed. Nevertheless, the strategies used by elderly subjects to complete challenging tasks that require precise sensorimotor integration, such as turning the head rapidly during gait, is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of aging on the movement coordination of the head, trunk and pelvis when executing a rapid head motion in response to a visual signal. Elderly and young subjects turned their head rapidly (up, down, left, right or none) in response to a visual signal, during standing and walking. The 3-D positions of head, trunk and pelvis were recorded and analyzed. All subjects, young and old, successfully performed the task during both standing and walking without any loss of balance. Postural stability was maintained as large head motions were accompanied by relatively small trunk and pelvis movements. Horizontal plane movements associated with right and left head turns were significantly larger than sagittal plane movements associated with head up and down motions. Head motions were significantly slower and smaller in elderly subjects, and resulted in disrupted horizontal plane trunkâ€“pelvis coordination during walking. We conclude that head, trunk and pelvis movements are coordinated in a task-dependent manner such that their movement amplitudes induced by rapid voluntary head motions are larger in walking than in standing. This task-dependent movement coordination is affected by aging.

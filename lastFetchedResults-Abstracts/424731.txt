The timely diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis is an important public health problem in both developed and developing nations. In the United States, migrant farmworkers are estimated to be about six times more likely than other employed adults to develop tuberculosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate explanatory models of tuberculosis among Mexican migrant farmworkers working in western New York state. In-depth interviews were conducted with 26 farmworkers using an open-ended question format. All interviews were conducted in migrant camps and were audio-taped, translated and transcribed by the researcher. Data analysis was performed using Glaser and Strauss’ grounded theory method of analysis which involves continuous and simultaneous data collection, coding, and analysis. Study participants included 21 males and 5 females ranging in age from 18 to 65. Respondents had worked as migrant farmworkers an average of 10 years and had an average of five years of schooling. Two-thirds of the participants had previously attended a tuberculosis education program, and four had received treatment for tuberculosis infection in the past. Farmworkers’ explanations of tuberculosis etiology, severity, symptoms, prevention, treatment, and social significance are described as well as their beliefs about tuberculosis skin testing and the bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Migrant farmworkers’ explanatory models were similar in many aspects to the medical model of tuberculosis, although farmworkers had numerous misconceptions about BCG vaccination. Health care workers should be aware that Mexican migrant farmworkers may have beliefs about tuberculosis that are very compatible with participation in testing and treatment programs if such programs are made accessible to them.

The objective of this study was to develop and characterize a biodegradable drug-loaded nerve guide for peripheral nerve regeneration. Sabeluzole, a nerve growth agent, was selected as model compound. Four biodegradable polymers were selected for this study: a copolymer of polylactic acid and polycaprolactone (PCL); a copolymer of polyglycolic acid and polycaprolactone PCL; a copolymer of PCL/polydioxanone (PDO) and PDO. Placebo and drug loaded nerve guides were obtained by melt compression and melt extrusion.
It was observed that melt compression and melt extrusion are feasible techniques to prepare the nerve guides. Based on the physicochemical characterization, all samples show absence of crystalline sabeluzole, indicating the formation of an amorphous dispersion. The in vitro release measurements show that the release of sabeluzole is complete, reproducible and can be controlled by the proper selection of the polymer. The release mechanism for all samples follows Fickian release behaviour.

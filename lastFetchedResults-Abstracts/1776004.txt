Grip endurance is one of the important prerequisites for good performance of the upper extremity and hence it is important to evaluate it correctly. However, we know little about normal grip endurance, especially for elderly people. The main objective of this study was to examine the age-related changes in grip isometric endurance of healthy community-dwelling elderly people. Two-hundred and eighty-six subjects aged between 60 and 90, were randomly selected from the electoral list of the city of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Grip relative isometric endurance was evaluated using the Jamar dynamometer. Isometric grip endurance was estimated by the number of seconds a subject could sustain 50% of his/her maximal voluntary grip strength. Contrary to other upper extremity sensorimotor parameters, no grip isometric endurance difference was found with age, in spite of a slight tendency towards a decrease. The women tended to have better scores than the men and endurance of dominant hand is better than the non-dominant. The stability with age could be explained by muscle fiber composition modifications.

This research relates to a single machine scheduling problem with objective is to minimize earliness &amp; Tardiness penalties with common due dates. We proposed a heuristic method for finding initial solution as an input to the Tabu search algorithm for finding a near optimal solution for this problem. In our research study the due dates are restrictive with due date parameter h, ranges from 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 to 0.8. Our study is a paper base in which we have applied the Tabu search algorithm for the prescribe problem. The base paper of (Ronconi and Kawamura 2010) studied single machine earliness and tardiness scheduling problem: lower bounds and a branch-and-bound algorithm) obtaining optimal solution. We compared the results of Tabu search algorithms with the base paper, Heuristic &amp; benchmark results of D. Biskup and M. Feldmann. Our algorithm shows near optimal solution to the branch &amp; bound algorithm.

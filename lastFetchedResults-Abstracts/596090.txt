Objective: Aim of this project is to establish blood glucose level of workers who are by occupational^ exposed to noise, to establish correlations between degree of damage of sense of hearing and blood glucose level of exposed workers and correlations between duration of exposure and levels of disturbances of glucose. Patients: Examination included 235 workers. After applying strict criteria for inclusion or exclusion, 81 workers (male and female) have been selected. In control group there were 50 clerks (male and female) who were not exposed to industrial noise. Methods: Audiometric examination was performed using apparatus AMPLAID 171. Examination of level of glucose was performed using apparatus DIMENSION POND PLUS by method glucoso-6-phosphat dehydrogenase (hexokinase). Body height and mass was determined by anthropometric measurement and BMI was calculated using standard formula. Results: This examination analyses effect of industrial noise on hearing and effects on level of blood glucose. The results were determined by correlation method and show that workers exposed to industrial noise for years, have higher damage of hearing sense and higher level of blood glucose than those workers who were not exposed to the noise.

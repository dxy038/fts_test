In several real-time applications, tasks are not only subjected to complete their deadlines, but more control of the scheduling process is required. In such situations, quality of service is interpreted in many ways (jitters, response times, etc.). In other real-time environments the objective is to optimize a performance measure while respecting release times and deadlines; other environments permit modifications of release times, but not of the deadline times, in a controlled manner. This paper focus on additional issues related on precedence constrains and variable execution times that could be considered during scheduling. In this idea, the paper presents a way of possible integration of such issues into a tool used for modelling and simulation of real-time systems behaviour.

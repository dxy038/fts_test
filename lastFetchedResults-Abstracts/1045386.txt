The inverse heat conduction problems (IHCP) analysis method provides an efficient approach for estimating the thermophysical properties of materials, the boundary conditions, or the initial conditions. Successful applications of the IHCP method depend mainly on the efficiency of the inversion algorithms. In this paper, a generalized objective functional, which has been developed using a generalized stabilizing functional and a combinational estimation that integrates the advantages of the least trimmed squares (LTS) estimation and the M-estimation, is proposed. The objective functional unifies the regularized M-estimation, the regularized least squares (LS) estimation, the regularized LTS estimation, the regularized combinational estimation of the LTS estimation and the M-estimation, and the regularized combinational estimation of the LS estimation and the M-estimation into a concise formula. The filled function method, which is coupled with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, is developed for searching a possible global optimal solution. Numerical simulations are implemented to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Favorable numerical performances and satisfactory results are observed, which indicates that the proposed algorithm is successful in solving the IHCP.

This study has the objective of evaluating the stability of B complex vitamins and its vitamers, for a period of 1 year of storage. The pollen samples were stored under room temperature (with and without light) and frozen. The vitamins were quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. All proposed vitamins were found in the samples and the dehydration process did not interfere in vitamin content. The variations were (dry basis): 0.59–1.09 mg/100 g (B1); 1.73–2.56 (B2); 6.43–15.34 (PP) and 0.33–0.68 (B6). After 1 year of storage, it can be stated that vitamin B1 concentration remained constant, while for the others, the concentration loss was dependent on time rather than on storage conditions. All samples were considered vitamin B2 sources. The influence of the storage time in the concentrations of vitamin B6 and PP was explained mathematically, through linear regression equations of multivariate analysis.

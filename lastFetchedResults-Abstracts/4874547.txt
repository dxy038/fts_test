In this paper we provide an overview of CPM, a cross-layer framework for Constrained Power Management, and we present its application on a real use case. This framework involves different layers of a typical embedded system, ranging from device drivers to applications. The main goals of CPM are (i) to aggregate applications´ QoS requirements and (ii) to exploit them to support an efficient coordination between different drivers´ local optimization policies. This role is supported by a system-wide and multi-objective optimization policy which could be also changed at run-time. In this paper we mostly focus on a real use case to show the very low overhead of CPM both on the management of QoS requirements and on the tracking of hardware crossdependencies, which cannot be directly considered by local optimization policies.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate collagen content and platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and connective tissue growth factor expression in the myometrium of the uterine lower segment from a patient with type IA osteogenesis imperfecta with recurrent uterine rupture and to evaluate the existence of a relationship between the rare recurrent uterine rupture and the tissue disorders of type IA osteogenesis imperfecta.
STUDY DESIGN: Collagen content and platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and connective tissue growth factor expression in the uterine lower segment were assessed in the patient with type IA osteogenesis imperfecta and in eight otherwise healthy (“control”) patients.
RESULTS: Type IA osteogenesis imperfecta contained less total collagen amount, with no difference in type III collagen expression and showed increased levels of platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in myometrial smooth muscle cells. No difference was observed in connective tissue growth factor expression.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the diminished collagen amount in myometrium from osteogenesis imperfecta and show the presence of additional pathogenetic mechanisms. A relationship is hypothesized between the underlying myometrial biochemical modifications and the recurrent uterine rupture.

Can there be deterministic chance? That is, can there be objective chance values other
than 0 or 1, in a deterministic world? I will argue that the answer is no. In a deterministic
world, the only function that can play the role of chance is one that outputs just 0s and
1s. The role of chance involves connections from chance to credence, possibility, time,
intrinsicness, lawhood, and causation. These connections do not allow for deterministic
chance.

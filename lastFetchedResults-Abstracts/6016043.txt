The experimental results for indication machine drives and the bidirectional power conversion using a pulsewidth-modulated GTO (gate-turn-off) type converter-inverter system are presented. The system has sinusoidal voltage and current at both the input and the output terminals. The PWM method is explained in detail, and the harmonic components contained in the PWM pattern are analyzed. The AC output current regulation by the PWM inverter with constant DC current is also discussed. The voltage and the current waveforms when this system is applied for the power conversion between 60 Hz and 50 Hz power sources are given. The experiment shows that this system can be used for various purposes.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

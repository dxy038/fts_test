Background & Objective: Sepsis is a contributing factor in >200000 death per year and approximately two third of cases occurred in patients hospitalized for other illnesses and is an important complication in hospitalized patients. Sepsis increases the length of stay, mortality rate and potential expense. This study is directed on the patients with microbiologically documented blood stream infection.

Material and methods: Research method was descriptive and it's technique was observation_interview. Resistance pattern and other parameters were evaluated in the patients with blood stream infection. Our microbiological method was Kirby- Bauer.

Results: We surveyed 126 patients with positive blood culture whose mean age were 37.8Â±24.44 years.44 patients were admitted in poisoning ward.

Staph.Coag.Negative.(80%) was the most commonly isolated pathogen and followed by Staph. Coag. Positive (1 l%),Acintobacter(6.4%),Klebsiella(4.8%) and Strep tococcus (3.2%).Temp>38 was seen in 36 patients (28%).

WBC> 12000 was seen in 39 percent of patients and WBC<4000 was detected in 8 percent of patients.

Conclusion: Resistance pattern evaluation showed that 67 precent of Streptococcus were resistant to Penicillin.40 precent of Staph. Coag. Positive were resistant to cloxacillin,80 precent of Acintobacter were resistant to Cefepim and 67 % of them were resistant to Ceftazidim and Amikacin,50 precent of E.coli were resistant to third and forth generation of Cephalosporin and 80 precent of psudomunas were resistant to Coterimoxazole and Cefepim.

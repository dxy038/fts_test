This paper presents an experimental study about the effects that various operating conditions have on conducted emissions by variable-speed drives. The objective of the research is to determine what quantities most significantly affect emissions so that electromagnetic compatibility test procedures can be carried out under the most appropriate conditions according to the specific destination of the equipment under test. The obtained measurements would so match the standardÂ´s requirement that they represent the worst case for the disturbance emission levels. A quantitative analysis has been made possible by introducing two indexes with values determined by emissions over the measurement band. The effects of voltage asymmetry and amplitude, motor operating frequency, and torque applied to it have been investigated. Results show a strong dependence on motor operating frequency and torque and that the fluctuations in the measured emissions largely depend on the measurement configuration adopted.

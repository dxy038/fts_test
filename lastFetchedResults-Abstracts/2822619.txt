In this paper, network reconfiguration of distribution network with solar and wind generation is solved using non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization (NSPSO). Three objective functions including system loss minimization, minimization of maximum voltage deviation and minimization of number of switching operations, are considered. The proposed NSPSO based algorithm has been tested on IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system. A comparison of network performance with respect to system loss and maximum voltage deviation for the three cases i.e., without network reconfiguration, with optimal but fixed network reconfiguration and with optimal but dynamic/adaptive network reconfiguration has been shown. The results indicate that better network performance is achieved from dynamic/adaptive network reconfiguration strategy than with other cases.

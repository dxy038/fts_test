Surface sealing formation in soils of arid and semi-arid areas is one of the most important factors of soil permeability reduction, formation of runoff and interrill erosion. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of surface sealing on runoff and interrill erosion rates. This experiment was conducted in a small flume with dimensions of 1Ã—0.5 meter under four rainfall intensities (21, 38, 50 and 81 mm/h) and three different slopes of 5, 15 and 25 percent. Three soils with contrasting soil texture namely as S1 (sandy loam), S2 (clay loam) from farmland use of  Ilkhichi, and a clay soil (S3) from  farmland use of  Caleibar area, East Azerbaijn, Iran were selected in the current research. Relative Sealing Index (RSI), the need time to reach to the final infiltration rate (tlim), runoff and sediment rate were measured in each combination of slopes and rainfall intensities. The results showed that S1 with RSI= 2.23 and tlim= 6 min was the most sensitive soil and S3 with RSI= 8.9 and tlim= 102 min was the least sensitive soil to surface sealing. For soil S1 as a sensitive soil, the amount of runoff at rainfall intensity of 50 mm/h decreased due to increment of slope, but for the rest of gradients and soils runoff rate was not affected by increasing slope. The rate of sediment loss in S1 and S2 Soils decreased due to surface seal formation during rainfall, but there was no clear trend of sediment loss in soil S3.

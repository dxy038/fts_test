An improved railway crew scheduling model was presented, and the objective was to schedule crews in such a way that the deadheading was minimized while the operational constraints were satisfied. Ant colony algorithm (ACA) was devised to solve railway crew scheduling problem (RCSP) based on principle of ACA used to solve vehicle routing problem (VRP). Improvement on route construction rule and pheromone updating rule was adopted on the basis of former algorithm. An example was analyzed to demonstrate the correctness of the application of this algorithm. It is proved that ACA is efficient and robust in solving RCSP

As the most common renal malignancy in childhood, Wilms’ tumor (WT)
                            is responsible for nearly 7% of all childhood cancers, with an annual
                            incidence rate of about 7 to 10 cases per million in children younger
                            than 15 years of age. Wilms’ tumor is not confined to children and it
                            can also involve older children and even adults. Like other primary
                            renal cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma, WT can develop unique
                            features of ureteric, intra-caval or intra-cardiac extension; their
                            incidences are approximately 2%, 4% to 10%, and 1%, respectively.
                            Treatment strategies from various oncology research groups are somehow
                            different with similar results at the end. This study aimed at reviewing
                            the current literature on the diagnosis, staging, and different
                            treatment strategies for Wilms’ tumor with either ureteral or
                            intravascular extension. In this article, we reviewed the current
                            literature about staging, diagnosis, and management strategies for WT,
                            through a randomized clinical trial, which focused on this matter. The
                            Medline database (through PubMed) and Cochrane Library was searched for
                            the following key words: Wilms’ tumor, ureteral extension of Wilms’
                            tumor, and intravascular extension of Wilms’ tumor with no time limit
                            for studies documenting the diagnosis, staging, and treatment
                            strategies.

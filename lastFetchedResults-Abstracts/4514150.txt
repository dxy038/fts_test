PWM is introduced to phase-shift bidirectional DC-DC converters, which can reduce current stresses, conduction loss and switching loss of semiconductors and can expand ZVS range. A technique to synthesize PWM plus phase-shift bidirectional DC-DC converter topologies is presented. Theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results of one particular converter taken as an example, are provided in this paper.

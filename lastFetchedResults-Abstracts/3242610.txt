The objective of this paper is to obtain the solution for minimized network power losses by optimally locating the distributed generation (DG) sources taking into consideration the total injection power of DG installed into a electrical distribution network. The method proposed in this paper is tested on a 20 kV electrical distribution network. The results demonstrate that the methodology can be successfully used to determine the optimal dimension (injection power) of DG sources without violation of any of the system constraints under any operating conditions.

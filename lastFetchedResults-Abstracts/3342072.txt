The article is focused on the examination of the phase behavior of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) utilized as the source of energy to propel the projectile in gas guns technology. The objective is to develop an equilibrium discharge mathematical model for carbon dioxide tanks in order to assume thermodynamic equilibrium states at every point in time throughout discharging under ambient temperature conditions. The speed of sound in a two-phase saturation is taken into consideration for the calculation algorithm. The presented model is solved using the MATLAB environment. An experimental setup has been established for the purpose of verifying the results of solution.

Proper clinical assessment of a patientÂ´s progress in rehabilitation will determine the regimen and intensity of therapy. At present many objective assessments require therapists to subjectively grade various tasks the patients perform. The administration of these assessments are onerous and error prone. In this paper, we make use of wireless body sensors using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) worn by the patients to accurately measure and assess the ability of a patient to perform various tasks. We also are able to capture the nuances of movements which are not easily obtainable by other means. We focus on the use of accelerometers in these tests and their use in detecting abnormalities in the performed tasks and the benefit of Singular Spectrum Analysis in sub-space based analysis.

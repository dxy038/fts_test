The concept of technology transfer (TT) and technology exchange (TE) in construction projects can be viewed as a two-way flow which involves the transfer and exchange processes of different components of technology (i.e., knowledge, tools and skills). The transfer and exchange process could transpire at any given time or in a given project and could occur simultaneously. The application of this concept in the Malaysian construction projects has always been questioned in the Malaysian construction industry. Thus the objective of this paper is to uncover the key factors that influence the technology transfer (TT) and technology exchange (TE) process in construction projects in Malaysia. A qualitative research approach was adopted through semi-structured interviews. The interviews were conducted with key construction personnel with experience in TT &amp; TE. The response rate was 67% (24 out of 36 respondents) within a-two month period. The results were analysed by means of content analysis techniques using NVivo software version 8. The findings revealed that the three major factors that influenced the process of technology transfer (TT) and technology exchange (TE) were: types of technology (i.e., knowledge, skills and tools); clientÂ´s requirements, and the cost of technology in TT &amp; TE projects. The results of the study would provide valuable guidelines to both public and private sectors in Malaysia promoting technology transfer and technology exchange within the international projects.

The main objective of this research is to derive a mathematical model of call admission control in WCDMA network. Three main call admission algorithm wideband power based (WPB), throughput based (TB) and adaptive call admission control (ACAC) algorithm are investigated throughout this paper and a little comparison between them is presented.

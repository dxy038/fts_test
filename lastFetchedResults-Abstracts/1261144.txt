Objectives/Hypothesis The objective was to study the role of the Greek version of Voice Handicap Index (VHI) in comparison with Voice Symptom Scale (VoiSS) in terms of measuring voice surgery outcome in patients with benign laryngeal lesions. Study Design Nonrandomized prospective. Methods Forty-six patients operated for benign laryngeal lesions were enrolled in the present study. All patients were assessed according to the European Laryngological Society guidelines. In terms of self-evaluation, patients answered the Greek versions of both VHI and VoiSS, preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively, and the results were statistically analyzed. Results The strongest correlation was observed between the functional subscale of VHI and the impairment subscale of VoiSS, as well as, between the emotional subscales of both VHI and VoiSS, pre- and postoperatively. A statistically significant change in subscale and total scores was found. VHI and VoiSS subscales and total scores correlated with the stroboscopic and aerodynamic measurements in a variable manner. Perceptual measurements, as well as shimmer and harmonic-to-noise ratio showed significant correlation with both VHI and VoiSS subscale and total scores postoperatively. Conclusion VHI and VoiSS are considered useful tools in evaluating voice surgery outcome, in the Greek language.

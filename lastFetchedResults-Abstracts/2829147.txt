An analytical design model is presented for an axial hybrid synchronous machine (AHS O SM) topology that contains both wound rotor and permanent magnet rotor components. The model is used to calculate the field distribution as well as qd-axis model parameters, terminal quantities, loss, mass, and developed torque from design data containing material properties, stator and rotor geometries, and winding layout. The calculated parameters include resistances, inductances, and the back-emf of the machine. The model is verified using finite element analysis and is intended to be used in a multi-objective optimization-based design process, providing the trade-off between competing mass and loss objectives. An outline of the design methodology is presented, along with results obtained for a particular design study.

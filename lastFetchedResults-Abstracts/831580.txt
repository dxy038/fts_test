Stability analyses play an important role in structural dynamics. To treat the occurring problems properly, basic knowledge of the stability theory is required. There are so many different solution techniques in scientific books and journals that there might be doubts whether the proposed algorithms reflect the arising task sufficiently. Therefore, the objective of the present paper is to introduce a unified stability concept based on Lyapunov Exponents. From this, suitable numerical procedures for different types of stability problems can be derived directly. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is documented by means of an appropriate example.

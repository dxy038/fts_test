The concept of Web-based information retrieval support systems (WIRSS) is introduced. The needs for WIRSS are shown by a detailed case study of existing research article indexing and citation analysis systems, such as current content, DBLP, science citation index and CiteSeer. The objective of WIRSS is to build new and effective research tools for scientists to access, explore and use information on the Web, which may lead to improved research productivity and quality.

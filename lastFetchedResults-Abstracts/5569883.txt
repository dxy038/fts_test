This paper presents an evaluation of the image quality using a nonlinear model based on Neural Network, more accurate Multilayer Perceptron. The main objective of estimation is a subjective rating of image quality with the help of the so-called Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale using different combinations of input parameters which present objective metric for assessing the quality of multimedia content. In order to test the performance of the model and identified the how well the proposed model estimates the MOS the reference linear model (linear regression) is chosen. In addition, the paper examines how the selection of input data affects the quality of estimation MOS.

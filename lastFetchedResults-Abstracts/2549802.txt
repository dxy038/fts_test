Background and Objective: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is defined as vomiting sufficiently severe to produce weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory and trophoblast-derived cytokine has ability to induce trophoblasts to secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The purpose of our study was to assay the level of IL-6 and B-hCG in serum of pregnant women suffering from HG during the first trimester of pregnancy and compare with gestational age-matched controls and normal non pregnant women.
Materials and Methods: Plasma concentrations of IL-6 and B-hCG were measured in 30 healthy non pregnant women and 30 women with HG, 30 pregnant women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and 30 normal pregnant women, matched for age, parity and gestational age .
Results: Mean serum levels of B-hCG were higher in women with HG. There was a significant difference between the three groups (P < 0.001) regarding IL-6 level. 
Conclusion: IL-6 levels rise in women with HG and this could lead to higher levels of hCG seen in these patients. It appears that IL-6 does not have a primary role in etiology of HG.

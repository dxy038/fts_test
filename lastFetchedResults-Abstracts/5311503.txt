Real-time scalable data acquisition systems and high performance transducer arrays are strongly interconnected subjects as most transducer arrays demands sophisticated readout systems in order to perform properly. Sound and ultrasound systems such SOund NAvigation and Ranging (SONAR), Sonography, Speech Recognition, Robotic Sensing and Sound Source Separation are a few of many systems that can deploy transducer arrays and require real-time high speed and expandable data acquisition systems. For these system characteristics such as speed, scalability and real-time signal processing are paramount, demanding highly developed data acquisition and processing platforms. Successfully integrating acoustic arrays with generic data acquisition systems is challenging due to the wide variety of requirements regarding speed, signal processing capabilities and scale that acoustic arrays can present. The objective of this work is to present an acoustic imaging system using CAPTAN (Compact And Programmable daTa Acquisition Node) architecture that can deliver these requirements while closely integrated with a specially designed sound imaging array.

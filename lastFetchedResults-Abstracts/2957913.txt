The reconstruction of the transmembrane potential distribution on the heartÂ´s surface using one or two magnetometer arrays on the anterior and posterior side of the thorax simultaneously considering an inhomogeneous boundary element thorax model is presented. The objective is to make an assessment on the localization accuracy. A minimum-norm algorithm is applied for the estimation of the transmembrane potential at the nodes of the epicardial and endocardial boundary element mesh. Results achieved are compared to those obtained by the application of a weighting matrix to remove depth bias

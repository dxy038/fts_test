A new wide-area data network is described. The network employs packet switching techniques within a multi-access, narrowband cellular radio environment and provides a flexible alternative to copper wire telecommunications for short data message applications. Following a discussion of the network requirements, the paper describes the key design areas in terms of a layered model. A new data link layer protocol called dynamic slotted reservation Aloha is introduced. This protocol is optimised for the bidirectional communication of packets containing around 1000 bits of application data. The practical implementation is presented briefly before a number of the major applications are discussed

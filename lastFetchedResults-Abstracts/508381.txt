The present research, using survey method, studies and compares the information seeking behavior of users of the library of the Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation. Results acquired from 250 questionnaires filled by library users reveal that the highest amount of information was requested for humanities subjects. Findings about the method for accessing information show that most library users use both print and electronic resources. According to questionnaire responders, the motivation and objective of searching for information was doing research tasks. Using computer systems was the most frequent way for accessing information resources. Findings showed that responders spend almost half of their time for accessing information resources. Furthermore, undergraduate users have higher motivation to "publish scientific works" in comparison to graduate users. The most important problem of accessing information for undergraduate users was "long distance between the library and their workplace" and for graduate users was "lack of time for searching information".

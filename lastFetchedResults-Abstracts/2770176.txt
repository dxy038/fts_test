This paper proposes a new fault current limiting dynamic voltage restorer (FCL-DVR) concept. The new topology uses a crowbar bidirectional thyristor switch across the output terminals of a conventional back-to-back DVR. In the event of a load short, the DVR controller will deactivate the faulty phase of the DVR and activate its crowbar thyristor to insert the DVR filter reactor into the grid to limit the fault current. A fault condition is detected by sensing the load current and its rate of change. The FCL-DVR will operate with different protection strategies under different fault conditions. Design of the FCL-DVR involves selecting important parameters, such as DVR power rating, dc link voltage of the DVR, output filter reactors and capacitors, and grid-tied transformers is proposed. The design methodology of the proposed FCL-DVR is fully discussed based on power systems computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including dc (EMTDC) simulation. A scaled-down experimental verification is also carried out. Both modeling and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the new FCL-DVR concept for performing both voltage compensation and fault current limiting functions.

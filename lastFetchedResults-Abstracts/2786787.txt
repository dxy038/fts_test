Lately, we are interested in networks of industrial clusters. Though these studies point out the importance of cluster networks, the network itself has not been analyzed. The Japanese shipbuilding industry is concentrated in western Japan, specifically in the Seto-Uchi and northern Kyushu areas, and makes the value chain in this cluster. It consists of two industries, ship manufacturing and marine equipment. The research objective is to derive solutions for some issues regarding future prospects of the Japanese shipbuilding industry cluster by targeting an analysis of the present situation in western Japan, including the Seto-Uchi and northern Kyusyu areas, based on a cluster or a network analysis. Our analysis perspectives are the following three points: (1) transaction status among the cluster, (2) the network structure, and (3) the network function. Our study shows that the multilateralization of Japanese ship industry has changed its cluster structure. The ship manufacturing industry developed out of the Meiji ere Navy yard and was successfully taken over by the private sector. The marine equipment manufacturing industry, on the other hand, was widely spread out across Japan. In other words, we understand that it becomes apparent that this cluster constitutes a specialization network in western Japan and it has a different structure in each industry.

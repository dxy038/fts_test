The objective of controller reduction is to retain the input/output relationship while the order of the controller is reduced. To preserve the closed-loop performance, a structured truncation approach is proposed, in which a structured similarity transformation is obtained to approximate the balanced realization on the closed-loop system, and therefore a controller truncation can be made

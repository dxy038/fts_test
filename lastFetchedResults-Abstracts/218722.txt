Through the proposed model in this study, the production control with the consideration of
workforce scheduling for advanced manufacturing systems becomes realistically and concretely solvable. This
study not only meditates the concept of balancing machine productivity and human ability into the objective,
but also implements Calculus of Variations to optimize the profit for a deterministic production quantity. In
addition, the optimum solutions of dynamic productivity control and workforce scheduling are comprehensively
provided. Moreover, the decision criteria for selecting the optimum solution and the sensitivity analysis of the
critical variables are fully discussed. This study definitely contributes the applicable strategy to control the
productivity and workforce in manufacturing and provides the valuable tool to conclusively optimize the profit
of a machining project for operations research in today's manufacturing industry with profound insight.

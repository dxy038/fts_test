Pressure distribution at the driver-seat interface has been regarded as an objective measure having a clear association with subjective ratings, yet existing evidence regarding its efficacy is unclear. This study examined associations between driver´s seating discomfort and kinds of pressure distribution variables considering driver´s behaviours showing discomfort - changing seating postures and moving frequently. This requires quantitative and dynamic analyses of body pressure distribution. To investigate the relationship of pressure data with driver´s postural changes, eight subjects performed a simulated driving task for 100 min in a driving simulator. The driving postures and body-seat interface pressure were measured continuously, and the subjective ratings were surveyed at the prescribed interval. In this study, two kinds of body pressure distribution variables were proposed as components of a discomfort assessment framework, and the relationship between these pressure variables with subjective ratings were analyzed. The close correlations between the pressure ratio variables and subjective ratings supported the possibility of using pressure data as a tool for the assessment of driver discomfort. It was also found that the change of load center position represented the change of driver´s postures and might be a good indicator for discomfort prediction.

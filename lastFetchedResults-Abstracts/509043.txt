Background and Objective: Urinary stress incontinence has been
defined as any involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion or
on sneezing or coughing. Physical treatment and rehabilitation have
an important role in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.
Subjects and Methods: In this clinical trial study, forty five women
with urinary stress incontinence were included .Diagnosis was made
according to the detailed history, physical examinations and urinary
tests. All cases were randomly divided into three groups. Fifteen
cases underwent kegel exercises, fifteen other cases underwent
interferential current and both treatment (kegel exercise and
interferential current) were applied the remaining cases. Number of
leakages in three days and amount of leakage were evaluated pre
and post treatment and the values of these data were compared in
each group and among groups.
Results: All of the parameters improved after treatment in each
group (p < 0/05). Kegel exercise and interferential current seemed to
have similar effects on the number of leakages in three days before
and after test. Treatment with kegel exercise and interferential
current together was more effective on decreasing the number of
leakages in three days than each one alone (p < 0/05).
Conclusions: Physical therapy modalities used in this trial are easy
and non invasive. Treatment with kegel exercise and interferential
current together can be more effective in patients with urinary stress
incontinence.

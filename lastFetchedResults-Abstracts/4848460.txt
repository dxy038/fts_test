In this paper the application of an innovative SAR image processing developed by the authors - that provides a map of the point by point fractal dimension of a single (amplitude) SAR image - to a data-set of COSMO-SkyMed images, with look angles varying from 20&#176; to 45&#176;, is presented. The main objective is the analysis of the fractal behavior of natural and urban scenarios, with particular evidence to the fact that fractal dimension estimation, in the case of SAR images of natural areas, turns out to be independent of the sensor viewing geometry, while for urban areas it is strongly dependent on look angle variations.

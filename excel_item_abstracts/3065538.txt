Various techniques have been developed for enhanced image processing. However, the issue of storage and querying on these images is usually discussed separately in the context of multimedia information retrieval systems. In this paper, we describe the architecture of a system which supports the coupling of effective image management with enhanced image processing techniques, where image retrieval is conducted by using an image algebra. We have also developed a prototype medical image retrieval system to illustrate our idea.

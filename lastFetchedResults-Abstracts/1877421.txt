Objective
cribe patterns of bath care for patients who are weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) and to explore the association between bathing and weaning trial duration.
s
ptive correlational study. Clinical records from 439 weaning trial days for 30 patients who required PMV were abstracted for bathing occurrences during weaning trials, within 1 hour before a trial, and nocturnally.
s
aths occurred during weaning trials (30.8%) or at night (35.3%), and less frequently (16%) within 1 hour before a trial. No significant effects were found on trial duration for nocturnal bathing or bathing within 1 hour before a trial. By using random coefficient modeling, weaning duration was shown to be longer when bathing occurred during a weaning trial (P &lt; .05), even when controlling for age, severity of illness, and days on bedrest.
sion
g occurred during approximately one third of PMV weaning trials. Baths during PMV weaning trials were associated with longer weaning trial duration.

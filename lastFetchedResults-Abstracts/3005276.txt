We are concerned with the reconstruction of a regularly-sampled image based on irregularly-spaced samples thereof. We propose a new iterative method based on a cubic spline representation of the image. An objective function taking into account the similarity to the known samples and the regularity of the function is minimized in order to obtain a good approximation. We apply the developed algorithm to motion-compensated image interpolation. Under motion compensation, the resulting sampling grids are irregular and require irregular/regular interpolation. We show experimental results on real-world images and we compare our results with other methods proposed in the literature.

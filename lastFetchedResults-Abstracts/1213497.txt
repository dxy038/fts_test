This study addresses the intensification of heterogeneously catalysed multiphase reactions using thin flow channel approaches, where the gas liquid and slurry catalyst are all circulated through the reactor, in contrast to the wall coated and packed bed approaches generally used. Resorcinol hydrogenation is used as an example reaction. Catalyst screening and process parameter investigations were carried out using a representative single capillary. The main objective of this paper is however to evaluate the scalability of this “structured slurry bubble column” concept through the use of heat exchange (HEx) reactors, and particularly exploring the various process channel design features made possible by the “shim” mode of construction. Hydrodynamic studies of gas, liquid and solid transport using magnetic resonance imaging and video-graphic techniques are reported. Twelve prototype HEx reactors were manufactured, and seven of these were selected for testing under reaction conditions. The results presented are discussed in terms of the observations of phase transport characteristics. This study shows the viability of implementation of a structured slurry bubble column using a heat exchange reactor design approach.

Objective: Free radical induced tissue damage has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases. We aimed to investigate the role of free radicals and scavenging enzymes in children with obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
Materials and methods: The study consisted of 29 children with obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy and 51 control subjects with similar age and sex. All the patients and/or their parents had complaints of snoring, mouth breathing, and pausing of breath during sleep for at least 6 months. All patients underwent an adenotonsillectomy operation under general anesthesia with curettage and cold dissection methods. Venous blood was taken preoperatively and 4 weeks postoperatively. After collection of blood samples into citrate (3.5 mg/ml blood) containing glass tubes, erythrocyte sediments were prepared for the analyses. Then malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured.
Results: The levels of MDA and activities of SOD and GSHPx were significantly higher in the pre-tonsillectomy period than in the post-tonsillectomy period. However, CAT activity was not different in pre- and postoperative period.
Conclusion: Our study supports the notion that oxidant and antioxidant defense mechanisms are altered in children with obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and this alteration improves after tonsillectomy.

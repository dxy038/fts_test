A novel multi-objective hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on evolutionary programming (EP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), named MOEPPSO, is presented to coordinate multiple thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) devices in power system. The coordinate design problem of TCSCs is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the system response is optimized by minimizing several system behavior measure criterions. Then, MOEPPSO is employed to search optimal controller parameters. Design of the multi-objective optimization aims to find out the Pareto optimal solution which is a set of possible optimal solutions for controller parameters. The proposed approach has been applied to a typical IEEE 4-machine 11-bus system with two TCSCs. In comparison with separate design of the controllers, the better performance of the system is achieved.

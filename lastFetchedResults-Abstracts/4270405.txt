This paper presents the simulation and modelling of a low-frequency AC distribution power system for hybrid optical fiber/coaxial cable telecommunication architecture. The objective is to study the powering requirement and the maximum loading capability of the network. The modeling of the distribution cables and the constant-power load are discussed. The voltage distribution of the network under various operating conditions is studied through computer simulation and results are reported in this paper

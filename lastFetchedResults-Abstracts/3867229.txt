Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) constitute a well-known type of probabilistic neural networks. One of their many successful applications is in image segmentation, where spatially constrained mixture models have been trained using the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. In this letter, we elaborate on this method and propose a new methodology for the M-step of the EM algorithm that is based on a novel constrained optimization formulation. Numerical experiments using simulated images illustrate the superior performance of our method in terms of the attained maximum value of the objective function and segmentation accuracy compared to previous implementations of this approach.

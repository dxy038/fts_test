This paper focuses on capacity optimization configuration of electric vehicle battery exchange stations containing photovoltaic (PV) power generation. First, the system structure of battery exchange stations with PV system is given. Then the method for calculating the power generated by PV system is discussed. The objective function of system capacity optimization model is established with the goal of annual profit of battery exchange stations containing PV system. And the constraints of the optimization model including the system variables and the system balance in power and energy are analyzed in detail. Finally, an example verifies that the optimization model established by this paper is feasible. The example result shows that this model enables the capacity of system components to match well. The optimization model proposed by this paper can provide some reference for planning and design of battery exchange stations containing PV system.

Most of technologically applied explosives contain a considerable amount of nitrogen. During an explosion the molecules decompose and nitrogen, as other atoms, creates—more stable, than those in explosives—compounds, mainly nitrogen oxides (NOx).

In the authors’ opinion it is possible to match the chemical composition of the explosives so as to eliminate or considerably decrease the NOx created, and thus the explosion products will contain N2 and NH3, which are the gases that are applied for nitriding. High pressure and temperature, which accompany the explosion should facilitate nitrogen penetration into the metal surface. However, very short time of gaseous products reaction may appear too short for fixed nitrogen binding; checking the above mentioned theory was the main objective of the present research.

To carry out the early research some kinds of explosives were chosen. The explosives contained various quantities of nitrogen and after determining the explosion parameters the following one was finally chosen, MWS-2. The experiments of direct explosive nitriding were carried out on iron-armco and steel samples of grade 33H3MF and 38HMJ. The steel sample shape was a disk of diameter 50–70 mm and thickness 20–30 mm. The sample charge was applied three times and then the hardening effect and nitrogen diffusion were determined.

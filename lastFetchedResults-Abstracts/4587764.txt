The objective of this research project is to propose a Web services oriented framework for e-learning systems aimed at providing a flexible integration model in which all the learning components and applications are well defined, effectively discovered and loosely connected. Web services provide an essential deploy environment to realize dynamic e-learning/e-business systems by facilitating application-to-application interaction. Using the proposed framework, learning service providers will be able to publish their learning objects or applications universally and learning service requesters can retrieve those services anywhere, any time with any device (wired or wireless) through common communication protocols. The key values of interoperability and reusability in the proposed architecture enhance the future e-learning systems to communicate more efficiently and share data more easily.

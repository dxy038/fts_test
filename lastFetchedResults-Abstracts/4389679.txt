The productivity gap between analog and digital circuit design has been steadily increasingly over the past four decades of semiconductor development, largely driven by advances in digital CAD. Using a simple design productivity metric, like the number of transistor utilized per man-months for any given design, the analog team can incorporate anywhere between 10 - 100 transistors per man-months whereas the digital design team can utilize 100Â´s of thousands or more per man-months. It is the objective of this paper to describe how time-mode signal processing can be used to reduce the analog-digital productivity gap and, in addition, consider how time-mode signal processing can assist with manufacturing considerations like analog/mixed-signal production test.

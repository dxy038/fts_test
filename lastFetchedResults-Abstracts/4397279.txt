This paper presents an analysis of a shell and tube heat exchanger, carried out using a finite element method for the optimal design. The main objective in any heat exchanger design is the estimation of the minimum heat transfer area required for a given heat duty, as it governs the overall cost of the heat exchanger. Step by step on designing the software is build first to make the work on calculation easy and simple by using finite element method. Numbers of configurations are possible with various design variables such as outer diameter, pitch, and length of the tubes; tube passes; baffle spacing; baffle cut etc. Hence the engineer needs an efficient strategy in searching for the global minimum. Here the shell and tube line utilizes bare tube (straight and u-tubes), helical low-fin outside, longitudinal fins (inside &amp; outside are available). These exchangers are suitable for a variety of applications and are offered in fixed tube sheets or removable bundles. A finite element model to predict temperature distribution in heat exchanger is reported. The predictions are in good agreement with available analytical solutions. The model can be effectively used to analyze and design heat exchangers with complex flow arrangements for which no regular design procedure is available. Illustrations are provided to explain the application of the method for the analysis of shell and tube heat exchangers.

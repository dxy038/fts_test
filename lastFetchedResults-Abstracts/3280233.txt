This paper is dedicated to the study of HARQ protocols under a secrecy constraint. An encoder sends information to a legitimate decoder while keeping it secret from the eavesdropper. Our objective is to provide a coding scheme that satisfies both reliability and confidentiality conditions. This problem has been investigated in the literature using a coding scheme that involves a unique secrecy parameter. The uniqueness of this parameter is sub-optimal for the throughput criteria and we propose a new coding scheme that introduces additional degrees of freedom. Our code involves Secrecy Adaptation and Rate Adaptation and we called it SARA-code. The first contribution is to prove that the SARA-code has small error probability and small information leakage rate. The second contribution is to show, over a numerical example, that the SARA-code improves the secrecy throughput.

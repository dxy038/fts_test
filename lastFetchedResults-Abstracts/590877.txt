Introduction & Objective: Biological effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the body of live organisms, have been studied by researchers in recent years. UV affects human organs such as skin, eyes and immune system, as well as animals and plants. The main natural source of UV radiation is the Sun. So, the integral observation of UV levels and their effects at ground level is important to determine the present and future environmental and health implications of  the solar UV radiation. Since the amount of UVR (UV radiation) has not already been measured in Hamadan, the aim of this study was to measure the amount in Hamadan city in different months of the year. 
Materials & Methods: This work was  a cross-sectional study and has assessed the solar UVA radiation, by calibrated Hagner digital radiometer, model EC1 UV-A. The monthly quantity of solar UVR was measured in Hamadan during one year (2011-2012). 
Results: The maximum UVA received on the ground level was 27.3±1.09 W/m2  in Shahrivar month (Aug 23 – Sep 22) while the minimum was 11.8±1.32 W/m2 in Azar month (Nov 22 – Dec 21) . Total UVA radiation received on the ground level was 19.74±1.56 W/m2  during the period of measurment.
Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it seems that the annual UVA in Hamadan city exceeded the amounts recommended by the WHO and further studies are needed to measure UVB and UVC to determine the total UV radiation level in thecity. Based on these results, it is recommended to wear appropriate sunglasses and  minimize sun exposure during the midday hours.

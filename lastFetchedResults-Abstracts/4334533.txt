Distributed generation (DG) placement is addressed in this paper. A cost based model to find the optimal size and location of distributed generation sources in a power distribution system is proposed in which the objective is defined as minimization of DG investment cost and total operation cost of the system. The proposed objective function and its constraints form an optimization problem which is solved using ant colony optimization (ACO) as the optimization tool. Application example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

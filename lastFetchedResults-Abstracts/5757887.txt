This paper presents an overview of the second Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions, CROHME 2012. The objective of the contest is to identify current advances in mathematical expression recognition using common evaluation performance measures and datasets. This paper describes the contest details including the evaluation measures used as well as the performance of the 7 submitted systems along with a short description of each system. Progress as compared to the 1st version of CROHME is also documented.

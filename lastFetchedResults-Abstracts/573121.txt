Using pheromone traps is one of the suitable methods for monitoring and control of forest pests. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of atmospheric conditions and daily times on pheromone traps efficiency of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.). Sampling was carried out in Daland forest park during 2008. Samples were taken on three atmospheric conditions (sunny, cloudy and rainy) and daily times (07:00 AM, 08:00 PM and and 01:00 PM). A factorial experiment in a randomized design was used to analyze the data and means were compared using Duncanâ€™s multiple range test. Eight white traps were placed on trees at distance of 100-150 m from each other at 1.5 m height in each site. Results showed that atmospheric conditions and daily times of day had significant (P < 0.001) effects on number of males capture in pheromone traps. The interaction of daily times and atmospheric conditions were also significant. Maximum captures of male moths were observed at 07:00 AM, and sunny conditions. Also, minimum captures occurred in 08:00 PM and rainy conditions.

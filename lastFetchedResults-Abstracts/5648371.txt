Considering the difficultly of passengers taking elevators in up-peak traffic mode, this paper studies and gives an optimal strategy of elevator group dynamic zoning dispatching. Firstly, this paper explains the basis and algorithm about this elevator group dynamic zoning dispatching model. Then it establishes one elevator service quality model and one elevator energy loss model separately. Based on those and the multi-objective optimization method, ultimately it establishes an optimization model of elevator group zoning dispatching. Finally, the superiority of the model is verified by one example.

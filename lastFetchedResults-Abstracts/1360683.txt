<p>The objective of this experiment was evaluation of self-compatibility and identification, introduction and selection of late flowering genotypes as cultivars. This experiment was carried out in order to determine the best pollinator for two commercial almond cultivars, 'Shahrood 12' and 'Shahrood 21'. Applied pollinator cultivars were included pollen from 'Shahrood 21', 'Genco', 'Tuno', '5-15' and 'Super-nova' that were applied on 'Shahrood 21' mother trees, and 'Shahrood 12', 'FeilipCeo', 'Tuno', '5-15' and 'Super-nova'. Results showed no fruit formation in non-pollinated and self-pollinated flowers. Although, results from cross pollination using pollen from other cultivars showed higher fruit set using pollen of 'Genco' for 'Shahrood 21' , and '15-5' for 'Shahrood 12' cultivars. Samples were collected using pollinated flowers for further microscopic examinations. Field and microscopic examination of pollen tube growth in the style confirmed above results. The quantitative traits of fruits obtained of some known almond hybrids were assessed in order to evaluation of this phenomenon which known as xenia. The recorded traits were length (L), width (W), thickness (T) of fruits and seeds, and W/L and T/L ratios.</p>

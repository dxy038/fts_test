This note deals with chained form systems with strongly nonlinear unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. The objective is to design a robust nonlinear state feedback law such that the closed-loop system is globally Kexponentially stable. We propose a novel switching control strategy involving the use of input/state scaling and integrator backstepping. The new features of our controllers include the ability to achieve Lyapunov stability, exponential convergence, and robustness to a set of uncertain drift terms.

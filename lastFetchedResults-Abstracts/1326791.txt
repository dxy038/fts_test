Korean government agencies manage bridge structures at the network level using a Bridge Management System (BMS). One of the most important functions of the BMS is to provide the agencies with an effective decision making tool for managing bridges. Especially, it is very important for the BMS to assist in prioritizing routine maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement activities to optimize the given constrained budgets. This paper suggests an algorithm for the BMS to prioritize bridge maintenance activities at the network level and to show its implementation. The selection of maintenance activities can be modeled as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. A genetic algorithm is used to solve it. Using bridge decks as an example, the application of genetic algorithms is demonstrated and the feasibility of the suggested methodology is examined through some numerical case studies.

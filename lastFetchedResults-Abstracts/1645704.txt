Introduction & Objective: Biological scaffolds, composed of Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM), are capable of facilitating the restructuring of a large number of tissues. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ovine bladder scaffold of sheep, domesticated breed, on blastema cells in vitro
Materials and Methods: At first, ovine bladder o the sheep was decellularized by putting in 1% wt/vol solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 24 hours. Then to prepare the blastema tissue, the pinna of New Zealand rabbit was manually punched-hole with a special puncher and a circular blastema was separated. There after, the decellularized samples were put in the middle of blastema ring and were transfered to the culture medium. To continue the study, microscope with lights of hematoxylin & eosin and pick indigo and Toluidine blue staining was used. Some samples on the day 15 and 20 of culture were studied by transitional electron microscope.
Results: Collagen fibers were preserved after decellularized in matrix of bladder. Most migration of blastema cells occurred on days 15 and 20 of culture. On the day 10 and 15, some immature cells were differentiation in the pathway of adipocyte and fibroblast. On the day 15th and 20th, more blastema cells were migrated to the ovine scaffold. On the 10th and 15 day immature cell culture was seen to be differentiated from fibroblast and adipocyte cells. On the 15 th day blastema cell culture differentiated from covering cells and on the 20th day from fibroblast and adipocyte cells were seen.
Conclusion: Bladder scaffold has ability to induce blastema cells and causes not only   blastoma cellsâ€™ migration but also to be changed to different cells. This phenomenon is very important because of no growth factor and inducer was used in culture medium.

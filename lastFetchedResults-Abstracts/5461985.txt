This paper presents an optimal transmit strategy for multiple antennas bidirectional broadcast channels in the wideband regime. The transmit covariance matrix at the relay has been designed in order to maximize the wideband weighted sum rate. A closed form of the optimal matrix is derived, which shows that a single beam transmit strategy is optimal. The transmit strategies for some special cases, the wideband capacity region, and the minimum energy per bit versus fairness issues are also discussed.

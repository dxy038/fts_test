In this paper, we extend the traditional grey situation decision to the case of decision information serving as interval grey number, and provide multi-objective weight optimization model of multi-objective grey situation decision. Taking the deviation in different objectives among the effect measure of each situation, positive and negative ideal into consideration first, the optimization model is established, and the ideal objective weight of each situation also obtained. Then, a quadratic programming model is set up from the whole and objective integrated weight vector of grey situation decision acquired as well. We sort the situation of each event by the possibility degree of interval grey number and get the optimal situation, so that the traditional theory of grey situation decision is improved. The feasibility and efficiency of the model is finally tested and verified by an example.

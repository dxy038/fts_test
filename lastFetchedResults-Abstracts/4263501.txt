In this paper, the objective was to investigate the heart rate variability in two selected groups of premature infants (sepsis vs non-sepsis). We studied the RR interval series not only by linear methods - time domain and frequency domain, but also by non-linear methods - chaos theory and information theory, in order to find the optimal parameters to distinguish sepsis premature infants from non-sepsis ones. The results show that indexes of information theory are useful parameters for the diagnosis of late neonatal infection in premature infants with recurrent apnea-bradycardia.

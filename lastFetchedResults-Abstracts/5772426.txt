Objective: Ascertain relations between brain responses elicited by stimuli of different modalities (visual and audiological). The stimuli used were based on some of the basic elements and concepts of the visual syntax, regarding to the Gestalt theory, and an audiological grammar based on the clinical protocols. Methods: We used Event-Related Potentials for assessing the brainÂ´s electrical response to visual and auditory stimuli. Materials: Biopac Systems Mp 150 - Data acquisition unit &#8220;MP150A.CE&#8221;; universal interface module &#8220;UIM100C&#8221;; stimulator module &#8220;STM100C&#8221;, two electroencephalogram amplifier modules &#8220;EEG100C&#8221;; Ag-AgCL lead electrodes - AcqKnowledge 3.9.0 (software); SuperLab 4.0 (software) and MatlabR2008B. Results: Interim results presented in form of waveforms representing the average and standard deviation of all signals acquired for each type of stimulus. Conclusions: We can visually conclude that different modalities elicit different waveforms and certain stimuli have a more defined response than others.

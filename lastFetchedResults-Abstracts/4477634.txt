We consider the problem of real-time distributed admission controls and a centralized static sequential homing policy for channelized wireless communication networks. To maximize the spectrum efficiency, we study the effect of adjustable channel separation together considering generic channel interference on different propagation environments. For purpose of maximizing system revenue, sequential homing policies can cooperate with channel assignment to prearrange channel resource more efficiency. The emphasis of this work is to develop a centralized sequential homing algorithm and determine a fixed channel allocation scheme to support real-time distributed admission control. We formulate the sequential homing problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, where the objective function is to minimize the total call blocking rate of systems. The basic solution approach is Lagrangean relaxation. In the computational experiments, we compared the proposed algorithm with the power dominant heuristic on test networks. The proposed algorithm average achieved up to 99% improvement of the total call blocking rate.

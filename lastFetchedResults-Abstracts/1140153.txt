The objective of this work was to study oil absorption and the kinetics of texture development of fried potato slices during frying. Prior to frying, potato slices were blanched in hot water at 85 °C for 3.5 min. Unblanched slices were used as the control. Control and blanched potato slices (Panda variety, diameter: 37 mm, width: 2.2 mm) were fried at 120, 150 and 180 °C until reaching moisture contents of ∼1.8% (total basis) and their texture and oil content were measured periodically. Oil uptake was higher in ∼15% for blanched samples than for control samples after 20 s of frying. Besides, the higher the frying temperature, the lower the oil absorption in control samples. Textural changes in fried potato slices were followed by the parameter maximum force (MF) extracted from the force vs. distance curves corresponding to different sampling times. Normalized maximum force (MF*) was used in modeling textural changes in the potato slices during frying in both the initial tissue softening process and the later crust development process. Higher temperatures accelerated these processes; however neither the temperature nor the pre-treatment had a significant effect (P > 0.05) over the final texture of the fried potato chips.

The problem of optimum synthesis of the planar four-bar function generator is investigated and the practical case of the Ackermann steering linkage considered as an example. The reduced number of design parameters of this symmetric four-bar linkage allowed inspecting the design space of various types of objective functions through 3D representations, and their properties suggestively highlighted. For practical purposes, the numerical results were summarized in a set of parametric design-charts useful to the automotive engineer in conceiving the steering linkage of a new vehicle.

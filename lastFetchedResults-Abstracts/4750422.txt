Buffer analyzing is widely used for identifying areas surrounding geographic features. As the volume of spatial data increases rapidly, a high computational power is required. Over the past decade, grid has become a powerful tool to provide huge computational capabilities. It allocates the resource efficiently to applications. The objective of This work is to investigate the performance of buffer analysis in grid computing environments. In this paper, we discuss the parallel generation algorithm of line buffer zone. Our experiments were performed on a grid-computing environment, which is in the High-Throughput Spatial Information Processing Prototype System based on Grid platform in Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The computing nodes are heterogeneous. Performance results are also reported in This work.

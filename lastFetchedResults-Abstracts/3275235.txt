The objective is the new development of a Software-Tool, known as FRCas, to calculate the failure rates from various components. This Software-Tool should offer the User the opportunity to determine the failure rate for various components on the basis of various Standards of Siemens SN 29500, Military Handbok MIL-HNDB, SINTEF, and CENELEC. The user should be able to obtain results with this Tool without previous knowledge of the details of standard. A further objective is the integration of Program Package "OrCAD" into the developed Software-Tool, therefore to determine the failure rates of individual components that are in the OrCAD developed electronic circuits.

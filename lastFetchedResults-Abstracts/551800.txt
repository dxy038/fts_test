Uncertainty inherent in the nancial market was usually consid-
ered to be random. However, randomness is only one special type of uncer-
tainty and appropriate when describing objective information. For describing
subjective information it is preferred to assume that uncertainty is fuzzy. This
paper denes the expected payo of trading strategies in a fuzzy nancial
market within the framework of credibility theory. In addition, a computable
integral form is obtained for expected payo of each strategy.

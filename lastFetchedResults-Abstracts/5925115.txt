In order to increase the reliability and response speed of a DC microgrid system, the power management algorithm for autonomous operation is proposed using a DC-bus signaling (DBS) method, instead of the centralized power management system which needs communications among power interfaces. The DC-bus voltage is considered as an information signal of the status of the DC-bus. In addition, DC-bus voltage bands are proposed to classify the scenarios of DC-bus conditions. The DC microgrid components individually operate to achieve the functionality of the system control in the DC-bus voltage band. This paper suggests a control strategy for the power management among independent components in the islanding mode. Its test-bed contains the power management algorithm which consists of a grid-connected AC/DC rectifier, a bidirectional DC/DC converter, a renewable energy simulator, DC loads, and a DC-bus protector. The proposed power management algorithm in the islanding mode is analyzed via simulation result, which is verified from the proposed DC microgrid test-bed.

The objective of this research was to identify emotional factors that affect the perceived value of products. After collecting 400 statements from consumer case studies, the authors summarized these statements into fifteen elements. Principal component analysis was then used to extract four emotional dimensions: Features (F), Association (A), Social-esteem (S), and Engagement (E). This system was called the FASE Index. To validate the applicability of these factors, this study used two design cases and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to quantitatively measure the perceived value of products. The results showed that the FASE index was sensitive enough for evaluating different products. In addition, there were no significant differences between the experiences of designers and potential consumers in these cases.

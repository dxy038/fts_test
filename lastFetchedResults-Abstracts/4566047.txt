The major objective of this VLSI module design is to determine how to modify a fast floating-point multiplier so that it can perform division and square root in accordance with IEEE standards. This has been achieved by applying the Newton-Ralphson iteration only on the mantissa and adjusting the iterated result by a rounding algorithm. Using 1.0-&#956;m CMOS standard cell technology, the total area of this module is approximately 7.0 mm&#215;6.5 mm, which is just 25% larger than the floating-point multiplier. The module can compute multiplication, division, and square root in 3, 31, and 43 cycles, respectively. The cycle time, under nominal conditions, is expected to be 20 ns

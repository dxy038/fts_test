The objective of this research was to determine to what extent organizational intelligence (OI) has been achieved within private and public schools according to the perceptions of principals and teachers. The research included 499 principals and teachers -380 principals and teachers employed by public primary schools and 119 principals and teachers within the private primary school system- in Sakarya. Data was gathered utilizing the "Organizational Intelligence in Primary Education Schools Questionnaire" adapted from "Dimensions of the Organizational Intelligence Questionnaire" developed by Albrecht (2002). These findings were based on significant differences of perception concerning OI levels for the following dimensions: strategic vision, shared fate, appetite for change, heart, alignment and congruence, knowledge deployment and performance pressure. The results from analysis of all OI dimensions revealed that performances of private primary schools are superior to public primary schools. Principals and teachers with 21 years or more experience expressed more positive perceptions toward all OI dimensions. However, gender among the research subjects registered no effect on OI perceptions.

Objective
s on the influence of low-power red laser on the repair of dental structures are very scarce. This study investigated the effects of the laser therapy on the ultrastructure of the dentine–pulp interface after conservative class I cavity preparation.

male volunteers with 8 premolars indicated for extraction for orthodontic reasons were recruited. Class I cavities were prepared and the teeth were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received treatment with a GaA1As laser, λ = 660 nm, power of 30 mW and energy dose of 2 J/cm2, directly and perpendicularly into the cavity in a single visit. After the irradiation, the cavities were filled with composite resin. The second group received the same treatment, except by the laser therapy.
s
-eight days post-preparation, the teeth were extracted and processed for transmission electron microscopy analysis. Two sound teeth, without cavity preparation, were also studied. The irradiated group presented odontoblast process in higher contact with the extracellular matrix and the collagen fibrils appeared more aggregated and organised than those of control group. These results were also observed in the healthy teeth.
sion
findings suggest that laser irradiation accelerates the recovery of the dental structures involved in the cavity preparation at the predentine region.

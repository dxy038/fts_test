The primary objective of this technical note is to establish an equivalence between the (preconditioned) conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm and a special central difference based DR procedure, thereby revealing a discrete dynamic nature of the CG iterative procedure. This may therefore provide an alterative viewpoint to gain a further understanding of the CG method and its variants.

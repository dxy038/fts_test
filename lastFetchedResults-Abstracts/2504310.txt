Background: The application of luteal phase supplementation hormones to increase the
implantation rate is on debate among researchers.
Objective: In this study, the morphological and morphometrical assessment of
superovulated mice endometrium were investigated at window implantation period
superovulated mice.
Materials and Methods: Female mice were superovualated then were mated with
vasectomized mice; the mice were divided in experimental and control groups.
Experimental group included five groups which in them pseudopregnant mice were
given a four consecutive daily injection of 1-progesterone (P), 2-estrogen (E), 3-
estrogen + progesterone, 4-antiprogesterone+estrogen and 5-sham group. The uterine of
all groups were collected after 4.5 day of pseudopregnancy and were prepared for
histological and morphometrical studies.
Results: Morphological studies of endometrial tissue showed that the luminal
epithelium in group P appeared cuboidal shape. Endometrial folding was very high in
group E+P. The luminal epithelium in groups E, E+P and RU 486 + E were seen in
different morphology in comparison to control group. Morphometrical evaluation also
showed height of luminal epithelium in group E (32.7±0.67) and E+P (33.6±1.3) were
higher than those were seen in control (22.5±1.5) and group P (15.3±1.2).
Conclusion: Progesterone caused the lowest endometrial development compare to other
groups. It is concluded that the adding of E to P may improve endometrial condition to
implant at luteal phase.

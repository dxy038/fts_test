Since more than half a century, much has been written and spoken about Andre
Gide, one of the greatest thinkers of the 20" century, Perhaps, it seems that nothing
new remains to be said about Gide, the winner of the Nobel Prize. However, effort
will be made to demonstrate the effect of Gide's private experiences on his works by
using the analytic-expressive method and structural theories in literacy criticism,
also effort will be made to offer an exact definition for immoral and unethical
words, in order to erase his negative reputation of being an immoral person. After
traveling to North-Africa for curing his tuberculosis disease and there meeting Oscar
Wild, Gide started to teach passion to Natanael in Fruits ofthe Earth and encourage
her to be ready to experience new joys and anxieties, more than before. He shows
these two themes again in Strait is the Gate, whose base is in the Christian religion
which Gide knows completely because of his orthodox upbringing.
Gide's life and his works show the contrast between darkness and light. He
introduces himself as hen compared to his angel-like wife, Madeleine. Freedom and
moral limitations are the source of contradiction in his mind.While narrating
childhood memories, he describes his intrinsic inclinations in If it die ...: An
Autobiography, He introduces his theory of "Action without Reason", which is an
important issue against God and the regulation ofthe world in The Vatican Cellars.

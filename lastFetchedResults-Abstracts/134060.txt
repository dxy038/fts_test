Introduction: In a fast growing organization which has activities in several geographical locations, efficient utilization of expert knowledge is a challenge. Many researches have begun to distinguish between conceptual use of knowledge and instrumental use or changes in behavior and practice. So, one central question is whether the approaches do support the motivation of people to use the knowledge and the next point of interest is about knowledge utilization.
Objective: This study was conducted to review knowledge utilization process to recognize and compare current models of knowledge utilization in medical sciences.
Materials and Methods: Systematic review of articles was applied on basis of Internet resources covering knowledge utilization disseminated between 1997-2003.
Results: Utilization may be conceptual, instrumental or even strategic. There are different models of knowledge utilization in medical sciences: Estabrooks, Behavioral,COHRED , Ace star , CURN Stetler CCI and Iowa. Comparing these models based on five factors implied that COHRED model and CCI model are more complete than the other models.
Conclusion: Knowledge utilization means knowledge reception, perception and influence on receiver's action. The produced knowledge of medical sciences is useful provided it could be applied in the process of health development.

This paper presents a very effective method for direct load control (DLC) dispatch with the objective of minimizing system operational costs. In the paper, the coordination between DLC dispatch and unit commitment is discussed, and the significant potential benefit accrued from using DLC capacity as a part of system spinning reserve is illustrated. This paper also presents an extension of the proposed method to include consideration of capital cost saving.

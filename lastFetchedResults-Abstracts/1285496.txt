Despite the leading role of South East Asian Nations, Iranian researchers also made some efforts in theorizing the international relations, but there hasnâ€™t been an attempt to show its development in Iran, as a result, the changes in this field and our present position is not clear. (Question) The process of theorizing international relations in Iran can be divided into two main streams; contextualizing stream and theorizing stream, which the former paves the way necessary for the latter. (Hypothesis) Showing the status and process of theorizing in international relations helps us to recognize the factors necessary for localization and theorizing and to understand the changes in this field. (Objective) The present research used the descriptive investigation of prominent works on this issue by comparative and quantitative methods as a way to answer the question. (Methodology) Presenting an organized model of the development of theorizing in international relations in Iran and revealing the attempt of researchers in the Islamic seminaries and universities for the localization and Islamization of this issue are from the results of the present paper.

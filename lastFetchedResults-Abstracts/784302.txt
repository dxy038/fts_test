Purpose The objective of the present study was to provide
updated data from nine European countries about the
impact of social inequalities in the prevalence of common
mental disorders.
Methods Cross-sectional household survey of a representative
sample of the adult general population of Belgium,
Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Northern
Ireland, Portugal, Romania and Spain. In total, 34,395
individuals were included. Social inequalities in 12-month
mood, anxiety and alcohol-related disorders were evaluated.
Results In Europe, income seems not to be related to the
prevalence of mental disorders. Unemployment and disablement
are associated with mental disorders. Lower
educational level augments the risk for mood disorders.
Living in small (rural) areas decreases the risk for mooddisorders and living in urban settings increases it. Northern
Ireland, Portugal and Belgium are the countries with the
highest risks for mental disorders.
Conclusions Despite some contradictions with previous
literature, in Europe there are social inequalities in the
prevalence of mental disorders. However, income showed
not to be associated with inequalities in mental health.
Being younger, unemployed or disabled, with no education
or incomplete primary studies, living in urban settings, and
in Northern Ireland, Portugal or Belgium were associated
to an augmented prevalence of mental disorders. Policy
makers could focus on mental health promotion and mental
disorders prevention programmes for risk groups such as
unemployed/disabled individuals. Support to vulnerable
groups (unemployed or those with less education) and
mental health literacy can improve European citizensâ€™
mental health.

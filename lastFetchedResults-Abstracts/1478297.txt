The analysis of the time-splitting procedure implemented in the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) is presented. The time-splitting procedure uses different time steps to describe the evolution of interacting fast and slow propagating modes. In the general case the exact separation of the fast and slow modes is not possible. The main idea of the analyzed procedure is to split the system of primitive equations into two systems of equations for interacting external and internal modes. By definition, the internal mode varies slowly and the crux of the problem is to determine the proper filter, which excludes the fast component of the external mode variables in the relevant equations. The objective of this paper is to examine properties of the POM time-splitting procedure applied to equations governing the simplest linear non-rotating two-layer model of constant depth. The simplicity of the model makes it possible to study these properties analytically. First, the time-split system of differential equations is examined for two types of the determination of the slow component based on an asymptotic approach or time-averaging. Second, the differential-difference scheme is developed and some criteria of its stability are discussed for centered, forward, or backward time-averaging of the external mode variables. Finally, the stability of the POM time-splitting schemes with centered and forward time-averaging is analyzed. The effect of the Asselin filter on solutions of the considered schemes is studied. It is assumed that questions arising in the analysis of the simplest model are inherent in the general model as well.

In order to raise the irrigation performance and to minimize the deep percolation and/or soil leaching for sustain utilization of soil and water, some combination of technical parameters was derived from intelligent optimization computing based on the valid mathematical model of border irrigation. An improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm was selected to optimize the irrigation technical parameters such as inlet discharge and cutoff time for combined high efficiency. Cased by studying on some testing borders in an irrigation district of Shanxi Province China, the multi-objective problem of technical parameters combination optimization for border irrigation was numerically solved. The results have verified the validity of mathematical model and the efficiency of optimization algorithm.

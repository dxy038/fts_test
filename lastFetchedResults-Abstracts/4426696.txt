This paper builds on the recently developed adaptive multi-Bernoulli filter, proposing a novel sensor control solution within the multi-object filtering scheme. Our sensor control method does not need any prior information on clutter and sensor field-of-view parameters. In addition, our control objective is based on the novel strategy of minimizing the uncertainties (quantified by variance) of the cardinality, and object state estimates as well as the estimated rate of clutter. In terms of computation, our method is efficient, as it does not need to perform Monte Carlo sampling in the space of measurement sets. This method is particular useful in space situational awareness applications such as detection and tracking of space junk, as currently, there is limited information on the distribution of traceable objects in the space and clutters, and our method can effectively handle such uncertainties.

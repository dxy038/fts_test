Objective
mine the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole treatment for acute bipolar depression.
s
week prospective, nonrandomized, open label study was conducted in depressed bipolar outpatients (types I, II, and NOS), as diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria. Previous treatments were continued unchanged, and new treatments not permitted, except lorazepam up to 2 mg daily. Aripiprazole was dosed flexibly up to a maximum of 30 mg daily, based on tolerability and efficacy. Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Mania Rating Scale (MRS) scores were used to assess changes in mood symptoms. Side effect outcomes were measured. Data was analyzed using last observation carried forward methodology and Analysis of Variance.
s
 patients (15 men, 5 women) with bipolar disorder (10 type I, 7 type II, 3 type NOS) enrolled in the study. Mean endpoint dose was 13.6 mg/d ± 10.0 mg/d. Thirteen (65%) patients completed 6 weeks of treatment. MADRS and MRS scores significantly improved during treatment. 44% of patients who completed at least one week of treatment were considered responders, based on ≥ 50% decrease in MADRS scores from baseline. Side effect measures were mostly unchanged during treatment.
sion
sive symptoms improved in bipolar patients treated with open-label aripiprazole.

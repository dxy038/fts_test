The distribution of power supply limiting in multi-zone is discussed by means of combining analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy sets theory. From the greatest factors in power limiting distribution, guide line system and hierarchy structure are established. Also, the relative membership degree functions are determined. A novel multi-objective group decision model is suggested by introducing a compromise coefficient between subjective weight and objective weight, which can give attention to both. The model is applied to peak load shifting distribution and the result manifests this model is reasonable and applicable.

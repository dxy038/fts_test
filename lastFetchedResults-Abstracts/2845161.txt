The use of mobile cloud computing infrastructure can be used to improve the delivery of health services. This paper proposes a high-level model that characterizes the behavior of an mHealth system. The main objective of this work is to identify the probability of a message being delivered at a time t, whereas several components involved may fail. Various scenarios were analysed considering different possibilities for communications, battery discharge rates and timeouts. The results show that, in the best case, a message may be delivered in 1.3 minutes with a 0.9999 probability, but in the worst case may take up to 8.8 minutes.

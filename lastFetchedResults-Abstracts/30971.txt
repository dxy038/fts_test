The perspective projections of n physical points on two views (stereovision) are constrained as soon as n>=8. However, to prove in practice the existence of a rigid motion between two images, more than 8 point matches are desirable in order to compensate for the limited accuracy of the matches. In this paper, we propose a computational definition of rigidity and a probabilistic criterion to rate the meaningfulness of a rigid set as a function of both the number of pairs of points (n) and the accuracy of the matches. This criterion yields an objective way to compare, say, precise matches of a few points and approximate matches of a lot of points. It gives a yes/no answer to the question: "could this rigid points correspondence have occurred by chance?", since it guarantees that the expected number of meaningful rigid sets found by chance in a random distribution of points is as small as desired.It also yields absolute accuracy requirements for rigidity detection in the case of non-matched points, and optimal values of n, depending on the expected accuracy of the matches and on the proportion of outliers. We use it to build an optimized random sampling algorithm that is able to detect a rigid motion and estimate the fundamental matrix when the set of point matches contains up to 90% of outliers, which outperforms the best currently known methods like M-estimators, LMedS, classical RANSAC and Tensor Voting.

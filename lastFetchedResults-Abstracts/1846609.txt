Eighty-nine cases after anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) reconstruction were followed prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients were examined using axial and sagittal MRI at least twice during the postoperative evaluation of reconstructed ACL. Two cases of pretibial cyst formation were observed. At the time of cyst formation, neither patient had any subjective or objective evidence of knee instability. The cyst of one case communicated with the intra-articular. The minimum follow-up period after the surgical excision was 9 months, with no evidence of recurrence. We might speculate that the critical period for cyst formation in both patients occurred at less than 12 months after their ACL reconstruction. We concluded that the cyst formation was most likely due to incomplete graft tendon incorporation within the osseous tunnel.

A state variable feedback controller combining large signal and current mode control is analyzed and detailed for a radar pulsed power supply for space applications. This controller, called the current control mode state feedback controller, combines sampling frequency and bidirectional current flow buck cell. The typical features of the current control modulator are maintained, as the principle is based on the prediction of the inductance peak current, but the conventional error signal amplifier is replaced by a linear electrical network generating from the power cell parameters an adequate command signal. A typical radar power supply delivering 40 W of pulsed power is presented; predicted time domain results are validated against breadboard performances.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

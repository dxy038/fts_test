A new controller for power system equipped with Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is proposed in the form of coordination between lead lag power system stabilizer (PSS) and modal optimal power oscillation damping (MO POD). MO is a combination of linear quadratic regulator and modal placement that is tuned with multi-objective time varying accelerating constant particle swarm optimization (TVAC PSO). The controller performance is tested with small signal disturbance to power system. A comparison with previous research, MO POD tuned with genetic algorithm is also conducted. Simulation result shows that proposed controller had the best response, with up to 65% reduction in overshoot and almost 30 times quicker settling time compared to system without POD. There are also 6% and 0.5s reduction in overshoot and settling time compared to previous research.

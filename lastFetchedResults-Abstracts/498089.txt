All persons had negative HEV and HAV IgM antibody Past history of hepatitis was negative in all persons. Demographic information had not significant related with anti hepatitis A and E virus antibody.

Conclusion: Enteric viral hepatitis and its complications threat the adult and military personnel. This study suggest that up than 97.7% of persons were immune to HAV but 98%) of them non immune to HEV, therefore at this time vaccination for hepatitis A virus wasn't require for adult in Iran. But Prevention of HEV infection is important for them and until effective vaccine was found, in time that they traveled to low sanitation areas should engage in practices and educated to avoiding drinking water of unknown purity.

High-performance applications are often developed for a specific class of target platforms and executing them on the increasing variety of Cloud and grid environments requires substantial adjustments and reconciliation. The aim of our framework, called ADAPT (Adaptive Application and Platform Translation), is to allow adaptation of applications for execution on various computational resources. The overall objective is to enhance usability of cyber-infrastructure platforms by providing automated adaptations of applications and conditioning of target environments so that greater cross-utilization is achieved. This paper presents a proof-of-concept experiment of a possible use of ADAPT, viz. executing a C/MPI application originally written for clusters on the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. This MPI application-to-cloud adjustment is based on automatic identification of the application programming paradigm followed by applying an application transformation to enable execution on an alternative target.

This paper presents an overview on available tools and methods for the simulation of electromagnetic transients in power systems. Both off-line and real-time simulation tools are presented and discussed. The first objective is to give the reader an overview on the modeling and simulation capabilities in currently available state-of-the-art tools. The second objective is to provide perspectives on research topics and needed enhancements.

Optimal values of the design parameters for a fin-tube heat exchanger of a household refrigerator under frosting conditions are proposed to improve its thermal performance and extend its operating time. In the optimization procedure, fin spacings of the heat exchanger are selected as the design parameters, and the average heat transfer rate, frost mass, and operating time are considered to be objective functions. The response surface and Taguchi methods are employed to optimize the design parameters. As a result, the average heat transfer rate and operating time of the optimum models increases by up to 6.3% and 12.9% compared to that of the reference model, respectively.

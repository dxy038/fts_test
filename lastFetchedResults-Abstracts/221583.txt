Gradient-based optical flow estimation methods typically
do not take into account errors in the spatial derivative estimates.
The presence of these errors causes an errors-in-variables
(EIV) problem. Moreover, the use of finite difference methods to
calculate these derivatives ensures that the errors are strongly correlated
between pixels. Total least squares (TLS) has often been
used to address this EIV problem. However, its application in this
context is flawed as TLS implicitly assumes that the errors between
neighborhood pixels are independent. In this paper, a new optical
flow estimation method (EIVM) is formulated to properly treat the
EIV problem in optical flow. EIVM is based on Sprent’s procedure
which allows the incorporation of a general EIV model in the estimation
process.
In EIVM, the neighborhood size acts as a smoothing parameter.
Due to the weights in the EIVM objective function, the effect of
changing the neighborhood size is more complex than in other local
model methods such as Lucas and Kanade (LK). These weights,
which are functions of the flow estimate, can alter the effective size
and orientation of the neighborhood. In this paper, we also present
a data-driven method for choosing the neighborhood size based on
Stein’s unbiased risk estimators (SURE).

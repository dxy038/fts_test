The objective of this work is twofold: the acquisition of symbolic rules in a geological domain and the representation in graphical form of the behavior of the different geological labels. We are particularly interested in a rule-based description of permeability (an important attribute in petroleum geology) that only uses porosity and spatial information. More precisely, a model of petrophysical properties is obtained using a hybrid discretization method to obtain permeability levels and the C4.5 method to obtain a rule-based representation. This model is simple and reasonably accurate and allows representation in graphical form.

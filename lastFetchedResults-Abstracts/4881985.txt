The primary objective of this paper is to apply the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) algorithm with an adaptive re-initialization procedure to passively tracking a single maneuvering acoustic source (SMAS) in a cluttered environment and to compare the results to those of the interactive multiple model (IMM) approach. The MHT algorithm establishes an acoustic source track in the measurement space through a combined track detection and track formation procedure. Subsequently target motion analysis (TMA) is applied to localize the target. Our simulation results indicated that this algorithm has an improved performance over the IMM algorithm at low signal to noise ratio (SNR)

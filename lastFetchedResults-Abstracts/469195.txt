Objective
The study analyzed morbidity and mortality rates among octogenarian and nonagenarian patients who underwent operations for gynecologic indications.
Study design
A retrospective chart review was performed for patients, aged ≥80 years, who underwent gynecologic procedures between January 1, 1995, and September 30, 2000. Information obtained included a complete medical history, type of surgical procedure, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition. Simple demographic statistics were used.
Results
Sixty-two patients (mean age, 83.6 years) were identified. Seventy-seven operative procedures, 49 major and 28 minor, were performed. All patients were discharged home, except 2, who were discharged to nursing homes. Sixteen patients, who underwent minor procedures, were discharged the same day, and 6 patients were admitted for “23” hour stays. There were 11 perioperative complications and no perioperative deaths.
Conclusion
Successful gynecologic surgical outcomes with minimal morbidity are achievable in octogenarian patients and nonagenarian patients with optimization of co-medical conditions and careful perioperative treatment. Age should not be the sole determinant in the decision-making process.

This paper studies the Parlay gateway traffic overload control problems in electric power communication networks. A traffic overload control algorithm with energy efficiency is proposed to solve it. Firstly, the fairness and effectiveness of the Parlay gateway is analyzed. Then we can establish the constraints about fairness and effectiveness. The electric power communication network energy efficiency is taken as the optimal objective function. The multi-constraint energy-efficient traffic overload control model about the Parlay gateway is successfully built. Finally, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model. By the iterative process, an optimal solution to this model can be attained. Simulation results show that our algorithm is feasible and promising.

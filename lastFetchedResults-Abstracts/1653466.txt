Introduction: The ability to set and manage faculty members’ emotions in classrooms is an important and determinant factor in successful and effective teaching. The main objective of this study was to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence and effectiveness of teaching and implementation of effective teaching components by faculty members of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.
Methods: This descriptive study was conducted on 393 faculty members of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences who were teaching in 2012-2013 academic years. A sample of 191 faculty members was selected according to krejcie and Morgan’s sample size table. Research tools were a research-made effective teaching questionnaire and Bar-Ann emotional intelligence questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson Correlation and Regression analysis.
Results: The findings showed a significant relationship between faculty members’ emotional intelligence and their effective teaching (p <  0.05). Their emotional intelligence was able to predict the effective teaching with a significant coefficient (B=0.78, p < 0.0005). There was a significant correlation between faculty members’ emotional intelligence and implementation of all the components of effective teaching (teaching design, education, classroom management, human relations, assessment, and desired personality traits) (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results indicated that by controlling variables such as age, gender, and education of faculty members, emotional intelligence can strongly predict the effectiveness of their teaching. In other words, faculty members` high emotional intelligence could be a determining factor for their effective teaching.

There are increasing demands for ultralow bit-rate video image transmission. We present a new formulation of moving object segmentation and motion estimation to quantify the potential gain in using object-oriented motion compensation in image sequence coding. Motivated by real-valued parameter estimation required in object-oriented motion-compensated video source coding, a framework motivated by RissanenÂ´s (1983) minimum description length (MDL) principle is proposed to more tightly couple motion estimation and object segmentation algorithms to the overall objective of minimizing source bit rate. A new objective function is constructed, and a suboptimal procedure to segment and estimate moving objects in a scene is proposed. Each object is represented by chain-coded block boundaries, affine motion parameters, and motion-compensated prediction error. A number of experimental comparisons between block- and object-oriented coding schemes suggests a significant potential coding gain using object-oriented motion-compensated coding

This paper deals with the measurement of the image quality of compressed video signals. Studies of the influence of spatial and temporal masking effects are presented. Algorithms for the analysis of both types of masking are proposed and applied to an objective quality measurement. The algorithms are designed in a way that allows the implementation in a single-ended manner. In conclusion an extension of the PSNR - which can be estimated from the coded data stream - is proposed.

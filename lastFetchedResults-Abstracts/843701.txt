In this paper, we present an adaptive high order differential feedback controller (HODFC) which is a kind of model-free control diagram. The proposed HODFC achieves the objective that the system output and its high differentials approximate the given reference input and its high order differentials, respectively. Stability, convergence, and robustness of the closed-loop system are also studied. Moreover, a kind of linearized decoupling control is obtained for MIMO system by a multivariable HODFC.

The objective of this letter is to analyze the effects of frequency mismatch for an adaptive algorithm that becomes the Filtered-X LMS algorithm when the reference signals are purely sinusoidal. The Filtered-X LMS algorithm is often used for active control of acoustic noise. For the case of sinusoidal noise sources, if there is a deviation between the frequency used in the adaptive algorithm and its true value (frequency mismatch), the performance of the Filtered-X LMS algorithm might degrade considerably. In this letter, using the equivalent transfer function method, the effects of frequency mismatch are analyzed precisely. Finally, computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the obtained results

We propose a new associative memory, named combined multi-winner associative memory (CMWAM), and study the bidirectional association properties. Unlike many conventional bidirectional associative memories, the proposed CMWAM can store and recall information hierarchically. The proposed CMWAM has the following features: 1) it can store analog information; 2) it can associate an episode from another episode; and 3) it is robust against noisy or partial information and it is robust against internal damage

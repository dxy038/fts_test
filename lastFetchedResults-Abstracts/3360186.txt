In this paper, the reconstruction of perfectly electric conductor (PEC) scatterers with transverse electric (TE) wave illumination is investigated using the continuous-type subspace-based optimization method (SOM). The PEC scatterers can be of arbitrary locations, shapes and quantities and no prior information about the scatterers is required in the reconstructions. Compared with the transverse magnetic (TM) counterpart, the TE case is not only mathematically more complex, but also numerically more demanding in the sense that the triangular basis is used to represent induced electric current. Moreover, under better mesh strategy and more strict objective function, numerical simulations for arbitrary PEC scatterers generate satisfactory results and are well robust against noise. The algorithm is also examined under the experimental scattering data and still obtains good reconstruction results.

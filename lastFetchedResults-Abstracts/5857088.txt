The objective of the paper is to develop multilevel multisensor based decision fusion principles for an intelligent animal robot. The paper presents the design and implementation of a four-legged animal robot. The animal robotÂ´s head, body, and legs were constructed using aluminum material. The control/decision unit, driver unit and sensory unit were designed for the control of the animal robot. In addition, we use hierarchically organized control hardware and multilevel multisensor based fusion techniques to obtain a fused decision. Weight function and rule based algorithms are employed to fuse and integrate multisensor data. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can effectively fuse decisions for the animal robot.

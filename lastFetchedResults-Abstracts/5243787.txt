The global objective of this paper is to propose models and functional architectures respectively forming the repository of conceptual model and the functional architecture for learning management system produced by the two-phase generating process of LMSGENERATOR, a software factory for business components and platforms for distance learning. This work focuses on the business repository used as a starting point by the generation process of LMSGENERATOR. It is therefore a re-engineering process of learning management systems functional requirements to produce an extensible business model repository whose components are reusable, adaptable, flexible, integrating the various and global phases of the Open distance learning (ODL) and representing a criteria of adaptability to different user categories. Generic models with adaptability criteria are delivered to compose the LMS business repository. Each element of this repository (business model) is composed by three sub-models: data model, semantic model and visual model. These sub models are part of a transformation process that respected the art of model-driven engineering to produce a component model independently of the developmental technology. The generation process of component models, business components and the building process of complete solutions are represented to show the importance of this business repository in the LMSGENERATOR process.

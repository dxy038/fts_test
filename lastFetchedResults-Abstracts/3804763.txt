In this letter we re-examine flow control issues for a network environment where transmission links and CPUs on a data path can be jointly bottlenecked. We show that flow control without consideration of CPU congestion can significantly lose both fairness and efficiency in this environment. As a solution to this problem, we establish the notion of dual-resource proportional fairness, propose a distributed algorithm to achieve this objective and demonstrate its performance through simulations.

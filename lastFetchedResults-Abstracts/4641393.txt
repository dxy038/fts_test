Remote laboratories are typically used for having remote access to physical laboratory facilities. In the setup presented in this paper that has not been the main objective, the remote laboratory presented here is used mainly for the following two purposes: First, to create a controlled environment where unwanted side activities like hardware setup, driver problems, troubleshooting faulty components, and struggles with special software for configuring DSP systems, are removed as much as possible, in order for the students to have their full focus on the tasks that relevant in the module: modeling of non-linear systems, synthetisation of controllers, and stability and performance analysis. Second, to significantly reduce the setup and maintenance cost associated with complex laboratory setups involving DSPs and expensive hardware.

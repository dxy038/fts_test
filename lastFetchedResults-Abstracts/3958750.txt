A consolidation of existing as well as new configurations of voltage source power converters (VSCs) using gate turn-offs (GTOs) or a combination of GTOs and thyristors is considered. These VSCs are single-phase AC-DC current-controlled boost-type power converters with bidirectional power-handling capability. Both two-level and three-level power converters are presented along with a definitive classification. Experimental results are provided on a selective basis, confirming a 360&#176; power angle range of the power converters

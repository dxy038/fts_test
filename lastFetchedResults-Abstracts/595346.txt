Objective: To compare the post operative complications in appendisectomized patients with and without burial of stump following appendicectomy in patients with clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Material and Methods: This comparative study was conducted from 27th October 2006 to 5th June 2007. One hundred cases who underwent appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis were divided into two groups. In group 1 simple ligation and in group 2 burial of the appendiceal stump following appendicectomy was done. Each group consisted of 50 cases. Post-operative follow-up was done for two months for any complication in all cases. Results: The mean age was 24.2+8.031 years in group 1 and 23.7+8.672 years in group 2. In this study wound infection was 6% in patients undergoing burial of stump following appendicectomy and 4% in simple ligation (p> 0.05). Mean hospital stay was 2.42 days in those with stump burial following appendicectomy while in simple ligation it was 2.06 days (p > 0.05). There was one case of paralytic ileus in Group 2 (2%) while in group 1 there was none (p > 0.05). In group 2, 30% of patients suffered from fever while in simple ligation it was 20% (p value > 0.05). Extra time was spent on burial of stump following appendicectomy with mean 3.6 minutes. Conclusion: Simple ligation of the stump is easy and less time consuming. There is no significant difference in frequency of wound infection and shorter hospital stay in simple ligation and ligation and burial of stump after appendicectomy.

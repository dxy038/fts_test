The paper constructs simulation model of double-SVPWM(SVPWM(space vector pulse width modulation) rectifier-SVPWM inverter) based AC-DC-AC bidirectional converter excited VSCF-DFG (variable speed constant frequency-doubly fed generator) system with stator-field orientation vector control on basis of MATLAB/SEVIULINK, then carries out the simulation research of regulating properties of stator output active power in three generation modes of sub, super, and cross synchronous speed and stator output reactive power, lastly compares double-SVPWM with double-SPWM(S(sinusoidal)PWM rectifler-SPWM inverter). The simulation results show that using double-SVPWM based AC-DC-AC bidirectional converter as AC-excitation power not only has good performance of bidirectional power flow, but also has higher coefficient of DC voltage utilization and lower THD(total harmonic distortion factor) of exciting voltage(or exciting current), which better satisfy the excitation control requirement of the system. The work of this paper will be helpful to the application research of excitation control technique in VSCF-DFG system.

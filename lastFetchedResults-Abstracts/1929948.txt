The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in the wild has been in decline for several decades and breeding in captivity has not been self-sustaining. The use of artificial insemination (AI) can help overcome many of the difficulties associated with breeding elephants in captivity; however, the ability to store semen for extended periods of time is critical to the successful application of AI to elephants. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of four different semen extenders and the presence of egg yolk on the viability and motility of Asian elephant semen stored at 4 °C. High quality ejaculates (n=4) were collected from two Asian elephant bulls by rectal massage. Aliquots of each ejaculate were extended in four different diluents (Beltsville thawing solution (BTS); Tris–citric acid (TCA)/fructose-based; Beltsville F5 (BF5); dextrose-supplemented phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) with or without egg yolk then cooled and stored at 4 °C. The percentages of viable (viability) and motile (motility) sperm were evaluated at 8, 24 and 48 h following collection. The addition of egg yolk significantly reduced the percentage loss in viability from initial collection to 48 h compared to extenders without egg yolk (17.0±8.2 versus 32.6±8.9 decline in percent viable sperm in the population, respectively; P&lt;0.05). Extender and egg yolk affected (P&lt;0.005) total motility and percent progressively motile sperm at all evaluation times during incubation. TCA + egg yolk maintained higher (P&lt;0.05) levels of progressive motility compared to other extenders supplemented with egg yolk. These results indicate that Asian elephant semen extended in TCA diluent supplemented with egg yolk can maintain at least 50% viability and motility when stored at 4 °C for 48 h.

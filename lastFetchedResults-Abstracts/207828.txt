Objective: The medieinal properties attributed to Crocus sativus L. (saffron) are extensive, but saffron taken in large
amounts is highly toxic, This study was performed to elueidate the possible toxic effects of total extract of Crocus
sativus L. stigma on liver, kidney and some hematological parameters in normal rats, Methods: Male Wistar rats
were randomly assigned into four groups of eight animals each, Group I was treated with ISS as control and Groups
2 to 4 were treated with total saffron extract administered daily for 2 weeks intraperitoneally in doses of 035, 0.70
and L05 g/kg, respectively. Body weight of the animals were recorded on the first, 7 and 14 of the experiment
Hematological and biochemical parameters were measured on final days of the experiment. Tissue specimens of the
liver and kidneys were subjected to histological examination using standard hematoxyline-eosin staining, Results:
Total saffron extract caused significant reductions in the Hb and HCT levels and total RBC count, although it
showed no dose-dependent effect. Total WBC count showed significant dose-dependent increases in extract treated
rats. The extract treated animals, also, exhibited significant dose-dependent increased values of AST, ALT, urea,
uric acid and creatinine, In the histopathological studies of liver and kidneys in extract treated rats, there were mild
to severe tissue injuries supporting the biochemical analysis, Ceneluslen: The results of this study indicated that total
extract of Crocus sativus L. stigma is toxic (in given doses), and causes hepatic and renal tissue damages along with
anemia in rats,

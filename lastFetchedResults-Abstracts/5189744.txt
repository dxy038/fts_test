Web services composition has become a main measure to create and streamline B2B collaborations within and across organizational boundaries. This paper focuses on the web servi- ces composition and provides a novel selection algorithm based on global QoS optimizing and Chaos Particle Swarm Optimiza- tion(CPSM). Firstly, the web services selection model with QoS global optimization is converted into a multi-objective optimiza- tion problem. Furthermore, the CPSM is used to select the service and optimize QoS to satisfy the user constraints. During the optimizing procedure, the random and ergodic chaos variable is used to make an optimal search. The simulation shows that the CPSM algorithm is feasible and efficient.

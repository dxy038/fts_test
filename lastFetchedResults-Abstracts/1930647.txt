The objective of this experiment was to determine if the proportion of first-calf suckled beef cows that resumed ovulatory cycles and the interval to resumption of ovarian cycling activity differ after exposure to either “unfamiliar” bulls or cows on d 35 postpartum, after exposure to either “familiar” bulls or cows for the first 30–32 d after calving. Fifty Angus × Hereford cows were stratified by calving date, calf BW, and calf sex by d 3 postpartum, and assigned to be exposed to familiar epididectomized bulls (BEF; n = 25) or familiar mature ovariectomized (OVX) cows (CEF; n = 25). On d 35 after calving, 12 BEF cows were assigned to be exposed to unfamiliar bulls (BEU); likewise, 12 CEF cows were assigned to be exposed to unfamiliar OVX cows (CEU). Cows were in their treatments for either 95 d (BEF and CEF) or 60 d (BEU and CEU) during the experiment. Blood samples were collected every third d from the beginning to the end of the experiment. A rise in progesterone concentration of &gt;0.5 ng/mL in consecutive samples was used as the criterion for resumption of ovulatory cycles. Exposing cows to bulls on d 5 after calving and then switching a subset of these cows to be exposed to unfamiliar bulls 30–32 d later did not (P &gt; 0.10) alter: (1) the proportion of cows that resumed cycling activity; and (2) postpartum interval to resumption of ovarian cycling activity compared to cows exposed to familiar bulls. However, 32% more (P &lt; 0.05) cows exposed to bulls (BEF and BEU) resumed cycling activity by approximately 14.8 d before cows that were exposed to OVX cows (CEF and CEU). We conclude that the familiarity of first-calf cows to either bulls or ovariectomized cows, did not affect the postpartum occurrence of cycling activity or the interval from calving to resumption of ovulatory cycles. However, bull exposure, whether familiar or unfamiliar, stimulates first-calf cows to resume ovulatory cycles sooner after calving than if they are not exposed to bulls.

In this paper, we propose an efficient intra coding method. The method involves adding an extra/inter-polating prediction method to the conventional H.264/MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) intra prediction method. The proposal consists of two parts. One is to change the sub-block coding order in macroblock (MB). The bottom-right sub-block in MB is predicted using the reference pels on the upper and left side of the sub-block firstly. After that, the other sub-blocks are predicted using not only the reference pels on the upper and/or left side but also ones on the bottom and/or right side of each sub-block. The other part is to use an intra bidirectional prediction method which can use the interpolation of the prediction from upper/left pels and the prediction from bottom/right pels. Experimental results show that our method improves bit reduction by up to 7.7% at the same PSNR compared to H.264.

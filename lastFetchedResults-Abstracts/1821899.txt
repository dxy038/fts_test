Objective
m of this study was to determine the salivary levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and cortisol and scores of depression, anxiety and stress in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP).
design
-one patients with a diagnosis of OLP were selected; they were matched by sex and age with 31 control patients. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were investigated by the instruments Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Lipp's Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults, respectively. Saliva was collected in the morning and at night for the determination of DHEA and cortisol levels by radioimmunoassay.
s
was no significant difference between the groups with respect to depression (P = 0.832), anxiety (P = 0.061) or stress (P = 0.611), or with respect to morning and night salivary levels of DHEA (P = 0.888, P = 0.297) and cortisol (P = 0.443, P = 0.983).
sions
sults suggest an association of OLP with anxiety. However, DHEA and cortisol levels did not differ between groups, which does not support any neuroendocrine aetiology for OLP.

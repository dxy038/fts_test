In this paper, the auxiliary switch control using a lookup table is proposed to enhance the efficiency of the bidirectional dc/dc converter used in electric vehicle, which performs soft switching. Continuous current data are difficult to obtain during a resonant operation due to the limit of DSP ADC capacity. The proposed auxiliary switch control has a lookup table reference of the auxiliary switch turn-on time. The control method properly controls the auxiliary switch turn-on time according to the required load current; this auxiliary switch control brings the more efficient control in generative and regenerative mode operation. The proposed approach has been validated by the results of experiments on a bidirectional dc/dc converter, inverter, and interior permanent magnet synchronous motor.

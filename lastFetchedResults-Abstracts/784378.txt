Background: Nutrition plays an important role throughout the life span. It is the interaction of nutrition
and health that form part of the aging process. Nutrition affects the maintenance of physiological and biological
process of aging, also, the risk of development of acute and chronic diseases. Objective: To examine dietaryrelated
behaviors and lifestyle factors among non-institutionalized older persons in a local Chinese community.
Design, setting & participants: It was a cross-sectional qualitative descriptive design. A convenience sample of
36 older persons (mean±SD age, 75±7.8 years) in a community center were approached and invited to complete a
questionnaire regarding their dietary-related profile and the self-perceived nutritional and health status. Results:
Results showed that 40% (n=14) of the older persons lived alone and ate alone on a regular basis, taking few fruit
and vegetables per day, inadequate fluid and no dairy or bean curd products, and 48% (n=17) were overweight or
obese. The self-perceived nutritional status correlated directly with perceived health status, which was high.
Clinical relevance: The clinical relevance of this study is highlighted by the far from optimal dietary behaviors
among this group of older persons. Nurses and health care providers working in the community should provide
education on healthy diet and nutrition-related health problems, especially to older persons, for health
maintenance and disease prevention

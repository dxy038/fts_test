Patients suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI) might paralytic for all lifetime. But there are no effective medical treatments for SCI presently. Here we show that the spinal cord quantum bridge (SCQB), which is a kind of bidirectional repeater, can connect two breakpoint of spinal cord. In order to reconstruct the patientÂ´s limb function, the recovery strategy of damaged nerve signal transmission channel is proposed in this paper. The strategy combines quantum mechanical with neurophysiology from the perspective of rebuilding nerve signal transmission channel. SCQB can connect one breakpoint of spinal cord injury with another breakpoint to achieve bidirectional relay transmission of nerve signals. Based on distribution of quantum entanglement, quantum states of damaged neurons which employed quantum entanglement teleportation can be passed from the upper breakpoint of spinal cord injury to the lower breakpoint to realize reconnection of nerve signals. The strategy may mean a new treatment for spinal cord injury.

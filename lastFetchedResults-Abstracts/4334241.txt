This paper considers a general approach for the computation of all functional characteristics of a probabilistic wireless channel model using a bidirectional parametric description. It is shown that under mild conditions the WSSUS property is valid for these models and explicit relations are derived for the computation of the time-frequency autocorrelation from which one can easily derive the Doppler and delay power spectra. As an illustrative example, we consider the single ring of scatterers channel model. We also briefly mention how all these concepts can be generalized to the MIMO case.

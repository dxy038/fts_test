Objective:
Endometrial cancer can be divided into atrophy-associated and hyperplasia-associated subtypes. It has been suggested that these subtypes have different pathologic features and prognoses. This preliminary study explores whether these subtypes are associated with different risk factors.
Study Design:
Hysterectomies performed in cases of endometrial carcinoma with evaluable benign endometrium on routine processing were reviewed, and clinical data were abstracted from medical records. Forty-eight subjects with atrophy-associated and 28 subjects with hyperplasia-associated cancers were studied.
Results:
We found younger age, higher weight, absence of cigarette smoking, and earlier menarche in subjects with hyperplasia-related cancers.
Conclusions:
Our findings support the idea that hyperplasia-associated endometrial cancer is estrogen-related but also suggest that atrophy-associated cases may result from a different causal pathway. Epidemiologic studies may yield more precise and accurate measures of association if atrophy-associated and hyperplasia-associated endometrial cancers are considered separately.

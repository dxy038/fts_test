Parotid surgery can cause postoperative facial nerve dysfunction, cosmetic impairment, and Frey’s syndrome. Thirty-six patients listed for superficial parotidectomy were entered into a prospective randomised trial to find out if the use of a sternocleidomastoid flap could reduce the incidence of these complications. Partial facial nerve paresis was seen at 3 months in five patients in whom flaps were raised compared with six among those who did not have flaps (P=0.025). There was no difference between the two groups at 1 year. The flap was not associated with an improvement in either subjective (P=0.13) or objective (P=0.12) appearance measured on visual analogue scales. Eight patients in whom flaps were raised described symptoms suggestive of Frey’s syndrome, compared with nine patients in whom a flap was not raised (P=0.31). Overall 19 of those who had a flap and 11 of those who did not had a positive starch-iodine test (P=0.21).

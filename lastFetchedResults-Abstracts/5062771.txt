A method, based on the fuzzy programming theory, was outlined to estimate the regional single-mode highway freight origin-destination matrix. Due to the problem nature, data from multi-source were used instead of a large-scale field OD survey. A bi-objective non-linear programming model was presented, taking account of the intermodal OD issue. Fuzzy mathematics was applied to solve the uncertainty problem both in objective functions and constraint conditions. A case study was completed to prove that the multi-data estimation method is more precise than the conventional method only based on link volumes. Besides, the calculation methods for the prior OD table and the highway-railway intermodal OD values were also discussed in the case study.

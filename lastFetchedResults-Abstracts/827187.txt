Delamination is the most common failure modes in composite structures. Delamination
on a flat composite structure under compressive in-plane loads can be causes local buckling on the
delamination area, reduced stiffness and early failure. In this paper, buckling analysis of laminates
with an embedded delamination has been studied by employing a finite element analysis. The
modeling and calculations was done using FEM commercial software ANSYS. Also the effect of
increasing the area of the delamination and the effect of fiber angle on the buckling load is
investigated. Composite laminates with embedded circular delamination are studied that under
compressive unidirectional and bidirectional plane loading are located. The results show that
increasing the area of the delamination, buckling load of structural is reduced and buckling mode is
changed. Specimen under unidirectional compressive loading, maximum buckling load is related to
stacking sequence [±75]s . Buckling behavior of structures under tensile-compressive loads is entirely
different and maximum buckling load is related to stacking sequence[±45]s.

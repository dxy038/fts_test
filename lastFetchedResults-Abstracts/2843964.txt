This work studies security-oriented cooperation schemes, addressing three possible cooperation scenarios, namely the jammer only, relay only and the relay-jammer pair. The cooperation scheme is adaptively selected according to the security requirement and networkÂ´s operational conditions. The selection of a relay or/and a jammer as well as their transmit power are jointly optimized with the objective of attaining a good trade-off between security performance and energy consumption.

This paper presents a new possible topology which improves power quality. Real and Reactive Power (PQ) theory in Pulse Width Modulation Voltage Source Inverter (PWM-VSI) to be connected in AC load, which compensates harmonics and reactive power in the ac grid. The objective of this paper is to show that with an adequate control, the converter can not only transfer the AC from wind energy system, but also can improve the power quality of electrical system. The two-level and three-level configuration are mainly considered here, since both of the two configurations have been widely used in the wind energy system. In this improved full-bridge three-level (IFBTL) dc/dc converter is used.

We present a multi-objective optimization approach for joint throughput optimization and traffic engineering, where the routing request of traffic arrives one-by-one. We provide an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that simultaneously i) maximizes the aggregate throughput, ii) minimizes the resource consumption, and iii) minimizes the maximum link utilization. We study the impact of optimizing the three different objectives simultaneously in dynamic environments, and show that better solutions than those of mono-objective approaches can be obtained. Because of the complexity of the ILP, we also propose another ILP with reduced complexity, and study its performance and the optimality gap between it and optimal solutions.

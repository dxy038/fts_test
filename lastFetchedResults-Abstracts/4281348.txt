The main contribution of this paper was to propose a dynamic and objective model of E-business website quality management. The key quality factors, quality characters and sub-characters from the userÂ´s perspective were discussed firstly, they formed the inherent causality relationship. The theoretical background of Bayesian Network was presented briefly. Applying the Bayesian Network, the E-business website quality management model was shaped. The Overall quality was presented as the central node, and it was followed by five quality factors: Tongibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assureance and Empathy. Every quality factors followed by several quality characters. Each quality character node was connected to a number of sub-characters, while the sub-characters as the root nodes. The presented model can be utilized in two ways. The forward reasoning applied on the Bayesian Network could evaluate the E-business website quality, and it also can be used by the designer to aiding in quality assurance during the website development. The backward reasoning could be utilized on quality diagnosis, quality improvement and allocation of resource. Several examples were illustrated in this paper, and the advantages and disadvantages were discussed in the end.

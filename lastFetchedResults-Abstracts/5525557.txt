In this paper, a new multi-objective planning framework, namely Non-dominated Sorting Improved Harmony Search (NSIHS), is presented, which is able to evaluate the impact of FACTS placement for an enhancement of voltage stability. It is based on the Improved HS algorithm which has been extended to the multi-objective optimization problem by non-dominated sorting and ranking with crowding distance strategy. Simulations are performed on IEEE 14 test system with FACTS controllers modeled for steady state studies. The approach is compared with Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method. From the simulation results, it is clear that the proposed method is able to give better distributed Pareto-optimal solution than MOPSO method. It can then be a robust tool towards multi-objective optimization in power system management and planning.

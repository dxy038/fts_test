The objective of this paper is to show that, even if much work remains to make, many solutions are usable in order to introduce relatively complex motorization techniques in the world of electric household appliances which is extremely constraining in term of costs. One of the main motivations for this work is the research of very high performances levels (weight, size, efficiency...) keeping in mind the aim of controlling the EMC or electrical disturbances generated by the system. The support application for this article is the drive of a vacuum cleaner turbine. The objective is to highlight various solutions of motorization and feeding, keeping in mind the economic viability of the structure. The accent will be kept on the integration of the engine and its electronics to the turbine function.

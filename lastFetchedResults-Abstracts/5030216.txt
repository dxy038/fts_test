This paper introduces a core migration protocol that provides QoS for multicast applications in mobile ad hoc networks. Multicasting is usually accomplished by constructing a multicast tree and transmitting the packets over this tree, replicating packets at the branch points. In a group shared multicast tree, the choice of the root (core) plays an important role in influencing the organization of the tree and affecting the performance of packet delivery. The objective is to construct a tree whose leaves achieve the desired qualities of the multicast application. Our proposal differs from previous work on core selection and migration which typically rely on complete knowledge of network topology and also almost complete network participation for providing this information

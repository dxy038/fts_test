Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has emerged as a promising technique for improving capacity and reducing power consumption in wireless networks. Most existing works on D2D communications either targeted CDMA-based single-channel networks or aimed to maximize network throughput. In this paper, we, however, aim at enabling green D2D communications in OFDMA-based wireless networks. We formally define an optimization problem based on a practical link data rate model, whose objective is to minimize power consumption while meeting user data rate requirements. We then present an effective algorithm to solve it in polynomial time, which jointly determines mode selection, channel allocation and power assignment. It has been shown by extensive simulation results that the proposed algorithm can achieve over 57% power savings, compared to several baseline methods.

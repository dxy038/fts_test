The new Internet terminals are at the same time mobile and multihomed since they are able to change their point of attachment to the network, and embed several network interfaces. Each one can be attached to a different network. Multihoming and mobility are generally considered as two separate concepts and thus are handled by different protocols. Nontheless, mobility and multihoming share the same objective: preserving the running sessions after changes in the set of the available addresses. For mobility these changes are due to movement; whereas, for multihoming, changes are due to outages or ISP renumbering. While mobility and multihoming have different surveillance and incentives, they both propose a mechanism for session survivability and its seems interesting to study how to merge them into a single protocol framework. In this paper we investigate and compare different the multihoming and mobility unification strategies.

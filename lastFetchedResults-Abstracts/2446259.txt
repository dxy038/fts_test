The EU Breeding Blanket Programme aims the testing of two blankets concept in ITER in form of Test Blanket Modules. In the equatorial port #16 the two EU TBMs – a solid and a liquid blanket concept – will be exposed to the plasma and the complex system of their auxiliary systems dedicated to heat and Tritium removal will be integrated in the surrounding ITER buildings. The development of the conceptual design of the EU TBM System is the main objective of the Grant F4E-2008-GRT-09 contract launched by F4E and assigned to a European Consortium. This paper presents an overview of the results after about 20 months of activities: namely, the design of the main sub-systems of the EU TBSs and a concept of integration in ITER.

Presents a heuristic algorithm to determine a cyclic schedule with optimal cycle time while minimizing the work in process (WIP). The respect of the optimal cycle time is a hard constraint during the computation of the schedule, while the minimization of the WIP is considered as an objective. The algorithm builds the schedule progressively and its complexity allows the use under real-time constraints

This paper proposed a Mixed-Voltage Bidirectional (MVB) I/O IP core for an automotive Body Control Module (BCM) SoC. It is based on a conventional bidirectional I/O circuit, four configuration signals with a constraints module, and level shifters to transform 1.8V core logic to 3.3V or 5V external logic are added. Data level shifter and input Schmitt trigger are modified to achieve low power strategy. With that strategy, this I/O could avoid any unnecessary power consumptions. This circuit will be fabricated under the TSMC automotive qualified 0.18&#956;m technology.

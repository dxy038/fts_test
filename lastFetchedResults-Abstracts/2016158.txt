Oil production optimization is one of the main targets of reservoir management. Smart well technology gives the ability of real time oil production optimization. Although this technology has many advantages; optimum adjustment or sizing of corresponding valves is still an issue to be solved. In this research, optimum port sizing of inflow control devices (ICDs) which are passive control valves is focused on by designing a neural network to simulate reservoir behavior and applying Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to find optimum port size for ICDs. Indeed; this work eliminates the need for lots of expensive and time consuming iterations through reservoir simulator. The objective of the work is to maximize the oil production.

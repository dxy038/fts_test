Salt accumulation in arid and semiarid areas of the world is one of the most common abiotic stresses that can have a wide range of effects on crop yield. The objective of this research was evaluation of the effect of fluorescent pseudomonads containing ACC-deaminase on nutrient uptake and growth of canola (Brassica napus L.) in saline condition. The experiment was conducted in factorial arrangement with completely randomized design with four replications. The experimental variables were: water salinity at four EC levels of 0.335 (control), 5, 10, and 15 dS/m (natural saline water) and five levels of bacterial inoculants including Pseudomonas putida strain P.p. 169, P.p.196 and Pseudomonas fluorescens strain P.f. 108, P.f. 11  and  a non-inoculated control. The results showed that inoculation with the selected strain was effective at alleviating salinity stress during different growth stages of canola. By increasing the salinity, uptake of K and Ca decreased, while uptake of Na and Cl increased. At salinity levels, inoculation with the selective strain, decreased the effects of salt stress, hence, inoculation of canola seeds with fluorescent pseudomonads strain may alleviate the stress effects of salinity on canola growth and nutrient uptake.

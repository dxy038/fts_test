Recent advances in electro-optical sensors, environmental characterization algorithms and nearshore circulation models will soon allow near-real-time, high-resolution characterization of littoral regions using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The fundamental objective of a new program at the Naval Research Laboratory is to develop a UAV-based system that couples remotely acquired imagery with advanced data analysis and state-of-the-art numerical models to provide a nowcast of littoral environmental conditions. The conceptual use of this system includes the estimation of waves, currents, and bathymetry to support expeditionary warfare operations particularly with respect to very shallow water and surf zone regions. The system is envisioned to operate organically in that no external sources of information are required. The framework of this system is described and the issues pertaining to operational deployment are discussed.

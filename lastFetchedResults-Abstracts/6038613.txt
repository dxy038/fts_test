We provide a solution to the reliable robust preview tracking problems against actuator faults for discrete LTI systems with polytopic uncertainties in terms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities. This method is based on multi-objective optimization and LQ tracking performance indices. To achieve uncommon LMI solutions in normal and fault cases so as to reduce the conservativeness, two iterative algorithms are proposed and compared. A numerical example is used to show the usefulness of the methods

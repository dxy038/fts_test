The Objective-Based Industrial Electrical Code (OBIEC) along with the companion document Objective-Based Industrial Electrical Code - Safety Management System Requirements (SMS) were introduced in January 2009. These documents are intended to allow users to build facilities based on safety objectives versus prescriptive electrical codes such as the CEC and NEC. This paper will discuss what the OBIEC means to industry and provide an update on acceptance. The paper will discuss how the OBIEC compares to ATEX 95 Products Directive 94/9/EC and ATEX 137 Worker Protection Directive 1999/92/EC and what enhancements each system can offer the other. It will present the view of the Regulator, the perspective of the Designer and the experience of a Manufacturer.

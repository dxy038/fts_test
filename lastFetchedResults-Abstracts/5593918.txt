By researching on maintenance schedule optimization of power supply system under electricity market environment, a mathematical model based on multi-constraint and multi-objective are put forward in this artical, as well as the intelligent algorithm. The model takes into account grid security constraints, coordination constraints and resource constraints. Maintenance economy versus power system reliability are considered while evaluating advantages of maintenance optimization. A case is showed to demonstrate that the model and the algorithm can not only optimize maintenance resources arrangement but also raise grid reliability during overhaul.

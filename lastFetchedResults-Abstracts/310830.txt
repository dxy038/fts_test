Objective. To review the literature that evaluates the influence of trunk motion on trunk strength and structural loading.

Background. In recent years, trunk dynamics have been identified as potential risk factors for developing low-back disorders. Consequently, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in trunk motion is needed.

Methods. This review summarizes the results of 53 studies that have evaluated trunk motion and its impact on several biomechanical outcome measures. The biomechanical measures consisted of trunk strength, intra-abdominal pressure, muscle activity, imposed trunk moments, and spinal loads. Each of these biomechanical measures was discussed in relation to the existing knowledge within each plane of motion (extension, flexion, lateral flexion, twisting, and asymmetric extension).

Results. Trunk strength was drastically reduced as dynamic motion increased, and males were impacted more than females. Intra-abdominal pressure seemed to only be affected by trunk dynamics at high levels of force. Trunk moments were found to increase monotonically with increased trunk motion. Both agonistic and antagonistic muscle activities were greater as dynamic characteristics increased. As a result, the three-dimensional spinal loads increase significantly for dynamic exertions as compared to isometric conditions.

Conclusions. Trunk motion has a dramatic affect on the muscle coactivity, which seems to be the underlying source for the decrease strength capability as well as the increased muscle force, IAP, and spinal loads. This review suggests that the ability of the individual to perform a task “safely” might be significantly compromised by the muscle coactivity that accompanies dynamic exertions. It is also important to consider various workplace and individual factors when attempting to reduce the impact of trunk motions during dynamic exertions.

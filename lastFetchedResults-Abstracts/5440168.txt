In order to solve the problem of voltage stability in the power system including wind farms,a method that assembling SVC at the connection point and applying Simulated Annealing´s Particle Swarm Optimization (SAPSO)Algorithm to optimize the reactive power compensation capacity is given. The processing of the wind farm node reflects its character accurately. The model´s objective function is to let the voltage of connection point close to 1 p.u.. Under the difference of wind speed, combining the calculation of the power flow and the algorithm of SAPSO, the best reactive power compensation capacity is figured out. With the computing result, this method can reduce the number of iterations, realize the global optimization, and the voltage of the power system can be restricted within regular range.

Examining the trend of China’s military relations with regional powers within the last few years particularly subsequent to activation of China’s foreign policy in South and West Asia, I seeks to answer this primary questions that which of the two countries of Pakistan and Iran have priority in Chinese military strategy. I also address the consequences of Iran and Pakistan’s military cooperation with China on regional and inter-regional power equations. I contend that China’s military relations with Pakistan have been on the rise to the level of strategic cooperation or even alliance, while Iran has lagged behind in ascending to such levels. The data provided by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute are used extensively in this research besides some other archival data.

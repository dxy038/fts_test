This paper presents a new formulation and design method for an M-channel perfect reconstruction (PR) cosine modulated filter bank (CMFB) with an adjustable group delay. The objective is to show how far we can reduce the group delay in this proposed CMFB by using a new design method for a very high stop-band attenuation FIR low-pass prototype filter. Simulation results show that the stop-band attenuation of this proposed prototype filter can be as high as 100 dB. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate that the group delay can be reduced in this CMFB without degrading its performance in an adaptive filtering scenario.

Objective to develop a signal processing system based on FPGA used in digital ophthalmology ultrasongraphy to process echo signals. Methods main signal processing technique used in the system includes interpolation, dynamic filter, TGC, envelop demodulation and logarithmic amplifier. In FPGA, a schematic file acts as the top module, and hardware describe language VHDL act as bottom modules. Results By building a physical simulation model, the validity of each phases in signal processing of the system has been validated. By detecting normal human eyes and orbits, the echo signals gained are all right. Conclusion The system has good ability to process high frequency ultrasonic echo signals of ophthalmology in real time. It has reached design demands, and shows a good application prospect.

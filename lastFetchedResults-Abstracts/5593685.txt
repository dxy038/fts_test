We make use of time warp for the distributed simulation of a dynamic channel allocation scheme known as channel segregation. Channel segregation requires that signal strength computation be made continuously, imposing a heavy load on the simulation. We compare the performance of the channel segregation algorithm to a fixed channel allocation algorithm. The main objective of our experiments was to determine limitations on our ability to make use of distributed simulation for wireless networks.

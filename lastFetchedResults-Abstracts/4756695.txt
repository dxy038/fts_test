A facial expression is a vague concept that is difficult to describe explicitly. Conceptual fuzzy sets (CFSs), which have the ability to explicitly represent vague concepts, are realized using bidirectional associative memories, and a multilayer structured CFS represents the meaning of a concept by various expressions in each layer. Multilayered reasoning in CFS has the capability of simultaneous abstract and concrete representation and of simultaneous top-down and bottom-up processing. CFS has been applied to the recognition of facial expressions and shown to achieve context-sensitive recognition

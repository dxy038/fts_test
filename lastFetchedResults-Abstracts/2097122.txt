Attempts to eradicate tuberculosis from cattle and farmed deer in some countries have been frustrated by the existence of wildlife reservoirs of Mycobacterium bovis infection. Possum control programmes in New Zealand using poisons have shown clearly that the brushtail possum is an important source of infection for cattle and farmed deer, and the sum of evidence strongly suggests that badgers serve as a source of infection for cattle in the UK. Bovine tuberculosis can only be eradicated from these countries by controlling M. bovis infection in both wildlife and domestic animals. The most promising options for control of M. bovis infection in wildlife in the longer term include the development of a tuberculosis vaccine for wildlife and a strategy for biological control of possums. The aim of this review is to address the problems and approaches involved in the control of wildlife tuberculosis from an immunological perspective.

This work is concerned with the design of a chaotic communication system based on a modified inclusion method. For this, we propose a bidirectional transmitter-receiver communication scheme whereby the transmitter is a Rossler oscillator and the receiver is a corresponding nonlinear high gain observer. The main motivation to employ a bidirectional communication scheme is exclusively to eliminate the nonlinearities in the error dynamics of the observer. We propose an approach where a message is embedded with a proportional and integrated form in the state variables, proving that if amplification factors are correctly calculated the transfer function is equal to unity and message recovery is possible with simple error dynamics subtraction. Consequently the proposed technique does not require a left inversion message recovery block, contrary to traditional inclusion methodology.

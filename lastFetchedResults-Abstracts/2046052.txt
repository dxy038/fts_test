The part of power new rule is performing in different countries of the world. The new rule emphasize on the role of competitive markets in order to prepare and support lateral services. Among these lateral services, we can refer to producing reactive power and controlling the voltage of transfer network so that is ensures the system reliability. The objective of this article has two sections: reactive power producing services and voltage control which nowadays are divided into two sections: the first section is the voltage profile management and the second section is voltage adjusting. Similarly, margin cost is recommended so that the overall rule of producers' performance and supporting the consumers will be unfolded. In this paper, we deal with the calculation of reactive power cost in restructured environment through OPF method.

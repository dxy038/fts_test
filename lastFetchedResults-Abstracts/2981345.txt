Edison Technology Solutions (ETS) and its collaborative partners are participating in the development of a collaborative $16 million demonstration hybrid electric generation project using a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell (PSOFC) integrated with a micro-turbine generator (MTG). The demonstration project is strategically located at the National Fuel Cell Research Center (NFCRC) at UCI. It is a ´first of a kind´ demonstration. The DOE calls it the ´most exciting innovation in power in the next 10 years.´ The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate the first hybrid power cycle employing a PSOFC integrated with an MTG. The parameters of evaluation are the power output, generation efficiency, degradation characteristics, operability and operating power range. Emissions from fuel cells are known to be the lowest for all forms of electric generation, which use fossil fuels. The emission specification for this PSOFC design is less than 1.0 PPM NO<sub>x</sub> and less than detectable SO<sub>x</sub> and other target pollutants. Sulfur compounds are removed from the fuel prior to use. The fuel cell requires no combustion of the fuel to generate electricity. Without combustion, no pollutants are formed resulting in clean exhaust. A small percentage of fuel (15%) passes through the fuel cell unused. The unused fuel is spontaneously combusted in an exhaust plenum of the fuel cell, which elevates the exhaust temperature. The added thermal energy is used in the MTG. With no combustion in the MTG, no additional pollutants are formed

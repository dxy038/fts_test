In this paper, a change detection accuracy comparison is made between a recently proposed EKF method and a sliding window Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) alternative within a spatio temporal change detection framework. Both methods produce a mean and amplitude parameter sequence which is then used to determine a change metric which yield a change of no-change decision after thresholding. The objective is to determine which of these methods produces a change metric value that is able to best discriminate between change and no-change.

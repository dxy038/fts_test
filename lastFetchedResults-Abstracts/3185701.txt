The present study is related to the ESA/ASTRIUM contract n&#176;4500082825 entitled &#8220;Wireless Intra-Spacecraft communications&#8221;, whose objectives cover the design, development and validation of a RF wireless communications system for use in spacecraft Assembly Integration and Verification (AIV). This paper presents the main outcomes of this study, whose main objective was to assess, by modelling techniques, the possibility of using wireless communication inside satellite for AIT (Assembly, Integration and Tests) purposes. Comparisons with tests have been done in order to validate the numerical model and statistic data have been established.

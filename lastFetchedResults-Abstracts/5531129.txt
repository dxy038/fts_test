With the advent of the information age, todayÂ´s engineer is faced with the dilemma of processing ever larger amounts of information. This paper presents a cogent method of storing categorizing, associating, and accessing knowledge from all available fields of study. Realization of this objective would enable a researcher in one field of study to access past and present work in his or her own field, or in related fields, or in unrelated fields where a particular inference may be applicable or perhaps even suggested by the current search. The proposed methodology will avail the user of a vast array of concepts and knowledge from which useful data can be gleaned: it will thus expedite any research effort

The mnemonic keyword method is an effective technique for vocabulary acquisition. This study examines the effects on recall of word-meaning pairs of (a) training in use of the keyword procedure at the time of retrieval; and (b) the influence of the self-rated ability to image. The performance of students trained in bidirectional retrieval using the keyword method to learn new Spanish words and their English definitions was compared to that of control group students who used the standard keyword procedure. Data on recall performance were gathered on five occasions and analysed using multilevel analysis procedures (HLM). The retrieval training was a significant predictor of both backward and forward recall performance, as was the ability to make images.

Distributed generation (DG) promises many potential benefits, including peak shaving, price hedging, fuel switching, improved power quality and reliability, increased efficiency and improved environmental performance. For these reasons, DG predicted to play an increasing role into the electric power systems of the near future. In this paper, two types of DGs are considered for implementation and DGs are modelled as PQ bus. The suitable location for placing distributed generation (DG) is identified through loss sensitivity factors and L index. The fuzzy adaptation of evolutionary programming has been chosen as it is particularly suited while solving optimization problems of multiobjectives. This technique is used to find the optimal size of distributed generation (DG). The objective of this paper is to minimize the total payments toward compensating for system losses and DGÂ´s capital costs by optimal siting and sizing of two types of DG. This new technique is tested on IEEE-34 bus radial distribution system and the results obtained justify the importance of optimal placement of distributed generation (DG) for minimizing losses and maximizing saving while maintaining appropriate voltage profile at all the buses.

The paper introduces a new approach to the behavioural modelling of nonlinear RF/microwave systems or subsystems. The model accounts for both linear and nonlinear distortion, is fast to compute, can accurately handle broadband modulated signals, and is fully bidirectional. It can thus be used to analyze systems where bidirectional signal flow takes place, e.g., due to mismatches between interconnected subsystems, or even to the presence of filters operating in the stopband.

SuperB is a novel, high-luminosity (10<sup>36c</sup>m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), asymmetric e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup> collider to be built at the future Cabibbo Laboratory, in the campus of the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy). A detector aimed at studying the B physics will be installed in this facility. High-speed serial links will be used for trigger, control and data read-out. The on-detector ends of the links will have to withstand a hadron fluence of 8&#183;10<sup>10</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup> per effective year (10<sup>7</sup> s). In this work, we focus on the multi-gigabit bidirectional serial link architecture, which we implemented by means of GTP SerDes embedded in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. We also performed proton irradiation tests of our designs and, with reference to the collected results, we discuss the effectiveness of the radiation mitigation techniques we employed.

The optimal control of a single machine processing a certain number of jobs and modelled as a discrete-event dynamic system is considered. The sequence of jobs is fixed, whereas their timing and sizes represent the control variables of the system. The objective function to be optimised is a weighted sum of the inventory cost and of the quadratic deviations of job lot-sizes and completion times from those specified by the production demand. The problem is formalised as a multistage optimal control problem and solved by a procedure making use of dynamic programming techniques; in this way, a proper real time control scheme is obtained

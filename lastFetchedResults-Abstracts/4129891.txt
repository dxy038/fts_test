The objective of this paper is to provide an assessment on voltage profiles in residential neighborhoods in the presence of photovoltaic (PV) systems. The network was modeled in PSCAD using common feeder characteristics that Canadian system planners use in suburban residential regions. A simulation study was performed to investigate potential voltage rise issues in the network up to 11.25% total PV penetration in the feeder and LV transformer capacity penetration up to 75%. Results indicate that the PV penetration level should not adversely impact the voltage on the grid when the distributed PV resources do not exceed 2.5 kW per household on average on a typical distribution grid. Moreover, the role of feeder impedance, feeder length, and the transformer short circuit resistance in the determination of the voltage rise is quantified.

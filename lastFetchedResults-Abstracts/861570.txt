The objective of this study is to examine the effect of the line of sight unit vector (LOS) on the accuracy of the GPS and pseudolite navigation system. An analytic derivation shows that the error of LOS cannot lower the accuracy of CPS in first-order sense. We carried out numerical simulation to examine the effect of the higher-order terms of the LOS error on ranging accuracy. The effect of the LOS error on CPS accuracy is negligible. On the contrary, the accuracy of pseudolite navigation system can be quite sensitive to LOS error, unless the distance between user and pseudolite is quite large. However, if the distance between user and pseudolite is sufficiently large, the LOS error can be ignored in pseudolite navigation system.

The authors propose an efficient distributed algorithm for finding a minimal connected dominating set of an asynchronous communication network. An asynchronous communication network can be modeled by a connected undirected graph <e1>G</e1>=(<e1>V</e1>, <e1>E</e1>) where the nodes correspond to the sites and the edges correspond to bidirectional communication links. No common memory is shared by the sites. Each node receives messages from its neighbors, performs some computation, and sends messages to its neighbors. Thus the distributed algorithms considered here are primarily message driven. Furthermore, each message sent by a node is assumed to be error free and to arrive in sequence to its neighbors after an unpredictable finite delay. The worst case message complexity of the algorithm is <e1>O</e1>(<e1>n</e1><sup>2</sup>), where <e1>n</e1> is the number of processors of the network

The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism of a phenomenon peculiar to phase-change recording regarding the mark shape or mark-forming process. The following results were obtained from our simulation of mark shapes, transparency electron microscope observations, and analysis of reproduced signals. A method of calculating a mark shape by calculating the holding-time profile was devised and its appropriateness was confirmed. We found there were close relationships between the cooling pulse shape, the effective erase ratio, the reproduced signal amplitude, and the noise level, and that the temperature change when the mark edge was cooled has a great influence on the stability of the mark shape and crystallized regions

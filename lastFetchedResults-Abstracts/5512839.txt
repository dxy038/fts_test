PID control is probably the most applied control strategy around the world. There is also a huge amount of literature available about this control strategy. In the most common case, the controller is formulated in the continuous-time domain. If it is necessary to implement the controller as a computational algorithm, controllerpsilas equations are discretized. It is less frequent to find PID control laws, which are directly formulated as a discrete-time system. It is also possible, but unusual, to find design methods for digital PID controllers based on parametric optimization. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to revisit the digital PID/PI controller design based on parametric optimization including new advanced optimization methods as well as taking into consideration the new calculation machinery for several performance indices. Single as well as multi-objective optimization approaches are considered. Finally, available software and practical implementation aspects are highlighted.

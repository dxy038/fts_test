Knowledge representation is a multidisciplinary subject that needs to apply theories and techniques from logic, ontology and computation. There are a great number of languages able to represent knowledge, among them UML can be considered a suitable language for modelling knowledge. It could be included within the category of visual languages for knowledge representation. On the other hand, numerous efforts are being carried out in the context of enterprise modelling to improve the capacity of enterprise models for externalising enterprise knowledge. The proposal presented in this paper combines both approaches, UML and enterprise modelling, in order to make possible enterprise knowledge modelling using UML. It shows a summary of this proposal describing its principles, the main steps of its development and an example of one of the UML Profiles implemented with the objective of modelling knowledge.

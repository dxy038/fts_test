This study deals with pre-sizing methodology of embedded static converters using optimisation for which high performances of weight, volume and efficiency are required. Moreover, in the automotive and aircraft domains, power-sharing architectures should be an other investigation path to reach such performances. The idea of power sharing is suitable and judicious if the actuators are in the same power range. In this study, the authors consider three electrical machines sequentially driven. The first solution is to use three independent inverters without power sharing, the second one is an inverter with a power-sharing system. A non-conventional DC-AC matrix converter is proposed to replace classical inverters. So as to overcome a priori power designers habits, a general modelling and optimisation is performed to provide a virtual prototyping tool to avoid physical prototyping because of their exhaustive cost. The objective function is the overall volume (mainly the heatsinkÂ´s volume). The optimisation results are presented and discussed. These preliminary results, under a three-AC drive assumption, show clearly that {inverter + power sharing system} and even the DC-AC matrix converter have an overall volume lower than the three-inverter solution.

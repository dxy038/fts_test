Objective: ACT focuses on specific processes that are not directly targeted by other treatments. ACT does not focus on the form
or frequency of inner experiences but instead targets their functional effects on behavior. ACT targets the function of thoughts,
feelings, and bodily sensations using acceptance and mindfulness procedures on the one hand, and targets behavior change using
traditional behavioral procedures on the other.
Methods: In this study an adult woman with chronic obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and depressive disorder who was
nonresponsive to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is presented in this case study.
Results: She was treated with 5sessions of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Measurements of pt (OCD) and D
(depression) were taken at pre-treatment, after Sessions 5, and at post-treatment. Results showed significant reduction on all
measures throughout treatment.
Conclusion: ACT helped the client to introduce the notion that struggle and control may actually interfere with the client's
everyday functioning and life-goal attainment, and then explore that notion briefly in terms of clients' life experiences.

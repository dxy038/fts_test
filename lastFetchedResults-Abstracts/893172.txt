The objective of this work was to study the effects of buffalo and bovine species and steers and heifers sexes, on the yields of commercial carcass cuts of animals with carcass average weight of 187.5 kg. A total of 72 animals were used, 30 Mediterranean crossbred buffaloes, 13 heifers and 17 steers, and 42 Aberdeen Angus crossbred bovines, 18 heifers and 24 steers. No significant interaction was observed between species and sex for the variables analyzed, indicating separate discussion of these effects. There was no statistical difference between species and sexes for hot carcass weight. Maturity was more advanced in bovines in relation to buffaloes, and in males in relation to females. Fat classifications did not differ between species, but females carcasses showed more fat cover than males. Buffalos and males showed forequarters with higher weight and percentage, and lower sawcut percentage than the bovines and females, respectively. Comparing the brake even point between buffalo and cattle was obtained the purchasing price of US$ 3.17 and US$ 3.13/ kg of carcass, respectively. Between sexes, the brake even point was US$ 3.18 for males and US$ 3.15 for females.

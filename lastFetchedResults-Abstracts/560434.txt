Abstract1
In order to achieve high quality seeds, producers must be able to estimate the
accurate harvest maturity time seeds. The objective of this study was to investigate
changes in seed quality during seed development and maturation in the two
cultivars native of the Sari and Gorgan and two cultivars modified of the Darab14
and Yellowhite. A field experiment was conducted in during 2009 at Gorgan
University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran. The
results indicated that physiological maturity (maximum dry weight of seed)
achieved at about 68 (889), 70 (957), 77 (1036) and 75 (1012) days after flowering
(growth degree days) for Yellowhite, Darab14, Gorgan and Sari cultivars,
respectively. At this date, the seed moisture content was 29, 40, 27 and 16% (wet
basis), respectively. Maximum seed quality occurred at 2 and 24 days later for cv.
Darab14 and Yellowhite, and 10 and 6 days earlier for cv. Sari and Gorgan, when
compared to physiological maturity of seeds. The results indicated that there was
significant difference as aspect the time to achieve to maximum seed quality and
physiological maturity in sesame. Generally, for to achieve high quality seeds in
sesame, must was done harvest at 900-1000 degree-days after flowering. At the
date, the moisture content of seeds were between 25-35% (wet basis) and color
lower and middle capsules were change from green to brown or yellow (depending
on cultivar). Hence, color identification of the capsules can be used as an additional
indicator for sesame harvest.

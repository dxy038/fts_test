Differential Evolution (DE) is widely used in solving single objective constrained real-parameter optimization problems. In this paper we present a new version of DE-based algorithm for constrained optimization. A new mutation strategy is also used in the proposed algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the set of 36 benchmark functions provided for the CEC 2010 competition. The obtained results show that our algorithm has found feasible solution on almost all benchmark functions, when the dimension of decision variables is set to 10 and 30, respectively.

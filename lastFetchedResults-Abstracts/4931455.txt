With the massive surges of new malware, the intuitive detection techniques currently used in most security tools deem ineffective. Consequently, we urgently need better solutions that are established on solid theoretical basis. It becomes, thus, necessary to search for more efficient techniques and algorithms as well as taxonomies and models for attacks and malware. We present, in this paper, the analysis we made on both automatic malware and human-centric attacks, which allowed us to construct a model for attack process. The main objective of this work is to construct a model that can aide in the generation of real attack scenarios and use it in the evaluation of Intrusion Detection Systems. However, the model described here could have many other potential uses. For example, it can be used for writing "execution- based" signatures, event correlation, penetration testing, security simulations as well as security educations.

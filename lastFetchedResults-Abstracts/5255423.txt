In this paper, we formulate a problem of simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension for via yield optimization. Our problem is more general than previous works in the sense that more than one type of line end extension is considered and the objective function to be optimized directly accounts for via yield. We present a zero-one integer linear program based approach, that is equipped with two speedup techniques, to solve the addressed problem optimally. In addition, we describe how to modify our approach to exactly solve a previous work. Extensive experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.

In this paper, the hot strip mill batch planning problem is summed as a Prize Collecting Vehicle Routing Problem (PCVRP). According to the hot-milling technical rules, the inverse bounce of the width and the thickness of the steel strips are considered, the inverse bounce penalty table is designed and an improved multi-objective mathematics programming model is presented. To solve this problem, the improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used. With the best parameters, computational results show that the best solution obtained by the algorithm, the probability of the average load and the effort of time are all satisfying.

The increase in the power grid security is one of the most important goals of the passive defense. On the other hand, there is the possibility of the sabotage actions and terrorist attacks which can harm the electric grid infrastructure. The infrastructure of the wide Area Measurement System (WAMS), which is based on the Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), is a proper method to control and monitor the power network. The control of the power Network can be done properly by using the infrastructure. In this paper, a new method is presented to find the optimal place of the phasor measurement units and design the communication network infrastructure. The total cost of the WAMS is considered as the objective function. The Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problems. Also, the bellman ford algorithm is used to design the communication infrastructure. The standard 30 and 39 bus IEEE and Iran (153 Bus) systems are tested with the proposed method. For this purpose, terrorist attacks scenarios are considered in the simulation. The simulation results show that using a proper design of the WAMS and considering the passive defense in a terrorist attack can protect the visibility of the system.

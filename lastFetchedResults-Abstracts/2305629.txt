BACKGROUND: Meat products may be unacceptably tough because of the high connective tissue content of meats used in their manufacture. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was using meat acid marination method on some physicochemical and sensory characteristics of beef burgers. METHODS: Meat was marinated in three concentrations (0.5%, 1% and 1.5%) of lactic and citric acid solutions (1:4 w/v) at 4 Â°C for 15h and was used in formulation of beef burgers. RESULTS: According to control sample, the highest redness (a*) value was found in the lowest concentration of lactic acid while the lowest a* value was in the highest concentration of citric acid. Shear force value indicated that lactic acid had a tenderizing effect particularly at the lowest concentration and had a positive effect on overall acceptability. Electrophoresis of proteins showed that band intensity had decreased in 0.5% acid treatments, compared to the control sample. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that meat acid marination is an applicable technique to tenderize beef burgers with high percentage of meat

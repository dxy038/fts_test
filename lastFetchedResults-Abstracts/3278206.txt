Critical structures such as aircrafts, bridges, dams and buildings require periodic inspections to ensure safe operation. Reliable inspection of structures can be achieved by combining ultrasound non-destructive testing techniques with other sensors (for example, temperature sensor and accelerometers). In this study, we show that adapting wireless embedded systems to the task of structural health monitoring improves inspection productivity, increases mobility, and allows the aggregation of critical data to enhance inspection accuracy. To achieve this objective, we developed a customized system based on Reconfigurable Ultrasonic System-on-chip Hardware (RUSH) platform. RUSH collects and analyzes ultrasonic data to detect structural flaws such as cracks, voids, or fatigue. The collected data is then transferred through a Bluetooth transceiver to an Android smartphone referred to as Mobile Sensor Data Collector (MSDC), where the data is instantly displayed and forwarded to a central server for expert review over the Internet.

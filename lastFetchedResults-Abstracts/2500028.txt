Background and Objectives: Endurance exercise induces cardiac remodeling. Also, myh6 gene is affected by cardiac remodeling. This study was performed with the objective of determining the effect of endurance activity on cardiac myh6 gene expression. &nbsp; Methods: In this study, 14 rats (weight, 231&plusmn;24g), after familiarization with endurance trainings, were randomly divided into two groups of control and experimental (7 animals each). The experimental group performed a training program (30m/min, 50min/session, and 6 session/week, for 14 weeks) on treadmill. Forty-eight hours after the end of the last session, the animals of the experimental and control groups were anesthetized and anatomized, then, the heart and subsequently the left ventricle, were removed. Real time PCR and sonography methods were, respectively, used to assess the expression levels of myh6 gene and structural changes in left ventricle. Data were analyzed using t-test. &nbsp; Results: In this study, endurance exercise significantly increased heart weight to body surface area ratio (p=0.002), also final diastolic diameter increased (p=0.008) in experimental group compared to control group. The results showed 124 fold and significant (p=0.011) increase in myh6 gene expression in the experimental group compared to control group. &nbsp; Conclusion: According to the results of this study, endurance exercise along with structural and functional changes in the left ventricle, induces changes at the gene level and thereby increases heart contractility power.

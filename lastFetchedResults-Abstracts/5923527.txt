The objective of this study is to classification in the particular agricultural land cover in the Tsagaannuur as there is an important agricultural producing area in Mongolia. We were developed agricultural cadastral map and create the vector coverage of the study site, the vector field boundaries were built and digitized from the ground truth data using with ARCMAP software. In this study, maximum likelihood supervised classification was applied to Landsat TM and ETM images acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively.

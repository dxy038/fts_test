Joint flexibility is an intrinsic property in most industrial robot manipulators. Because of the great complexity of its model, the resonant frequencies of the two-link flexible-joint robot manipulator vary with the configuration of the manipulator. Our objective is to move the manipulator from point to point with the least amount of residual vibration at the end point in the shortest time possible. Two shaped command profiles, based on ramped sinusoidal basis function and segmented versine basis function, are compared against one another as well as against the unshaped bang-bang command profile. The segmented versine basis function was proved to be the most effective

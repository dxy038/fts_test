This paper aims at developing an efficient controller for a nonlinear system. This necessitates identifying a near accurate model using the data acquired through real time experimentation conducted on the laboratory level process. An offline parametric estimation method is used to obtain discrete-time models for various operating regions. Three different digital polynomial controllers are designed and implemented to achieve the desired dynamics of the reference model. In order to obtain further improvement in the desired performance closed loop poles are relocated by Pole placement technique. The objective of this work also includes a comparative analysis of performances of the chosen system when implementing all these four strategies under different operating regions. The design and simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform.

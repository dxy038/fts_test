The use of numerical optimization methods to partially automate the design process is demonstrated. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, a global search technique, is used to determine both the active control and passive mechanical parameters of a vehicle suspension system. The objective is to minimize the extreme acceleration of the passenger's seat, subject to constraints representing the required road-holding ability and suspension working space. GA optimization is also used for passive suspension design to compare results from the literature based on a local optimization search technique: a gradient projection method.

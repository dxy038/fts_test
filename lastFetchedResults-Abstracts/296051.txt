Colonization of burn patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is not uncommon, however an outbreak that necessitates closure of a burns unit is relatively rare. The objective of this study was to present the experience of a regional adult burns unit where an outbreak of epidemic MRSA-15 (EMRSA-15) took place. During the studied period, 176 patients were admitted to the unit, 52 with burns, 48 for elective plastic surgery procedures while the remainder belonged to other specialities. Patients admitted under burns and plastic surgery were investigated together with 46 staff members to control the outbreak. MRSA was isolated in 18 patients out of which 12 had EMRSA-15. Among the staff members, MRSA was isolated in nine of which five had EMRSA-15. The burns unit was closed to all admissions to terminate this outbreak. The MRSA positive staff members were sent on “special leave” and underwent treatment with nasal mupirocin and triclosan body wash. All staff members were able to return to work after one week's treatment. The burns unit underwent refurbishment and decontamination while it was closed. In conclusion, the study shows that an outbreak of EMRSA was controlled successfully, however, it highlights the implications of such an event for a regional burn service with regard to staff, patients and guidelines for management.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the role of colposcopy and cytodiagnosis in the early detection of pathological changes in the uterine cervix and the association between the number of birth, sexual partners and colposcopic changes and cytological atypia. Material and Methods: Colposcopic changes in the cervix in relationship to number of births, abortions, and number of sexual partners were determined based on data from examinations performed at the Obstetric-Gynecologic Clinic in Prishtina, Kosovo during 2006 and 2007. The 500 examined patients were categorised in several groups. Results: All study patients underwent colposcopy. Colposcopic atypia was observed in 70 patients (14%), and 77 (15.4%) had other abnormal findings. The amount of colposcopic atypia increased with an increasing number of sexual partners. In the group with three or more sexual partners (n = 43) the rate was 62.8%. Infections were also more frequent in this group; of the 43 patients examined, 51.3% (22 patients) had infections, whereas in the group of 76 patients with only one sexual partner, 18.3% had infections and only 20.6% used contraceptives. Conclusion: Number of births, abortions, number of sexual partners, and contraceptive use directly affect colposcopic changes and cytological atypia.

With the increasing of wind power integration, the uncertainty of wind power affects the safety of the grid seriously. It is necessary to consider the wind power as random variable in the dynamic economic dispatch. A stochastic dynamic economic dispatch is presented based on the wind power probabilistic forecasting and operation risk constraints. The weak link and potential risk of system operating is displayed directly. And the objective reference to weigh the fuel cost and operating risk is also presented for operators. The model is solved by the hybrid intelligent algorithm, which is combined with SOT (Sequence Operation Theory) and GA (Genetic Algorithm). In order to reduce the computation time, the parallel algorithm and some further methods are implemented too. Simulation results show that the cost of system operating is greatly reduced with the same risk level by using the proposed model. Moreover, the calculating speed and searching efficiency can be improved greatly, which is acceptable in practice.

The main objective of this paper is to study the transient magneto-thermo-visco-elastic stresses in a non-homogeneous anisotropic solid placed in a constant primary magnetic field acting in the direction of the z-axis and rotating about it with a constant angular velocity. The system of fundamental equations is solved by means of a dual-reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM). In the case of plane deformation, a numerical scheme for the implementation of the method is presented and the numerical computations are carried out for the temperature, displacement components and thermal stress components. The validity of DRBEM is examined by considering a magneto-thermo-visco-elastic solid occupies a rectangular region and good agreement is obtained with the results obtained by other methods. The results obtained are presented graphically to show the effect of inhomogeneity on the displacement components and thermal stress components.

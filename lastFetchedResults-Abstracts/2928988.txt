The k-stacker crane problem (k-SCP), a generalization of the stacker crane problem (1-SCP) originated from the travelling salesman problem, is studied in this paper such that Two approximate O(max{|V| <sup>3</sup>, |A|<sup>3</sup>}) heuristics are first presented under the objective of minimizing the total length of k stacker crane tours, where V stands for a set of modes (or cities), A is a set of arcs, and each arc is an ordered pair of cities to be visited. Not only the heuristics but also their compounds provide a worst-case guarantee similar to those of FredericksonsÂ´ 1-SCP, and better than the k-SCP to minimize the longest of k stacker crane tour

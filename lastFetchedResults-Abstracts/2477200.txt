Background and objective: Despite the many benefits of physical activity,
sedentary lifestyle is still a public health problem among women. This study
was conducted to identify factors associated with physical activity based on
Stages of Change Model as one of the most effective models of behavior study
among health volunteers in Rasht in 2014.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, all of the active health volunteers in
Rasht (N=176) completed the self-administered questionnaire consisting of 3
parts: demographic information, validated questionnaire of stages of change
model constructs, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQlong
form). Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, ANOVA, Kruskal-
Wallis, Correlation and regression through SPSS 18.
Results: Intensity of physical activity among health volunteers was respectively
10.2%, 61.4% and 28.4% in low, moderate and severe level. Among the
structures of Stages of Change Model, self-efficacy (B = 0.2) and Cons (B = 0.17),
had predictive power on the promotion of physical activity (p  < 0.05). 17% were
in the pre-contemplation stage, 10.3% were in the contemplation stage, 17.6%
in the preparation stage, 12.5% were in the action stage, and 42.6% were in the
maintenance stage of regular physical activity.
Conclusion: Since most of the health volunteers were in the middle-ages, and
also the majority of them had moderate physical activity, appropriate for their
age, therefore, due to the effective constructs (self-efficacy and Cons), it is
necessary that these constructs to be strengthened in order to maintain the
moderate level of physical activity in this group.

In this paper, we consider an identical parallel machine scheduling problem with release dates. The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time. This problem is known to be strongly NP-hard. We propose some dominance properties and two lower bounds. We also present an efficient heuristic. A branch-and-bound algorithm, in which the heuristic, the lower bounds and the dominance properties are incorporated, is proposed and tested on a large set of randomly generated instances.

The objective of this workwas to determine the hydrogen production from paper mill wastes using microbial consortia of solid
substrate anaerobic digesters. Inocula from mesophilic, continuous solid substrate anaerobic digestion (SSAD) reactors were transferred
to small lab scale, batch reactors. Milled paper (used as a surrogate paper waste) was added as substrate and acetylene or 2-
bromoethanesulfonate (BES) was spiked for methanogenesis inhibition. In the first phase of experiments it was found that acetylene
at 1% v/v in the headspace was as effective as BES in inhibiting methanogenic activity. Hydrogen gas accumulated in the headspace
of the bottles, reaching a plateau. Similar final hydrogen concentrations were obtained for reactors spiked with acetylene and BES.
In the second phase of tests the headspace of the batch reactors was flushed with nitrogen gas after the first plateau of hydrogen was
reached, and subsequently incubated, with no further addition of inhibitor nor substrate. It was found that hydrogen production
resumed and reached a second plateau, although somewhat lower than the first one. This procedure was repeated a third time
and an additional amount of hydrogen was obtained. The plateaux and initial rates of hydrogen accumulation decreased in each
subsequent incubation cycle. The total cumulative hydrogen harvested in the three cycles was much higher (approx. double) than
in the first cycle alone. We coined this procedure as IV-SSAH (intermittently vented solid substrate anaerobic hydrogen generation).
Our results point out to a feasible strategy for obtaining higher hydrogen yields from the fermentation of industrial solid wastes, and
a possible combination of waste treatment processes consisting of a first stage IV-SSAH followed by a second SSAD stage. Useful
products of this approach would be hydrogen, organic acids or methane, and anaerobic digestates that could be used as soil amenders
after post-treatment.

Water sector policy makers are interested in assessing the long-term impacts of adopted policies on water allocation for stakeholder benefits. To assess the impacts of policies on stakeholders, a model that considers water supply-demand interaction is necessary. Research in this field mostly deals with the short term modeling of water supply-demand interaction. In this research, a dynamic water allocation model is developed, which considers long-term water supply-demand interaction through the inclusion of socio-economic parameters representing water allocation problems and stakeholder benefits. 

In this research, the net income of stakeholders, employment of a labor force and the allocated water to minimum river flow requirements, are socio-economic and environmental parameters included in the objective function to be maximized. Agricultural and industrial water demands are considered to interact with the water supply and with each other. Stakeholders are comprised of agricultural, industrial, water allocation and environmental sectors. This model is used for assessment of the long-term impacts of two policies; the first considers 5% improvement in efficiencies and the second considers the present state continuing without improvement in efficiency. Policies are applied to and assessed for an example water basin comprised of multi-reservoirs and different water demands for a 30 year planning horizon. Criteria are defined for summarizing the long-term impact of policies in the water basin. Based on these criteria values, the second policy is favored in comparison with the first.

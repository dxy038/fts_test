This paper addresses the robust fault detection (RFD) problem for a class of neutral systems with time delays in states and unknown input. The objective is to minimize the difference between the residual and the fault, and to enhance the robustness to unknown inputs and control inputs. The key idea is to formulate the design of robust fault detection filter (RFDF) as H<sub>infin</sub> filtering problem. The sufficient condition for the existence of the RFDF is proposed by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method

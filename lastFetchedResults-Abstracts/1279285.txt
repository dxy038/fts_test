Conventional sampling techniques are often too expensive and time consuming to meet the amount of data required in soil monitoring or modelling studies. The emergence of portable and flexible spectrometers could provide the large amount of spatial data needed. In particular, the ability of airborne imaging spectroscopy to cover large surfaces in a single campaign and to study the spatial distribution of soil properties with a high spatial resolution represents an opportunity for improving the monitoring of soil characteristics and soil threats such as the decline of soil organic matter in the topsoil. However, airborne imaging spectroscopy has been generally applied over small areas with homogeneous soil types and surface conditions. Here, five hyperspectral images acquired with the AHS-160 sensor (430 nm–2540 nm) were analysed with the objective to map soil organic carbon (SOC) at a regional scale. The study area, covering a surface of ∼ 420 km2 and located in Luxembourg, is characterized by different soil types and a high variation in SOC contents. Reflectance data were related to surface SOC contents of bare croplands by means of 3 different multivariate calibration techniques: partial least square regression (PLSR), penalized-spline signal regression (PSR) and support vector machine regression (SVMR). The performance of these statistical tools was tested under different combinations of calibration/validation sets (global and local calibrations stratified according to agro-geological zones, soil type and image number). Under global calibration, the Root Mean Square Error in the Predictions reached 5.3–6.2 g C kg− 1. Under local calibrations, this error was reduced by a factor up to 1.9. SOC maps of bare agricultural fields were produced using the best calibration model. Two map excerpts were shown, which display intra- and inter-field variability of SOC contents possibly related to topography and land management.

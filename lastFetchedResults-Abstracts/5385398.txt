In this paper, a novel method for design of the output feedback controllers as unified power flow controller (UPFC) is developed. Selection of the output feedback gains is converted to an optimization problem which is solved by the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a time domain-based objective function. Only local and available state variables are adopted as the input signals of each controller for the decentralized design. To ensure the robustness of the proposed stabilizers, the design process takes into account a wide range of operating conditions and system configurations. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers on damping low frequency oscillations is tested and demonstrated through non-linear time simulation. The results of these studies show that the designed controller has an excellent capability in damping power system oscillations.

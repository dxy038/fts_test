With the objective to understand structural features responsible for the biological activity, novel nonelectrophilic biphenyl derivatives and peptide-biphenyl hybrids have been synthesized and evaluated as calpain I inhibitors. The preliminary results indicate that the presence of additional aromatic rings (besides the biphenyl system) makes these compounds potent calpain inhibitors with IC50 values in the nanomolar range.

We propose an adaptive trellis coded modulation orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ATCM-OFDM) scheme to provide high rate transmission with high spectral efficiency for an indoor environment. Our objective is to minimize the overall transmit power in each OFDM transmission by optimizing the power distribution, the code rate and modulation scheme in each OFDM subchannel so as to maintain a constant data transmission rate and a fixed bit error rate (BER). In the simulation, the ATCM-OFDM scheme can achieve more than 7 dB power reduction compared with the OFDM scheme using fixed TCM

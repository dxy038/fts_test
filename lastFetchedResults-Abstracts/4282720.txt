In this paper, four PWM control methods: simple boost, maximum boost, maximum constant boost, and modified space vector PWM control are reviewed and compared for different voltage type Impedance Source Inverter (ZSI) topologies. There are three different topologies for three phase-two level-voltage type ZSI: basic, bidirectional, and high performance ZSI. For purposes of comparison, these three ZSI topologies are simulated by using the different four PWM control methods for the same input voltage, shoot-through duty ratio, peak dc voltage across the inverter, switching frequency and output load. These simulations have been developed in Simulink/Matlab for a 30 kW ZSI designed for hybrid electric vehicle applications. The comparison shows that the maximum constant boost control is the most suitable PWM control method for all ZSI topologies. Also, the paper presents a review for optimal impedance network parameters design.

In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical approach for multiphase image segmentation. The approach presents a unified framework that unifies two basic segmentation approaches; level set methods and graph cut algorithms. In the work of El-Zehiry et al. (2007), we have presented a bimodal image segmentation approach that have the advantages of the level set methods such as robustness to noise, blurred edges and topology changes and the advantages of graph cuts vis-a-vis global optimization and speed. Our main objective in this paper is to extend our previous approach to segment n classes. The results section will show that our algorithm outperforms the multiphase image segmentation approach introduced in the work of Vese and Chan (2002).

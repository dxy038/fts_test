A new meshfree method for the analysis of elasto-plastic deformation is presented. The method is
based on the proposed first-order least-squares formulation for elasto-plasticity and the moving leastsquares
approximation. The least-squares formulation for classical elasto-plasticity and its extension
to an incrementally objective formulation for finite deformation are proposed. In the formulation,
equilibrium equation and flow rule are enforced in least-squares sense, i.e. their squared residuals
are minimized, and hardening law and loading/unloading condition are enforced pointwise at each
integration point. The closest point projection method for the integration of rate-form constitutive
equation is inherently involved in the formulation, and thus the radial-return mapping algorithm is
not performed explicitly. The proposed formulation is a mixed-type method since the residuals are
represented in a form of first-order differential system using displacement and stress components as
nodal unknowns. Also the penalty schemes for the enforcement of boundary and frictional contact
conditions are devised and the reshaping of nodal supports is introduced to avoid the difficulties due
to the severe local deformation near contact interface. The proposed method does not employ structure
of extrinsic cells for any purpose. Through some numerical examples of metal forming processes, the
validity and effectiveness of the method are discussed

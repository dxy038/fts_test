The authors present a description of the appropriate device models, design methods, and analysis techniques for a real-time surface acoustic wave (SAW) computer-aided design (CAD) system. The approaches presented have been successfully implemented in the creation of a fully integrated SAW filter CAD system for the design of bidirectional and three-phase unidirectional filters on a DEC VAX 11/750 system and for the design of bidirectional filters on an IBM PC-AT computer, which acts as an independent workstation. The focus is on bidirectional transducer design and analysis using the PC-based computer system. CAD analysis of a SAW bidirectional filter is compared to measured parameters

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of parental and strangers sex pheromones on the puberty beginning in immature male rats. Testing consisted of six groups, each group consisting of 8 rats. In each group male rats were exposed to sexual pheromones from birth. the first group, received maternal pheromones, second group, received the stranger female pheromones, the third group received father pheromones , the fourth group received stranger male pheromones, fifth group received parents pheromones and eventually the six group received strangers male and female pheromones. Immature male rats received pheromones through the ventilator that was placed in the cage. Not found significant difference in testosterone level after hormonal testing in groups. The results of this study indicate pheromones inhaled through the air not have effect on the puberty beginning in immature male rats and it seems pheromones influence puberty beginning in immature male rats if the pheromones directly received by the immature male rats.

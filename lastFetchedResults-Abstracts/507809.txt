One of the primary issues in line balancing problems is the uncertainty associated with the processing times. There are different reasons for having uncertain processing times such as task deterioration, failure in machines, etc. On the other hand, there are different objectives, such as cycle time, number of workstations in an assembly line balancing. In this paper, we present a multi-objective decision making assembly line balancing which minimizes different objectives such as cycle time and number of workstations. The resulted problem is formulated based on Lp-norm mixed integer programming and a meta-heuristic approach is also presented to solve the resulted model. The problem formulation is solved for some test examples and the results are discussed under different conditions.

AbstractObjectives
m of this retrospective study was to analyze prognostic factors in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sunitinib or sorafenib after progression on cytokine therapy.
als and methods
onal database of patients treated with targeted agents was used as the data source. A total of 319 patients treated with sunitinib (n = 181) or sorafenib (n = 138) after progression on cytokine therapy were analyzed.
s
stic factors significantly associated with poor overall survival in a multivariable Cox model included the time from diagnosis to the start of treatment with TKIs&lt;1 year, increased neutrophil counts, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group performance status 2 or higher. The parameters showing statistically significant association with progression-free survival included time from diagnosis to the beginning of treatment with TKI&lt;1 year, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group performance status 2 or higher. We have also validated the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium prognostic model in our cohort of patients.
sion
onstrate that the International Database Consortium prognostic model performs well for European patients treated with TKIs, including sunitinib or sorafenib, after progression on cytokines and suggest that a reduction from original 6 down to 4 parameters is possible.

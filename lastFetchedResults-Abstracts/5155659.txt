The load flow has a stochastic character due to the high penetration of renewable generation, especially wind power. Nowadays about 50 GW of wind power is installed in the UCTE power system. This causes difficulties especially in the optimal operation of the system and can lead to black outs due to problems with energy flow which is often not produced according to demand. An example occurred on November 4, 2006 when the UCTE system was divided into three parts with different frequencies. The reason for this was the uncontrolled share of power on the transit line caused by high, unpredicted wind penetration. In the paper a objective function for a WAC (wide area control) system has been defined. The Fribourg analog power system simulator, which has been used to test the flexibility of the proposed solution, will be presented too. The controllability of the system has been provided using a phasor measurement unit (PMU) installed in the simulator.

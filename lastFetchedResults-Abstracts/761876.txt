Objective: Childbirth is one of the most important causes of
disease, disability and mortality among women. There is a big
difference between childbirth health in Iran and world wide
standards.Because women still die in childbirth in Iran and around the
world and many consequences result from it, we must try to decrease
these resulting problems. Therefore, childbirth safety is one of the
most crucial issues in national and international health. Methods: This
study is a survey with a questionnaire as the means of data collection.
The research population Consisted of 185 women hospitalized in
Javanrood Hospital's maternity ward was interviewed by the
researcher using a closed questionnaire.Findings and Results: The
results show a significant relationship between delivery health level
and social exclusion.Exclusion from social welfare is the most
effective factor among the various types of social exclusion, and
exclusion from social production and exclusion from civil society
come next respectively. Exclusion from social welfare depends on the
conditions of the maternity ward, and improving them can have
instant effects on the health of delivery. Exclusion from social
production and exclusion from civil society result in social isolation.
We must first eliminate exclusion from social production by
improving social relationships, communication, and contribution to
health and medical care, which will decrease social isolation, thereby
improving the health of delivery. Decreasing gender and ethnic
discrimination and violence against women, and observing patient
rights in hospitals will reduce exclusion from civil society and will
influence social isolation, so delivery health will be improved.
Nowadays, exclusion from civil society influences delivery health
more than biological Factors.

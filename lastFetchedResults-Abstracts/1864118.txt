The purpose followed in this study was to estimate infiltration and roughness coefficients in furrow irrigation employing inverse modeling as an indirect method. A surface irrigation simulation model was used throughout the inverse modeling approach. To discover the optimum values of infiltration as well as roughness coefficients, genetic algorithm of seven objective functions was employed to minimize the differences between the observed vs. simulated values of advance time, recession time, total runoff volume as well a combination of all. The objective function which simultaneously minimized the differences between the observed and simulated values of all the parameters, could accurately estimate infiltration and roughness coefficients. The relative error (%) of the inverse modeling approach ranged from 1.3 to 1.5 for the advance time, 3.4 to 4.1 for the recession time, and 0.4 to 12.5 for the runoff discharge. This was while these values (for the two-point method) varied within the ranges of 18.7 to 26.6; 3.4 to 3.7; and 12.5 to 13.0, respectively for conventional and alternate furrow irrigation systems.

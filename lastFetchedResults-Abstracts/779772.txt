The objective of this study is to analyze outsourcing from various
perspectives and establish a strategy for turning crises into opportunities
based on the mission and vision of Hanyang University Libraryâ€™s
material organization department. Accordingly, the author
re-examined the balanced scorecard (BSC) technique for the cataloging
department rather than the entire library. BSC has allowed
Hanyang University Library to establish their current positions, including
outsourcing, to steer the library toward an ideal direction,
and has also enabled the author to implement strategies for creating
a proactive department that can adapt to the changing trends
in cataloging. Accordingly, this study examines the BSC not as a
means of improving outputs and evaluating performance, but as a
guide for achieving the future vision of the cataloging department

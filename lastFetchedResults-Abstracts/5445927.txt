For the requirements and characteristics of the software quality synthesis evaluation, this paper creates a matter-element model and an extension evaluation method for software quality metrics. This method combines softwareÂ´s pure qualitative indices with specific quantitative metrics algorithm, by which the complex expression and computation of the qualitative and quantitative synthesis evaluation for software quality are solved well. Practice shows that this new matter-element model and the extension algorithm not only help us to get objective, accurate, practical and high reliable results, but also make it easy to calculate and standardize in evaluating software quality.

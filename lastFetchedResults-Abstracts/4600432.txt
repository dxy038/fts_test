Based on multi-agent system, an agent network structure model of closed-loop quality chain is built up at first, realizing closed-loop operation by agent coordination mechanism. The agent operation and communication scheme of the novel quality chain management is analyzed by a unite agent model, and its coordination between different agents is expressed according to positive and reverse quality agents. Based on this model, quality chain co-design problem combining quality of service system parameters and controller parameters is described as a multi-objective optimization function. When system operation requirement changes, the co-design scheme can coordinate different agents to fit different demands. A comprehensive solving method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm are explained and verified by a simplified example.

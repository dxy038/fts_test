Treatments for asthma are largely pharmaceutical, with some therapies also utilizing alternative breathing techniques. The objective of both medical and alternative methods is to relax contracted airway smooth muscle (ASM). As a means of investigating more-effective alternative treatment methods for contracted airways, we analyze the combined effects of bronchodilators and length oscillations on isolated, contracted ASM. This work suggests that relaxation of isolated, contracted ASM is enhanced by combining oscillations with pharmaceutical relaxant.

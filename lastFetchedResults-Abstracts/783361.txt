Objective To investigate whether abnormal
eating behaviors in young women could predict
eating disorders after 4 years. Method 56 women were
identified as presenting abnormal eating behaviors in a
cross-sectional study (Eating Attitudes Test-26 and
Edinburgh Bulimic Investigation Test). They were
matched for age and neighborhood to two controls
(n = 112). Four years later, they were re-assessed with
the two screening questionnaires plus the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1).
Results Women with abnormal eating behaviors at
baseline showed a high probability of presenting
abnormal eating behaviors but it was not associated
with eating disorders 4 years later. They were also at
higher risk for obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder, and specific phobia.
Discussion Abnormal eating behaviors were related to
the maintenance of the disturbed behavior over the
years, and were associated with increased probability
for psychiatric diagnoses

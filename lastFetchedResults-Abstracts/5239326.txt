In this paper, a new Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithms is introduced for bi-objective no-wait flow scheduling problem, to minimize total flow time (TFT) and maximum completion time (makespan). which makes the problem into single objective by sum of weighted and discrete for no-wait flow scheduling problem. In order to improve the optimization of PSO and increase the algorithmÂ´s exploring ability, we can improve the performances through executing Variable Neighborhood Search. Passing through the testing experiments, this hybrid scheduling algorithms has higher superior performance.

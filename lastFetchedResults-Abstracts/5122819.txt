The main objective of this study is to build a basic human size faraday cage. 1-channel ECG circuit inclusive of notch filter also has been built to test the effect of faraday cage. The outcome of ECG signals was compared when placed inside cage (inside building), outside faraday cage (inside building) and outside building. Then the study of relationship between faraday cage and the effect on power line noise in ECG system has been done. From the result of this project it can be seen that faraday cage can eliminate the 50 Hz power line noise in ECG signal.

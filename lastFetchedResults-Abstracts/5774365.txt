This paper develops a simple analytical model for evaluating the hierarchical system of road networks. The model is based on a grid road network where roads are classified into three types according to widths and travel speeds. The objective is to find the optimal ratios of road areas that minimize the average and maximum travel time. Minimizing the average travel time provides an efficient solution, whereas minimizing the maximum travel time provides an equitable solution. As an application of the grid network model, we evaluate the hierarchical system of the road network of Tokyo.

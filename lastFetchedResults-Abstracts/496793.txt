During recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to plant diversity by ecologists and range managers. Loss of plants causes ecosystem instability which in turn reduce its ability to withstand pests and diseases damage.This research was performed in Karsanak Rangeland as one of the richest rangelands of Chaharmahal-Va–Bakhtiari province, with 573ha, and four vegetation types include, Astragalus  adscendens - Agropyrum intermedium- Eryngium billardieri, Astragalus verus- Agropyrum intermedium-Bromus tomentellus.Agropyrum intermedium Bromus tomentellus-  Agropyrum intermedium, Astragalus verus- Bromus tomentellus. Size and number of sampling quadrats were determined based on the nested (spiral) quadrat  and appropriate statistical method, respectively.Sampling was carried out 1 × 2 m2 quadrat in a systematic way, with the use of random number quadrat 30 along two 200 m transect in each vegetation type. In order to study plant diversity, index of Margalef and Menhinick for species richness, and Shannon -Weiner and Simpson for uniformity and diversity were applied. The results showed that type 1 and 2, had the highest and the lowest diversity, respectively. If we call plant diversity protection an important objective in range management, then the protection of type one should be a major priority for the area.

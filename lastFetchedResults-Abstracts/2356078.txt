To date, there is substantial co-relational evidence supporting the link between negative interpretations of intrusive thoughts and obsessive compulsive symptoms. The main objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of cognitive bias modification-interpretation in reducing the severity of symptoms, beliefs, and obsessional behaviors. For this purpose a sample of 60 students was selected with the symptoms of this disorder. The research design was an experimental pretest-posttest design with a control group. All the participants completed three questionnaires: the Moudsely Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Obsessional Beliefs Questionnaire. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance on the difference between pre-test and post-test scores showed that the cognitive bias modification-interpretation decreases the intensity symptoms, beliefs and obsessional behaviors, and the efficacy of the combination of cognitive bias modification-interpretation with group cognitive behavior therapy in reducing the severity of symptoms, beliefs and obsessional behaviors is more than cognitive bias modification-interpretation. With regard to this finding we can propose therapists to use cognitive bias modification-interpretation and its combination with group cognitive behavior therapy as a new, easy to use and effective approach in obsessive compulsive disorder therapy.

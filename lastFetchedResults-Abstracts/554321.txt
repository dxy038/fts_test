The objective of this study is to test the relationship between performance evaluation measures based on both accounting and economic models. Performance evaluation measures of accounting model are: Net Operating Profit after Tax (NOPAT), Profit after Tax (PAT), Profit before Interest and Tax (PBIT) and Cash Flow from Operation (CFO), and Performance evaluation measures of economic model are Market Value Added (MVA) and Economic Value Added (EVA).

The statistical population of the study is the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) for five years period (2002-2007). Our results show that coefficient of determination between MVA and PAT is more stronger than other measures. This also shows that PAT is a better proxy for MVA and also better predictor of MVA.

Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) are clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell. The myeloid lineage shows increased proliferation with effective maturation, while peripheral leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or elevated red blood cell mass are found. In Philadelphia negative CMPD recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities occur, but no specific abnormality has been defined to date. The spectrum of cytogenetic aberrations is heterogeneous ranging from numerical gains and losses to structural changes including unbalanced translocations. The most common chromosomal abnormalities are 20q−, 13q−, 12p−, +8, +9, partial duplication of 1q, balanced translocations involving 8p11 and gains in 9p. Cytogenetic analysis of CMPD by conventional or molecular techniques has an important role in establishing the diagnosis of a malignant disease, adding also more information for disease outcome. Molecular studies may detect the possible role of candidate genes implicated in the neoplastic process, addressing new molecular target therapies. FIP1L1/PDGFRα rearrangements, as well as alterations of PDGFRβ or FGFR1 gene have been found to be associated with specific types of CMPD. Recently, a novel somatic mutation, JAK2V617F, has been reported in most of the polycthemia vera (PV) patients, as well as in a lower percentage in essential thrombocythemia (ET) or idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) patients. This finding represents the most important advance in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlined the pathogenesis of CMPD, contributing to the classification and management of patients.

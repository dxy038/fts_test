In this paper, we propose an unsupervised design method for optimal structuring element (SE) of morphological filters. We formulate the design of SE as an optimization problem, and estimate an optimal shape and brightness of SE directly from degraded images. We estimated an optimal shape and brightness by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Estimation of SE that can remove noise while preserving original signals is achieved by objective function that use Rank-Ordered Logarithmic Differences (ROLD) statistic for the impulse noise detection.

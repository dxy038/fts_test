Today in this information avaricious society, internet traffic such as Multimedia streaming application is driving the demand for high speed data packet wireless services. In order to meet this demand and ameliorate the capacity of future generation wireless cellular network, several capacity improvement techniques that mitigate interference have been proposed in the recent past. The capacity of MC DS/CDMA system is limited by multipath fading and Multiple Access Interference. Mitigating MAI can improve the overall capacity of the system. In this paper, a signal modeling for unknown code channels using OVSF code characteristics is analyzed with a Multipath Interference Mitigation scheme that can exterminate the unknown intracell interferences additionally based on this signal modeling. The main objective of the work is to mitigate MAI in such a way that the orthogonality is preserved to the maximum extent and elevate Pedestrian mobility needs. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement for increased number of users in accession to maintaining orthogonality.

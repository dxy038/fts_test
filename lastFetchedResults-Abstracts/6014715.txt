A number of segmentation techniques are compared with regard to their usefulness for region-based image and video fusion. In order to achieve this, a new multi-sensor data set is introduced containing a variety of infra-red, visible and pixel fused images together with manually produced "ground truth" segmentations. This enables the objective comparison of joint and unimodal segmentation techniques. A clear advantage to using joint segmentation over unimodal segmentation, when dealing with sets of multi-modal images, is shown. The relevance of these results to region-based image fusion is confirmed with task-based analysis and a quantitative comparison of the fused images produced using the various segmentation algorithms

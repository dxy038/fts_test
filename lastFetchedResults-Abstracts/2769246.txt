This paper studies the problem of joint allocation of subchannel, transmission power, and phase duration in relay-enhanced bidirectional multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) networks. The goal of resource allocation is to minimize transmission energy consumption in networks with multiple decode-and-forward relay stations (RSs) under the data rate constraints of user equipment (UE). The challenges of this resource allocation problem arise from the complication of multiple-phase assignments within a subchannel since the RS can provide an additional transmission path from the base station to the UE. Existing research does not fully take into account all of the influential factors to achieve feasible resource allocation for relay-enhanced MIMO-OFDM networks. Green resource allocation (GRA) schemes with reduced computational complexity are proposed in this paper to develop joint allocation of subchannel, power, and phase duration for the UE with the consideration of direct and two-hop communications. Both the separate-downlink (DL)-and-uplink (UL) and mixed-DL-and-UL relaying assignments and the linear block diagonalization (LBD) technique are adopted to obtain the solutions for the proposed GRA schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed GRA schemes can provide comparably better energy conservation with the consideration of quality-of-service (QoS) support.


Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of attachment-based
interventions on females suffering from eating related disorders. The study method was
experimental with a pretest-posttest control group. The study sample included 32 elementary
school female students with eating disorders, obesity problems, and attachment disorders.
Sampling method was purposive. Methods: After assigning groups (experimental and control), the experimental group’s
mothers participated in 10 sessions of attachment-based intervention program over 2.5 months
and control groups did not receive any intervention. By the end of intervention, the posttest
and then follow-up test were done after 45 days. Instruments comprised ‘child attachment
disorder,’ ‘disorders caused by eating,’ and ‘eating disorder’ questionnaires. Results: The results of univariate analysis of covariance showed that in the posttest and followup
test of the disorders caused by eating, there were significant differences between control and
experimental groups. Conclusion: According to the results, the attachment-based treatment can be used as the
method of intervention to reduce disorders caused by eating in children with eating disorders
and obesity.

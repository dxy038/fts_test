The objective of the paper is to describe a hierarchical network architecture based on all-optical Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks extended (for longer distances) through Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. The local subnetworks are designed as all-optical WDM networks that require tunable components and a media access protocol. These networks are designed to efficiently support multimedia traffic and ATM encapsulation is used for local transport. The WDM networks are interconnected using generalized multichannel ATM switches. The ATM switches are termed as generalized since they are designed to utilize multiple wavelengths (provided by WDM) on the input/output links. The wavelengths on each link are allocated to different virtual circuit connections, to send signaling and control information, and to enhance priority handling

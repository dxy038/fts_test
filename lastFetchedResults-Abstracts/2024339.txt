
Language and meaning have drawn  considrably the theoretical attension of  philosophers part of which is the ontology of meaning. The author of this article is going to show that ontology of meaning as part of semantics, semiotics and hermeneutical speculation is not only of theoretical and philosophical concern but it has practical cosequences in the way we face with language and text and involves some recommendations and strategies in interprtations.  The deconstructionist view on the nature of meaning as well as Ferdinand de Saussure's analysis of nature and origin of meaning along with the view of those who consider meaning as ontologically dependent on text or take any text basically devoid of meaning advocate the objective plurality of meaning are all the subject of critical examination of this article with a disscussion of the implications of these viewpoints in religious knowledge and exegisis of revealed texts.

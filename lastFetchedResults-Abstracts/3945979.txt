The prioritization of technologies at the Army Materials Technology Laboratory are considered and the criteria and the technologies to be evaluated are identified. A mathematical model was developed to combine the subjective criteria with a single objective criterion. The criteria weights were determined by the analytic hierarchy process through a hierarchical representation and pairwise comparisons. The results were aggregated to yield a prioritized list of technologies to be used by the management of the laboratory for funding decisions of projects within technology areas

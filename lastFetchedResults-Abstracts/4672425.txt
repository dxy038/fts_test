The primary objective of the study is to derive an algorithm for regional albedo estimation using narrow band and moderate spatial resolution satellite data. A &#8220;uniform spectral region reflectance&#8221; model for converting satellite derived reflectance (emphasis on NOAA AVHRR) to broader spectral regions in the visible (0.38-0.72 &#956;m), near-IR (0.72-1.30 &#956;m) and shortwave mid-IR (1.30-4.0 &#956;m) was further developed. Analysis of spectra from surface grasses indicated the usage of a satellite waveband reflectance to directly estimate a wideband visible and wide-band near-IR may produce errors to over 30%, when not incorporating a linear correction. For sensors such as NOAA AVHRR without a shortwave mid-IR band, visible and near-IR reflectivities may be used to estimate a mid-IR reflectance to reduce albedo errors to 20%. Examination of atmospheric data indicates that for many different scattering atmospheres there is a compensating effect between diffuse and direct radiation providing a small variation between spectral regions for global radiation, improving the algorithm capability to provide regional albedo estimation

Just in time is one of the most important components of having efficient production plan. The primary objective of JIT is to reduce the amount of storage as much as possible to remove the cost of inventories and work-in-progress. However, the implementation of JIT is a tedious task especially in developing countries, where there are shortages for essential infrastructures and increase the risk of production in case of JIT adaptation. In this paper, we present a survey to detect important factors preventing JIT implementation in Iran. The proposed study designs a questionnaire for assessing important factors influencing JIT adaptation, which includes inflation, political sanction, unreliable suppliers, shortage of cash flow and weak organizational culture. The results of our survey confirm that shortage of cash flow is the most important factor, follows by economical sanction and inflation.

Coccidiosis is a common disease of poultry breeding industry in the world that cause by Eimeria spp. objective of the present study was comparison of anticoccidial effect of Diclazuril and Toltrazuril and their effects on the breeding function and intestinal oocyst shedding rate. Therefore, 300 broilers from Ross breed with 47 gr weigth average were divided into 3 groups randomely. Then chickens were inoculated 0.1 ml of suspension containing 10.000 Eimeria tenella oocysts in 22 days age and after produce coccidiosis in broilers, they were treated by Diclazuril and Toltrazuril through drinking water in two groups. Another group was untreated as control. Finally, food conception and intestinal oocyst shedding rate were compared with statistical analysis. Findings showed that difference between oocyst shedding rate in treated group with Diclazuril and control group (p=0.000) and treated group with Toltrazuril and control (p=0.000) were significant. But difference between two treated groups was not significant (p=0.059). Moreover, food conception rate in two treated groups were less than control group (p=0.000) that it indicated to better breeding function in treated groups. Therefore, regarding to similar effects of to anticoccidial compounds, it appears diclazuril is advised because of its lower dose and price.

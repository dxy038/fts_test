In this research, a detailed study of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of
minimizing total tardiness is presented and a steady-state genetic algorithm solution procedure is developed
for such problems. Also, using problem-specific knowledge, a very efficient elite guided solution
improvement scheme and an appropriate crossover operator have been developed and integrated into
the proposed method. Using benchmark problems, the algorithm has been compared with heuristic algorithms
having the best performance in the literature. The performance of the developed algorithm is
shown to be superior using a simulation study.

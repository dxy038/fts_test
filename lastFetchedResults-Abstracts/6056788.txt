Process of security administration in an information system is a complex task. Many security constraints should be expressed in order to define in the proper way the security policy. The security constraints can be classified into two groups. The first group represents the constraints classified by system application and the second group the constraints required by global security policy. The application developer can define the security constraints that should by associated to the application. On the other hand, the security administrator who knows well the global security policy can set up the constraints on the global level. The objective of this paper is to present and implement the security constraints of security schema in information system based on RBAC model. The security constraints can be described using the standard tool, like the UML language and in particular one of its part - the OCL language

During the last decade, the technique of optical character recognition has a particular research interest that laboratories continue to improve and develop. This technique is a good alternative to entering text, the availability of various tools involved in the singularity of this service. Undoubtedly, the development of such tools will provide a considerable gain in time and costs. The basis of the Arabic language, prompted us to work hard for a successful control of its optical character recognition, otherwise it is necessary to develop another approaches, therefore an approach based on finding a word-image in a text-image. Finally, the objective of this work is to conduct research in a word-image-text image of the Moroccan official bulletin. Finally, the objective of this work is to conduct research a wordimage in text image of the Moroccan official bulletin.

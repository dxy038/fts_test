This work investigates the use of a statistically based override on an automatic controller. The objective is to temper controller action, and to obtain a better balance of variance reduction in both controlled and manipulated variables than is currently obtained with conventional filtering. Experimental results on a pilot-scale flow loop demonstrate the benefit. Results are supported by both simulation and theoretical analysis.

Objective: Factors contributing to the applicability of interassay calibration of methods measuring enzyme catalytic activities are described. Also discussed are the properties essential for such a material. Similarity of specificity for the methods to be calibrated as well as commutability between the material(s) intended to be used as calibrator are the main criteria to be satisfied.
Result: Several examples demonstrated that interassay calibration is feasible but a multi-enzyme calibrator with a wide commutability for the most popular methods remains to be developed. This is the project of the IFCC Working Group on Calibrators in Clinical Enzymology (WG-CCE). Several experimental data are also presented that indicate that the temperature at which the reaction is carried out is not a limiting factor in the implementation of interassay calibration in clinical enzymology.

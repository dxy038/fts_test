Medical images edge detection is one of the most important pre-processing steps in medical image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, an edge detection algorithm using an uninorm-based fuzzy morphology is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is robust when it is applied to different types of noisy images. It improves the results of other well-known algorithms including classical algorithms of edge detection, as well as fuzzy-morphology based ones using the &#194;&#191;ukasiewicz t-norm and umbra approach. It detects detailed edge features and thin edges of medical images corrupted by impulse or gaussian noise. Moreover, some different objective measures have been used to evaluate the filtered results obtaining for our approach better values than for other approaches.

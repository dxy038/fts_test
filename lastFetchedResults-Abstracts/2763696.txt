For the undisputed degree of complexity that characterizes the port system, it certainly belongs to the category of systems of systems. In fact, the functioning of a port is made possible due to the interaction of a certain number of subsystems, which in turn depend on other subsystems. The goal of this paper is to model and simulate, by adopting the System Dynamics methodology, a subsystem of the port context: the rail port cycle. The model has been applied to some important container terminals located in Italy. &#8220;What-if&#8221; scenarios have been tested with the objective of underlining system bottlenecks.

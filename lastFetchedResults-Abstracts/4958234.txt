In this article, a model of service oriented market is presented. It gives a more equitable opportunity of integration in the business markets for the small and medium enterprises. Nevertheless, multi-site planning is a critical and difficult task due to the heterogeneity between planning applications of the various partners. For this objective, the proposed interoperable and distributed architecture SCEP-SOA for multi-site planning is based on SOA (service oriented architecture), integrating the concepts of the generic model of planning and scheduling SCEP (supervisor, customer, environment, and producer). This interoperable architecture enables an applicative interoperability as well as a semantic interoperability between different planning applications used by the partners.

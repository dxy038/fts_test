Background and Objective: Low glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) diet as a
therapeutics object to management of postprandial glycemia and hyperinsulinemia, reduces risk
of cardiovascular disease development in type II diabetic patients. Accordingly, this study
design to determine glycemic Index and glycemic load intake of type II diabetic patients and
their correlation with cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Material and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 65 (20 male and 45 female)
type II diabetic patients that referred to endocrinal glands and metabolism clinic of Sina hospital
in Tabriz, participated. Weight and height were measured and body mass index was calculated.
Fasting venous blood sample were obtained for measuring glucose, lipid profile and insulin
concentrations and Systolic- and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Nutritional intake was
determined using three day-24 hour diet recall. Dietary average GI and GL was also calculated.
Results: Mean of GI and GL were %59.0±3.5 and 112.5±79.6 g, respectively. Glycemic
index only showed positive correlation with glucose level (r =0.28, P<0.05) and systolic blood
pressure (r =0.26, P<0.05). Glycemic index correlated with Systolic blood pressure (r =0.29,
P<0.05) and glycemic load correlated with triglyceride concentration (r =0.39, P<0.05) in
women, respectively.
Conclusion: In this study, glycemic index correlate with glucose concentration and systolic
blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure and triglyceride concentration correlated with glycemic
index and glycemic load in women, respectively. So low GI and GL diet suggest to reduce
cardiovascular risk factors in these patients

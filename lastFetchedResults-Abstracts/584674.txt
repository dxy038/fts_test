Background and Objective: Intensive anaerobic exercise is a risk factor for children with sickle cell anemia. However, it remains unclear whether anaerobic or aerobic exercises have any effect on subjects with sickle cell trait. This study conducted to determine of the effect of aerobic exercise on O2 saturation in children with sickle cell trait. 
Subjects and Methods:  Eighty-two healthy and trait children (age 6-18) were allocated randomly in two groups: case (41) and control (41) in this study. Anthropometrics profile and hemoglobin concentration were measured. HbS hemoglobin recognized with HPLC. All children performed a cycle ergometer 2-min exercise and 3-min rest. Before and after exercise, O2 saturation was assessed with pulseoximetry.
Results: There was no significant difference between two groups for O2 saturation before and after exercise (P > 0.05). This parameter remained normal in children with sickle cell trait. 
Conclusion: It seems aerobic exercise is safe for children with sickle cell trait.

The paper presents the design and implementation of a self-paced and adaptive courseware, in short SAC. The main focus of SAC is to formulate a model that encompasses the important requirements of supporting an adaptive learning courseware environment. The paper begins by discussing the issues and design requirements of developing an interactive and adaptive learning system that is able to individualize a student learning style, with the ultimate objective of maximizing his learning experience and effectiveness. The system has been designed and implemented on a three-tier Web application architecture, which uses the AHAM (Adaptive Hypermedia Application Model) approach to structure the domain, user and teaching model for use by the adaptation engine

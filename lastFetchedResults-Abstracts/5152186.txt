The objective of this paper is to report on new developments in the project we are working on for the development of a mobile sensor based opportunistic urban pollution monitoring network. This work follows from the implementation of a single pollution sensor based sensing node prototype which was used for testing an opportunistic communications network and which was reported elsewhere. Here we concentrate on the extension of the basic sensing system and its modular conversion into a multi pollutant sensing system able to additionally provide temperature, humidity and geo-position information as well as on the software architecture developed around it in order to process the huge amounts of data the system produces. The different prototypes were tested on the public transportation system of the city of Vigo and on multiple test runs around the city of A Coru&#195;&#177;a in the north-west of Spain producing very promising results.

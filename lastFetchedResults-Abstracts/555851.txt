Abstract
Introduction: The (3-carbolines harmane, harmine and norharmane are the members of Harmala's alkaloids group (Peganum harmala, Zygophillaceae). The P-carboline alkaloids adjoined to benzodiazepine site of the y-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa). These alkaloids also inhibited cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities. These findings showed that the P-carbolines should be able to reduce writhing nociceptio induced by acetic acid- in mice. Objective: To assess the effects of acute treatment with harmane, norharmane and harmine on the writhing induced by acetic acid in mice.
Materials and Methods: The experiments were carried out on male BALB/C mice (20-25g). Intraperitoneal (I.p) injection of acetic acid (0.6%) was performed in order to cause writhing behavior. This behavior was recorded by direct observation for a 30-minutes period. Decrease of writhing count is indicative of an anti-no iception. In order to avoid the possibility of a physicochemical interaction between them, Drugs were administered on opposite sides of peritoned. Results: Intraperitoneal (I.p) injection of Harmane (5-20mg/kg) on 6-9 mice, norharmane (5-15mg/kg) on 8-9 mice and harmine (10-15mg/kg) on 8-9 mice in per group decreased the writhing behavior significantly (PO.OOOl, P<0.0003 and P<0.0016, respectively). The inhibitory effects of the mentioned drugs were antagonized by flumazenil (2 mg/kg) Conclusion: Effects of harmane, norharmane and harmine on writhing response may be mediated through an inverse agonistic mechanism located in the benzodiazepine receptors.

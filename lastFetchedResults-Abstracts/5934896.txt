Grid computing provides huge number of hardware and software resources. Semantic improves the quality of information about resources. For efficient discovery of Grid resources, it is not only necessary to have semantic representation of resources but also their usage policies, since the discovered resources are useless if they are unavailable to use. In this paper we propose a matchmaker for efficient discovery of Grid resources. It contains a semantic knowledge base, in the form of domain, functional and policy ontologies, of resources description. We use policy ontology to enforce user specified, resource usage policies. Semantically-rich policy representation can reduce policy conflicts, simplify policy analysis, reduce human error and facilitate interoperability. Moreover, we also develop a policy analyzer algorithm to enforce these policies in matchmaking process. Our objective is to make prior resource selection efforts more useful by providing maximum surety that the discovered resources are available to the user by analyzing their usage policies. A request subscription knowledge base is also maintained which is used to check the request and send notification later on, if resources are not available. This system will be evaluated using ProActive Grid Middleware.

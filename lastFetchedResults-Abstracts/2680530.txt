Background: Fetal electrocardiography is a developing field that provides valuable
information on the fetal health during pregnancy. By early diagnosis and treatment of
fetal heart problems, more survival chance is given to the infant.
Objective: Here, we extract fetal ECG from maternal abdominal recordings and
detect R-peaks in order to recognize fetal heart rate. On the next step, we find a better
and more qualified extracted fetal ECG by using a novel approach.
Materials and Methods: In this paper, a PCA/ICA-based algorithm is proposed
for extracting fetal ECG, and fetal R-peaks are detected as well. The method
validates the quality of extracted ECGs and selects the best candidate fetal ECG to
provide the required morphological ECG features such as fetal heart rate and RR interval
for more clinical examinations. The method was evaluated using the dataset which
was provided by PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013. The dataset
consists of 75 recordings of 4-channel ECGs each containing 1-minute length for training
and 100 similar recordings for testing.
Results: When the proposed algorithm was applied to the test set, the scores of
85.853 bpm2
 for fetal heart rate and an error of 9.725 ms RMS for fetal RR-interval
estimation were obtained.
Conclusion: The results obtained with the mentioned algorithm shows the robustness
of the research, and it is suggested to be used in practical fetal ECG monitoring
systems.

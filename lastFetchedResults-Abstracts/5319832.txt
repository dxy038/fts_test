An inventory decision model of multi-item maintenance materials is analyzed for a joint ordering problem. A unanimous ordering policy which reviews inventory continuously of multi-item is applied in the model. The aim of inventory control of maintenance materials is ensuring the service level and reducing the inventory cost. According to this objective, an algorithm is proposed. Firstly, supposed that ordering level and lead time are both zero, and then determine the order-up-to level according to the inventory cost. After that, ordering level of all kinds of maintenance materials is computed according to the fill rate. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the validity of the model and algorithm.

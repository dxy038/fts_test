Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of fetoscopic surgery in complicated monochorionic and dichorionic triplet pregnancies.
Study design
This was a case series of fetoscopic surgery in 12 cases of monochorionic (n = 5) or dichorionic (n = 7) triamniotic triplets complicated by severe feto-fetal transfusion (n = 8), twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (n = 3), or discordant for an anomaly (n = 1). Six underwent cord occlusion, and 6 had laser coagulation of the vascular anastomoses.
Results
All procedures were successfully completed, and the outcome was comparable to that reported for similar procedures in twins. Eighty-three percent of fetuses survived, and 13% had long-term problems.
Conclusion
Fetoscopic surgery may be considered as a therapeutic option in complicated triplet pregnancies, with results similar to those found in twins.

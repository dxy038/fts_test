A model for the bidirectional reflectance over soils is coupled into a vegetation model to predict the bidirectional reflectance of a semi-arid landscape. The vegetation model is a hybrid of geometric optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model for the bidirectional reflectance over discontinuous plant canopies. The coupling is done by extending the assumption of Lambertian background in the GORT model into a non-Lambertian soil background described by Hapke´s soil BRDF model. The model is validated with POLDER and AVHRR imagery collected in a semi-arid site during the Jornada PROVE´97 campaign with good accuracy. It is a very simple but analytical model for bidirectional reflectance over a semi-arid landscape and has the potential for surface parameter retrieval for the study of biosphere-atmosphere interaction

This paper presents a bidirectional DC-DC converter. The circuit topology of this converter is very simple. The pulse-width-modulation control strategy is used to control the active switches. Also, the synchronous rectifier technique is used to reduce the losses. The proposed converter has wide voltage conversion range than of the conventional bidirectional buck/boost converter. The operating principle and steady-state analysis are discussed. Finally, a simulation is done to illustrate the performance of the proposed converter.

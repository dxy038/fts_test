In this paper, we have carried out a detailed analysis of IEEE 802.16-2004 256-point FFT OFDM PHY layer and also simulated the important features of the PHY layer to have a better understanding of the standard. Our main objective is to analyze, evaluate and compare the performance of the PHY layer under various AMC (Adaptive modulation and coding) modes and channel conditions. The discussions based on the various results in the simulation are presented in this paper.

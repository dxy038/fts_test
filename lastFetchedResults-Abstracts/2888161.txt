Syntactic parsing deals with syntactic structure of a sentence. The word ´syntax´ refers to the grammatical arrangement of words in a sentence and their relationship with each other. The objective of syntactic analysis is to find syntactic structure of a sentence which is usually depicted as a tree. Identifying the syntactic structure is useful in determining the meaning of a sentence. Natural language processing is an arena of computer science and linguistics, concerned with the dealings amongst computers and human languages. It processes the data through lexical analysis, Syntax analysis, Semantic analysis, Discourse processing, Pragmatic analysis. This paper gives various parsing methods. The algorithm in this paper splits the English sentences into parts using POS tagger, It identifies the type of sentence (Facts, active, passive etc.) and then parses these sentences using grammar rules of Natural language. The algorithm has been tested on real sentences of English and it accomplished an accuracy of 81%.

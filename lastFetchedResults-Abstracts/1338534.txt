The objective of this study was to examine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acid supplementation on insulin sensitivity (SI) in horses. Twenty-one mares were blocked by age, body weight (BW), and body condition score (BCS) and randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments. Treatments consisted of (1) 38 g of n-3 fatty acids via fish and algae supplement and diet (MARINE), (2) 38 g of n-3 fatty acids via a flaxseed meal from the supplement and diet (FLAX), and (3) control (CON) no supplemental fatty acid. Treatments were supplemented for 90 days. Frequent sampling intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed on days 0, 30, 60, and 90. Blood samples were analyzed for glucose and insulin. The minimal model was applied for the glucose and insulin curves using MinMod Millennium. SI increased 39% (P < .007) across all treatment groups. Acute insulin response to glucose decreased 22% (P < .006) between days 30 and 60 and increased (P = .040) again at day 90. Disposition index (combined SI and β pancreatic response) increased (P = .03) by 53% in the MARINE- and 48% in the FLAX-supplemented horses and did not change with time in the CON group. In insulin-resistant mares, MARINE- and FLAX-treated horses had an increase in SI (P = .09). It would be interesting to test this supplement in a larger group of insulin-resistant horses. If proven effective, supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids would help to reduce problems associated with insulin resistance in horses.

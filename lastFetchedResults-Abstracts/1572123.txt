Prescribed burning of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) communities is conducted with the intention of increasing either the productivity of the understory plants or the big sagebrush. It was our objective to compare the recovery of big sagebrush communities from prescribed fire at as many sites as we could locate in south-western Montana with environmentally paired unburned portions. We located and sampled 13 sites that had been burned over a span of two to 32 growing seasons earlier. Big sagebrush canopy cover, density, and production of winter forage were significantly greater (P≤0·05) in the unburned portions in 34 of 38 comparisons. Canopy coverage of Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer), the dominant herbaceous species, was greater in the burned portion at only one site while it was less (P≤0·05) at four sites. Total perennial grass canopy coverage was not different (P≤0·05) between treatments over the 13 sites. Managers considering prescribed burning of big sagebrush communities should be aware that herbaceous plant responses may be minimal while shrub values will likely be lost for many years. The loss of the dominant shrubs in any ecosystem will affect many other organisms and severely impact species that have an obligate habit with the shrubs.

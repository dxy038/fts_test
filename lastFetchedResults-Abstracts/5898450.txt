We propose a traffic control approach that can reduce both traffic emissions and travel times based on model predictive control (MPC). We approximate the traffic flow and emission models into a linear parameter varying (LPV) form, which leads to an LPV-MPC control approach. We consider two objective functions and formulate them as convex functions, so that convex optimization methods can be used to generate the optimal control sequences of the LPV-MPC control approach. The resulting LPV-MPC solutions can next be used as a good initial point in the nonlinear-nonconvex optimization of the nonlinear original MPC problem.

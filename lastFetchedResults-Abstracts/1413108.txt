This paper proposes a new method for performing predefined simultaneous modification of natural frequencies and buckling loads of composite cylindrical panels. The method is based on the fact that both natural frequencies and buckling loads are eigenvalues of an algebraic system of simultaneous equations. First- and second-order derivatives of these eigenvalues are calculated and the first two terms in Taylor expansion are used for developing a modification procedure that is defined as an inverse eigenvalue problem. A four-layered composite cylindrical panel with an arbitrary angle-ply stacking sequence is considered as a case study and several simultaneous modifications for natural frequencies and buckling loads are carried out. It is shown that the proposed method can perform the predefined modification with an acceptable accuracy even for large perturbations in objective functions.

Objective
ntify factors associated with long-term outcome and to report possibly meaningful clinical features in a unicentric sample of adult urologic sarcomas.
als and methods
-five patients treated between 1992 and 2011 were studied. Except for 3 patients, surgery was the initial treatment. The median follow-up in the surviving (censored) patients was 11.3 years. Kaplan-Meier method and competing risk analysis were used to evaluate outcome. Disease recurrence, disease-specific mortality, and overall mortality were the study endpoints. Comparisons were made with the log rank and the Pepe-Mori tests. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify independent predictors of disease recurrence.
s
isease grade was significantly associated with all 3 study endpoints. The primary tumor site was significantly associated with disease-specific and recurrence-free survival but did not reach the significance level concerning overall survival. In the multivariate analysis, primary site and tumor grade were identified as predictors of disease recurrence. Whereas 10-year disease-specific survival was 100% in patients with low grade inguinoscrotal tumors, it was 0% in patients with high grade disease arising from other sites.
sions
ade and inguinoscrotal origin are factors associated with favorable outcome in urologic sarcomas. Repeat interventions to remove or to inactivate recurrent tumors or metastases seem to provide clinical benefit in individual cases.

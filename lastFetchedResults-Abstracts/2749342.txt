This study presents a control scheme for hybridised electric vehicles with an online power follower management strategy. The considered hybridisation is based on an active parallel topology composed of two bidirectional DC-DC converters, connecting NiMH batteries and SuperCapacitors. First, a control scheme of this hybridisation is deduced through a cascade of current and voltage linear controllers, complemented with the decoupling method. Thereafter, an energy management strategy based on a power follower is developed using an efficiency map of the hybridised feeding system. A reduced-scale prototype has been built to analyse the performance of the control scheme with an online power follower strategy under realistic driving cycles. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed control layer under an online rule-based management strategy.

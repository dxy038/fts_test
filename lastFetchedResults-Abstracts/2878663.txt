There are many advantages and disadvantages of using internet. In Thailand, the number of people who are using Internet has dramatically increased, meanwhile the number of threats that protected by many organizations also go up. One of the threats to youth generations is pornography that spreads very fast via cyberspace or internet. The Southeast Asian countries have had a vigorous debate over pornography in recent years, exposing deep divisions with the Muslim-majority nation [2]. Thailand is one of the countries be ranked of pornography and sexual behavior. Another threat in Thailand to the Muslim community especially in southern border provinces are in term of website contains seditious and annoying for the Muslim people especially to the youth generation. These problems are very significant to resolve for the objective of future youth to be safe. Many countries try to control these kinds of the issues, but the result has not been too effective. In this study, we propose a coordinate system model among Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) in Thailand as a regulator and law enforcer, National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC) and the Central Islamic Council of Thailand (CICOT) as the content advisor. The coordinate system model that we propose is to provide the system for filtering and detecting negative content over Internet to be more efficient in order to prevent people from negative content. Our objective is to protect the youth generation especially Muslim community by filtering and detecting websites which contain pornography and seditious elements. However, it is very difficult to coordinate with all these organizations because Thailand is non-Muslim country and we might face the challenges and we hope it will be successful.

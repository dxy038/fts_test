The least invasive method to image blood flow in vivo is Duplex or color Doppler (CD) ultrasound. Until now, color Doppler examinations carry only qualitative information. The information available in a color Doppler image is: (1) density of detectable vessels (reflected by the color pixel density) and (2) local flow velocity under assumption of a Doppler angle &#966;=0&#176;. To achieve an objective and reliable quantitation of these parameters and thereby describe the vascularisation we extended our tissue characterization system by a PC-based development which extracts and evaluates the information from the digitized CD image, adds this information to the knowledge base and finally combines it with the results of texture analysis

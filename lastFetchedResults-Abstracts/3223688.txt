Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) has become an indivisible part for communication for mobile devices. In this paper we have discussed some basic MANET routing protocols like Ad-hoc On Demand distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source routing (DSR), Optimized Link state Routing (OLSR), and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA). Main objective of this paper is to address some basic security concerns in MANET, operation of malicious node and its effect on these routing protocols.

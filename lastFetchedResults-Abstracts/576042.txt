Introduction & Objective: Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is the most common cause of epiphora in adults. Our purpose was the evaluation of efficacy and complications of NLD probing with adjunctive MMC in the treatment of partial NLDO in adults.
Materials & methods: This clinical trial study without control group (quazi experimental) was carried out in adult patients with symptom of epiphora. 40 patients (46 eyes) with partial obstruction of Nasolacrimal duct participated in this study. 6 patients had bilateral and 34 patients had unilateral epiphora. Each patient was followed for at least 6 months and visited 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the probing. 
Results: After 6 months follow up in 20 eyes (43.6%) Nasolacrimal duct was patent (confirmed with irrigation( and 21 patients (52.5%) were symptomatically satisfied. After 6 months follow up no complication was observed.
Conclusion: This study showed that probing and irrigation with mitomycin C (0.2 mg/ml) was a method with relatively high success rate and could be an appropriate alternative option for relieving partial obstruction of the Nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Its advantages include simplicity, low morbidity, operable without general anesthesia and with simple instruments.

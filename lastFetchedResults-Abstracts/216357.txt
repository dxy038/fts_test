Background/Objective: To determine the frequency of computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with mild head trauma. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted between September 2005 and April 2006, 708 patients with mild head trauma as defined by a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13–15, were underwent standard clinical examination and cranial CT. Results: The mean±SD age of our patients was 26.8±19.03 years (range: 1 month to 89 years). 489 (68.9%) patients were male and 219 (30.8%) were female. GSC was 13 in 1%, 14 in 4.6% and 15 in 94.4% of patients. The most common mechanism of trauma was car accident and falling down, each of which happened for 132 patients (18.6%). The most common findings on CT were subgaleal hematomas in 213(30%) and intracranial lesions were seen in 41 patients(5.8%) ;among them 37 were male. Among intracranial lesions,
the most common finding was epidural hematoma in 18 patients followed by hemorrhagic contusion in 13 patients. Intracranial lesions were observed in 28.6% of patients with GCS of 13; in 15.2% with GCS of 14 and in 5.1% with GCS of 15 (P=0.002). Conclusion: Many of patients with GCS equal to 15 after head trauma have considerable intracranial
lesions and minor focal neurologic signs revealed by careful physical examination could be a good marker of these lesions.

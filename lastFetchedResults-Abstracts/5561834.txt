Nowadays, Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO)is a common postoperative complication of cataract surgery. The rate of incidence and the intensity of PCO are affected by factors such as type and shape of implanted intraocular lens(IOL), cataract surgical techniques and etc. Clinical quantification of PCO is so subjective that evaluating the effects of these factors on PCO are varying among studies. The need for a reliable and efficient automated PCO quantification system is highly desired and many researchers tried to design such a system till now. In this paper a new fully automated Contourlet based PCO quantification system (CPCO) is presented. Comparing this system with other subjective and objective systems shows the reliability and correctness of CPCO system.

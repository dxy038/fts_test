In bolted joints, a large part of the load is transferred by friction. The objective of this investigation is to measure the coefficient of friction for carbon fiber epoxy matrix composite, HTA-6376, in contact with aluminum, 3637-77, in reciprocal sliding. During testing, the coefficient of friction increased initially with number of cycles and after reaching a maximum, slowly decreased. The initial coefficient of friction is approximately 0.23 and the peak coefficient of friction after wear in is approximately 0.68. The coefficient of friction is independent of normal load. During wear, cracks are formed at the fiberâ€“matrix interface, which causes the matrix layer on the original composite surface to break off in pieces. It also causes single fibers or groups of fibers to be broken off and removed from the surface. Pieces of carbon fiber caused depressions in the aluminum surface. The wear debris is reattached to the composite surface but not to the aluminum surface.

A new method is proposed to quantify the local
dislocation spacings on sections displaying the intersections
of dislocation lines. The method was applied to
dislocation structures in single crystals of CaF2 introduced
by deformation at elevated temperature and made visible
by etch pits. The method yields the frequency distributions
and the spatial distributions of dislocation spacings. For
cellular dislocation structures the method provides a
quantitative and objective characterization in terms of
frequency distribution of dislocation spacings in cell
boundaries and cell interiors and of cell size.

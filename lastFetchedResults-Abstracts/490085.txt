Background/ Objective: During past 30 years, low-level lasers have been widely used in medical fields. Low- level laser irradiation (LLLI) in red and near infrared region, locally or intravenously may result in vasodilatation, increased tissue perfusion and neovascularization. Here, we describe apatient with acute atheroembolism who treated with LLLI.
Case- Report: A 64-year old Iranian man was referred to our clinic with acute atheroembolism of distal phalanx index finger. There was no predisposing cardiovascular factor except for a mild hypercholesterolemia, and physical examination was generally normal. We used low-level laser therapy with infrared light, 980 nm/ 100 mW and red light, 650 nm/ 30 mW, associated with 3 sessions of intravenous red light laser, 630nm, 2 mW. After 12 sessions (about 30 days) ischemia disappeared and the finger was quite normal. On 12 months of follow-up, the patient was uneventful.
Conclusion: Delivery energy to the ischemia-induced necrotic area may have an important beneficial effect on patients with acute thromboembolism of fingers, preventing them from amputation or other invasive surgical interventions. However, additional studies and more clinical evidence are needed to demonstrate the various aspects of this application of lasers in medical practice.

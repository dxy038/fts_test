This paper aims at analyzing the mobility performance in heterogeneous 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. The main objective is to analyze the behavior of LTE macro/pico co-channel networks with different mobility parameters, such as the &#8220;Time-To-Trigger&#8221; (TTT). For this purpose, a system simulator has been utilized to assess the performance. The system must have different settings depending on the user velocity and on which cell-layer user is being serviced. Additionally, we have considered scenarios with a mixture of users moving freely or constrained to a hotspot, and different pico cell deployments.

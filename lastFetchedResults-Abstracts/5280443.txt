We report on our progress towards the development of a miniature cold atom frequency standard (MCAFS). The ultimate program objective is a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) with performance comparable to a bench top Cesium beam primary standard. We have addressed many of the critical hurdles of this project and demonstrated its feasibility with a compact and fully integrated prototype.

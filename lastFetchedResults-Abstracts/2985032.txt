The objective of this study was to determine, quantitatively, if local changes in wavefront propagation direction (PD) during atrial activation are higher at locations of high gradient of repolarization time (RT). Curl of PD was used to measure these local changes. Results from experiments and simulations were analyzed. Curl of PD was significantly higher at areas of high RT and RT gradient during simulations but significance was not detected in experiments

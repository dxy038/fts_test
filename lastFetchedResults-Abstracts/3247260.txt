Impregnated thermionic cathodes production was the main objective of this work. The W-30wt.%Cu composite was sintered by induction heating (1200&#176;C). The porous matrix was obtained after decopperization (1600&#176;C). High purity Ba-Ca aluminate was impregnated (1630&#176;C). The amount of aluminate impregnated was 18.32wt.%. Microstructure, porosity, and particle sizes distribution were determined.

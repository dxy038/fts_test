This paper proposes a suite of customer centric quantitative analysis method aiming at evaluating service performance in new generation telecommunication service system. Firstly, bidirectional modelling approach is put forward to define the extracting process of information parameters related to service quality and hierarchical service quality evaluation model is established. Secondly, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) combined with other different judging arithmetic is introduced to perform the mapping of information parameters among sub-layers, thereby the accuracy and validity of evaluation indicators is improved as well as an integrated analysis and assessment of customer centric service quality is achieved. Finally, FTP service over UMTS network performance simulation is examined and the evaluation of FTP service quality is accomplished. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is rational and valid.

A common objective in simulation is enhanced understanding of a system; an opened model which can be storage, retrieval, sharing, and invocation in a distributed environment and among Web-based component applications is essential for this objective. As the development of Internet and WWW, the actions in the WWW are not only the human-machine interaction, but also Semantic Web-based machine -machine interaction, so a well-formed model needs opened and extensible interfaces, In the future, there will be large amount of models in the Web-based simulation, it is very simple that one problem mapped to a few solutions. This paper discusses a standard specification and an extensible interfaces of a model of simulation events and their triggers in Web-based discrete event simulation called TEA-XML (Triggers and Events Association XML); In conclusion, the compare of diagnose results of our model with other static models have been given, it is argued that the TEA-XML will be a part of foundation of the analysis of discrete-event simulation models in the Web environment.

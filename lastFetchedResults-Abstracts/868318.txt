This paper addresses the problem of partitioning and transporting a shipment of known size through an n-node public transportation network with known scheduled departure and arrival times and expected available capacities for each departure. The objective is to minimize the makespan of shipping. The problem while practical in its scope, has received very little attention in the literature perhaps because of the concentration of research in vehicle routing without regard to partitioning and partitioning without regard to routing. A general non-linear programming model is developed. The model is then converted into a linear model through the Routing First and Assignment Second approach. This approach is different from the general decomposition approaches since they normally do not guarantee optimality. However, the linear model still involves a large number of constraints, and solution is not attempted here. Instead, three heuristics are proposed for solving the problem. Two of the heuristics use iterative techniques to evaluate all possible paths. The third heuristic uses a max-flows approach based upon aggregated capacities to reduce the size of the network presented to the other heuristics. This allows for a good starting point for other heuristics, and may impact the total computational effort. We find that the heuristics developed perform well because in the case of networks that are not congested, they find the optimal solution.

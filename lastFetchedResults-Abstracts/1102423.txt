The Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM) on ASTROSAT is a position-sensitive gas-filled proportional counter with a wide field of view. The scientific objective of SSM is to scan the sky within few hours to detect and locate transient X-ray sources in the outburst phase. Once detected, this information will be provided for studies in all energy bands. The energy range of operation of SSM is 2â€“10 keV. The optimisation of the parameters of the proportional counter such as the cell size, the gas mixture and the gas pressure for the SSM are discussed here.

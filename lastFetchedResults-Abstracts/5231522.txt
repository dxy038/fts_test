Improving the efficiency of distribution in emergency logistics research, which would decrease disaster damage in the other side. A new composite weighted multi- objective optimal approach for distributing commodities was constructed in this paper, which feature in including penalty function in objective functions, as well as time and cost during the transshipment in urgent relief distribution centers were considered in constraints. Then, a simulation experiment analysis about a disaster such as earthquake occurred in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, was illustrated to indicate that the new model can be used by decision maker during an actually disaster relief efficiently.

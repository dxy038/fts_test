Objective
ntify clinical and neurocognitive predictors of long-term functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder
s
l of 32 subjects who met criteria for bipolar I or II disorder were recruited from the Barcelona Bipolar Disorder Program and were assessed clinically and neuropsychologically at baseline. After an average 4-year follow-up, they were interviewed with the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) to assess functional outcome. Multivariate analyses were applied to identify clinical and neurocognitive predictors of functional outcome.
s
in regression model for predictors of overall psychosocial functioning identified subclinical depressive symptoms (ß = 0.516, t = 3.51, p = 0.002), and free delayed recall in a verbal memory task (ß = − 0.314, t = − 2.144, p = 0.041), accounting for 36% of the variance. Specific predictors of occupational functioning were, again, subthreshold depression (ß = 0.435, t = 2.8, p = 0.009) and a measure of executive function, digits backwards (ß = − 0.347, t = − 2.23, p = 0.034). This model explained around 28% of the variance (corrected R2 = 0.28; F = 6.38, gl = 2, p = 0.004).
sions
ressive symptomatology together with neurocognitive impairments related to verbal memory and executive functions are predictor variables of long-term functional outcome in bipolar disorder.

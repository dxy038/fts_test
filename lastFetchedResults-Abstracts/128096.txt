Introduction: Green salt (known as Dalar by Local people) is one of the favorable traditional flavors in Northern provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran. It is made of native plants (water grasses), which commonly grow at the edge or in water resources particularly the ones providing suitable conditions for Fasciola parasite. The consumption of green salt may cause Fascioliasis.
Objective: This Study was Conducted to determine the Possibility of Fasciola Transfer From Consumption of green Salt in animals.
Materials and Methods: The Fasciola life cycle was established in two aquariums by simulating field conditions such as light, pH and heat followed by growing in them two native water grasses known as Khalvash and Chochagh by Local people. To do this the snail Golba truncatula was first adapted to aquariums conditions and then the Fasciola hepatica eggs were introduced to one of them. Green salts were prepared from plants grown in both Metacecaria-infested and Metacercaria-free aquariums and were force fed to two groups of rabbits. Besides, Metacercaria-infested green salt was treated with vinegar and was force-fed to another group of rabbits. A group was also left as control. The rabbit's feces were examined for Fasciola eggs with modified methods of Kato and Telman. The sera from all groups were checked by CCIE and the billiary ducts of rabbits were searched for adult worms.
Results: All the rabbits fed with plants grown in Metacercaria -infested aquarium turned positive by all the deployed methods including examination of feces for Fasciola eggs, CCIE and examination of billiary ducts for adult worms while the ones fed with plants grown in Metacecaria-free aquarium were negative. The group fed with vinegar-treated green salt was also negative.
Conclusion: The non-treated green salt contaminated with Fasciola Metacecercaria can cause Fascioliasis, while treating it with vinegar can prevent the infection.

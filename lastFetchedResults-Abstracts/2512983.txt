<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Seeking for fertility after previous vasectomy is increasing. Vasectomy may break the blood testis barrier and in this way the level of antisperm antibody increases. It is suggested that increase in antisperm antibody decreases spontaneous pregnancy even after successful vasovasostomy. In this study we evaluated antisperm antibody formation 3 months after vasectomy.<br /><strong>Method:</strong> This study was performed on 80 healthy men requesting vasectomy from eurology ward of Imam Khomeini hospital. Blood antisperm antibody was checked at the time of vasectomy and 3 months later, when they came to assure vasectomy results, using Kibrick and sensitized RBCs.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Only 2 patients had antisperm antibody before surgery. Three months after vasectomy 56.49% of the patients had antisperm antibody in Kibrick Method, and 53.56% of them had antisperm antibody in sensitized RBCs.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Vasectomy increases antisperm antibody level. We suggest evaluation of antisperm antibody before vasovasostomy to estimate the risk of infertility after successful procedure.</p>

Objective
Cranial capacity, brain weight and cerebral index are important measurements in the study of racial differences. Clinically, an analysis of cranial capacity and weight exposes another aspect of growth and development and permits critical evaluation of unusually large, small, or misshapen crania.
Subjects and methods
Brain weight and cerebral index were estimated in 772 normal 18–22-year-old (320 males, 452 females) Iranian people of different socioeconomic groups, using linear dimensions of the head (using Lee–Pearson's formula) measured with spreading caliper and auricular head spanner.
Results
Cranial capacity, brain weight and cerebral index in males were 1343.45 ± 102.37 cm3 (mean ± S.D.), 1390.47 ± 105.95 g, and 2.17 ± 0.27% respectively. Cranial capacity, brain weight and cerebral index in females were 1163.02 ± 115.76 cm3, 1203.73 ± 119.81 g, and 2.25 ± 0.31% respectively.
Conclusion
It was shown that neurocranial volume and weight of male is higher than female. Also, the results are different from previous studies in Western countries which may be a result of racial, topodemic, and socioeconomic variations. Finally, we propose the new “cerebral quotient” for anthropometric measurements.

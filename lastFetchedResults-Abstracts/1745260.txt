Background and Objective: Researchers have pointed out that higher rate of female athlete lower extremity injuries are related to functional imbalances in hamstring and quadriceps muscles and suggest the use of training protocols in order to gain adequate functional muscle patterns. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of neuromuscular, strength and combined trainings on H/Q strength ratio in professional female basketbalists.
Materials and Methods: The subjects were 42 female basketbalists in 3 experimental groups and 1 control group with mean age, height and weight of 20.73±1.88 year, 172.47±6.57 cm and 63.54±4.98 kg, and BMI of 21.36±1.17 who completed 6 weeks of neuromuscular, strength and combined trainings. Functional hamstring to quadriceps muscle strength ratio was measured prior to and after training by Isokinetic Biodex Dynamometer 4, at 3 angular velocities 60,180,240?.s-1. Repeated measurement, Anova, Independent sample T test and Tukey post hoc test were used to analyze the data.
Results: Statistical analysis of data revealed that there was a significant difference in Functional H/Q Ratio in strength training group at 3 angular velocities in pre and post training. Differences between the strength training groups and the control group were meaningful.
Conclusion: Prescription of lower extremity strength trainings in injury prevention training programs can cause improvement in functional strength ratio and may lead to reduce lower extremity injury risks.

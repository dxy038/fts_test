Objective

Different medical and rehabilitation interventions have been used for treatment of cerebral palsy (CP). In addition to conventional methods, complementary medicine such as homeopathy has been used in treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. This study has been done to determine what effect homeopathic treatment would have on motor development (MD) of children with spastic CP, when added to rehabilitation normally used for such children.

Materials & Methods

This 2004 study was a double blind clinical trial, conducted on twentyfour subjects recruited from a developmental disorders clinic in Tehran. Using the minimization technique, subjects were divided to the case and control groups. Routine rehabilitation techniques were carried out for 4 months on both groups. In addition the cases were given homeopathy drugs, while the controls received placebos. Levels of gross and fine motor development were assessed with the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (DDST II). Data was collected by assessment forms, direct observations and examinations. Dependant variables in the two groups were compared at the beginning and at the end of the study.

Results

The average ages of the case and control groups were 28 and 28.4 months respectively. Gross and fine motor development and motor developmental quotient in the case group, compared to the controls showed no statistically significant differences.

Conclusion

Based on the results of this study adding homeopathy to rehabilitation had no significant effect on motor development of CP children. Considering the documented effects of homeopathy on the physical status of children with CP it would be better not to reject the possibility of effects of homeopathy on motor development of children with CP. As homeopathy is young in Iran, it is recommended to conduct further more extensive research on the effects of homeopathy on neurodevelopmental diseases.

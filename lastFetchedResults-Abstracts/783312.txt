Speaker recognition systems have high dimensional audio features which most of them
are irrelevant and redundant. So far, many approaches have been proposed to reduce
the size of these features which most of them are based on the system training and
evaluating the performance of each feature subset. In this paper, a hybrid semi-wrapper
method is proposed to select the audio features in speaker recognition systems. The
objective of this algorithm is to increase the accuracy of the speaker recognition system
using supported vector machine (SVM) as a classifier. In the first step, genetic and ant
colony algorithms were used to select the optimal subset of features. Then, the proposed
technique was presented for selecting spectral features. SVM classifier was used to
achieve better accuracy in recognition of real speaker. This algorithm was evaluated
based on the error rate. The results showed that the number of selected features, time
complexity and error rate of the proposed method are less than other methods.

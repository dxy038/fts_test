The multi-objective TT&amp;C (Tracking, Telemetry and Command) mission planning technique is studied based on the background of both ground-based and space-based TT&amp;C mission to the OOS (On-Orbit Service) type of &#8220;one-station to multi-objective&#8221;. Firstly, the characteristics and constraint condition of OOS TT&amp;C mission are analyzed. Secondly, the space-based and ground-based TT&amp;C mission planning models are established. Finally, using typical OOS mission as an example, the method of TT&amp;C resource planning is simulated for ground-based multi-objective and ISL (InterSatellite Link). The optimized design of TT&amp;C events, optimization scheduling of TT&amp;C resources and automatic implementation strategies of TT&amp;C operations are included to the TT&amp;C mission in this paper. The research results show that the ground-based TT&amp;C resource can be saved by using of space-based TT&amp;C resource. The technical reference can be provided for the implementation of future spacecraft OOS by the research results.

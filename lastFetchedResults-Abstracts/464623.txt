OBJECTIVE: The levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were measured in the peritoneal fluid of 15 patients with endometriosis to characterize the type of immune response that occurs at the site of endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN: Cytokine levels in peritoneal fluid obtained during laparoscopy from 15 patients and 12 controls undergoing tubal ligation were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean levels of interleukin-6 in patients with endometriosis and controls were 797 ± 407 pg/ml and 133 ± 38 pg/ml, respectively ( p< 0.02). Similarly, the mean concentration of interleukin-10 in peritoneal fluids of patients with endometriosis was significantly higher than that of controls (241 ± 38 vs 128 ± 21, p< 0.05). The levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were not significantly different between the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 are increased in the peritoneal fluids of patients with endometriosis, suggesting enhanced macrophage activity in these patients. Increased interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 production may partially contribute to the disturbed immune regulation observed in patients with endometriosis. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:1522-6.)

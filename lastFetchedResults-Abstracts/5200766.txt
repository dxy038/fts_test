The optimization of the biped walking trajectory is treated so that it can be used as a reference trajectory for control. The biped is modeled as a kinetic chain of 13 links connected by 12 joints. The inverse kinematics of the biped is derived for the specified positions of the body and feet. The objective is to optimize the location of the zero moment point (ZMP), which is the virtual total ground reaction point. Specifically, the authors minimize the deviation between the ZMP and the center of shape of the supporting area by treating the position of the body as free variables. A simulation of an optimal biped trajectory is presented to illustrate the proposed approach

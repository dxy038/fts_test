Complex scheduling problem is very difficult to solve. In this paper, an objective decomposing method based on IBMDC (intelligent method based on multilevel, decomposing, and coordination) for solving complex scheduling problem is proposed. Many other methods are powerless when the scale of complex scheduling problem is large. Decomposing global objective into local objectives is an effective way to reduce the problem scale. We use the rules extracted by neural networks to decompose due-date reasonably so as to minimize the weighted tardiness. The numerical simulations show that this method has a good performance.

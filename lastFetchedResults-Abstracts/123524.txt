Background: In our country more than 40% of mortality and morbidity is because of circulatory diseases and the prevalence of coronary artery diseases is high in Isfahan Objective: To determine the prevalence of CVD risk factors.
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in two provinces of Isfahan (case of intervention) and Markazi (control) in 2000 - 2001. In Isfahan province, Isfahan and Najaf-Abad were selected and in Markazi province Arak was selected. 2 groups of 6300 (12600 people totally) over 19 years were determined as a sample group in each province according to the age, sex, urban and rural distribution areas. Serum lipids including total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and fasting blood sugar also 2 hours post load plasma glucose sugar of them were measured. Their blood pressure was determined by the standard method of WHO. Their weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were measured with light and thin clothes.
Findings: The results showed that 34.3 % and 32.2% of people in Isfahan & Markazi had got at least one risk factor respectively and 19.3% and 15% had got at least two risk factors. High LDL-C was the most prevalent risk factor in all groups. Also high LDL-C, hypercholestrolemia, hypertension in women, and hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C and smoking were more prevalent in men respectively (P<0.05).
Conclusion: According to the results the prevalence of risk factor is high in two studied communities. So the importance of performing an interventional program seems necessary. As these two provinces of case and control have had a slight difference so the changes would be considered after performing interventions.

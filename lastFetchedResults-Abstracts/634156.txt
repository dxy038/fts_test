Alligators inhabiting the Florida Everglades contain elevated levels of mercury within their tissues due to accumulation of mercury in the sediments. The objective of this study was to determine the mercury bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in the alligators based on mercury concentrations in the alligator tissues and mercury levels in the water column. Data from studies on mercury concentrations in the Everglades alligator tissues and water quality were used to determine the mercury bioconcentration factors. The BCFs for juvenile and adult alligators were found to be very high, with liver and kidney BCFs of 39.9×107 and 32.9×107, respectively, for adult alligators and 10.5×107 and 9.34×107 for juveniles. Adults within 7–14 years of age, living under the same conditions as juveniles who are less than 4 years of age, contain approximately 70% more mercury in their livers and kidneys and 50% more mercury in their muscle tissues.

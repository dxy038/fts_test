The objective was to understand how illegal drug users monitored at a psychosocial care center for alcohol and drug users perceive and experience their human rights. The data were collected through semistructured interviews with 17 users and analyzed through content analysis. The results demonstrated the difficulty the users perceive to express what their human rights are, as if rights were something extraneous to their own life, particularly in function of the prejudice and stigma related to illegal drugs use in Brazil.

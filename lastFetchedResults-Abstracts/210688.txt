Introduction: Oral mucositis is a common morbid condition which is associated with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy for which there is no standard treatment or prophylactic method. According to past studies the use
of low level laser therapy (LLLT) can reduce the severity of mucositis and xerostomia in such conditions, both as
treatment and a prophylactic factor.
Material and Method: Thirty nine patients with head and neck cancer who were being treated with radiotherapy
in Cancer Insittiue of Iran enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to LLLT and placebo treatment
starting on the I" day of radiotherapy through the whole period of their treatment. Objective assessment of the
degree of mucositis and xerostomia was recorded every other day by a physician blinded to the type of treatment.
Results: All 39 patients developed degrees of mucositis during their course of radiotherapy. The patient in
placebo groups had experienced sever mucositis (grade III and IV) more than LLLT treatment group significantly
(p~O.04) (75.6% v.s. 57.1%). The median of incidence time of sever mucositis in LLLT group 21 days after
beginning of radiotherapy in which it is 16 days in placebo group. There was no significant difference between
LLLT and placebo group .according to xerostomia.
Conclusion: LLLT is capable of reducing the severity and duration of oral mucositis associated with radiation
therapy. However for detection of LLLT efficacy on xerostomia, it is necessary long time follow-up.

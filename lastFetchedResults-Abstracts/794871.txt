Considering a constrained fractional programming problem, within the present paper we present some necessary and sufficient conditions, which ensure that the optimal objective value of the considered problem is greater than or equal to a given real constant. The desired results are obtained using the Fenchelâ€“Lagrange duality approach applied to an optimization problem with convex or difference of convex (DC) objective functions and finitely many convex constraints. These are obtained from the initial fractional programming problem using an idea due to Dinkelbach. We also show that our general results encompass as special cases some recently obtained Farkas-type results.

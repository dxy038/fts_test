Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important health issues in developing countries.  Understanding the epidemiology of tuberculosis is critical for effective disease control. The global burden of tuberculosis, risk factors for transmission, and the epidemiology of tuberculosis will be reviewed in this article.
Materials and Method: We used Scopus, Embase, PubMed, World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific Iranian journals from 2000 to 2011; and the last reports from Iranian ministry of health, for extracting data. Key words such as tuberculosis, epidemiology, Iran and Sistan- Balouchestan were used.
Results: Descending trend of TB incidence was observed over the last 45 years in Iran. Pulmonary TB is the most prevalent kind of TB in Iran in which 53% were sputum smear positive. Extra-pulmonary TB consists 28% of TB patients. Sistan-Balouchestan and Golestan had the highest incidence and prevalence of TB among all provinces in Iran. According to the latest data from Iranian ministry of health, the incidence of TB in Zabol and Zahedan were reported 109.7 and 36.6 per 100000 populations, respectively.  
Conclusion: More than 80% of TB patients still belong to developing countries. Sistan-Balouchestan and Golestan had the highest incidence of TB and for achieving the goals of WHO, control and prevention of the disease should be followed seriously [ZJRMS, 2012; 13(9): 1-7].

The richness of phenomenological studies provides an oppprtunity for entrepreneurial researchers to start developing high content theories. The concept of epoche is the basis of phenomenological research. Epoche is increasingly advanced in qualitative research but it seems that it is frequently used as a surface or vague method. Epoche as a method is usually used in qualitative research to reduce the potentially harmful effects of defaults that may lead to invalid research process. The most important issue that we should be paid attention to it is how to design phenomenological research. The purpose of this article is to focus on epoche concept, its nature and its performance in qualitative research. To reach this objective, first, we have reviewed epoche concept and then we studied the style of epoche strategy in terms of its design and operation in two separate sections in details. Finally, as the researcher should design the style of epoche and no specified standard is available in this regard, we present a case study using epoche in designing phenomenological research for informing interested persons. It is expected the readers will understand the epoche concept, the method of its use in entrepreneurship phenomenological research and also the practical style of its implementation.

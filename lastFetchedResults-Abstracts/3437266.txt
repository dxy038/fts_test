The problems associated with optimization of the test application timing for a class of test equipment are identified. Two approaches to test application timing are introduced. The notion of slack is used to define the objective function for optimization. The optimization problem is shown to be NP-complete even for nonreconvergent-fanout circuits. Heuristics for the optimization problems are presented, and the results are compared with bounds on test circuits

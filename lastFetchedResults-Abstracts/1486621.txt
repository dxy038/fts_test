Cigarillos (aka little cigars) have been increasing in popularity unlike cigarettes; but relatively little is known about the toxicology of the mainstream smoke (MSS) from such products. Therefore, the objective of this work was to compare the toxicological properties of the MSS (Health Canada Intensive smoking conditions) from a range of cigarillo products with the toxicological properties of MSS of cigarettes. Three in vitro assays were used to evaluate the toxicities of the MSS total particulate matter (TPM): (1) mutagenicity using Ames assay with Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100 with S9 metabolic activation (+S9); (2) cytotoxicity using the Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay with CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells; and (3) genotoxicity using the micronucleus assay with CHO cells and short-term exposures (3-h Â± S9). The Ames assay (TA100 + S9) and the NRU assay were also applied to the gas/vapour phase of the MSS that passed through the Cambridge pad. On a per-milligram-nicotine basis, the preferred way of comparing toxicities of different types of tobacco products, the MSS from cigarillos was not less toxic, and in some cases more toxic (TPM fraction TA98 + S9, NRU), than the MSS from cigarettes. Thus, our findings support our prior work on smoke mutagenicity that showed MSS from cigarillos was not less toxic than MSS from cigarettes.

Context and objective: Restorative justice tries to manage shareholders
of criminal phenomenon and with improving the efficiency of the criminal
justice system seeks to redress and repair the damages caused by crime
and involvement of people, local communities, criminals and victims in a
collaborate environment.
In this paper, the credibility and status of restorative justice in the legalsocial
system in Iran and Canada are discussed.
Methodology: Present paper is attributive and used library-based resources.
Findings: Restorative justice has different principles and is executed in the
form of several methods such as mediation, family group conferencing and
victim- offender circles. Today, because of the ability of restorative justice,
many countries implement it. Iran still does not have much influence on the
discourse of restorative justice in the legal system and still certain models of
the classic criminal justice rules on it, which in several respects cannot permit
intervention of local communities and victims of crimes and gives prevailed
power to the judiciary system as the main authority. Canada is among leading
countries that institutionalized this discourse in its legal system, and uses
reconciliative procedure for many crimes.
Results: The present study shows the existence of a systematic practice of
restorative justice in the criminal policy of Canada and its apparent interaction
approach to criminal policy in Iran.

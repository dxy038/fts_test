In pervasive computing environments, context- aware applications provide services for people by using personal information. People also make privacy decision about personal information disclosure as privacy concerns. Privacy decision depends on people´s interaction situation. The trust of information collector and personal information sensitivity often enable people to make uncertain privacy decision. Therefore, we construct a fuzzy objective information system that consists of personal interaction situation history. The privacy disclosure policies are extracted from this information system under using rough set theory. The context-aware applications are assigned to an adequate privacy role with the privacy disclosure policies and situation of people´s interaction. Finally, we provide a working example and the initial performance evaluation.

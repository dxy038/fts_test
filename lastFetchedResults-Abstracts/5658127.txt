In planning and designing a large optical transport network, operators are faced with a complex optimization problem that needs to take into account the mix of legacy and new services, new technologies and network transition constraints, while satisfying high network flexibility and scalability. In this paper, we approach the answers to these difficult questions through a pragmatic methodology. We propose a flexible reference network architecture and develop an economic study using a realistic service mix, cost models, and traffic growth over a period of five years. The objective is to plan, design and optimize a Next Generation Optical Transport Network, which meets scalability and flexibility requirements while maintaining lower infrastructure and operational costs.

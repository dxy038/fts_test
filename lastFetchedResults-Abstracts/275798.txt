The objective of this study was an investigation of the material properties of the fresh pig kidney and parametric characterization of its elastic and inelastic material behavior. The material investigation included density measurements, uniaxial as well as three-dimensional compression tests, tensile tests, and shear tests on the samples extracted from the fresh pig kidney. For comparison, density measurements on a number of soft synthetic materials were also performed. Compression tests on the radial and the tangential specimens from the cortex tissue were performed at various loading rates. Three-axial compression tests were performed on the cortex tissues placed in a compression chamber. Shear tests were performed by punching a cylinder into a slice of the cortex. Tensile tests were carried out on the outer capsule. For characterization of the material behavior, a non-linear theoretical simulation based on a two parameter Blatz model was used. For characterization of the time-dependent behavior of the pig kidney cortex, a four-parameter linear viscoelastic model was employed. From the present experimental and theoretical studies, a number of conclusions were derived:

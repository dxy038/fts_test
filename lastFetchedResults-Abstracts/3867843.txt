The support of broadband multimedia applications over an enterprise network poses a broad range of networking challenges for efficient resource management, intelligent switching, and access control for distributed information. We propose two server-based scheduling algorithms, with low computational complexity, to guarantee multimedia information synchronization at the destination, with minimum presentation delays and buffer requirements. We outline a communication framework, highlighting the issues and challenges faced by todayÂ´s enterprise networks to support multimedia services. We describe the proposed connection establishment and resource allocation schemes in resource-constrained enterprise networks. The objective is to manage the limited resources of the network for maximum utilization. Towards this end we present a dynamic capacity allocation scheme to support connections for multiple users. Specifically, we show that the channel capacity allocation problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming problem. This allocation scheme is implemented at each intermediate switch to dynamically determine the capacity allocation. The effects of interswitch rate mismatch and network delay offset scheduling have also been incorporated in the management framework. In addition, we introduce the concept of route selection based on the requested network quality of service

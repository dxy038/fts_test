A new bidirectional switch and snubber circuit are proposed for medium-voltage AC/AC converters. The proposed switch can be constructed using 2-in-1 insulated-gate bipolar transistor and 2-in-1 diode modules, and can reduce the voltage stress of the switching device by series connection. The proposed snubber configuration is very simple and can regenerate absorbed energy. On the other hand, timing errors in the switching between the series-connected switches cause a voltage imbalance in the snubber circuit. Therefore, a simple method is proposed for reducing the voltage imbalance that uses one voltage sensor for each switch circuit. This proposed method controls the snubber voltages by adjusting the switch timings. Furthermore, application of the proposed switch circuit to a matrix converter is discussed and is confirmed by experiment.

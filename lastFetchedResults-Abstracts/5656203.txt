This work presents an optimization approach for the broadcast operation in MANETs based on the DFCN protocol. Such approach involves a multi-objective optimization that has been tackled through the cooperation of a team of evolutionary algorithms. The proposed optimization model is a hybrid algorithm that combines a parallel island-based scheme with a hyperheuristic approach. The model includes an adaptive property to dynamically change the algorithms being executed on each island. More computational resources are granted to the most suitable algorithms.The computational results obtained for a highway MANETs instance demonstrate the validity of the proposed model.

Linked Open Data provides a distributed model for the semantic web to create knowledge by publishing public available data and meaningfully interlinking dispersed data sources. It is undeniable that the realization of this goal depends strongly on the quality of the published data. Since, data quality is a multi-dimensional concept which is defined by a number of quality factors, in order to study data quality in depth; it is necessary to study each quality factor separately as well as the properties of its environment. The main objective of this work is to propose a set of metrics that enable the assessment of the accuracy of data sets from both semantic and syntactic accuracy viewpoints.

A compact coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed slot antenna developed for ultra wideband (UWB) applications with notched band ranging from 5.1 GHz to 5.9 GHz is presented. By inserting a rectangular slot in the ground plane a notching in the particular band can be achieved. The characteristics of the designed structure are investigated by using MoM based electromagnetic solver, IE3D. The overall dimension of the antenna is around 28 &#195;&#151; 21 &#195;&#151; 1.6 mm<sup>3</sup>. The proposed antennas are fabricated using FR4 substrate. The return loss and VSWR of the developed antenna are measured and compared with the simulated results. The measured parameters are in good agreement with simulation results and the antenna offers excellent performance for UWB system ranging from 3.3 GHz to 11.5 GHz with band notching from 5.1 GHz to 5.9 GHz. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional pattern in the E plane and omni directional radiation pattern in the H plane and relatively stable. This antenna configuration would be quiet useful for UWB indoor applications with no interferences from IEEE 802.11a and HIPERLAN/2 systems when they coexist.

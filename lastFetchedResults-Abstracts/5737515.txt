The weapon identification and selection issue is an important and strategic component and has a significant impact on the efficiency of defense system in US. The main purpose of this research is to develop a universal model and system to effectively assess, evaluate and identify the optimal weapons from a large collection of available weapon systems that have multiple criteria based on a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM) model. A simple but effective weight estimation method is adopted in this paper to make this selection more objective and reliable. There are some different weight estimation methods reported by researchers, however, most methods need a lot of mathematical operations and make the process very time consuming and even more complicated. In this paper, we utilized a weight estimation method based on the paired comparison matrix to simplify this estimation process. The evaluation and selection process can be significantly simplified and improved by using this method.

The objective of this paper is to present a broad scope of the current status and the challenges to be faced by Mexico around the satellite networks industry (SNI), the telecommunications industry (TI) deregulation process and the new emerging broadband internetworking technologies (BBINT) penetration. The recent launch of e-government initiative called e-Mexico and specially related to the nation wide deployment of e-kiosks for social and educational services through a satellite system has created an important milestone and a positive impact on the growth rate over the rest of broadband networks and services offered around the country. A tele-density analysis, plus a fixed, mobile and major local satellite players positioning and their user penetration services are discussed here versus Mexican market conditions and technology infrastructure trends.

This work addresses the model reference tracking control problem. It aims to highlight the encoutered difficulties and the proposed solutions to achieve the tracking objective for nonlinear systems described by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) models. Different control strategies are exposed. Exact state tracking is proposed and structural conditions for it are given. Approximate state tracking is also studied. The choice of the reference model to be tracked is discussed, as well as the criterion to be minimized to achieve given tracking objectives.

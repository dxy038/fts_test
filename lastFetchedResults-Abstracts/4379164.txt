Near-field scanning is often used to solve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems. Aside from the purpose of visualization of near fields, measured near-field data can be used to estimate radiated fields. One of many challenges associated with using near-field to far-field transform technique for EMC application is the handling of attached cables. The objective of this investigation is to evaluate different methods to add cable information to the near-field data for radiated-field estimation. The investigation is carried out using numerical experiments in EMCoS EMC Studio, which is a commercial software tool for EM simulation providing method-of-moments solver. Measurement results from a specially designed test structure are presented to validate the simulation results.

Background: Cellulite is a common disease whose exact mechanism
is unknown. This study was aimed to assess the safety and
efficacy of an anti-cellulite preparation compared with placebo
in a randomized double-blind, right-left comparison clinical trial.
Methods: Twelve healthy women aged 22 to 58 years with mild
to moderate cellulite on their thighs and buttocks participated in
this trial. The anti-cellulite preparation (Three O cream, Pouya
Varzan Tejarat Sepahan Co., Iran) and an identical placebo were
randomly applied on the right or left thigh and buttock twice
a day for 2 months. The mentioned areas were photographed
and the circumference, subcutaneous fat thickness, and dermis
density and thickness were measured before and after treatment.
A satisfaction questionnaire was completed by all volunteers to
assess their satisfaction with the efficacy of treatment on each side.
Results: There was no significant difference between active and
placebo treatment sides in any of measurements. About 90% of
participants had an overall satisfaction of 5 and more than 5 based
on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale on the side of anti-cellulite
cream. This score was similar on the sides treated with placebo
and the active product.
Conclusion: Although Three O cream provided more satisfaction
in volunteers than placebo, the objective measurements did not
show any difference between them.

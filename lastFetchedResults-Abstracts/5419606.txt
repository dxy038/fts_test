The discovery of Web services for a specific request is one of the central operations in SOA, and research on semantic Web services (SWS) aims to achieve the automation of this step. This paper presents an enhanced goal-based approach for semantic Web service discovery based on rich functional and non-functional descriptions. We distinguish goal templates and goal instances, the previous are generic and reusable objective descriptions, whereas the latter denotes concrete requests as an instantiation of a goal template stored in the system. In the basis of SDC graph we add the non-functional properties into descriptions of Web service and goal instance, give a method to quantize it, and then we improve the algorithm by adding the matching of non-functional properties. Last we use WSMT which provides tool for the semantic Web service technologies developed around the WSMO framework to demonstrate our framework.

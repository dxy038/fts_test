Photoluminescence (PL) of both InP and CdSe quantum dots is studied with the aim of generating photonic quantum states on demand. The setup is a scanning confocal microscope with a high numerical aperture objective. The samples are mounted in a liquid helium flow cryostat, where the temperature can be controlled between 3.6 K and room temperature. Excitation is done using either cw or femtosecond pulsed laser light. The PL light can be either sent into a spectrometer or onto two single photo detectors, forming a Hanbury Brown-Twiss arrangement. Time correlation measurements are presented under continuous and pulsed excitation, showing a photon antibunching. For the pulsed case this amounts to single photon generation on demand, where each laser pulse, that creates an excitation inside the quantum dot, produces a single photon. Experiments done on both the excitonic and the biexcitonic transitions and measurements of the spectra and lifetime complement the characterization of the emission process.

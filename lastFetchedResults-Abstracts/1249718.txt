This work had the objective of studying the ceramic pigment BaFe2O4, which presents iron as the chromophore ion, and barium as net modifier. Synthesis was done by the polymeric precursor method. After calcination at different temperatures, characterizations were done by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, surface area by BET, scanning electron microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy and colorimetric analysis, using CIELab system. The soft chemical synthesis method leads to a high crystallinity material after calcination at 700 °C, while usual methods require higher temperatures (above 850 °C) or lead to secondary phases. The powders were applied on ceramic pieces in order to evaluate the behavior of the system when added to a glaze. Pigments presented dark brown color, with homogeneous surfaces of the glaze.

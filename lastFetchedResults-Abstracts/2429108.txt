The distinction between civilizations and national communities based on modern government raises the question that which component distinguishes civilizational society from society based on homeland rationality, based on modern government. What is the distinctive feature that results in civilizational comprehensiveness? And above all this, what are the social consequences of this feature? In this paper, after a consideration about the dependence of modern government on their territories and geographical borders and the independence of civilizational society with respect to this feature, I seek to examine the consequences of such dependence and independence for the formation of some significant social categories, that is, the idea of society, social identity, the demarcation of insiders and outsiders, and the logic of behavioral calculations of governments, drawing their influences on the inclusiveness of civilizational rationality, the formation of models, and objective structures of social management in spite of the possibility of different models and styles.

The objective of the paper is to propose a social network security management model for a multi-tenancy SaaS application using Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) approach. The earlier security management models do not cover the issues when data inadvertently get exposed to other users due to poor implementation of the access management processes. When a single virtual machine moves or dissolves in the network, many separate machines may bypass the security conditions that had been implemented for its neighbors which lead to vulnerability of the hosted services. When the services are multi-tenant, the issue becomes very critical due to lack of asynchronous asymmetric communications between virtual when more number of applications and users are added into the network creating big data issues and its identity. The TRAIN model for the security management using PC-FAST algorithm is proposed in order to detect and identify the communication errors between the hosted services.

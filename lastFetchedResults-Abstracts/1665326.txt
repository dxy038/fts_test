The quantitative measurement of jet fuel additives in the field is of interest to the Air Force. The “smart nozzle” project was designed as a state-of-the-art diagnostics package attached to a single-point refueling nozzle for assessing key fuel properties as the fuel is dispensed. The objective of the work was to show proof of concept that a layer-by-layer thin film and long period grating fibers could be used to detect the presence of water in jet fuel. The data for the nafion/PDMA film and a long period grating fiber is a combination capable of quantitative measurement of water in kerosene. The average response (spectral loss wavelength shift) to the kerosene sample ranged from −6.0 for 15 ppm to −126.5 for 60 ppm water. The average calculated value for the check standard was 21.71 and ranged from 21.25 to 22.00 with a true value of 22.5 ppm water. Potential interferences were observed and are judged to be insignificant in real samples.

The technical losses have taken importance since they represent economic damage for the companies. This to motivate from the different electrical distribution entities to undertake reduction strategies within a technical-economic context with you watch to improve the profitability and quality of service, to fulfil this objective is outlined a strategy of control and reduction of technical losses using technical of computation, statistics and control SCADA. Also it is developed an application that consists in the comparative analysis of all the digitized circuits of an electrical distribution net in base to standard of losses to be established. To accomplish the standardization were executed three phases, the first phase of data and recognition summary of the net. The simulations phase (in the program PSSU) and finishes it categorization phase, using statistic methods (multivariable analysis and segmentation)

Sensor nodes are typically battery-powered. As a result, maximizing the network lifetime is an important optimization objective in the design of a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). In time-critical WSNs, it is important to minimize the maximum latency in data collection. We investigate the problem of lifetime and latency aware data collection in WSNs with one base station. We propose a new routing structure, namely k-tree, and a distributed algorithm for constructing a lifetime-aware k-tree. The novelty of k-tree is that it provides the maximum latency guarantee for data collection. We have simulated our distributed algorithm. The simulation results show that our algorithm is effective in terms of balance factor of the children of the base station.

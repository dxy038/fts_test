The other is quality of the ranking algorithm or matching algorithm. The earlier factor is never ending quest because the content of the Web keep up changing after a particular time. Web crawler crawl Web pages and refreshes the index for search engine. To keep the freshness of the result by the search engine, crawling of the Web page should be fundamentally linked with the frequency updates of the Web pages. But the size of Web today and the inherent resource constraints: re-crawling too frequently leads to wasted bandwidth and re-crawling infrequently leads to the poor performance of the search engine. In this paper, we address the scheduling problem and a solution for the Web crawlers, with the objective of the optimizing the resources like freshness of repository and the quality of the index. Towards this we divi- ded the Web content providers into two parts: 1) active; 2) inactive. For inactive content providers we use agents who continuously crawls the content providers and collect the update pattern of the content providers. We also propose a scheduling scheme which capitalizes on the information given by the agents. Extensive experiments with real web traces demonstrate that it plays major role in improving the content quality of the index.

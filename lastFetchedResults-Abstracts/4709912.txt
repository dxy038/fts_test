This paper presents a model predictive-based current control for PMSMs. In our approach, a reference voltage to an inverter can be strictly treated as a discrete voltage vector so that the output saturation of the inverter is avoided. Various constraints can be also taken into consideration in our approach. Both tolerance ranges for current response and number of the switching operations are incorporated into a single objective function in order to consider a trade-off between current ripple and the switching operations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations and experiments.

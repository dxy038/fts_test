In this paper we present the deployment algorithm for femtocells in capacity-limited scenario. We consider the operator-deployed femtocells that extend outdoor coverage to the areas that are poorly served by the existing macro-cellular network. To satisfy the interests of WSP and customers we propose an automated tool that carefully plans the femto-deployment. Our objective is to deploy femtocells in a single macrocell to satisfy the current traffic demand of the network and not to exceed the budget constraint for WSP. The proposed deployment algorithm PDA is based on geometrical segmentation of macro-cell, heuristic levels of traffic intensity and user distribution. To estimate the PDA effectiveness we suggest two simple deployment algorithms: SDA1 and SDA2. Also, we carry out a cost analysis to evaluate the economical perspectives of the deployment for WSP. Finally, three deployment algorithms with respect to number of installed femtocells, number of supported users and profits for WSP are investigated. Through simulations we show that the proposed deployment algorithm PDA surpasses among two other simple algorithms.

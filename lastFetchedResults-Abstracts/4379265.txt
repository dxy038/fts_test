The convergence of emerging real-time multimedia services, the increasing coverage of high-speed wireless networks, and the evergrowing popularity of mobile devices are leading to an era of user-centric multimedia wireless services. In this scenario, heterogeneous wireless communications will coexist and ensure that the end user is always best connected. However, the quality of experience supported for highquality applications in multi-operator environments remains a significant challenge and is crucial for the success of wireless multimedia systems. This article proposes a quality of experience handover architecture for heterogeneous mobile wireless multimedia networks. The architecture extends the media independent handover/ IEEE 802.21 proposal with QoE-aware seamless mobility, video quality estimator, dynamic class of service mapping, and a set of content adaptation schemes. The proposed architecture always provides the best connection and considers the QoE needs of mobile clients and available wireless resources in IEEE 802.11e and IEEE 802.16e service classes. Simulation experiments were performed to show the impact and benefits of the proposed solution from the userÂ´s perception, by using both objective and subjective QoE metrics.

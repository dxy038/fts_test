One objective of CTRON is to improve software productivity through program recycling. To this end the CTRON reference model adopts a two-layer structure, with the lower layer providing logical interfaces that hide hardware-dependent processing. In order to assure realtime performance, however, details of some of the interfaces are left to the implementor. Evaluation of CTRON portability has been undertaken by actually porting software developed in conformity with CTRON interface specifications. In this experimental evaluation, eight programs have been ported. The results indicate that the scale of revisions to the source program, and the number of man-hours required for the porting process, are kept to reasonable amounts

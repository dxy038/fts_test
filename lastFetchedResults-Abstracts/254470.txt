Unsupervised learning techniques provide a way of investigating scientific data based on
automated generation of statistical models. Because these techniques are not dependent on a priori
information, they provide an unbiased method for separating data into distinct types. Thus they can be
used as an objective method by which to identify data as belonging to previously known classes or to find
previously unknown or rare classes and subclasses of data. Hidden Markov model based unsupervised
learning methods are particularly applicable to geophysical systems because time relationships between
classes, or states of the system, are included in the model. We have applied a modified version of hidden
Markov models which employ a deterministic annealing technique to scientific analysis of seismicity and
GPS data from the southern California region. Preliminary results indicate that the technique can isolate
distinct classes of earthquakes from seismicity data.

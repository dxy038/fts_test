In this paper we describe an image-based rendering chain that realizes the free viewpoint video functionality throughout the whole scene. We summarize the most common problems that may be encountered in such an application and provide different solutions to each core stage of the rendering process. Moreover, we propose a novel way to specify the virtual cameraÂ´s path that moves throughout the scene and implement a procedure to render the 3D effect by exploiting the stereoscopy principle. Finally, we give some results about the objective quality of the synthesized views w.r.t. their original counterparts acquired from real viewpoints.

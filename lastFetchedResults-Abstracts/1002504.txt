1H NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the molecular quality of Aglianico red wines from the Campania region of Italy. The wines were obtained from three different Aglianico vineyards characterized by different microclimatic and pedological properties. In order to reach an objective evaluation of “terroir” influence on wine quality, grapes were subjected to the same winemaking procedures. The careful subtraction of water and ethanol signals from NMR spectra allowed to statistically recognize the metabolites to be employed in multivariate statistical methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA). The three wines were differentiated from each other by six metabolites: α-hydroxyisobutyrate, lactic acid, succinic acid, glycerol, α-fructose and β-d-glucuronic acid. All multivariate analyses confirmed that the differentiation among the wines were related to micro-climate, and carbonate, clay, and organic matter content of soils. Additionally, the wine discrimination ability of NMR spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods, was proved when commercial Aglianico wines, deriving from different soils, were shown to be statistically different from the studied wines. Our findings indicate that multivariate statistical elaboration of NMR spectra of wines is a fast and accurate method to evaluate the molecular quality of wines, underlining the objective relation with terroir.

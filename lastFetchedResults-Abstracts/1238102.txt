Performance seismic evaluation is an important topic in earthquake engineering. In this regard, several methods have previously been developed and used. The main objective of present research is to evaluate two methods including “Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM)” and “Improved Capacity Spectrum Method (ICSM)” in determination of seismic performance of concrete frames. For this purpose, several sample frames are subjected to several different earthquake records, seismic performance of them are evaluated using these two methods. It was demonstrated that CSM and ICSM methods underestimate displacement at seismic performance level. Based on the numerical results of this study, it was concluded that the ICSM method is more accurate than the CSM Method.

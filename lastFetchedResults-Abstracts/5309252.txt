A combinatorial optimization algorithm called simulated annealing (SA) is applied to the modeling process of active devices. The objective is to obtain simplified yet accurate models by integrating both model minimization and parameter determination into one process. In this approach, two nested SA loops are used to determine the least-complicated model of a device that closely matches the measured characteristics. The outer loop reconfigures and simplifies a fully expanded, detailed equivalent-circuit mode, of which the parameters are optimized iteratively in the inner loop. This approach is technology-independent and versatile and can be applied to any device

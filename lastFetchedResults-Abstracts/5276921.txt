The purpose of this paper is to discuss the framework and measurement of development evaluation of the snow-ice tourism resources. The definition and category of snow-ice tourism resources are identified. A destination-oriented CSSRR(Core, Supportive, Subsidiary and Reserved Resources) category is introduced to help understand the tourism resources. Then a hierarchy assessment framework is developed to establish levels of attraction. Assessment is completed by the fuzzy comprehensive multilevel evaluation method. The development evaluation of snow-ice tourism in Harbin is examined. The attraction diversity in this region is high, although the resources are associated with poor accessibility, low levels of tourism infrastructure and moderate levels of environmental degradation. This paper highlights some of the difficulties associated with establishing objective resource evaluation techniques for snow-ice tourism. The analysis also indicates that fuzzy comprehensive multilevel evaluation method is applicable.

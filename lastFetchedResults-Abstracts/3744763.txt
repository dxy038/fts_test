Bird related outages are more common and widespread than generally believed. The objective of this paper is to review the existing bird related problems and to recommend practices and procedures that are successful in reducing bird related outages on transmission lines, in substations and on overhead distribution lines. Experience has shown that use of perch guards, metal or plastic spikes, insulating caps, alternate perch sites and washing have significantly reduced bird related streamer and contamination outages.

Abstract
Objective: The present study aimed at comparing the efficacy of mixed Neurofeedback and medication therapy with medication therapy in order to reduce the anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Materials and Methods: A pre- and post-test semi-experimental design without control group was used. Twenty patients from counseling centers and psychiatrists offices in Sanandaj who according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-V) had suffered from generalized anxiety disorder were selected using convenient sampling. Then, they were randomly appointed to 2 groups; 10 people in each group. First, both groups received an anti-anxiety medicine (Sertraline) under medical supervision. The first group was under the Neurofeedback therapy, and the second group was under the mixed Neurofeedback and medication therapy. In order to evaluate the clinical status and diagnosing the GAD, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI test) and Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (MMPI2 test) were used. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance.

Results: The findings showed that the anxiety level reduced in the post-test of the intervention group and the difference was significant. But the anxiety level reduced more in the group receiving the mixed Neurofeedback and medication therapy.

Conclusion: The results indicate that the mixed therapies are effective for the treatment of GAD.

In order to provide the decoder with essential information on the channel state, and improve the effectiveness of the communication, a probabilistic analysis of the communication channel is needed. Such modeling must include fading and multipath, as well as interference. An insight into the behavior of the channel can be gained by attempting an information theoretical approach for the multipath model of the wireless indoor channel. The main objective of the information theoretic approach of the multipath Gaussian channel is to find its capacity region, i.e. the set of information rates at which the simultaneous reliable communication of the messages of each user is possible

Introduction:One of the most important stages of life is the elderly time when noticing the need of the olds is a social necessity. The main objective of this study is considering the effect of 12 weeks of chosen Pilates exercise on the quality of life in healthy nonathletic people.
Method:This Quasi-experimental study was conducted on 40 old nonathletic men who were randomly chosen from a group of old people referring to Ardehal Health Centre in Kashan in 2012. Having randomly chosen, they were divided into two equal groups of inference (age: 65.13±3.2, weight: 70.40 ± 6.91, height: 165±7.91) and control (age: 64.86±2.53, weight: 61.13 ± 4.940, height: 163±4.73). The quality of life of the subjects from different respects was tested through Quality of Life Questionnaire. Then, the subjects in the experimental group did the Pilates exercise whereas the subjects in the other group did not. To distribute the data naturally, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed and to see the efficacy of the exercise, covariance analysis and the t-test were administered using the significance level at P?0.05.
Results:There was a significant difference in the quality of life and the following results emerged (P?0.05): physical health (P=0.0001, F=146.929), mental health (P=0.0001, F=186.508), social contacts (P=0.0001, F=335.657), environmental health (P=0.0001, F=287.57) and the quality of life (P=0.0001, F=69.317). However, no significant differences was found in the control group (P?0.05).  
Conclusion:Totally, the results showed that 12 weeks of Pilates Exercises leads to better quality of life and related variables in nonathletic men. This can be regarded as a nonaggressive way to improve the quality of life of the older people.

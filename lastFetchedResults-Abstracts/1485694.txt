The objective of this study was to determine how sensory quality, shear force and water loss differ between beef stored either chilled or frozen before cooking. Meat tenderness was analysed instrumentally and sensorially using both a consumer panel and a semi-trained panel. Both M. longissimus dorsi (LD) from eight young Holstein bulls were cut into eight samples, weighed, vacuum packed and aged at 4 °C for 2, 7 or 14 days. After ageing, the frozen samples were kept at −20 °C prior to heat treatment. Water holding capacity was recorded as purge or thawing loss and cooking loss or as combined loss. Sensory analyses were performed on samples aged 7 days. Peak force values declined with ageing time and freezing. Frozen meat aged 2 days had the same peak force values as chilled meat aged 7 days. Total energy was the same for both treatments at day 2 and 7, whereas at day 14 frozen samples showed significantly higher values than chilled samples. The sensory panel experienced the chilled meat to be more tender, juicier and having a more intense meat taste than the frozen meat, whereas the consumers could not find any significant difference in degree of liking. Water holding capacity was lower for the frozen samples. The results indicate that conclusions from studies concerning sensory quality of beef will depend on whether the meat has been kept chilled or frozen before testing.

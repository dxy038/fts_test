In this paper, the potential difficulties with the application of exact linearization technique to a class of continuous bioreactors are examined. We concentrate on input-output linearization since the input-state linearization can be viewed as a special case of input-output linearization. Input-state linearization can have all the same problems except unstable zero dynamics. Various control structures are compared. We emphasize on the analysis of zero dynamics, singular points and disturbance decoupling property. We introduce the process and the control objective. We briefly review the exact input-output linearization theory. We study single loop control structures with the dilution rate D, the single loop control with feed substrate concentration, and the multivariable control

Objective: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) resulting from lack of sufficient iron for synthesis of hemoglobin is most common hematologic disease of infancy and childhood. There is little information about the renal function in iron deficiency anemia. The aim of the present study was to examine the renal function in children with iron deficiency anemia.
Methods: This case-control study was performed in children with iron deficiency anemia (n=20) and healthy age matched subjects (n=20). Blood and urine samples were obtained for hematological and biochemical investigation. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired sample t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.
Findings:  Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) was significantly higher in children with iron deficiency anemia than control subjects (P=0.006). There was no significant difference in the level of urine specific gravity, calcium/creatinine ratio, ?2-microglobulin and creatinine clearance between case and control groups (P>0.05). There was no correlation between FENa and Hb (r=0.13, P=0.57), FENa+ and Fe+2 (r=0.079, P=0.72), FENa+ and TIBC (r=-0.083, P=0.71), FENa+ and ferritin (r=0.039, P=0.86) as well as Hb and ?2-microglobulin (r=0.02, P=0.37) in IDA patients.
Conclusion: The results showed that FENa+ was higher in children with iron deficiency anemia than in normal subjects. The findings revealed evidence of tubular damage in IDA; this needs confirmation by more investigation.

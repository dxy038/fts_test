In recent years, wireless sensor networks have become attractive for tracking and target surveillance. For these applications, the accuracy is an important constraint. In this paper, we study a multi-objective sensor placement problem taking into account the K-coverage and the accuracy. The objectives are the maximization of the K-coverage and the minimization of the number of deployed sensors, under an accuracy constraint. A linear formulation and an adaptation of the NSGA-II and Beam Search are proposed. Results show the NSGA-II is better than the BS heuristic for small instances but this trend is inverted for larger instances.

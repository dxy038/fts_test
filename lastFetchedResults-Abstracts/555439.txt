There are different and contradictory approaches and views over the possibility/impossibility of an Islamic theory of international relations. This divergence of views is a result of possible relationship between religion and science and consequently different expectations from Islam in social arenas and in the field of sciences. Therefore, in spite of huge intellectual endeavors, no logical and coherent Islamic international theory has been developed so far. This article argues that it is possible to develop an Islamic theory of international relations based on presumptions logically derived from Islamic teachings. Such a theory has an explanatory, normative, constitutive and critical nature and its objective is to describe, illuminate, realize and interpret the existing international relations and explain how it is generated and changed and prescribe the favorable international order.

Various methodologies exist to annotate software models with data related to performance, and to translate the annotated models into performance models. A relevant objective is now at hand in this direction, that is to make these methodologies acceptable from the software engineering community. We present here the XPRIT tool that allows to annotate UML diagrams and translate them into models ready to performance validation, that are execution graphs and queueing networks. The translation is based on an existing methodology (PRIMA-UML), and the output models represent the inputs to a software performance engineering approach.

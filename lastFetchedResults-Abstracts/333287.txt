The talonavicular relationship in 14 patients with talipes equinovarus was quantified using gradient echo sequences. The angle formed between the short axis of the navicular and the long axis of the talus was measured. There is a significant difference in the talonavicular angle between patients who had posteromedial release (PMR) and those who had posterior release (PR) or casting only (P=.0004). This method provides an objective assessment of residual deformity following surgical and conservative management of talipes equinovarus.

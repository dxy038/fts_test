This paper proposes a time of use (TOU) pricing model and an improved sequential Monte Carlo simulation (SMCS) method to evaluate the distribution system reliability considering the TOU pricing. The proposed TOU pricing model presents the constraint conditions and objective function to obtain optimal TOU pricing tarrif. The model provides different objective functions to describe various specific demands. The proposed SMCS method can assess the reliability of distribution systems considering the TOU pricing and distribution generation (DG) by modifying the TOU pricing affected loads and by introducing islanding operation respectively. In the algorithm, real-time load is used to accurately evaluate the load loss. The validity of above model and the method are studied through numerical tests on modified RBTS test system. In the case study, the TOU pricing, together with DG, will improve or worsen the reliability depending on concrete combination.

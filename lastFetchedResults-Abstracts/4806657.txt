The main objective of this work is to present a methodology to assess the thermal necrosis in a dental model due a drilling process with and without water irrigation. An experimental methodology, using an infrared thermography camera, was used to measure the rate of temperature change during the drilling in a pig mandible. The finite element method is used with the ANSYS program to compare the results with the experimental model. A simplified model was analyzed in a transient thermal process. Using appropriated boundary conditions, successful numerical results could be used as an alternative to the in-vivo models.

Objective: Investigate the clinical effect of two different doses somatostatin on esophagogastric variceal bleeding caused by cirrhosis. Method: The patients of 116 cases of esophagogastric variceal bleeding were divided into two groups randomly. The intravenous drip at 250 &#956;g /h was performed on 59 cases in normal dose group constantly after slowly intravenous injections of 250 &#956;g initial dose, while the intravenous drip at 200 &#956;g /h was performed on 57 cases in small dose group as control group constantly after slowly intravenous injections of 200 &#956;g initial dose. Observe the treatment effectiveness of the two groups, the incidence rate of rehaemorrhagia and the changing conditions of the side effect. Result: There is no statistical difference for treatment effectiveness, the incidence rate of rehaemorrhagia and the side effect between the somatostatin normal dose group and small dose control group(P&gt;;0.05). Conclusion: Small dose of somatostatin still has better curative effect on curing esophagogastric variceal bleeding.

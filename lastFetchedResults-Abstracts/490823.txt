The most common age groups of drowned victims were 15-19 (25.3%) and 20-24 (22.1%) years (7.3 and 6.5 per 100 000 population/year, respectively). Victims under the age of 15 years (including age groups of 0-4, 5-9 and 10-14 years) comprised 24.3% of all drowning deaths. Rivers and canals were the locations with the highest number of drowned victims (74.7% and 11.3% respectively). Most of drowned victims (94.5%) were native. The manner of death was found as following: 88.7% accidental, 2.3% suicidal, 0.7% homicidal and 8.3% undetermined.

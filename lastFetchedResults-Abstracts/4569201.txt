The National Airspace System (NAS) is an important and a vast resource. Efficient management of airspace capacity is important to ensure safe and systematic operation of the NAS eventually resulting in maximum benefit to the stakeholders. Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) is one of the NextGen Concept of Operations (ConOps) that aims at efficient allocation of airspace as a capacity management technique. This paper is a proof of concept for the Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) approach to Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) by static sectorization. The objective of this paper is to address the issue of static sectorization by partitioning airspace based on controller workload i.e. airspace is partitioned such that the controller workload is balanced between adjacent sectors. Several algorithms exist that address the issue of static restructuring of the airspace to meet capacity requirements on a daily basis. The intent of this paper is to benchmark the results of our methodology with the state-of-the-art algorithms and lay a foundation for future work in dynamic resectorization.

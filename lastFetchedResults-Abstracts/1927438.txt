The objective of this study was to determine the effective relationship between different motion characteristics of bull spermatozoa assessed by computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA) and in vitro fertilization percentage in zona-free hamster oocytes. A total of 64 frozen semen samples from 16 different crossbred bulls (Bos taurus Ã— Bos indicus) with four ejaculates from each bull were taken for analysis. Various motion characteristics of spermatozoa like progressive motility, path velocity, progressive velocity, beat cross frequency, straightness and linearity were recorded. Hypo-osmotic swelling test and sperm penetration bioassay were conducted to assess the membrane integrity and fertilization percentage of spermatozoa respectively. Significant positive correlation (P &lt; 0.01) was found between fertilization percentage and progressive motility (r = 0.791) and between velocity parameters (VAP; r = 0.612 and VSL; r = 0.625) and fertilization percentage. Among different CASA variables, progressive motility alone contributed to 62.6% variation in the fertilization percentage. The velocity measurements (VAP and VSL) together with progressive motility and %HOS spermatozoa contributed to 66.1% of variation in fertilization percentage which was found to be significant (P &lt; 0.05).

The objective of this paper is to present the implementation of so-called global/local approach to crash landing analysis of the light composite aircraft. The analyses and experimental verifications have been performed for PZL I-23 aircraft, designed jointly by Institute of Aviation and PZL Swidnik aircraft factory. Some criteria for designing the light composite aircraft, according to the “safe-crash” rule have been formulated.

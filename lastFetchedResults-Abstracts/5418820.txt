Adaptive Directional Lifting (ADL) has been successfully implemented in image compression and denoising due to the feature of simple structure and flexible directional selectivity. However, image denoising by means of ADL introduces many visual artifacts caused by Gibbs phenomena due to the lack of translation invariance. In this paper, we propose a translation invariant directional lifting (TI-DL) by employing the cycle-spinning based technique to reduce artifacts in denoising results. Moreover, the inefficiency and high computational complexity of the orientation estimation technique in ADL strongly influences the performance. In order to achieve better denoising results, in this paper, 2-D Gabor filters are adopted for orientation estimation to achieve better orientation estimation results with lower complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-art denoising performance in terms of both objective (PSNR) and subjective (SSIM) evaluation.

Objective:
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and is associated with the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. It enhances vascular permeability and is expressed in inflammatory nasal as well as middle-ear mucosa. As the mechanism of VEGF induction during chronic inflammation, such as chronic paranasal sinusitis (CPS) remains to be clarified, we studied the factors regulating the production of VEGF in cultured human nasal fibroblasts and discussed the role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of CPS.
Methods:
We used ELISA to quantify VEGF levels in paranasal sinus effusions, nasal secretions, and serum from patients with CPS. In addition, we cultured human nasal fibroblasts isolated from nasal polyps of CPS patients and studied the effects of hypoxia, TNF-α, and endotoxin on their production of VEGF using ELISA and PCR.
Results:
The VEGF concentration was significantly higher in paranasal sinus effusions than in nasal secretions and serum. Nasal fibroblasts produced high levels of VEGF, when cultured under hypoxic condition and this production was remarkably enhanced in the presence of TNF-α or endotoxin.
Conclusion:
VEGF is locally produced in paranasal sinuses as well as nasal mucosa and its production is increased in patients with CPS. Hypoxia is associated with the production of VEGF by nasal fibroblasts and TNF-α and endotoxin may act synergistically to enhance VEGF production in paranasal sinuses under hypoxic condition.

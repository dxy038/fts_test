Objective The present report describes the objectives,
design, and methods of the Dresden Predictor Study (DPS)
of anxiety and depression, a prospective epidemiological
study investigating anxiety disorders and depression in
3,065 young German women (18â€“25 years of age).
Materials and methods The DPS consists of a baseline
and one follow-up investigation separated by approximately
17 months. At both time points, respondents were
diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) using
an extended German version of the Anxiety Disorders
Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV-L). In addition to diagnostic
assessment, respondents completed a battery of self-report
questionnaires that provided detailed information about
potential predictors of disorders and a comprehensive
dimensional assessment of psychopathology.
Discussion and conclusions Results on both response
bias in the baseline investigation and effects of dropout at
follow-up are presented, and strengths and limitations of
the study design are discussed

The homotopy perturbation method (HPM) is used for solving space and time fractional telegraph equations. The telegraph equation is used in signal analysis for transmission and propagation of electrical signals and also used modeling reaction diffusion the obtainedresults show that HPM is effective and convenient. The objective and goal of this paper is to present the semi-exact analytical Solution of The telegraph equation, one of the newest, powerful and easy-to-use analytical methods is the homotopy perturbation method (HPM), which is applied in this paper to solve Telegraph equation with high nonlinearity order. The study has highlighted the efficiency and capability of aforementioned method in solving telegraph equation which has risen from a number of important physical phenomenons.

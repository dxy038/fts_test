In this study, numerical simulations of asteroid/comet impact on the earth were carried out by using the hydrocode AUTODYN-2D (Century Dynamics Inc.). The ejected mass into the atmosphere originated from different sources was recorded at different altitudes as a function of time. It is claimed that the mass extinction at the Permianâ€“Triassic (P/T) boundary was caused by an extraterrestrial impact and the following abrupt climate/environment change. The objective of this work is to substantiate the claim with numerical analysis. It is demonstrated that the materials from different origins are splashed into the atmosphere and that the crater size is a function of the diameter as well as the kinetic energy of the impactor. The effect of impact angle to the appearance of ejected materials is also investigated using two-dimensional plane strain model.

Knowledge of some particular fact, subject, or event is conveyed among disparate agents affecting their respective activities and, in turn, the generation of new information. The authorÂ´s main objective is to reconstruct the flow of information in the form of a weighted digraph, based on data that reflect agent activities. Embarking from the principles of maximum entropy, the author casts the digraph identification in the Bayesian estimation framework.

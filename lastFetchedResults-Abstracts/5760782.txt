For molecular biological detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PCR methods with primers targeting different regions specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are used worldwide. However, some uncertainties exist concerning the specificity of certain target regions and the sensitivity. To identify the methods which are best suited for diagnostics, 9 single-round and 2 multiple PCR systems based on IS6110 , IS1081, recA intein, and pps1 intein gene sequences were compared regarding their analytical sensitivity and specificity under similar PCR conditions.

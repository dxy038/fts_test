The majority of empirical comparisons of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are performed on synthetic benchmark functions. One of the advantages of synthetic test functions is the a-priori knowledge of the optimal Pareto front. This allows measuring the proximity to the optimal front for the solution sets returned by the different MOEAs. Such a comparison is only meaningful if the cardinality of all solution sets is bounded by some fixed k. In order to compare MOEAs to the theoretical optimum achievable with k solutions, we determine best possible &#949;-indicator values achievable with solution sets of size k, up to an error of &#948;. We present a new algorithm with runtime O(k &#183; log<sup>2</sup> (&#948;<sup>&#8722;1</sup>)), which is an exponential improvement regarding the dependence on the error &#948; compared to all previous work. We show mathematical correctness of our algorithm and determine optimal solution sets for sets of cardinality k &#8714; {2,3,4,5,10, 20,50,100,1000} for the well known test suits DTLZ, ZDT, WFG and LZ09 up to error &#948; = 10<sup>&#8722;25</sup>.

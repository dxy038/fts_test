The objective of this paper is to examine antecedents of mobile banking adoption behavior. The role of national culture, socio-demographics, consumer-behavioral-specific characters and mobile phone specifics were examined. The authors develop hypotheses based on the earlier literature and test them on a data collected from 3582 bank customers in Finland and Portugal. The results show that individualism, long term orientation, and masculinity are the significant determinants of national culture in mobile banking adoption. In addition, gender, previous mobile service experience, type of mobile device, and country have a significant effect.

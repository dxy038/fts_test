The organic part of the MSW is an important biomass resource, which has not properly used to satisfy the energy demand yet. The objective of this project is to set out a smart grid using local renewable resources, in which the plasma gasification of MSW is the main contributor. This smart grid seeks to increase the system efficiency, to reduce operational cost and to optimize the distributed power generation, reducing the external dependency.

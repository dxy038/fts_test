In this paper we propose a spectrum aggregation-based cooperative routing protocol, termed as SACRP, for CRAHNs. The primary objective of SACRP is to improve throughput and reduce end-to-end delay for CRAHNs. In this regard, we design the Media access control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layer, and propose different spectrum aggregation algorithms for cognitive radio (CR) users. We propose two different classes of routing protocols; Class A for achieving higher throughput, and Class B for reducing end-to-end latency. Based on a stochastic geometry approach, we build an analytical model for the proposed protocol. Besides, the proposed protocol is compared with the state of the art cooperative and non-cooperative routing algorithms with spectrum aggregation. Performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SACRP in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.

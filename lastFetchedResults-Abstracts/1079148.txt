The objective of the study was to determine a relation for predicting convective and evaporative heat transfer coefficients for all three condensing surfaces inclined at 15°, 30° and 45° under indoor simulation. The condensing covers were made of the same flat transparent glass as found in any solar distillation unit. The operating temperature range for the experiment was maintained at steady state from 40°C to 80°C by using a constant temperature bath. The temperatures and yields obtained for a 10-min interval were used to determine the values of constants C and n and consequently convective and evaporative heat transfer coefficients. It was found that a higher yield was obtained with an increase in temperature for a 30° slope compared to 15° and 45° slopes of the condensing cover.

However, there is no agreeable conclusion about this issue in spite of many relative published papers. This article aims to find out the truth of CSR and CFP relationship and examine whether extant studies are reliable without publication bias. The meta-analysis including 34 Chinese empirical research papers shows that the two are positively correlated. Publication bias tests using multiple methods such as funnel plot, Begg´s rank and Egger´s regression method, fail-safe N etc. , indicate that the conclusion is valid without obvious publication bias. Thus the argument that the relationship between CSR and CFP is positive proves to be not only objective but also universal. That is to say, CSR also pays off in the Chinese context.

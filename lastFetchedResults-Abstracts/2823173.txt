This paper reports on the evaluation of several objective quality measures for predicting the quality of the dereverberated speech signals. The correlations between subjective quality assessment for single-channel dereverberation techniques and objective speech quality as well as speech intelligibility measures are analyzed and discussed. Six different single-channel dereverberation algorithms were included in the evaluation to account for different types of distortions. The subjective quality was assessed along the four attributes reverberant, colored, distorted and overall quality following the recommendations of ITU-T P.835. The objective measures included system-based, i.e. channel-based, as well as signal-based measures.

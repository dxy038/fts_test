Objective: To examine the use and efficacy of social and temporal comparisons used before and after coronary artery surgery. Design: Secondary analysis of data from a prospective study designed to examine social support. Patients: 141 subjects undergoing surgery. Results: One third of subjects made spontaneous social comparisons. Most who made a social comparison before and 1 month after surgery viewed themselves as similar to others. Social comparisons were related to mood states only before surgery. The majority of subjects made temporal comparisons 1 year after surgery. Subjects generally saw themselves as the same or better than they were before surgery. Temporal comparisons were related to both emotional and functional outcomes. Conclusions: Social comparisons were not consistently related to emotional and functional status; thus whether they can be used to formulate interventions needs further exploration. On the other hand, use of temporal comparisons was related to better mood state and functional status. Enhancing an individual’s ability to view self as stable or improved compared with before surgery may be beneficial. Results are discussed in terms of how social comparison theory fits within the overall context of coping with physical illness. (Heart Lung® 1999;28:316-25)

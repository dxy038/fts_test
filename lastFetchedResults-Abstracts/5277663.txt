The optimization of multi-objectives is crucial to the functional configuration design of industrial products, especially to the functional design of mobile devices. In the design of mobile devices, due to the complexity of functional implementation and their interactions, an optimized functional configuration for a product is hardly to achieve. In this paper, the functional configuration design of a mobile phone is taken as an example, and by applying the analytic hierarchy process, multiple objectives in the designing process are optimized with a harmonization of competing factors. The proposed method is associated with graphical operators to construct the optimization model and relevant constraints, in which each objective is weighted either by its information entropy or by individual subjective partiality. The evaluation of design results utilizing our method demonstrates that the method is capable of delivering the best functional configuration, by means of providing reference identifying the best functional configuration from a variety of possible design schemes.

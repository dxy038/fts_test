Objective: To review the existing data on the use of cyclosporine (CsA) in kidney transplantation, particularly with respect to therapeutic drug monitoring.
Data Sources: A literature search was conducted of applicable articles related to therapeutic drug monitoring of cyclosporine in renal transplantation. Previous consensus guidelines were examined. Discussions on issues related to this topic convened in Toronto, ON, on June 15–16, 1994.
Data Synthesis: The literature was analyzed to examine patient factors and drug interactions affecting CsA concentrations, the effect of CsA concentrations on patient outcome, current methods of analysis, pharmacodynamic monitoring, and new immunosuppressants.
Conclusions: CsA has improved the success of kidney transplantation, reducing the incidence and severity of acute rejection and improving short-term patient and graft survival. The rate of graft loss after the first year (primarily due to chronic rejection) has remained largely unchanged. Sandimmune Neoral® offers promise due to its better bioavailability and limited dependence on bile flow for absorption. Long-term studies are underway to determine its effectiveness and safety. Indications for therapeutic drug monitoring for CsA are provided.

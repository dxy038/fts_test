Recently, developments in detectors, filters, and laser technology now make Raman spectroscopy more attractive as an in situ probe. The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate Raman spectroscopy as an in situ, spatially resolved probe of compound semiconductor electrical properties for use in process monitoring and control.

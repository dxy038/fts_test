In this paper a topology of solid state transformer, direct current to alternate current, bidirectional, isolated, single stage, based on the principle of operation of the dual active bridge converters is presented. Its operating principle is explained, and a switching strategy is presented to reduce total harmonic distortion. Finally the simulation results are shown to evaluate the performance of the converter.

Image Fusion is the process of combining information of two or more images into a single image which can retain all important features of the all original images. Here the input to fusion involves set of images taken from different modalities of the same scene. Output is a better quality image; which depends on a particular application. The objective of fusion is to generate an image which describes a scene better or even higher than any single image with respect to some relevant properties providing an informative image. These fusion techniques are important in diagnosing and treating cancer in medical fields. This paper focuses on the development of an image fusion method using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform. The results show the proposed algorithm has a better visual quality than the base methods. Also the quality of the fused image has been evaluated using a set of quality metrics.

Mathematical model and dynamical model of passive suspension and semi-active suspension are established. A fuzzy PID controller is designed to control the damping of semi-active air suspension. Using multi-objective method and co-simulation technology and targeting the ride comfort and road-friendliness simultaneously, the differences among sprung mass acceleration, suspension working space and dynamic tire load of semi-active air suspension and passive suspension have been analyzed. The results shows that, under the control of fuzzy PID method, semi-active air suspension is superior to passive suspension, which can improve the ride comfort and road-friendliness of the vehicle effectively.

The objective of this work was to check possible additive beneficial effects of whole body hyperthermia (WBH) associated with betacarotene (BC) supplementation in patients with AIDS. In a pilot study, 10 HIV positive patients, (8 with AIDS and 2 with AIDS related complex, ARC), after AZT or DDI discontinuation, were first treated with one single session of WBH applied with a non-invasive procedure at 42 Â°C core temperature for one hour, and subsequently supplemented with BC 120 mg daily continuously. All patients well tolerated the non-invasive WBH as well as the high dose BC supplementation. Apart from one patient who died after 4 months, all the others underwent an HIV burden diminution, clinical improvement and amelioration of laboratory data, along with an subjective improvement of their life quality. With reference to control groups, namely (a) only WBH applied with extracorporeal procedure to 31 AIDS patients, and (b) only BC supplementation at high dosage applied to 64 ARC patients, the combined physical and BC supplemental treatments clearly showed a better and longer lasting response.

This paper studies a specific methodology for the design of different topologies in multi-agent networks with the central objective of maximizing agent collaboration. In order to obtain this feature we rely on the use of a recently discovered type of topology, namely the &#8220;small world&#8221; (SW) topology. This topology has been shown to present several advantages such as enhancement of signal-propagation speed computational power, and synchronizability. We have extended the analysis to multi-agent networks searching for the topologies that maximize the flow of entities (data, energy, goods, etc.) with different complexities in the behaviour of each agent in the network

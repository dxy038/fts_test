Background and Objective: Gutta percha is a common material used filling root canal and recently made with various tapering. The aim of present study is evaluating the effects of tapering of master cone on marginal adaptation of curvature canal prepared using nickel- titanium rotary instruments.
Materials and Methods: in this in vitro study 45 mandibular molar teeth selected with two canals and separated apical foramen while curved more  than 20 degree based on using (%2,%4,%6) master cone taper, then divided in three experimental groups of 15. After preparation with %6 of rotary files to 30 apical areas, the root filled by cold lateral condensation technique and AH plus sealer, and from each sample, four section of 1mm were cut from the apex by sectioned instrument and used SEM for investigation. The data were analyzed using variance analysis (ANOVA) and Kurskal- Wallis test in significant level P <  0/05.   
Results: After observation under SEM, the mean area of space in group A filled with %2 taper found significant difference between sections where the smallest in the first section and the largest space was in the third section, and difference in group B filled with %4 taper were significant between sections where the largest area of space was in the second section and smallest in third one. The difference in group C filled with %6 taper was not significant: the largest area of space was in the second section and smallest in first one.
Conclusion: According to the finding of present study using various taper of gutta percha for filling including %2 taper gutta percha is superior to marginal fitting in the end of apex required apical seal.

There have been many studies that apply three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3D DWT) to video coding. It is known that lowest frequency sub-band coefficients of 3D DWT outputs affect the visual quality of video. In order to maintain image quality of video that is transmitted over channel with error such as a wireless, it is necessary to development of error resilient transmission scheme for protecting the lowest subband coefficients. Coauthors of the study proposed the method (conventional method), which adopted duplication scheme of lowest frequency sub-band coefficients of 3D DWT. The objective of this study is to indicate improvement of error resilience by replacing the duplication scheme of conventional method with the error correction scheme using invertible codes. In addition, conventional study is assumed the packet loss channel model that packets are lost or received without bit errors. However, in wireless communications of the actual, the packet is often received with errors, and errors occur in bursty. The simulation evaluations compare the performances of the proposed method with those of the conventional one over burst error channel.

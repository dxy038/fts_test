In a lubricated interface, the local dynamic responses can be complex and depend on molecular effects in the confined lubricating films. In a mechanical system comprising one or more of such interfaces, the influence of the local interfacial behaviour on the total vibrational response remains largely unknown. In this work, we propose a numerical model that incorporates realistic laws of local friction issued from previous experimental results. The objective is to characterize the dynamics of a lubricated system and to study its complex global responses triggered by the local interfacial behaviour. Both stability analysis and vibrational oscillations of the mechanical system will be investigated through various operating conditions.

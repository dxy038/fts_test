Bidirectional DC converter is necessary in order to accomplish G2V and V2G operations in electric vehicle applications. In this paper, a bidirectional three-phase dualactive- bridge DC converter is implemented. Both charging and discharging behaviors are controlled by the phase angle of voltages applied on both sides of the transformer in each phase. Theoretical analysis and design consideration of the converter are presented. A lab-scaled converter prototype with 48V/20AH Li+Fe battery was established to validate effectiveness of the proposed method.

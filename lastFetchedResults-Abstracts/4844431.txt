Modeling and identification of dynamic systems often is a prerequisite for the engineering of technical solutions, for example control system design. This paper presents an multi objective evolutionary approach for identification of dynamic systems of variable structure. The evolutionary algorithm employs domain specific operators in order to evolve the block oriented structure of the model and simultaneously optimize its parameters. Based on the observed inputs and outputs the multi objective method identifies an entire set of optimal compromise models which contrast model accuracy against complexity. The models are constructed from a set of basic blocks that capture phenomenons such as linear transfer functions, nonlinear gains and hysteresis that typically occur in mechanical, hydraulic and electrical systems. This representation enables the incorporation of domain knowledge in terms of building blocks and the interpretation of the identified model for further analysis and design. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated in the identification of an artificial dynamic system as well as a hydraulic proportional valve.

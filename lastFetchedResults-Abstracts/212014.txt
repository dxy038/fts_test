Background and the purpose of the study: Tuberculosis is curable if patients take sufficient
uninterrupted therapy. Most experts acknowledge importance of patient adherence in efforts
to control of the disease. This cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the rate of
compliance to anti-tuberculosis regimens by means of urine tests in newly diagnosed
tuberculosis patients.
Method: Investigation was carried out in Tehran University of Medical Sciences Teaching
Hospitals, Tehran, IRAN. Fifty patients completed the study. The patients' urine samples
were obtained at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 months of the study. Simple chemical methods were used
to detect Isoniazid, Rifampin, and pyrazinamide, the three main drugs in tuberculosis
treatment regimens. Urine tests at months of 0 and 1 of the study were considered as control
tests.
Results: After the first month, the patients' compliance was about 96%. At months of
second, fourth and sixth, the whole adherence rates were 56 %, 76% and 81% respectively.
Conclusion: About 30% of patients were non-compliant with treatment regimen which was
more frequent than presumed; therefore detection of non-adherent patients is an essential
subject in developing countries.

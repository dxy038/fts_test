We consider a multi-cell wireless network with universal frequency reuse and treat the problem of co-channel interference mitigation in the downlink channel. Assuming that each base station serves multiple single-antenna mobiles via space-division multiple-access, we jointly optimize the linear beam-vectors across a set of coordinated cells and resource slots: the objective function to be maximized is the instantaneous weighted sum-rate subject to per-base-station power constraints. After deriving the general structure of the optimal beam-vectors, a novel iterative algorithm is presented which attempts to solve the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the non-convex problem at hand. The proposed algorithm admits a distributed implementation which we illustrate. Also, various approaches to choose the initial beam-vectors are considered, one of which maximizes the signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. Finally, simulation results are provided to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Determining of sprouting efficiency and sprout distribution pattern on stump are two main features of coppice regeneration dynamics. The goal of this study was to compare the sprouting efficiency in different geographical aspects of stumps. To gain this objective, 45 Lebanon oak trees were cut in 5 sites of Armardeh forests. The stumps were fenced individually and each stump divided into 8 sections, with 45Â° angle wide. The number of sprouts was measured in each section separately. Geographical aspects were defined by pooling mentioned sections. Analyzing the results showed that southern aspects of stump have more sprouts than northern aspects significantly, owing to get more light and heat. Sprouting pattern in each site indicated different patterns in northern and southern slopes. In northern slopes, southern aspect had the most sprouts while in southern slopes; northern aspect had the most sprouts. These results show that sprouting pattern was affected by sun light direction. Therefore, we suggest that integrated effects of aspects and slopes would have been taking into account to determine the sprouting pattern.

Recently, number of on-board visual display, such as a navigation system is increasing. A driver gazes such display in short period of time in driving. Thus, it is important to improve visibility of the on-board display. We propose two methods about visibility improvement of on-board display. First, we mention about simulating method of creation of the perceived brightness distribution of a scene which is useful for design of the high visibility on-board display. Second, we describe displaying method for the on-board display to control luminance and chromatic saturation of displaying image. Both methods are based on the adaptation property of human vision. Experimental results of subjective and objective evaluation that compare the conventional display and our new one indicate the effectiveness of the second method

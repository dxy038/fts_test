We present a method for optimizing antenna designs for hepatic microwave ablation using computer models and mathematical optimization algorithms. We illustrate the usefulness of this technique by optimizing several choke antenna designs using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The optimization procedure yields antennas that produce spherical ablation zones up to 4.6 cm in diameter.

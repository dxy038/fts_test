An analytical calculation of the acoustic transmission loss of sound propagating through a thin cylindrically curved piezoelectric membrane, which is rigidly clamped at its straight ends, is presented. The membrane is placed inside an acoustic tube and connected to an active electric shunt circuit that behaves as a negative capacitor. A properly adjusted shunt circuit has a significant impact on the effective elastic stiffness of the piezoelectric membrane and, hence, influences the membrane acoustic reflectivity and transmission loss of sound. Such a setup represents a noise control system based on the principles of the active elasticity control of piezoelectric materials. The non-uniform radial motion of the clamped membrane and its interaction with the acoustic field and the electric shunt circuit are analyzed. The main objective of the calculations, which are based on Donnellâ€™s theory, is the determination of the effects of the membrane clamps on the flexural motion of the membrane and, therefore, effects on the acoustic transmission loss of sound. Approximative formulae for the amplitude of the membrane displacement and the acoustic transmission loss of sound are expressed as well as the resonant frequencies of the uniform mode and flexural vibration modes.

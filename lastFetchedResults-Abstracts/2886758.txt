It is a great pleasure to welcome all of you to the IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE IWCMC 2014) in the beautiful city of Nicosia, Cyprus! We are indeed delighted that this yearÂ´s IEEE IWCMC accomplishes its goal under the conference theme &#8220;Connecting the World,&#8221; and continues its tradition of providing the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reporting on the cutting edge research in the general areas of wireless communications and mobile computing. This year, we received more than 595 submissions from 35 countries. Each paper received at least three peer technical reviews, comprised of more than 500 TPC members from academia, government laboratories, and industries. After carefully examining all review reports, the IEEE IWCMC 2014 TPC finally selected about 34% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the IEEE IWCMC 2014 proceedings. The conference program starts on Monday August 4<sup>th</sup> with a full day Tutorials that are free of charge to all our attendees. Then, each day starts with a keynote speaker chosen from renowned world-class leaders in the area-Dr. Mario Gerla, Dr. Fumiyuki Adachi, and Dr. Tarik Taleb, highlighting the latest research trends in the wireless communications, mobile computing, and networks. This year, the technical sessions reflect the continued and growing interests in a wide range of spectrum, including wireless communications and networks, cross-layer design and optimization, mobile computing, wireless sensor networks, network security, and use of wireless technologies in social applications. There are two special sessions composed of invited papers from renowned experts from around the world. Outstanding papers will be selected for possible Special Issues in international journals. Our objective in the future is to reduce the acceptance rate and improve the quality of presentations and discussions furthe- .

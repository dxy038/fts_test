The main objective of this paper is to develop and experimentally verify a new technique to detect an inter-turn short circuit in one phase of a stator winding of an induction motor energized from a vector-controlled drive. This is in order to overcome the fault masking difficulties associated with the concept of depending on the actual magnetic field pendulous oscillation between the conventional voltage and current space vectors with respect to a reference that is unaltered by the compensation action of the drive. This technique is based on the flux pendulous oscillation phenomenon. This flux pendulous oscillation is also described in this paper, this in addition to the magnetic field pendulous oscillation previously addressed in prior publications. The new approach has been verified through experimental results which are represented here.

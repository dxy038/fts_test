Internet users in Korea are obtaining IP addresses from DNS (Domain Name System) using unfamiliar English (or Roman character) domains in order to access their host systems. Description orders in English domains are different from the ones in Korean. Although the main objective of using English abbreviations is to facilitate remembering and recording of the domains, the opposite effects are being witnessed. This paper describes how it will be possible to process Korean domains by making improvements on the DNS. Korean naming convention has been established and DNS has been extended to enable Korean domain service through STROP (SLD Translation and Reverse Ordering Program for Korean). Dissatisfaction with domain name distribution caused by use of Roman characters can also be easily resolved with this domain name system. These solutions are expected to ultimately contribute to wider usage of the Internet in KOREA

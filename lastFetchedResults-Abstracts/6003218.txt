This paper deals with modeling interaction between Electro-Magnetic (EM) wave and the complex target. The first objective is to estimate monostatic and bistatic Radar Cross Section (RSC) of a complex target. The second objective is to present a new approach to compute the RCS of complex target (typically a boat). The target is modeled in 3D using computer aided design (CAD) to generate triangular facet meshing, as does CATIA software. From the triangular mesh, we propose to implement a parallelepiped mesh technique. This new mesh approach allow to introduce more precesely target in its environment and can be used in remote sensing domain.

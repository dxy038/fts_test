The authors performed a computerized analysis of ambulatory Holter recordings in patients with cardiac arrhythmias associated with prolonged ventricular repolarization. The objective was twofold: first, to quantitate the cycle length determinants of cardiac arrhythmias, with specific reference to the R-R intervals immediately preceding the onset of events. Second, to determine the probability of occurrence of events following given beat template sequences. Two algorithms were utilized: a systematic analysis of the arrhythmic events and an automatic analysis of the 10 minutes and the 10 cycles preceding given target events. Five interval variables in their sequential order were retained for the statistical analysis

This paper deals with motion control problem for a 2 DOF small driving simulator. The main idea is to test and compare performances of different Washout algorithms applied to such platform category. The experimentations allow us to have the best compromise between quality of the human perception, implementation complexity and platform architecture type. Implementation of different washout algorithms (optimal, adaptive and classical one) are discussed. For an objective comparison, the classic algorithm was synthesized so as to take into account the human perception thresholds and the platform workspace limitations. A modelling of a second DOF (seat tilting) is given and simulated to show the inertial effect of the seat movement. Finally, psychophysics study, experimental results and conclusion are given

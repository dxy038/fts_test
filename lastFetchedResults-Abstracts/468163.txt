Objective: Our purpose was to determine the predictive values of primary or secondary screening for cervical human papillomavirus infection for cytologic detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Study Design: Most of the 254 women referred for colposcopy in Västerbotten County in Sweden during October 1993 through December 1995 and 320 age-matched women from the general population were screened for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid by nested general-primer polymerase chain reaction. Results: Ninety-six percent of women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia had human papillomavirus, compared with 4% of women with normal findings (odds ratio 606; 95% confidence interval 137 to 5607). Thirty-seven percent of referred women and 48% of referred women >39 years old had mostly minor cytologic abnormalities with no human papillomavirus. The human papillomavirus–associated positive predictive value for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was 76% in the colposcopy group and 11% in the general population, whereas the negative predictive value was >97% in both populations. Conclusion: Testing for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid seems diagnostically useful among women referred for colposcopy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:1497-502.)

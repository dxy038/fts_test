To extract value of knowledge, the multi-agent architecture of electronic commerce knowledge management system (KMS) based on agent and ontology has been introduced, which includes four major types of agent and one Function Knowledge Agency that deals with each stage of knowledge life cycle. In this architecture, Ontology is used to define a common vocabulary for agents to communicate with one another, and explicitly formalize the domain knowledge. To illustrate the architecture, a simulation work has been done and the results imply that the architecture provides a very efficient method to design electronic commerce KMS with the purposes of flexibility to apply tools, extensibility, and reusable ability of the software components. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the architecture of electronic commerce KMS, and the approach how Agent and Ontology support the electronic commerce KMS.

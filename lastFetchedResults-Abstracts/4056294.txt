Measurements on soft magnetic materials were made to determine the measurement capabilities available to the partners of a government-funded collaborative research project, with 16 partners from industry and academia. One of the objectives of this project was the development of advanced magnetic materials for novel electrical machines for use in harsh environments such as gas turbines. To establish the measurement confidence necessary to deliver this project objective, an equivalence study was undertaken. A reference core of soft magnetic material that has been measured over a period of many years at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) was distributed and the dc and ac properties were measured. The measurement systems of the three laboratories are independent and this ensured that no correlations that could skew the results existed. In the analyses, the measurements at NPL were used as the baseline. With the core capabilities established, it was possible to develop the new measurements required to deliver the overall project objectives. At NPL, a standard permeameter method was modified for the measurement of strips. This was incorporated into a stress machine to measure the dc properties of the soft magnetic materials used by the partners, at stress levels of up to 700 MPa. The results for seven materials are presented and the changes in the properties with applied stress compared to establish which materials exhibit favorable properties.

In this paper we present a multisensor-multitarget tracking testbed for large-scale distributed scenarios. The objective is to develop a testbed capable of handling multiple, heterogeneous sensors in a hierarchical architecture for maritime surveillance. The testbed consists of a scenario generator that can generate simulated data from multiple sensors including radar, sonar, IR and ESM as well as a tracker framework into which different tracking algorithms can be integrated. In the current stage of the project, the IMM/assignment tracker, and the particle filter (PF) tracker are implemented in a distributed architecture and some preliminary results are obtained. Other trackers like the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) are also planned for the future

Background and Objective: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one the most prevalent bacterial infections and Escherichia coli is the most common causative agent of UTI. However, the incidence of community acquired UTI caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli is increasing worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of blaTEM gene in E. coli isolated from UTI of outpatients in Kermanshah.
Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty E. coli strains were isolated from the midstream urinary samples of outpatients. The susceptibility of isolates to selected antibiotics was tested using disc diffusion method followed by confirmation for the ESBL producing strains using combined disc method. Finally, the blaTEM gene was determined among the ESBL producer isolates using PCR.
Results: Of 140 isolates, 34 (24.28%) were positive ESBL and PCR determined that 18(53%) of ESBL producing isolates contained blaTEM gene. When testing their susceptibility to antibiotics, 81.43% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin while all isolates were sensitive to imipenem.
Conclusion: The production of ESBL by pathogenic bacteria, in particular in outpatients, is a serious concern for the use of various beta-lactam antibiotics including the third generation of cephalosporins. Due to the presence of blaTEM gene in the high proportion of the isolates, more molecular and epidemiological studies on pathogenic gram-negative bacteria are recommended.

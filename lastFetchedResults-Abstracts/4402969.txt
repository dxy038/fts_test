In this paper, we describe our experience with time transfer sharing heterogeneous telecom infrastructure with standard data channels. The time transfer over fibre is becoming a progressive technology that can provide better results compared with traditional methods based on dedicated satellites channels. We also present recent results achieved with bidirectional optical amplification that preserves symmetry of optical path.

The objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the cutting mechanisms of polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDC) using two different lasers: (a) a near infrared Nd:YAG laser (Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) of 1064 nm wavelength and 100 Î¼s pulse width; and (b) a green light KTP (Potassium Titanyl Phosphate)/Nd:YAG laser of 532 nm wavelength and 120 ns pulse width. To realize the objective, the study applies polishing, lapping and etching processes to the cut-surfaces of the PDC samples. It further observes and analyzes the processed cut-surfaces with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. A discussion is provided to reveal the underlying physics of the laser cutting mechanisms, and a conclusion is drawn based on the outcomes from the experimental investigation and the discussion.

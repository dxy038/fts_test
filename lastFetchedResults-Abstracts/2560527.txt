The efficiency of transportation system management plays an important role in the planning and operation efficiency of flexible manufacturing systems. Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are part of diversified and advanced techniques in the field of material transportation which have many applications today and act as an intermediary between operating and storage equipment and are routed and controlled by an intelligent computer system. In this study, a two-objective mathematical programming model is presented to integrate flow shop scheduling and routing AVGs in a flexible manufacturing system. In real-life problems parameters like demand, due dates and processing times are always uncertain. Therefore, in order to solve a realistic problem, foregoing parameters are considered as fuzzy in our proposed model. Subsequently, to solve fuzzy mathematical programming model, one of the most effective technique in the literature is used. To solve the problem studied, two meta-heuristic algorithms of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGAII) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) are offered that the accuracy of mathematical models and efficiency of algorithms provided are assessed through numerical examples.

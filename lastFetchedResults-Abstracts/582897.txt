Objective: To estimate the size of groups at high risk of HIV,
Network Scale UP (NSU), an indirect method, was used.
Methods: 500 Kermanian male aged 18 to 45 were recruited. 8
groups at high risk of HIV were defined: Users of opium, unknown
drug, ecstasy, and alcohol; intra?venous drug users (IDUs; males
who have extra?marital sex with females (MSF); male who have
sex with female sex workers (MFSW); and male who have sex
with other male (MSMs). We asked respondents whether they
know anybody (probability method), and if yes, how many people
(frequency method) in our target groups.
Results: Estimates derived in the probability method were higher
than the frequency method. Based on the probability method,
13.7% (95% CI: 11.3%, 16.1%) of males used alcohol at least once
in last year; the corresponding percent for opium was 13.1% (95%
CI: 10.9%, 15.3%). In addition, 12% has extra?marital sex in last
year (95% CI: 10%, 14%); while 7% (95% CI: 5.8%, 8.2%) had sex
with a female sex worker.
Conclusion: We showed that drug use is more common among
young and mid?age males; although their sexual contacts were
also considerable. These percentages show that special preventive
program is needed to control an HIV transmission. Estimates
derived from probability method were comparable with data from
external sources. The underestimation in frequency method might
be due to the fact that respondents are not aware of sensitive
characteristics of all those in their network and underreporting is
likely to occur.

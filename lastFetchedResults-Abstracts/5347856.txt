The objective of this paper is to compare the forward link performance of a direct spread CDMA system with a spreading bandwidth of 3.6864 MHz and a multicarrier system consisting of 3 carriers each with a spreading bandwidth of 1.2288 MHz. In addition to providing a description of a multicarrier method, which is under consideration for the forward link of the next generation CDMA cellular/PCS systems, this paper summarizes performance comparison results of the two systems for a data rate of 9.6 kbps with the IMT-2000 vehicular and pedestrian channel models. The results indicate that the two systems have comparable performance for the above data rate and the IMT-2000 channel models

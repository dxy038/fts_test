The optimal choice of switches within a hysteresis controller with a d-q-related constraint is discussed in this paper. The hysteresis controller controls a bidirectional two-level three-phase standard inverter. This paper expands the options of switching processes to a former published d-q-hysteresis controller. Despite a separate active and reactive hysteresis constraint which is offered, further advantages for the d-q-controller are evaluated. This Paper describes the main functionality of the floating d-q-hysteresis controller and demonstrates a comparison with the &#945;-&#946;-control-structure.

Liquid films falling over banks of internally cooled horizontal tubes are often used to absorb mass from a surrounding vapor. This arrangement is particularly suitable for absorption processes where the vapor has a high heat of absorption and where high transfer rates and low pressure drops are required, as is the case of absorption heat pumps and other chemical processes. When the liquid film presents a significant resistance to heat and mass transfer, understanding the motion of the film is critical. However, mathematical models of these types of systems in the literature have generally made use of many simplifying assumptions about the behavior of the falling liquid. The formation, detachment, and impact of droplets and the associated waves and film disturbances can all affect the mixing of the liquid and can enhance transfer rates accordingly. The objective of this paper is to identify and visually document these deviations from idealized film behavior and discuss their implications on the heat and mass transfer processes, which are important to consider in the development of mechanistic models of the absorption process.

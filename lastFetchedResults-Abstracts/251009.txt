The paper presents a 3D-based adaptive first-order shell finite element to be applied to hierarchical
modelling and adaptive analysis of complex structures. The main feature of the element is that it is
equipped with 3D degrees of freedom, while its mechanical model corresponds to classical first-order
shell theory. Other useful features of the element are its modelling and adaptive capabilities. The element is
assigned to hierarchical modelling and hpq-adaptive analysis of shell parts of complex structures consisting
of solid, thick- and thin-shell parts, as well as of transition zones, where h, p and q denote the mesh
density parameter and the longitudinal and transverse orders of approximation, respectively. The proposed
hp-adaptive first-order shell element can be joined with 3D-based hpq-adaptive hierarchical shell elements
or 3D hpp-adaptive solid elements by means of the family of 3D-based hpq/hp- or hpp/hp-adaptive
transition elements.
The main objective of the first part of our research, presented in this paper, is to provide non-standard
information on the original parts of the element algorithm. In order to do that, we present the definition of
shape functions necessary for p-adaptivity, as well as the procedure for imposing constraints corresponding
to the lack of elongation of the straight lines perpendicular to the shell mid-surface, which is the procedure
necessary for q-adaptivity. The 3D version of constrained approximation presented next is the basis for
h-adaptivity of the element. The second part of our research, devoted to methodology and results of the
numerical research on application of the element to various plate and shell problems, are described in the
second part of this paper. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

The researchers carried out drilling tests using drills of various shapes to determine burr minimization. The ultimate objective of this study was to develop a compatible drill shape to minimize burr formation. For the experiment general carbide drills, round drills, chamfer drills and step drills are designed and manufactured. Burrs are generated under various cutting conditions using four different materials. A laser sensor was used to measure the burr dimensions. As a result of the experiments, step drill with specific step angle and step size Is suggested for burr minimization.

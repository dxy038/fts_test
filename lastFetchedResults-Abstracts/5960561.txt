The result was that pollution load had not been reduced effectively, and the water quality of receiving river could not meet the target. In order to solve this problem, a new methodology, Basin integrated wastewater treatment system Planning Based on Water Quality Objective, was established in this research. This kind of method was composed of basin basic survey analysis, river water quality objectives establishment, sewage treatment plant and recycled water reuse planning, pollution load forecasting, water quality model selection, river water quality simulation in only sewage treatment plants case, assisted Processing system Planning. A case study of Nanshahe River was also present in this paper, which proved that this method is suitable for Beijing actual situation, and it had strong application.

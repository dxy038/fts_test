Given the steel industry park–city paired structure commonly found across China and it associated environmental pollution, the objective of this study was to examine the spatial–temporal distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as the relative contributions of the main influx pathways in Banshan steel industry park, China. We analyzed the concentrations of 16 PAHs in soil, air, water and dry/wet deposition samples using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The concentrations of ∑16-PAHs ranged from 572 to 4654 μg/kg in April 2010; and the average concentration is 12.7% and 26.1% higher than that of April 2009 and April 2008, respectively, mainly due to the rapid increase of highly toxic high molecular weight (MW) PAHs. The principal input pathway for high and low MW PAHs was determined to be dry deposition (e.g., 69.73% for Benzo[a]pyrene) and wet deposition (e.g., 78.87% for Naphthalene), respectively. Together, 54.79% of total PAHs found in this region are via dry deposition, whereas wet deposition and river water irrigation contribute to 25.46% and 19.76% (corrected with toxic equivalency factors). The approach to the soil–air equilibrium was assessed by calculating fugacity quotients between soil and air samples, and the results indicate that the soil acted as a secondary source for light MW atmospheric PAHs and a sink for higher MW PAHs. It was also determined that the soil acted as a source for median MW PAHs, particularly PY.

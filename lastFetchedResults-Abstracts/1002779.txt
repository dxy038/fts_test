Abstract
Background/Objective: This study aimed to address the
knowledge gap in citizenship education. In other words,
there was an attempt to investigate the effect of a citizenship
education program on knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms,
and behavioral intention of high schools girls.
Methods: 228 female students, 91 in the experimental and 137
in the control groups participated in this study. A questionnaire
was used to collect the data. The educational program was run
in the experimental group using interactive teaching-learning
techniques. The research data were, then, analyzed in SPSS,
using inferential statistics.
Results: The mean score of the students’ knowledge in the
experimental group increased from 7.35±1.93 in the pretest to
11.14±1.78 in the posttest, while in the control group this score
remained approximately the same in the pre- and post-tests.
The pre- and post-test means of attitude scores were statistically
different, but not in the control group. The pretest mean scores
of the subjective norm in the experimental and control groups
were relatively similar, but in the posttest it became significantly
different (experimental: 25.78±3.77, control: 23.40±4.62). The
students’ behavioral intention score increased from 18.51±2.71
to 20.87±3.04 in the experimental group. The mean scores of
intention in the pretest and posttest were not statistically different
in the control group. In the second posttests, the levels of these
constructs remained unchanged in the control group, but they were
significantly higher than pretest scores in the experimental group.
Conclusion: This study revealed the adolescents’ need for as well
as the efficacy of a citizenship education program.

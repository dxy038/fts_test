The objective of the study was to analyze the functional and nutritional properties of enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein concentrate (WPC) and to formulate a beverage mix. WPC hydrolysates were produced using fungal protease and papain, at time intervals of 20, 40 and 60 min and were analyzed for proximate composition and functional properties. A beverage was formulated with hydrolyzed WPC, skim milk powder, cocoa, liquid glucose, sugar and vegetable fat and analyzed for physicochemical properties, sensory attributes and keeping quality. Results revealed that the protein content of WPC was 75.6% and decreased slightly on enzyme treatment (69.6%). The water absorption capacity of WPC was 10 ml/100 g and increased in enzyme treated samples from 16 to 34 ml/100 g with increase in the time of hydrolysis. Emulsion capacity (45 ml of oil/g of control WPC) showed a decreasing trend with increasing time of hydrolysis. Enzyme treatment slightly increased the foam capacity in three samples but lowered foam stability in all. The gel filtration pattern of enzyme treated samples showed an increase in low molecular weight fractions. The amino acid profile showed higher content of methionine in samples treated with enzymes, compared to the control. The in vitro protein digestibility of untreated WPC was 25% and increased in all treated samples to varying degrees (69â€“70%). Formulated beverage had 52% protein, 10% fat and 6.6% ash. There were no significant differences in the sensory attributes of formulated and commercial beverage. The formulated beverage could be stored well in a PET container for 30 days.

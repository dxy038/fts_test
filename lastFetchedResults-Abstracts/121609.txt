This study offers empirical measures for the concepts of cultural capital and social identity, analyzes the relationship between various .dimensions of cultural capital and how one defines her/himself, and examines the correlation between cultural capital and the salience of various social identities. Based on the theory advanced by Pierre Bourdieu, cultural capital has three dimensions: subjective, objective, and institutional. The study uses the theory of symbolic interaction to develop a framework to quantitatively analyze the social identity of young adults. The measurement of the dependent variable (social identity) is carried out by performing TST. Research results indicate a positive correlation between cultural capital and the salience of the four types of identity. Yet, the highest degrees of correlation are with religious and national identities while the lowest are with individual and family identities. Also, the correlation between the various types of social identity and objective and subjective dimensions of cultural capital is to some extent different from that with the institutional dimension. The last part of the article discusses the findings in terms of cultural policymaking and future research directions.

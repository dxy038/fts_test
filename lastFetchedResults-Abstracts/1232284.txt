Up to now, several computational methods have been proposed for crystal plasticity models. The main objective of these computational methods has been to overcome the problem with the non-uniqueness of active slip systems during the plastic deformation of a single crystal. Crystal plasticity models based on a single crystal yield function have been proposed as alternative algorithms to overcome this problem. But the problem with these models is that they use a highly non-linear yield function for the crystal, which makes them computationally expensive. In this paper, a computational method is proposed that would modify a single crystal yield function in order to make it computationally efficient. Also to better capture experimental data, a new parameter is introduced into the single crystal yield function to make it more flexible. For verification, this crystal plasticity model was directly applied for the simulation of hydroforming of an extruded aluminum tube under complex strain paths. It was found that the current model is considerably faster than the previous crystal plasticity model based on a power-law type single crystal yield surface. Due to its computational efficiency, the current crystal plasticity model can also be used to calculate the anisotropy coefficients of phenomenological yield functions.

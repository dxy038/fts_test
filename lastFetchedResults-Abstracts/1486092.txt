The pork industry uses pH to differentiate product of varying quality; thus, the effect of pH on shelf-life is important as time during transport is extended. The objective was to develop regression equations to predict shelf-life over a range of ultimate pH (5.42–6.26). Shelf-life was evaluated after vacuum aging pork loin sections 0, 7, 14, 21, or 28 d and during 3 d of simulated retail display (4.5 °C) for pork loin chops. Correlation coefficients indicated a strong relationship between pH and quality measurements. Regression analysis with Aging Day and pH was able to explain 87% of the variation in aerobic plate counts for pork. After 28 d of vacuum aging, loin sections from the upper end of the pH distribution had about a 3 log(1000X) greater aerobic plate count than did the lower end pH product. An increase in pH resulted in pork with lower L*, a*, b* and R630 − R580 values and as Aging Day increased, instrumental measurements of color increased slightly. Although higher pH is associated with improved pork quality, higher pH and longer aging periods will result in increased microbial proliferation and decreased shelf-life. Thus, an intermediate pH may provide the most desirable combination of quality and shelf-life when extensive aging is used.

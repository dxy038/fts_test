The penetration and freezing of hot-core material mixtures through flow channels during core disruptive accidents (CDAs) within a sodium-cooled fast reactor is one of the major concerns confronting safety designers of the next-generation reactors. The main objective of this study is to investigate those fundamental characteristics of penetration and solidification involved in channeling molten metal and solid particle mixtures over cold structures. In this study, a low-melting-point alloy (viz., Bi–Sn–In alloy) and mixtures with solid particles (of copper and bronze) were used as a simulant melt, while L-shape metal (of stainless steel and brass) and stainless steel fuel pin bundle were used as cooling structures. Two series of basic experiments were performed to study the effect solid particles have on penetration and cooling behavior under various thermal conditions of melt by varying solid particle volume fraction, structure temperature and structural geometry. Melt flows and distributions were recorded using a digital video camera and subsequently analyzed. The melt penetration length into the flow channel and the proportion of melt adhesion on structural surfaces were measured. Results indicate that penetration length becomes shorter for molten-metal/solid particle mixtures (mixed melts) compared with pure molten metal (pure melt) as well as decreases with increasing solid particles volume fraction of the melt. The present study will contribute to a better understanding of the basic thermal-hydraulic phenomena of melt freezing in the presence of solid particles and to provide an experimental database for validation and improvement of the models of fast reactor safety analysis codes.

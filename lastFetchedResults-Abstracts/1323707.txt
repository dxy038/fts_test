Background: Primary malignant bone tumors are heterogeneous groups of neoplasms, which affect mainly children and adolescents. The most common types are Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Elevation of sCD30 and sCD40L has been observed in lymphoma, leukemia and autoimmune disorders. Objective: To evaluate serum concentrations of sCD30 and sCD40L in patients with primary malignant bone tumors. Method: Fifty-four cases (31 Osteosarcomas, 14 Ewing sarcomas, and 9 Chondrosarcomas) and 54 healthy controls enrolled in this study. Cases with the history of prior treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) were excluded from the study. Serum levels of sCD30 and sCD40L were detected by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Mean serum concentration of sCD30 in Ewing sarcoma was significantly higher than that of the control groups (p=0.007), but mean serum concentrations of sCD30 in osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma groups were not significantly different, compared to the controls (p=0.41 and p=0.11, respectively). Mean serum concentrations of sCD40L in osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and chondrosarcoma groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.0001). In addition, the mean serum level of sCD40L in chondrosarcoma patients was higher than that of both Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: sCD30 and sCD40L increase in primary bone tumors; however the significant of these findings for diagnosis or prognosis of these tumors needs further investigation.

The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of high throughput (HT) screening techniques for pressure-driven membrane processes. For this purpose, a HT-filtration module, allowing to perform 16 pressure-driven separations simultaneously, was designed. The potential of the developed equipment and of the HT-screening concept in general was validated by demonstrating both the reproducibility of experimental flux and selectivity data, and the scalability of these data between the HT-module and a conventional dead-end filtration set-up. Data were obtained with two solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes: a laboratory-prepared polyimide (PI) and a commercial MPF-50 membrane. The reproducibility of the data was highly encouraging, proving that this HT-approach can be a useful tool to rapidly screen a large array of operational parameters in membrane processes and of synthesis parameters in the development of new membranes.

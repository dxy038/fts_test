For the past 12 years the Canadian Department of National Defence and Raytheon Canada Limited have collaborated on a cost-shared programme to develop an Integrated Maritime Surveillance (IMS) system based on HF Surface Wave Radar (HFSWR). The primary objective behind the programme was to demonstrate the capability of HFSWR to continuously detect and track surface targets (ships and icebergs) as well as airborne targets, at all altitudes, to ranges in excess of 200 nautical miles, reliably and consistently in real time and in all weathers. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the concept of IMS, involving the fusing of data from HFSWR radars and other sensors. This paper reviews techniques and methods used in the processing of HFSWR data to ensure that performance is maintained, even under adverse operating conditions.

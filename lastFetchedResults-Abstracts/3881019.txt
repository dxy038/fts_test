In this paper, we consider an adaptive multi-user resource allocation for the downlink transmission of a multi-cluster tactical multicarrier DS CDMA network. The goal is to maximize the sum packet throughput, subject to transmit power constraints. Since the objective function turns out to be noncovex and nondifferentiable, we propose a simple iterative bisection algorithm. At each iteration, a closed-form expression is derived for the transmit power, subchannel, and modulation assignment, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. We also provide an optimization algorithm for the downlink transmission under the condition of imperfect channel knowledge, and investigate the effects of both channel estimation error and partial-band jamming.

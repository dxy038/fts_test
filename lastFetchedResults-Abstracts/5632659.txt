A compact and accurate current conveyer for interfacing with a three-electrode electrochemical sensor is presented. It employs chopper stabilization to reduce transistor sizes for a given flicker noise. A current-copying circuit generates a mirror image of the sensor current for bidirectional conveying. It employs dynamic element matching to remove the mismatch in the current mirrors. The current conveyer prototyped in 0.13&#181;m CMOS consumes 4&#181;W from a 1.2V supply. It achieves an input-referred noise of 0.13pArms over a 1kHz bandwidth with a dynamic range of 8.6pA to 350nA. The prototype has been validated in DNA catalytic reporter detection.

Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three months regular aerobic exercises on levels of homocysteine, hsCRP, serum lipids (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG)), body composition and aerobic power in middle aged healthy and inactive men. 

Materials and Methods: Subjects of this study in experimental group included 11 men (age: 44.73 ± 5.03 y, height: 1.73 ± 0.04 m, weight: 81.84 ± 9.36 kg) and in control group included 10 men (age: 41.16 ± 8.03 y, height: 1.73 ± 0.07 m, weight: 78.18 ± 14.81 kg). They performed three months (three days/week) aerobic exercise program with an intensity of their 75% to 85% of maximum heart rate. Before and after the trainings, their aerobic power, body composition and fasting levels blood variables were measured. Analysis of data was done using SPSS-15 software at a significant level of 0.05. 

Results: Data showed that after three months aerobic exercise in experimental group, aerobic power increased and BMI, homocysteine, hsCRP, TG and TG/HDL significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Serum levels of LDL, HDL and TC, fat percent and weight in subjects of experimental group had not a significant change (p > 0.05).

Conclusion: Three months regular aerobic exercises through reduction of homocysteine and hsCRP as two emerging cardiovascular risk factors can be effective in reduction of coronary artery disease risk in middle aged healthy and inactive men.

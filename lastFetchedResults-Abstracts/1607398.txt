Background and Objective: Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are recognized as the main pathogens of urogenital tract. Mycoplasma genitalium can cause several reproductive tract inflammatory syndromes in women. 
Material and Methods: This study was conducted on 100 women with the history of abortion. The samples were obtained from cervical secretions and remaining products of curettage to diagnose Genital Mycoplasma. All samples were inoculated into PPLO Broth medium and incubated at 37?C for 3 days. 
Results: Of 21 Mycoplasma isolates, Mycoplasma hominis was isolated from both  cervical secretions and remaining products of curettage (4.26%) ; Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated from products of curettage (12.8%), cervical secretions (8.5%) and  from both samples  (6.38%).  
Conclusion: Based on the results, a high percentage of women with the history of abortion were infected with these bacteria. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of these pathogenic organisms are necessary.

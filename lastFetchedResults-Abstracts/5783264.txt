In this paper we propose an inter-cell coordination scheme that coordinates the transmission time and mode of users in neighboring cells. The scheme is designed for 3G LTE systems and therefore takes into account interface constraints especially for the uplink. The objective of the scheme is to assign physical resource blocks together with the transmission mode to users in a way that minimizes interference by maximizing a utility function subject to a certain quality of service. Numerical results show that interference coordination with Dynamic-TDD actually provides significant gains when compared to Static-TDD for noticeable differences of traffic between the downlink and uplink.

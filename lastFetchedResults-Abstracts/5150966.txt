Results are presented of the testing of a rod/sphere gap with oscillatory-switching surges produced in the laboratory. These surges are unidirectional or bidirectional, and the frequency and decay rate can be controlled by varying the resistances, capacitances, and inductances of the components in a modified impulse generator circuit. The resultant output wave can be either unidirectional or bidirectional and of either polarity, and the waveform can be predetermined by analysis on a computer

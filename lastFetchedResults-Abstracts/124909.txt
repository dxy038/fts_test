BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are many researches regarding association between periodontal problem and smoking but there are a few studies about this relationship and the changes in salivary composition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of smoking on salivary composition in subjects with moderate periodontitis before and after periodontal therapy.
METHODS: In this study saliva samples were taken from 30 patients (15 smokers and 15 nonsmokers) with mean age of 33 who referred to periodontal clinic of BaboI dental faculty. Laboratory parameters were SIgA, SIgG, Na, K, Ca, P, Mg, Albomin and Amylase. Salivary sampling was done in two stages before and after scaling. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and t-test.
FINDINGS: The concentration of SIgA, K and P were greater in smokers before therapy (p<0.05). Post treatment, K and P level were greater in smokers (K=18.8±0.57, P=11.27±0.8) than nonsmokers (K=16.78±0.43, P= 8.83±0,8) and Mg was greater in nonsmokers (2.73±0.55) than smokers (1.16±0.13) (p<0.05). There was a reduction of SIgA and Mg in smokers after treatment (P<0.05). The reduction of SIgA in smokers (0.08±0.011) was greater than nonsmokers (0.03±0.012) (p=0.005). Post treatment nonsmokers had reduced SIgA level and increased Ca concentration (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in SIgA level after treatment in both groups, which is related to decrease of inflammation. Smoking has not any considerable effect on salivary composition changes after periodontal therapy.

Introduction: Due to high false negative results of Pap smear, investigators are trying to design alternative tests for screening. One such option is Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA).

Objective: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of VIA as an alternative screening test for cervical cancer prevention.

Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study on 401 based on demographic questioner, three separate Pap smear, referred to alzahra hospital Gynecology clinic. All the patients were given questionnaires of demographic characteristics and then underwent 3 separate tests (Pap smear, VIA and colposcopy) simultaneously. If colposcopic evaluation was abnormal, a sample biopsy was taken. The gold standard test is considered to be colposcopyc-direted biopsy. Upon data collection, they were analyzed by statistical software SPSS version 14.

Results: As shown, 12 had abnormal Pap smear, 39 with positive VIA and 11 had abnormal colposcopy. Sensitivity of VIA was found to be 72.7%, and specificity 92.1%.Pap smear detected 83.3% CINI, 66.6% CIN III, 50% Invasive cancers whereas VTA detected 50% CINI and 100% CIN III and invasive cancers. Both tests yielded 3 false negative results. The number of false positives was higher for VIA.

Conclusion: VIA is a more powerful screening test than Pap smear but its detection ability for CIN I is lower, compared with Pap smear. In order to minimize false negative results, we propose combination of VIA and Pap smear

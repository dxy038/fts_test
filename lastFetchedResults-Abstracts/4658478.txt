A Multi-Objective Antenna Placement Genetic Algorithm (MO-APGA) has been proposed for the synthesis of matched antenna arrays on complex platforms. The total number of antennas required, their position on the platform, location of loads, loading circuit parameters, decoupling and matching network topology, matching network parameters and feed network parameters are optimized simultaneously. The optimization goal was to provide a given minimum gain, specific gain discrimination between the main and back lobes and broadband performance. This algorithm is developed based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique for producing diverse solutions when the number of objectives is increased beyond two. The proposed method is validated through the design of a wideband airborne SAR.

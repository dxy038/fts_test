This paper purposes to describe S.PERERE (simulation of performance in error), a human behavior computational simulator, which main objective is to produce, in a random way, human error states. For the generation of error states, S.PERERE has a behaviour disturber mechanism and also a mechanism to start the perturbations. The construction of the simulator is based on ACT-R (atomic components of thought - rational) cognitive architecture

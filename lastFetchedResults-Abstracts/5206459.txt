With the new generation of full low floor passenger trains, the constraints of weight and size on the traction transformer are becoming stronger. The ultimate target weight for the transformer is 1 kg/kVA. The reliability and the efficiency are also becoming more important. To address these issues, a multilevel topology using medium frequency transformers has been developed. It permits to reduce the weight and the size of the system and improves the global life cycle cost of the vehicle. The proposed multilevel converter consists of sixteen bidirectional direct current converters (cycloconverters) connected in series to the catenary 15 kV, 16.7 Hz through a choke inductor. The cycloconverters are connected to sixteen medium frequency transformers (400 Hz) that are fed by sixteen four-quadrant converters connected in parallel to a 1.8 kV DC link with a 2f filter. The control, the command and the hardware of the prototype are described in detail.

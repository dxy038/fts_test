Conventional images store a very limited dynamic range of brightness. The true luma in the bright area of such images is often lost due to clipping. When clipping changes the R, G, B color ratios of a pixel, color distortion also occurs. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to enhance both the luma and chroma of the clipped pixels. Our method is based on the strong chroma spatial correlation between clipped pixels and their surrounding unclipped area. After identifying the clipped areas in the image, we partition the clipped areas into regions with similar chroma, and estimate the chroma of each clipped region based on the chroma of its surrounding unclipped region. We correct the clipped R, G, or B color channels based on the estimated chroma and the unclipped color channel(s) of the current pixel. The last step involves smoothing of the boundaries between regions of different clipping scenarios. Both objective and subjective experimental results show that our algorithm is very effective in restoring the color of clipped pixels.

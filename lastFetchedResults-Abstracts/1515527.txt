Distributions of functional groups in individual chromatographic adsorbent particles have been investigated using confocal Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Measurements have been performed with different microscope objectives and it was found that an immersion objective should be used when wet adsorbent particles are analysed. Nd3+ ions have been used as fluorescence probes to evaluate the distribution of chelating and negatively charged functional groups. The fluorescence spectrum from Nd3+ has also been used to obtain information about the coordination of Nd3+ within the adsorbent particles.

Control of turbocharged diesel engines is a challenging task due to system nonlinearities and constraints on the inputs and process variables. In this paper nonlinear model predictive control is applied to control a diesel engine with a variable geometry turbocharger and an exhaust gas recirculation valve. The overall control objective is to regulate the setpoints of the air-fuel ratio and the amount of recirculated exhaust gas in order to obtain low exhaust emission values and low fuel consumption without smoke generation. Simulation results are presented to study the advantages and disadvantages of nonlinear model predictive control. The achieved performance is compared in simulations with a linear state feedback controller and an input-output linearization based control method. As shown, nonlinear model predictive control achieves good overall control performance and constraint satisfaction.

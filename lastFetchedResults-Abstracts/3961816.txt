This paper presents knowledge representation-oriented nets (KRON), a knowledge representation schema for discrete event systems (DES). KRON enables the representation and use of a variety of knowledge about a DES static structure and its dynamic states and behavior. It is based on the integration of high-level Petri nets with frame-based representation techniques and follows the object-oriented paradigm. The main objective considered in its definition is to obtain a comprehensive and powerful representation model for data and control of DES. The use of the DES behavioral knowledge is governed by a control mechanism stored in a separate inference engine. KRON provides an efficient execution mechanism to make the models evolve. This is an adaptation of the RETE matching algorithm in order to deal with the features provided by high-level Petri nets and it takes advantage of its integration with a frame/object-oriented representation schema, Moreover, KRON facilitates dealing with decision points in the execution of nondeterministic models. A prototype of a simulation tool with graphical display and animation facilities has been implemented for KRON and it has been used in several case studies in the manufacturing systems domain

Background/Objective: Ultrasonography is an imaging modality which is easy to use and less expensive than other imaging methods. It is becoming more widely available in regions of the world where Fasciola hepatica infestation is prevalent. In this report, we described the sonographic findings of hepatic lesions in patients with fascioliasis. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 248 patients with confirmed hepatic fascioliasis from Guilan province who were referred by internists or infectious disease specialists to private sonographic offices were studied. Abdominal sonography was performed in supine and left decubitus positions using an Aloka 288 scanner and a 3.5 MHz transducer. Results: Out of 176 hepatobiliary involvement, the right lobe of liver and the periportal area with echoic or hypoechoic lesions, had the most involvement (45.2%). There were lesions in the gallbladder of 34 (13.7%) and biliary tracts of 17 (7%) patients. There was coincident in-volvement of both liver and biliary tracts in 13 (5.2%) patients. Conclusion: Sonography is a useful method to confirm hepatobiliary lesions in human fascio-liasis and can facilitate the diagnosis of this condition, particularly in areas where it is endemic.

The estimation of optimal values of a model parameters has an important role in early stages of V-cycle based mechatronic design of a system. Utilization of a model with flexible bodies in the objective function of the optimization procedure leads due to its high order to the lengthy or unfeasible optimization calculations. It is presented an utilization of a linear time invariant model (state-space LTI) of a system with flexible bodies represented by a block model which overcomes the mentioned difficulties. The model consists of two blocks - a) block containing mainly state-space LTI of flexible bodies which does not depend on values of searched parameters and b) block which depends on them. This allows clear and effective representation of the problem, its efficient implementation and, consequently, finding the optimal values of the required basic parameters. The formulation of the task will be demonstrated on three studies. The first one deals with the location of optimal values of design parameters of absorber connected to the flexible cantilever, the second one deals with vibration energy harvesting device and the last one with damping of heavy machine tool long axis.

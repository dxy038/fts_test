The main objective of this paper is to design and optimize the edge fed microstrip patch antenna and to improve efficiency by improving the parameters such as return loss and frequency of operation. In this paper, the various antenna characteristics for patch antenna are achieved by using dege feeding techniques. The patch antenna using edge feed is simulated using IE3D simulator for 3.3GHz operating frequency with acceptable return loss of -12db and circular polarization is achieved. The simulation of antenna is done using dielectric material FR4 with dielectric constant of 4.4. The designed antenna can be used for wireless LAN and mobile communication.

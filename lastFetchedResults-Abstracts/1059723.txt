Many works showed that the change of sliding direction is a factor worsening wear between two bodies in contact. The objective of this study is to propose a model of wear able to reply these observations. This model tries to show that part of the multidirectional effects is due to the variation of wear rate according to the number of cycles. The results presented in this paper come from numerical calculations. They show that using a wear coefficient depending on the sliding distance, one can obtain, for a rectangular motion pattern, a volumetric wear up to 2 times more important than for a rectilinear motion pattern.

The methodology for the development of a fat phantom that simulates ultrasound parameters is described in this paper. The objective of this development is to provide a test body that simulates the ultrasound speed and the ultrasound attenuation in human fat. The elaboration protocols as well as the parameters estimation procedures are described. The results in ultrasound speed and attenuation in a range of temperature from 20degC to 50degC, in successive increments of 1degC, are presented. This range includes the temperatures used in our experimental works in hyperthermia. The results show that the speed of sound of fat phantom decrease with the increment of temperature and the attenuation remain almost constant.

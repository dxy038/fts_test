This paper compares a traditional fuzzy logic controller with two new proposals of defuzzification based on Boolean relations. The objective of the controller is to reduce the electromechanical oscillations like a classical power system stabilizer. The design of controllers begins from of a previous developments in fuzzy logic and fuzzy logic type 2 tested in simulation before, each one is presented including a justified theoretical and methodology explanation of the contribution mentioned and modified with the defuzzification proposals. Time response is evaluated in a multimachine system of two areas for each method.

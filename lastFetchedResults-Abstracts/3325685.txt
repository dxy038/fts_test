Clay-Pot-Refrigerator is a Pottery article to cool vegetables and keep them safe and fresh without shrinkage. Pot-Coolers are produced by the potters´ clusters, like village potter´s association in different regions of India. Pottery clusters are developing a new model of Clay-Pot-Refrigerator based on the naturally available terracotta clay. Decision-making problems in new model/product selection often involve a complex decision-making process in which multiple requirements and conditions have to be taken into consideration simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to select the best Clay-Pot-Refrigerator model using Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) of alternatives with Grey relations method. The best Clay-Pot-Refrigerator model will be helpful to potters clusters to improve their production on the particular model Pot to meet the customers´ expectation. An extended presentation of the data and results of the case analysed is proposed in order to show the characteristics of the product model and performance of the COPRAS of alternatives with grey relations method.

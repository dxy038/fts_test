The integration of interaction and simulation in e- learning systems represents a milestone in educational research and supports the student\´s learning process in innumerable ways. Nevertheless, current standards do not provide appropriate mechanisms to obtain a significant assessment about the student\´s performance while interacting with a simulation neither to influence on the teaching-learning process. This work proposes a SCORM-compliant architecture which includes a tutoring module for simulations (TMS). The main objective consists in providing mechanisms to track and "observe" the student\´s performance (while interacting with a simulation), thus enabling the TMS to take decisions or intervene when necessary, and/or to modify the course of the simulation.

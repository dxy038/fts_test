No satellite system is designed to last forever. By 2007, the US Navy expects the ultra high frequency (UHF) follow-on (UFO) satellite constellation to start to show its age. Although the degraded health of the UFO satellite constellation is several years away, the US Navy has already begun to study when and how to replace UFO. With enthusiastic help from the joint community, the US Navy is taking steps today to develop the requirements for a replacement system to UFO called the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)

Objective (s): War is an event that causes physical and psychological disorders. One of these complications is blindness that may occur in one or two eyes. The blindness may affect the adjustment state of warfare veterans. This study aimed to investigate the emotional and social adjustment among warfare veterans with blindness.
Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study of 45 warfare veterans in Zanjan, Iran. Participants were suffering from one eye blindness. Data was collected by the Bell Adjustment inventory. We used SPSS software to analyze the data performing one-way analysis of variance.
Results: The mean age of veterans was 48Â±7 years. The results showed that 53.4% of the sample had poor emotional adjustment. With regard to social adjustment 44.4% of the sample had fair and 44.4% had moderate adjustment. There was a meaningful difference between social adjustment and age (p=0.017). Also there was a meaningful difference in mean emotional adjustment scores among veterans (p=0.022). However, there were no differences in mean emotional and social adjustment scores with marital status, education, exercise and reason of injury.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that many veterans with eye blindness suffer from poor emotional and social adjustment. Indeed further attention to this population and their needs are recommended.

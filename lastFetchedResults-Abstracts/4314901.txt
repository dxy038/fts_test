The paper proposed optimal design and control of a 5kW PPS control bidirectional dc-dc converter. In this paper, we will propose the losses model based on different kinds of semiconductor switches: MOSFET or IGBT and different input voltage: 42V or 380V. Based on the loss model, we are able to design the PPS control bidirectional dc-dc converter with minimized switch losses. The dynamic model of the converter will be designed to design the feedback control system. A new control strategy is proposed, which is based on the dynamic model.

Background: Finding new antitumor compounds is essential for treating cancer. Streptomyces species are
the major producers of antitumor agents. The objective of the present study was to screen the products of
soil isolated Streptomyces species using cell culture technique to detect antitumor agents.
Methods: Growth curve of Streptomyces was determined. In the production process. spore suspensions
were inoculated to preculturc medium and after 48 hours incubation. the bacteria were transferee to
production medium. After 120 hours incubation of production medium, the process was stopped and
fermentation broths were obtained. "Differential agar diffusion bioassay for cytotoxic substances". as a
technique, was performed for the screening of antitumor compounds, so that the fenncntation broths were
examined on mouse T cell lymphoma using the mentioned technique. Cytotoxicity effect on T cell
lymphoma was detected with appearance of blue zone on the cultures containing cancerous cells.
Results: Two out of 125 products of Streptomyces showed positive result (blue zone). Conclusion: Two
soil isolated Streptomyces products exhibited cytotoxic activity against tumor cell line. Therefore, these
two products may have antitumor properties which warrant the need of further investigations

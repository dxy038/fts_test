This paper describes a prototype configuration management tool applied to the design, planning, evaluation, and maintenance of network hierarchical structures. Specifically designed for future ad hoc military networks, the versatile tool supports a) rapid deployment of large numbers of nodes with heterogeneous links, and b) rapid adaptation to changing environment or mission needs. The tool, called multi-objective network optimization and analysis tool (MONOPATI), has three main components: the network environment simulator component, the network optimization component and the statistics collection and visualization component. The network environment simulator can generate diverse topologies and apply several random, group and custom mobility models. The statistics component collects and visualizes real-time network and performance metrics. The network optimization component uses an enhanced version of simulated annealing (SA) for rapid network optimization and assessment based on the objectives and constraints. A unique feature of MONOPATI is the flexible mathematical representation of goals in objective functions and constraints; thus quantifying hierarchy goodness. This paper highlights the application and effectiveness of MONOPATI in forming and evaluating structures that satisfy diverse hierarchy formation objectives in dynamic ad hoc network environments

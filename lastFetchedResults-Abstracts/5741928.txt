Objective of this paper is to present the application of interception model developed in previous study. This model estimates canopy interception loss annually with temporal resolution effects. To derive the equation, precipitation data with different temporal resolutions (ranging from one hour to twenty four hours) and depth of storage capacity varies from 0.1 to 10.0mm were prepared and applied. Parameters to calculate the annual interception loss are the annual precipitation, depth of storage capacity, and the temporal resolution of the data available at the selected locations. Hydrological data with different temporal resolution generated from 28-years hourly hydrological data set is applied to a simple interception model. The effect is significant and is quantified by a newly developed formula which relates the annual canopy evaporation with annual effective potential evaporation, depth of storage capacity, and temporal resolution of the data. The results show that the equation can be applied to estimates annual canopy interception loss.

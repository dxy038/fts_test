Moving objective detection is important in computer vision, a novel algorithm for moving objective detection and contours extraction based on level set method is presented. Firstly, an improved frame difference algorithm is used for dealing with the problem of initial moving objective detection in video sequence, with adjacent video frame subtracting technique, moving objective pixels in current image can be detected by adaptive threshold. Then expanding level set C-V model, the contours of moving object should be extracted with the energy function evolving. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively extract the contours of moving object, and detecting rate is more powerful.

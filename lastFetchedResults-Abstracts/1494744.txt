Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations from agricultural activities prompted the need to quantify greenhouse gas emissions to better understand carbon (C) cycling and its role in environmental quality. The specific objective of this work was to determine the effect of no-tillage, deep plowing and wind speeds on the soil CO2 concentration in muck (organic) soils of the Florida Everglades. Miniature infrared gas analyzers were installed at 30 cm and recorded every 15 min in muck soil plowed with the Harrell Switch Plow (HSP) to 41 cm and in soil Not Tilled (NT), i.e., not plowed in last 9 months. The soil CO2 concentration exhibited temporal dynamics independent of barometric pressure fluctuations. Loosening the soil resulted in a very rapid decline in CO2 concentration as a result of “wind-induced” gas exchange from the soil surface. Higher wind speeds during mid-day resulted in a more rapid loss of CO2 from the HSP than from the NT plots. The subtle trend in the NT plots was similar, but lower in magnitude. Tillage-induced change in soil air porosity enabled wind speed to affect the gas exchange and soil CO2 concentration at 30 cm, literally drawing the CO2 out of the soil resulting in a rapid decline in the CO2 concentration, indicating more rapid soil carbon loss with tillage. At the end of the study, CO2 concentrations in the NT plots averaged about 3.3% while that in the plowed plots was about 1.4%. Wind and associated aerodynamic pressure fluctuations affect gas exchange from soils, especially tilled muck soils with low bulk densities and high soil air porosity following tillage.

The problem considered is that of a multiple conductor transmission line with arbitrarily positioned impedances in series with each wire. The objective is to determine the currents in each of the loads in terms of the amplitude of the incident electric field. The groundwork is laid in this paper for a very general theory for N wire structures when the impedances are situated at the centers of the conductors. If the load elements are in echelon rather than centrally positioned, it appears necessary to abandon the simultaneous integral equation approach employed and resort to the use of two network theorems: superposition and compensation. It is demonstrated that the results depend on a synthesis of antenna and transmission line behavior. This work is an extension to the theory of end-loaded conductors published previously in the G-EMC TRANSACTIONS.

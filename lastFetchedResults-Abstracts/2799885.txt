In this paper, we have discussed the progress in the area of video quality assessment by presenting ITU standardized subjective assessment and objective assessment recommendations. Due to the need of effective video quality assessment, efforts have been made to standardize the video quality metrics. For this the efforts of VQEG and ITU have been discussed. Non-standardized objective metrics and the various video quality databases are discussed. The information regarding the video quality assessment is presented to understand the various aspects affecting the video quality assessment. Research issues in the area of video quality assessment are also discussed.

This paper presents a method of taking into account the uncertainty when the Feature Selective Validation (FSV) method is used. Nowadays, there is no doubt about the important role played by the FSV to do an objective process of validation. However, until now the uncertainty has not been considered in the validation process. This paper presents an alternative way to calculate the possible value of FSV, when the uncertainty is contemplated. We show the importance of this technique when defining the validation criteria for the computational electromagnetics method. Finally, in order to show the application and the importance of the method, a real case considering the test lab measurement uncertainty is analyzed.

The basic objective of the paper is to design a microstrip patch antenna for UWB wireless communication. The paper presents different types of microstrip antennas and compares their performance based on various characteristics so as to find the best antenna that can be used for 4-G communication. In this paper we have designed three antenna-C-shaped antenna, E-shaped antenna and 2F-shaped antenna. We have compared them on the basis of gain, return loss, radiation efficiency and VSWR. Conclusion has been drawn from the three designs and the antenna providing optimal performance is selected for further implementation.

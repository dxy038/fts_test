Background: Patients using topically applied corticosteroids are at risk of developing allergic contact hypersensitivity. Objective: To assess prevalence of allergic contact hypersensitivity reactions to inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids. Methods:  A prospective study of 30 adult patients using inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids for conditions such as allergic rhinitis was performed. We used epicutaneous patch testing to determine the prevalence of allergic contact hypersensitivity to corticosteroids and common additives (propylene glycol and benzalkonium chloride) in inhaled and nasal corticosteroid preparations in this population. Results:  Of 30 patients, 4 (13%) had positive patch test results. 3 (10%) were allergic reactions and 1 (3%) was an irritant reaction. Half of the reactions were to a corticosteroid (budesonide) and half were to a common preservative in nasal preparations (benzalkonium chloride). Conclusion:  This study supports other clinical evidence that contact dermatitis/mucositis from inhaled or intranasal corticosteroid products can occur. The corticosteroids or added agents such as preservatives can be causative and may result in allergic or irritant reactions, which can be relevant to clinical symptoms.

In an electrical distribution system, fault occurs as a result of equipment failure and is isolated by protective devices. So some critical loads are left without supply. Fast restoration of supply to these critical loads is necessary for the system survivability. Hence a specified search strategy is used to detect the most optimal and efficient restorative path satisfying all the system constraints. The main objective of this paper is to restore the service to these critical loads using depth first search and breadth first search.

Beyond the conventional idea that high resolution is equal to high quality on a computer screen, we are making basic research to develop the extra high quality imaging system, which can convey high order sensations. High order sensations mean highly artistic impressions and emotional information. We have carried out an assessment test of extra high quality images by subjective and objective methods. Extra high quality images can convey high order sensations, which include high quantization for one of the important physical factors. We have assessed image quality versus quantization level. It has been observed that, in EEG measurement, the power of &#945;-EEG has been higher value in images with higher quantization level, especially in the &#8220;MIROKU&#8221; image (a kind of BuddhaÂ´s image, monochrome). It is expected that EEG measurement is able to assess high order sensations included in extra high quality images practically

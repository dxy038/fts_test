We present a method for test power reduction in compression-based reconfigurable scan architectures. In addition to their key objective of minimizing Test Data Volume (TDV), we illustrate how the distribution of care bits in scan chains can be manipulated with the objective of reducing the number of transitions during test. Hence, peak and average power of shift and capture operations are effectively reduced.

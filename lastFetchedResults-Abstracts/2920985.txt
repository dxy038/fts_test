A growing need has been felt in Sweden for better knowledge of the loads in the power distribution networks and for better load information processing methods. The Association of Swedish Electric Utilities has therefore initiated a nationwide load data measurement programme and research project aimed at developing a new load information processing method. On the basis of the measurements, statistical demand curves have now been produced for several different customer categories. To facilitate the use of these calculated demand curves, a forecast program has been developed. The demand curves and associated forecast program are available for VAX computers and IBM PCs. The objective has been to make the forecast program as easy as possible to use. The only data that has to be entered is information which is normally available within the electricity supply utility. The authors discuss the analysis and forecast models

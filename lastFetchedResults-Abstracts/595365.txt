Objective: To determine the role of acupuncture in the management of frozen shoulder. Material and Method: This study was conducted on patients with frozen shoulder at Pain and Plegia center Peshawar from the year 1999 to 2005. Patients having frozen shoulder as sequelae of hemiplegia, those having pain in the region of the shoulder and upper arm due to cervicobrachialgia or due to pain in suprascapular region were excluded from this study. Patients with advanced uncontrolled diabetes but without restriction of movements around shoulder joint were also not included in the study. All patients were treated with electro-acupuncture around the rotator cuff muscles. An isolated trigger spot was identified at the tendon of long head of biceps brachii in the intertubercular sulcus ( bicipital groove). In most cases this trigger spot gradually faded away. Only in three cases the trigger spot was stubborn enough to be treated with local instillation of 40mg. of triamcinolone acetonide. Results: Out of 17 cases, 15 (88%) had complete recovery. Only two cases failed to respond. One among them had adhesive capsulitis while other after a year turned out to have malignancy. Conclusion: The lesion in frozen shoulder is inflammation of the tendon sheath of long head of Biceps brachii localized in the intertubercular sulcus. Frozen shoulder is a treatable condition and acupuncture can play an effective role in it.

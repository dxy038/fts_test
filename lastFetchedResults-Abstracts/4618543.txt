The new design method of an fuzzy edge detector based adaptive quantization image coding (fuzzAQC) is proposed. In this design first the image is decomposed to blocks and each block is AQC compressed according to their fuzzy classification as either edge or smooth blocks. This classification depends on Entropy Optimized Histogram based fuzzy edge detector. The block is coded with Bit plane, Quantization step and Block min or Block Mean. The experimental results shows that the proposed fuzzAQC scheme is superior to conventional AQC and Intensity based AQC on objective measures like MSE PSNR along with visual quality.

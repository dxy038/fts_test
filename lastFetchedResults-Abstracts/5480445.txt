The Xpatch software package, used to generate very accurate electromagnetic scattering predictions, consists of two programs, Xpatchf and Xpatcht. These programs are for frequency domain and time domain analysis respectively. The research presented focuses on the frequency domain version, Xpatchf, which currently requires a significant amount of time to generate a scattering prediction for an average object. However, real-time radar signature prediction needs to perform these same calculations in less than one second. The objective of this research is to produce a functional codesign model of the Xpatch software to provide significant decrease in processing time.

According to status of complex structure and integration level not high of varying mechanism in axial piston motor, design a high integration mechanism which adopt two-stage varying displacement. Its structure and working principle is introduced in detail, the maximum and minimum resistance torque when varying displacement are both studied in theory, balance equation of torque when varying are obtained by theoretical analysis, the position of swashplate under the different varying torque are also analyzed. Using radius of varying piston and relative position of two supporting plane in swashplate as optimization objective, using torque of varying displacement as constraint function, transformed it into a nonlinear optimization objective, with global searching optimization ability of genetic algorithm find optimization solution. Experiment shows this type of varying displacement mechanism that designed base on optimizing parameters has rapid response and can varying accurately.

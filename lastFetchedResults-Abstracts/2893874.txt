The main objective of this paper is to provide a excelling provision to hospitalization for patients and mainly for physician who are enable to supervise their patients at the right time in the hospital itself. The benefits of these efforts is presented, which followed by successful studies in acquiring different signals like temperature, ECG from healthy persons by using BIO-PAC system which is for signal acquisition and processing. The specific sensors and the MIT-BIH database of various arrhythmia is also used for PCG signal. It is predicted that emerging trend of mobile technologies trigger more development of this LabVIEW based applications causes contribution to the health maintenance. LabVIEW provide user-Friendly GUI Interface for experiments and analysis of various physiological parameters which is essential for patientÂ´s wellness program. The use of mobile devices and smart phones continue to expanding, and the future need for remote health care and telemedicine is certainly expanded because the national inclination to shared and integrated electronic health records is required. So the newly developed android application, directly make patient current status available to doctor which is beneficial for doctor to monitor patients.

Building construction in India is estimated to grow at a rate of 6.6% per year between 2005 and 2030 resulting in a continuous increase in demand for building materials. Fired clay bricks are the most widely-used walling materials in the country. However, over the past few decades, the development of other materials such as concrete blocks, fly ash bricks, stabilized mud blocks, etc., has created viable alternatives to bricks. There is limited understanding of the broader environmental consequences of these building materials addressing natural resource depletion, energy, environment and socio-economic impacts.

The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive assessment of materials used for wall construction by comparing one square meter of constructed wall for each of the materials. A composite Environmental Index was developed by weighting and aggregating normalized numerical scores of several parameters making use of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework. The Environmental Index was then ranked to determine walling systems that are best suited in the context of India.

Our analysis shows that wall assemblies that use non-fired products as masonry units are ranked higher compared to fired masonry unit wall assemblies. Clay fired masonry wall assemblies exhibit poorer environmental performance compared to non-fired masonry wall assemblies. When a more efficient form of construction such as the Rat-trap bond wall construction is considered, the environmental performance of clay fired brick walls is significantly improved.

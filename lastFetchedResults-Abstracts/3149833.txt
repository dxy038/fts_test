This paper analyzes the EGCS in detail and analyzes the disadvantage of multi-objective optimization method according to the feature of EGCS in the basis of general EGCS control rule and multi-objective plan. Multi-objective co-evolutionary algorithm is used EGCS to modeling because the multi-objective optimization method makes the operation speed slow in order to improve service quality and operation efficiency of elevator. So, this paper puts forward co-evolutionary arithmetic operator and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for optimal multi-objective optimization. We apply Visual Basic to simulate EGCS and simulation effect shows that the algorithm has advantage and excellent engineering application value.

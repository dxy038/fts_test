The grid characteristics significantly differ in various areas because of the broad region in China. The appropriate construction standards should b e researched according to the different supply regions. The main trans former capacity con figuration of 110~35kV substation is researched in the paper. The optimization method of main transformer capacity is proposed. The capacity optimization mathematical model is established which takes the lowest annual cost per unit area of power network as the objective function. And the corresponding grid models of different voltage levels are created. The main transformer capacities of 110~35kV substation are optimized according to the load characteristics of different supply regions and the final capacity configuration is proposed.

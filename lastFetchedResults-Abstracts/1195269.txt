The analysis of the thermal comfort in nine open plan offices was carried out in the present work. An objective evaluation, by means of environmental parameters experimentally-acquired in the selected work-places, was performed. In addition, a subjective evaluation was achieved by the distribution of a dedicated multiple response questionnaire, already developed in previous studies. The questionnaire is comprehensive of information for the application of the traditional static model and also the adaptive model, proposed by UNI EN ISO7730:2006 and ASHRAE 55.

Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values derived from questionnaire data were compared with those of the Operative Temperature. A significant correlation was found. Furthermore, the Neutral Temperature, corresponding to thermal comfort, was calculated and correlated to the Operative Temperature and to the External Temperature by means of linear regression method. In addition, a comparison between data obtained by the 588 questionnaires and data from experimental campaigns, for each work place in both morning and afternoon, is here presented. As a conclusion, parameters useful for the application of adaptive models have been elaborated according to the statistical approach suggested by recent standards.

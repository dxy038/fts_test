The objective of sensorless freehand 3-D ultrasound imaging is to eliminate the need for additional tracking hardware and reduce cost and complexity. However, the accuracy of current out-of-plane pose estimation is main obstacle for full 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) tracking. We propose a new filter-based speckle tracking framework to increase the accuracy of out-of-plane displacement estimation. In this framework, we use the displacement estimation not only for the specific speckle pattern, but for the entire image. We develop a nonlocal means (NLM) filter based on a probabilistic normal variance mixture model of ultrasound, known as Rician-inverse Gaussian (RiIG). To aggregate the local displacement estimations, SteinÂ´s unbiased risk estimate (SURE) is used as a quality measure of the estimations. We derive an explicit analytical form of SURE for the RiIG model and use it as a weight factor. The proposed filter-based speckle tracking framework is formulated and evaluated for three commonly used noise models, including the RiIG model. The out-of-plane estimations are compared with our previously proposed model-based algorithm in a set of ex vivo experiments for different tissue types. We show that the proposed RiIG filter-based method is more accurate and less tissue-dependent than the other methods. The proposed method is also evaluated in vivo on the spines of five different subjects to assess the feasibility of a clinical application. The 6-DoF transform parameters are estimated and compared with the electromagnetic tracker measurements. The results show higher tracking accuracy for typical small lateral displacements and tilt rotations between image pairs.

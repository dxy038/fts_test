In this contribution, the extraordinarily high level of thermal insulation produced
by nanoporous materials, which can achieve thermal conductivities
down to a few mW·m−1·K−1 when they are evacuated to a primary vacuum,
is highlighted. The objective here is to quantify the level of radiation heat
transfer traveling through a nanoporous material in relation with its composition.
The model used here is based on the “non-gray anisotropically scattering
Rosseland approximation,” which allows the definition of a “radiation
thermal conductivity” expressed as a function of the optical properties (complex
optical index spectra), mean sizes and volume fractions of the different
populations of particles constituting the material. With the help of this simple
model, one can draw iInteresting conclusions concerning the impacts of
different parameters related to the microstructure of the nanoporous material
on the amplitude of the radiation heat transfer. In the future, this model
should help to orient the formulation of new nanoporous materials with optimized
radiative properties

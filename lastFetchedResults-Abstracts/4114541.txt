Effective with the 1948 edition, the &#8220;AIEE Year Book&#8221; will be published and distributed in the early fall, probably during September, instead of early in the spring as it has been in recent years. The objective of this change is to make available at the beginning of the AIEE administrative year an up-to-date roster that will be a maximum service to the new officer and committee personnel and other members active in AIEE affairs. This change was recommended by the publication committee and approved by the board of directors at Pittsburgh in January. The decision also was made to continue issuance of the Year Book with the same general format and arrangement that has prevailed since 1934. It was decided further that the Year Book would continue to be distributed automatically upon issuance only to the working group of the membership comprising the local, District, and national officers, and to the personnel of national committees, but that copies also would be made available, without charge to any Associate, Member, or Fellow of the Institute upon written application to AIEE headquarters.

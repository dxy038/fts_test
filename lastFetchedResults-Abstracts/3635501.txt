Colour T. V. receivers featuring a significantly improved picture quality in many cases work with an increased line scanning frequency. The principle of bidirectional line scan with a sinusoidal deflection current can be applied with advantage. The problems of this horizontal scanning method are discussed and solutions are proposed, the feasibility of which is shown with a laboratory model.

In this paper, we present a Mixed Integer Programming formulation for the sample day selection problem. This formulation incorporates the IMC delay minutes for the purpose of modeling the effect of weather conditions in its objective function along with other performance metrics. The objective of the MIP formulation is to minimize the sum of differences between the sample averages and the full population averages. A variant of this formulation is also developed by adopting a weighting scheme based on the significance of IMC impact on the airports. Numerical results are reported and analyzed to show the effectiveness of this formulation and different choices of weighting schemes. Comparisons with the original model without IMC delay data are also presented.

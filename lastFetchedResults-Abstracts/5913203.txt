Herein we present an ITS framework to provide timely and accurate ITS forecast with the assistance of GIS (Geographic Information System) and an active sensory system. Urban settlements can be viewed as a collection of street regulators acting like points of flow control. Cars are affected in their travel performance when queuing up through these traffic controllers. These flow regulators can be defined as an integrated system of interconnected models distributed all over the urban environment. The objective is to regulate the traffic flow in a fast and secure way. We propose in this paper an approach to integrate a GIS with an active sensory system in order to provide timely and accurate ITS forecast. Our efforts are oriented to predict accurate short-term traffic conditions and reliable long-term traffic forecast with the support of available ITS technologies.

This paper is aimed to show a design of quasi-Yagi antenna which is optimized from the conventional quasi-Yagi antenna for operating at center frequency of 60 GHz. The design of antenna is initially obtained from theoretical analysis, then is optimized to reach prescribed matching impedance, to exhibit maximum gain, and to obtained a desirable bandwidth which covers the 60 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band spreading from 56 GHz to 66 GHz. Multi-objective cost function and multi-procedure optimization are used for optimizing process that is based on Genetic Algorithm. Computer simulation results of the optimized antenna are presented and discussed.

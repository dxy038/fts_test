Objective (s): Endometriosis is a common disease among women of reproductive age with negative consequences on mental and physical health as well as social life and job competency. The impact of disease on sexual health of patients has received less attention and most studies focused primarily on infertility, pain, and dyspareunia as main complaints of patients. The aim of this paper was to review the existing body of information on the impact of endometriosis and its medical and surgical treatments on sexual health of patients, providing new insight into the issue, and call attention to this overlooked aspects of women’s life.
Methods: Using the PRISMA guideline, papers published between 1975 and 2013 on the topic of endometriosis, and its treatments retrieved and with a critical narrative synthesis the effect of disease or its treatments on sexual health of patients were reviewed. 
Results: In total, 37 papers were found relevant. Of these 32 papers used quantitative methods and 5were qualitative studies. The results showed that dyspareunia was the most common symptom as part of a pain syndrome and not a sexual problem. Sexual well being of patients has been included in the treatment outcomes only in recent years. Pain, frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual function, and satisfaction, and orgasm were the most accounted outcomes.
Conclusion: Endometriosis strongly affects sexual and marital relationships and quality of life in women. Therefore, these aspects of patients’ life as well as biological and clinical indicators should be integrated into the health care and the future research.

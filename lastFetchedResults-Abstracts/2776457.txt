A systematic method for deriving multiport converters (MPCs) from the full bridge (FB) converter (FBC) and bidirectional dc-dc converters (BDCs) is proposed in this paper through sharing the parasitized switching legs by the BDCs and the FBC. By employing the proposed method, families of FB and BDC-based MPCs (FB-BDC-MPCs), including some existing ones, are developed for renewable generation systems with the merits of simple topology, reduced devices, and single-stage power conversion. Voltage regulations between any two ports can be achieved by employing pulsewidth modulation and phase-angle-shift control scheme. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching for all the switches can be realized in the proposed FB-BDC-MPCs. A typical four-port converter developed by the proposed method, named buck/boost four-port converter (BB-FPC), is analyzed in detail as an example in terms of operation principles, design considerations, and control strategy. Experiments have been carried out on a 500-W prototype of BB-FPC, which demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology derivation method.

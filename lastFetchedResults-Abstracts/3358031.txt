This paper focuses on the problem of Logistics distribution route optimization in peach products transport, which is a key step in the peach products producing. The logistics distribution route optimization problem can be converted as a graph model, and the final objective of this paper is to minimize the costs in the peach products transport. Particularly, the main innovation of this paper lies in that an improved ant colony algorithm is used to tackle the logistics distribution route optimization problem. Afterwards, using the proposed ant colony algorithm, the optimal logistics distribution route can be determined. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm, we design a simulation scheme, in which three types of vehicles and boxes are utilized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the cost of the peach products transport.

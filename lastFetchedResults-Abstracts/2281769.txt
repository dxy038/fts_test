Molecular diffusion of gases in oil plays a role in several heavy oil recovery processes. In solution gas drive, the gas diffusion coefficient has a direct impact on the amount of gas that is released and the level of supersaturation that exists during pressure depletion. In the Vapex process, molecular diffusion controls the rate at which the solvent vapour is absorbed by the oil. Molecular diffusion is also important in supercritical fluid extraction of heavy oils and in recovery of residual oil by miscible displacement. Unfortunately experimental data on gas diffusion coefficient in heavy oils are relatively scarce due to the tedious nature of diffusivity measurements. The main objective of this work was to develop a simple experimental technique for measuring gas diffusion coefficients in heavy oils. Diffusion coefficients of carbon dioxide and methane were measured by measuring the rate of gas absorption in a high-pressure windowed cell. The diffusion equation, coupled with the gas material balance equation, was used to history match the gas absorption data using the diffusion coefficient as an adjustable parameter. The diffusion coefficients calculated by this history match technique are compared with the reported values of diffusion coefficients in similar systems.

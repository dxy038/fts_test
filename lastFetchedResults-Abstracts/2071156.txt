The recurrent reciprocal selection scheme used
in the oil palm genetic improvement in Cote d’Ivoire results
on a decrease of the diversity in selected genitor’s
populations. To maintain parental diversity, introductions
were made at different levels of selection cycles. Therefore
parental diversity is essential to any objective oil palm
breeding program. This study was used to determine among
categorical variables classification criteria whose can put
most prominently this parental diversity. Various indices and
descriptors of diversity were used to appreciate parental
diversity after three cycles of selection. These indices were
based on Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Simpson diversity
index and Hill diversity index. The criteria for categorical
variables classification were based on production groups,
origin and genealogy criteria. It appears that among all the
criteria, the criterion concerning the genealogy of genitors
was the criterion that puts most prominently parental
diversity. The use of this categorical variable will maintain
within improved genitors population high variability
compared to commonly using agro-morphological variables.

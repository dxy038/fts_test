Vertex coloring is a well probed problem in graph theory. The problem of graph coloring is known to be NP-complete problem. Such NP complete problems can easily be solved with the help of distributed computing and parallelism, since distributed algorithms are applicable in many real life applications. In this paper we are using distributed algorithm for solving vertex coloring problem. The main objective of this paper is to minimize the number of colors used for achieving the proper vertex coloring of the graph. We have performed an experimental study employing distributed algorithm. We have presented an experimental analysis of simple and elegant distributed algorithm for achieving optimized vertex coloring problem.

A mathematical model for determining the best schedule for maintenance of aircraft in order to minimize expected total cost of maintenance and failure per time unit is presented. This total cost consists of the cost of inspections, the cost of repairs and overhauls, and the cost of catastrophic failure. The stochastic optimization model developed has a nonlinear objective function and a single set of simple bound constraints on integer decision variables

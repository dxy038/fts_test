There is a lack of an objective performance evaluation method for quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) algorithms. We present a novel approach to an accurate and objective performance evaluation. A simulation tool used to generate synthetic angiograms of a single coronary artery with a known centerline and diameter function is developed. It is used for an objective comparison of two QCA algorithms,

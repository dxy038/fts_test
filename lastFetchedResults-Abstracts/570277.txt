Women’s occupation affects family relations such as relations with spouse, children, as well as marital satisfaction. As a result their equal social levels will directly affect their marital relations.
The main objective of this research is the assessment of the relation between a couple’s occupational level and their marital satisfaction level. Using qualitative and quantitative methods 60 subjects were selected randomly, and 15 were assigned in the qualitative group and 45 in quantitative group.
A structured interview was used for qualitative section and Enrich marital satisfaction questionnaire for quantitative section. It was indicated that the qualitative group with equal occupational values consider occupation as an activity for achieving financial independence. Men with higher level jobs prioritize socialization, hobbies, feeling useful and avoidance of mental isolation after financial independence. However, women with higher level occupations prioritize welfare support, socialization and spiritual improvements after financial independence. When a couples’ occupational level is equal, advantages of an employed wife are higher than her housewife peers and her restrictions limited. However, it increases when the couple’s jobs are at two different levels. This limitation will only increase when the wife’s occupational level is higher than of her husband.
In the quantitative section of the research, results indicate that the average rate of general marital satisfaction for couples with equal occupational values (182) is more than couples with unequal occupational values (117.54, 154.47).

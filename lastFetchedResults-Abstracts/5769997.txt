A prototype version of a new switch-level fault simulator for digital MOS ICÂ´s is described. The simulation program, which is called CSASIM, analyzes CSA (connector-switch-attenuator) circuit models using multiple logic values. A novel method of signal evaluation is employed, based on the superposition of bidirectional static and dynamic signals. CSASIM also allows efficient simulation of many different fault types, including stuck-at-constant, open-circuit, short-circuit, and delay faults. The internal structure and fault-simulation mechanisms of the simulator are discussed in this paper.

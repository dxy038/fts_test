The issue of God's knowledge is one of the key topics in Islamic philosophy, and philosophers have presented various ideas about it. One of the well-known ideas in this regard has been propounded by Shaykh al-Ishraq. On the one hand, he introduces Almighty Necessary the same as light and the manifestation of infinity and equates knowledge with manifestation. On the other hand, he believes that the truth of Almighty Necessary is "Pure Existence", "Universal Existence", "Absolute Needlessness", "Infinite", and "the Giver of all things and their truths". Therefore, we can say that, in line with his philosophical system, he believed in the absolute and a priori Knowledge of Almighty Necessary and tried to demonstrate it based on the fundamental principles of his school of philosophy. Accordingly, one cannot base criticism of him and his philosophical system on the negation of God's a priori and differentiated knowledge of objects.

Moreover, Shaykh al-Ishraq considers God's knowledge of the objective existences of all objects, including material and immaterial things, to be of the type of presential knowledge based on illuminative force and domination. He also believes that no existent and particle is hidden from God's knowledge and vision. Therefore, all possible existents are also included in the presential knowledge and all-inclusive vision of Almighty Necessary after they are created.The present paper aims to analyze Shaykh al-Ishraq's view concerning the above issues, report contemporary philosophers' objections to his view, and criticize those objections based on Ishraqi (Illuminative) philosophy.

Introduction: Bone graft is one of the most common orthopedic operations. The most common donor site is iliac crest. Pain and hematoma of donor site has been reported in some patients.
Objective: This research was carried out to evaluate a bone grafting procedure (intercortical) and its effect upon the rate of hematoma and pain in donor site in comparison with the usual method (the graft is obtained from outer iliac table with cancellous bone).
Materials and Methods: In a prospective (cohort) study, 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups (A, B). In group A, the bone graft has been obtained from outer iliac table with cancellous bone, and in group B, the graft has been obtained from Intercortical bone with preservation of outer and inner table. 48 patients were followed up for two years. (Group A 25 (%83) and group B 23(%77).
Results: Two years after operation there was no significant difference between group A (20%)and group B (17%) for donor site pain (P>0.02). For hematoma after operation, the results were the same. The mean weight of graft in group A was 36gr and in group B 25.7 gr. The average duration of operation in group B was 20.3minutes and 14 minutes in group A(P<0.05)
Conclusion: The Intercortical graft obtaining from iliac crest has no significant effect upon decreasing pain and hematoma in donor site, but it makes the operation longer and weight of graft is less than usual method.

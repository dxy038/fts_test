One of the most important issues in DC electrified transportation system management is to perform, as far as possible, optimal operation in terms of economy, quality and reliability. In this paper a voltage control strategy is performed in order to minimize power losses and contemporaneously optimize the power sharing between feeding substations. The problem is formalized as a multiobjective optimization, this allowing to compare various solutions by simply varying the weights in the objective function. The control structure is designed according to a hierarchical architecture. For the traction load characteristics identification, an estimation algorithm is also described. In the last part of the paper a numerical application is presented, highlighting the feasibility and the goodness of the proposed strategies

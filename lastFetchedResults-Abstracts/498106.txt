Introduction: Use of medicinal plants and their effective constituents for attenuation of hyperglycemia and restoration of lipids to normal level is very important. Naringenin as an effective protective of flavonoid exhibits is mainly found in citrus fruits.

Objective: To investigate the effect of chronic administration of naringenin on serum glucose and lipids in diabetic rats.

Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 40) were divided into 5 groups, i.e. control, naringenin-treated control, diabetic, and naringenin- or glibenclamide-treated diabetic groups. For induction of diabetes, streptozotocin (STZ) was administered (60 mg/Kg; i.p.). Naringenin was administered i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg one week after diabetes induction for 6 weeks. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels were determined before the study, and at 3rd and 6th weeks after the study. Results: There was a significant reduction in serum glucose level at 3rd and 6th weeks in naringenin-treated diabetic group as compared to untreated diabetics (p<0.01). In addition, there was not a significant reduction in serum total cholesterol in naringenin-treated diabetic group as compared to untreated diabetics. Regarding serum triglyceride, there was a significant reduction in naringenin-treated diabetic group as compared to untreated diabetics (p<0.01). On the other hand, naringenin administration did not significantly increase HDL-cholesterol level and reduce LDL-cholesterol level in treated diabetics relative to untreated diabetic group. Conclusion: Chronic administration of naringenin had a significant antihyperglycemic effect and led to appropriate significant changes only in serum triglyceride.

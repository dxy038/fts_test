This paper proposes the determination of the optimal repartition of renewable energies. The general problem can be formulated as a problem of optimal allocation of limited resources constrained to meet specific demands. Thus, it is expressed in terms of linear programming. Examples of estimation of the energetic potential of renewable energy resources that can be extracted from a given site are derived for Photovoltaic panels and for wind turbines. Two types of situations are considered. The first type considers situations where the installed energetic capacity of each resource is continuous. The Simplex linear programming method is adopted to solve this problem. The second type considers situations where the installed energetic capacity is only available by means of specific units (discontinuous). For instance, we may need to combine photovoltaic panels and wind turbines with specific capacities to meet an energetic demand in a specific site with a lowest cost. Therefore, determining the optimal energy to be installed leads of determining the number of units from each source. This problem is formulated as an integer linear program where the objective functions to be minimized is the initial capital investment and the decision variables are the numbers of units which should be pure integer numbers.

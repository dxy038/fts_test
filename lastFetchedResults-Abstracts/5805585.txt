Over the years there have been a number of publications, discussions, proposals and designs on the integration of control, protection and monitoring functions on to a common system. This has led manufacturers to develop systems that have varying advantages and disadvantages. Recently, NGC started pilot installations to determine which of the options available for integration would deliver the business benefits identified in its integration strategy, known as Substation Information Control and Protection-SICAP. This paper puts forward yet another option for consideration. The advantage of the proposal is that it can introduce a multi-vendor future proof installation that delivers the benefits of integration and opens a new market of software support. The concept is outside NGCÂ´s current SICAP initiatives but could be considered as a future objective depending on the market direction

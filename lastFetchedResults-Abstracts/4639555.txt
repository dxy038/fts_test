This work proposes novel three-phase ac-ac indirect matrix converter (IMC) topologies well-suited for voltage step-up operation, e.g. wind energy generation applications. The IMC systems employ a bidirectional delta-switch voltage source converter (VSC) as front-end stage and a bidirectional current source converter (CSC) as the back-end grid connected converter. Two space vector modulation schemes for the studied ac-ac converter featuring commutations under zero current or zero voltage are presented. Finally, in order to demonstrate the advantages of the new delta-switch IMC (&#916;-IMC), a comparison of the proposed solution and conventional IMC rated to 10 kW is given for a permanent magnet synchronous generator based wind power system.

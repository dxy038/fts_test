Objective(s): Preclinical studies show that iron plays a key role in mediating neuronal injury. This study was performedin order to identify the relationship between the serum level of ferritin and severity of the brain injury which occur after an Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods:This was a cross sectional descriptive – analytic study, which was conducted on those patients who had suffered from an ICH and had attended Poursina Hospital. The Serum levels of ferritin were measured at admittance.  A Cranial CT scan was performed at admission and also 72 hr afterward.  Hematoma and edema surrounding the hematoma volumes were also measured at entrance and 72 hr afterward.  Data analysis was carried out by a descriptive - analytic statistics approach and calculated later on by the Spss-20 software. Results:In this investigation, 63 patients were studied, from which 34 (54%) were male and 29 (46%) female. The average age of the patients was 69.7± 11.9 (Min 43 and Max 94 years old). A significant relationship was observed between the level of ferritin and the edema volume surrounding the hematoma at first and next 72 hr after the patients were admitted. Conclusion:These results delineated the effective role of iron on the edema volume elevation. More studies are essentially urged to ascertain the clinical evaluation of the curing effect of iron chelators in those patients who suffer from ICH.

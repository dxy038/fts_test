Chronic multi-channel neural recording recently has been applied to study dynamic brain function. Often these studies rely upon chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, raising questions about the stability of the long-term neuronal recording. The objective of this paper is to investigate and track the recorded neural signal activity for over 3 years in the awake, behaving primate brain through analysis of unit waveforms and principle component analysis (PCA) of multi-units. For the time span from the beginning to the end of the recording session, the monkey was trained to do three different tasks. We show that some units are very stable within a session for over 3 years recording.

A method to solve the resource allocation and test scheduling problems together in order to achieve concurrent test for core-based system-on-chip (SOC) designs is presented in this paper. The primary objective for concurrent SOC test is to reduce test application time. The methodology used in this paper is not limited to any specific test access mechanism (TAM). Additionally, it can also be applied for test budgeting during the design phase to obtain a tradeoff between test application time and SOC pins needed. In this paper, the above problem is formulated as a well-known 2-dimensional bin-packing problem. A best fit heuristic algorithm is employed to obtain satisfactory results

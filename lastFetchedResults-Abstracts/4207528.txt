Due to the fact that the environmental issues have become more serious recently, interest in renewable energy systems, such as, fuel-cells (FCs) has increased steadfastly. Among many types of FCs, proton exchange membrane FC (PEMFC) is one of the most promising power sources due to its advantages, such as, low operation temperature, high power density and low emission. However, using only PEMFC for electric vehicle may not be feasible to satisfy the peak demand changes especially during accelerations and braking. So, hybridizing PEMFC and an energy storage system (ESS) decreases the FC cost and improves its performance and life. Battery (B) appears to be the most powerful candidate to hybridize with PEMFC for vehicular applications. Therefore, the performance of PEMFC/B hybridization is limited considerably by the performance of the converter. Thus, a suitable dc-dc converter topology is required. Various isolated and nonisolated converter topologies for FC applications have been proposed in literature. The objective of this study is to design and simulate a fuel cell - interleaved boost dc-dc converter (FC-IBC) for hybrid power systems in electric vehicle application, in order to decrease the FC current ripple. Therefore Energetic efficiency can also be improved. A control strategy capable of determining the desired FC power and keeps the dc voltage around its nominal value by supplying propulsion power and recuperating braking energy is designed and tested with an urbane electric vehicle model.

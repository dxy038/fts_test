Introduction: Although injection of opium or anti-inflammatory drugs (IV or 1M) is common for reducing postoperative pain there is limitation in use of them because of their side effects. Objective: In this study the efficacy of intrathecal Midazolam in the management of acute postoperative pain in CIS has been examined.
Materials and Methods: I51 patient scheduled for cesarean section (CIS) under spinal anesthesia was performed by 80 mg of Lidocain Hyperbaric Solution plus 2.5mg Midazolam as case group. In control group 76 patient spinal Anesthesia was performed with 80mg Lidocain Hyperbaric. In postoperative period, Visual Analoge Score determined pain evaluation at one and three hours after CIS.
Results: The mean of VAS in 1 and 3 hours after CIS in case and Control group was (2.5 ± 1.2, 4.9± 1.9), (5.9±1.7, 8.8± 1.5) Respectively with (P< 0.0001). Ketamine injection, Hypotension and shivering in case group is lower than control group (P<0.01) (1.3% versus 50%), (29.3% Versus 42.1%), (%4 Versus 57.9%) Respectively.
Conclusion: Interatecal midazolam without side effect can reduce postoperative pain.

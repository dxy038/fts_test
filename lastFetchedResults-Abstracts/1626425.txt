Introduction: Malathion is one of the most common toxic organophosphorus insec-ticides (OPIs) which is normally used in the world. In addition to enzyme inhibition, ch-olinesterase also plays a role in the induction of oxidative stress and increased oxidants. On the other hand, zing is a crucial element that has antioxidant pro-perties and protects against free radicals. The objective of this study was to inve-stigate the possible protective effects of zinc on organophosphate pesticide poiso-ning similar to malathion in male rats.
 
Materials & Methods: 20 male Male Wistar rats weighing 250-180Grm were used in th-is study. The 20 male rats were equally div-ided in to 4 groups (5 rats each). Group I (c-ontrol), while Group II was given mala-hion. Animals of Groups III received only zinc. Group IV was given zinc+ malathion once for acute test. After the treatment, blo-od was isolated.  The animals were killed after 48 hours and cholinestrase activity (C-hE) and oxidative stress marker such as total thiol groups (TTG) and total antio-xidant capacity (TAC) concentration was measured. Data were then analyzed through SPSS software by One Way Anova ana-lysis. The significance level was cons-id-ered to be p < 0.05.

Findings: Results of data analysis showed that malathion significantly reduced the activity of ChE enzyme, TTG and TAC in blood in comparison to the control group.  However, zing significantly increased the capacity of TTG and TAC in comparison to the malathion group. 

Discussion & Conclusion: Based on the above findings, it can be suggested that zinc can reduce the oxidative damage of malat-hion by increasing free radicals and can be used in organophosphate pesticide poiso-ning such as malathion

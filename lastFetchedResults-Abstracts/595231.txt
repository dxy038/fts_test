Objective: To compare the efficacy of single dose versus 7 days cephradine prophylaxis for the prevention of post operative infection in patients undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy. Material and Methods: This study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Lady Reading Hospital from January 2006 to March 2007. Twenty patients each were randomly allocated by card method to either group 1 or group II.

Wound was examined on 2nd, 4th and 7th day then alter 2 weeks and after 6 weeks. The efficacy was measured in terms of febrile morbidity, surgical and nonsurgical site infection and duration of hospital stay. The statistical analysis was carried out by chi square test.Results: Febrile morbidity was equal in both groups (20%), surgical site infection was 10% in group I and 5% in group II, and duration of hospital stay was equal in both groups. Non surgical site infection occurred in 5% of patients in group-I. There was no statistically significant difference in out come in two groups.Conclusion: Single dose prophylactic antibiotic is as effective as multiple dose antibiotics in elective abdominal hysterectomy.

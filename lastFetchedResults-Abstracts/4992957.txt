The Field Marshal (FM) simulation environment is aimed at small research groups involved in electromagnetics design and analysis. Project goals include consistent user interface, single-geometry/multiple-tools and inclusion of legacy codes. A key objective is usability, maintainability, and extensibility by researchers who are not expert programmers. Four primary elements are necessary to cost-effectively achieve this: finite difference techniques, multigrid techniques, a modern scripting environment (e.g. Python), and Internet-based distributed development

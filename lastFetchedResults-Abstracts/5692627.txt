A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a direct communication channel between a human brain and an outside environment. Through this interface, usersÂ´ can send their messages or commands without any muscle movement, but through the thought process. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to measure the brain response which is generated by billions of nerve cells called neurons. This EEG activity is recorded through electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG signals are conventionally categorized into different rhythms based on their frequencies ranging from less than 0.5 Hz to above 30 Hz categorized as Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma waves. The main objectives of BCI systems are to translate the brain signals into control signals and use them to control activities on particular application domain. The objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of developing a BCI system for recognizing and controlling the stress level of a person. The emotional level of the subject will be recognized based on the brain EEG signals captured and analyzed through the Valence-Arousal model. Further, based on the emotional status of the person, corresponding music shall be played to reduce the stress level of a person, thereby controlling the emotional level of the subject. Experiments have been carried out in the Brain Computer Interface Research Lab and the results show a significant feasibility in developing an emotional control system.

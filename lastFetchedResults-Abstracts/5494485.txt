This paper has the objective of performing analyses with the series, parallel, and multi-string array with a few photovoltaic (PV) modules under partial shading conditions, with these analysis it is chosen an array of PV modules with total power installed of 6kW for powering a residence using a single DC-DC converter. With the chosen array configuration, it is performed the design of the three phase step-up isolated DC-DC converter with high frequency transformer, in charge of tracking the maximum power point and to provide energy to a grid-connected inverter. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the parallel array using the DC-DC converter.

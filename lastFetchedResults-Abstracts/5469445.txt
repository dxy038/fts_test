Fabrik is an experimental interactive graphical programming environment designed to simplify the programming process by integrating the user interface, the programmer language and its representation, and the environmental languages used to construct and debug programs. The programming language uses a functional, bidirectional data-flow model that trivializes syntax and eliminates the need for some traditional programming abstractions. Program synthesis is simplified by the use of aggregate and application-specific operations, modifiable examples, and the direct construction of graphical elements. The user interface includes several features designed to ease the construction and editing of the program graphs. Understanding of both individual functions and program operation are aided by immediate execution and feedback as the program is edited.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

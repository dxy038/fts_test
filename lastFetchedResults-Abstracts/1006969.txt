A genetic algorithm based optimisation technique has been developed for crossflow plate-fin heat exchangers using offset-strip fins. The algorithm takes care of large number of continuous as well as discrete variables in the presence of given constraints. The optimisation program aims at minimising the number of entropy generation units for a specified heat duty under given space restrictions. The results have also been obtained and validated through graphical contours of the objective function in the feasible design space. The effect of variation of heat exchanger dimensions on the optimum solution has also been presented.

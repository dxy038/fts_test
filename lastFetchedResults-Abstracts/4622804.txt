Precise control of electro-hydraulic actuator (EHA) system has been an interesting subject due to its nonlinearities and uncertainties characteristics. Good control can be designed when precise model of the system is available. ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) modeling technique has proven to be able to model various nonlinear systems. The objective of this paper is to obtain an ANFIS model from EHA system stimulus-response data. The prediction ability of ANFIS is also tested using limited data set for model training. Results show that ANFIS model is able to estimate nonlinear EHA system with high precision, even when training data provided is limited.

In this paper, we propose an optimal scheme for a distributed antenna system (DAS) to maximize energy efficiency (EE) under a constraint of overall transmit power of each remote access unit (RAU). We exploit the multicriteria optimization method to systematically investigate the relationship between EE and spectral efficiency (SE). Using the weighted sum method, we first convert the multicriteria optimization function, which is extremely complex, into a simpler single objective optimization function. Then an optimal algorithm is developed to allocate the available power to tradeoff EE and SE effectively. Furthermore, we also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate there is a tradeoff between energy-efficient and spectral-efficient transmission through computer simulation of a downlink multiuser DAS.

To determine the properties of a physical medium based upon a collection of measurements using microwave is the objective of many applied sciences and engineering problems. These electromagnetic inverse scattering problems are ill-posed, computationally expensive and have to fuse multi-sensor data from sparsely sampled, noisy observations. In this work, we solve the extended Born approximation (EBA) of permittivity perturbation in wavelet domain for microwave frequency bands and employ the multiscale statistical method to reconstruct the structure of the unknown. The computational complexity is reduced since the matrices defining the EBA are sparsified in wavelet domain.

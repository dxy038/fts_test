Cluster inspired regional development inside EU are a result of the work of three European regions, North Jutland (DK), Blekinge (S) and West Midlands (UK), The Innovative Regions project has had the objective of identifying and collecting experiences with different regional development tools. The collection of these experiences provided input to different pilot activities in each partner region and functioned as the starting point for thematic discussions at trans-national seminars. Regional clusters, the geographic concentration of economic activities in a specific field connected through different types of linkages, from knowledge spill-overpsilas to the use of a common labour market, are increasingly viewed as an interesting conceptual tool to understand the economic strength or competitiveness of a region. The Innovative Regions project has given the partners an opportunity to learn from the good and bad experiences of others, and collect reflections and recommended methods, which can be passed on to other regions. So other regions do not have to make the same mistakes. The North Jutland region and the Aalborg University participating are used as a case example with its unique use of problem-based education methods in connection with project and group-organised studies for strengthening the link between research, education and practice. ldquoCluster initiated SME students projectsrdquo are shown in appendix.

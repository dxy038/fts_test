A new application of pattern search optimization technique for estimating the parameters of solar cell and PV module is introduced in
this article. The estimated parameters are the generated photocurrent, saturation current, series resistance, shunt resistance, and ideality
factor. A new objective function formulation is introduced to guide the estimation technique toward the model parameters. The proposed
approach is tested and validated using different test cases, e. g. solar cell and PV module, to show its potential. Outcomes of
the developed approach are compared with those of different parameter estimation techniques to measure its accuracy. Comparison
results are in favor of pattern search algorithm in all cases.

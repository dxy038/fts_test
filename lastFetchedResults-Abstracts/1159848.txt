The stabilizing ponds are more effective systems for treating wastewater whit high organic and
hydraulic loading. Therefore, those are most popular methods for municipal and many of
industries of wastewater treatment .The main objective of this study was investigating the
efficiency of Abadan industrial estate wastewater treatment plant by stabilizing ponds . Module 1
of phase 1 was done in Abadan wastewater treatment plant.
In this study, the efficiency of Abadan wastewater treatment plant was studied over ten months
from February 2004 to December 2005 . The general conditions and operation of the plant were
considered and wastewater treatment indexes such as pH , COD , BOD5 , TSS , Total coliform
and fecal coliform in influent and effluent were determined.
The removal efficiency of pollutants had highest rate in July. The average amounts of COD , BOD ,
TSS , total and fecal coliform and helminthes ova in effluent in July were 805 mg/l ,440 mg/l ,
30mg/l,9/2×105 MPN/100ml 6/1×105MPN/100ml ,22 ova/l respectively.
These results showed that the amounts of these parameters (exception of the TSS) had significant
difference with the standard limits recommended by Iran Department of Environment (DOE) for
irrigation or discharged to surface water. For sanitary disposal and to reuse this effluent the
optimization of exiting system must be noted.

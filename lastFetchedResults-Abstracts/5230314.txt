Using energy harvesting nodes can be a viable solution for energy limited cooperative communication systems. In this paper, we consider the optimization of an energy harvesting (EH) relay system, where an EH source communicates with the destination via an EH decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Our objective is to maximize the system throughput over a finite number of transmission intervals. To this end, we propose an offline and several online joint source and relay transmit power allocation schemes. For offline power allocation, we formulate a convex optimization problem which can be solved either in closed form or using standard optimization tools. For the online case, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) approach to compute the optimal online transmit power. To alleviate the complexity inherent to DP, we propose several suboptimal online power allocation schemes. Our simulation results show that the developed suboptimal schemes provide a good complexity-performance tradeoff compared to optimal online power allocation.

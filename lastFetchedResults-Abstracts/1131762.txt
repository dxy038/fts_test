Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor that mediates the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (CE) and the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol (FC). The identification of selective uptake inhibitors holds promise for mechanistic studies of SR-BI and for discovery of pharmaceuticals useful in therapy of atherosclerosis.

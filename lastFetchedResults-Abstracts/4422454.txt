This paper proposes a low cost and small design of 3 degrees of freedom (3-DOF) sensors. The main objective of these sensors is to measure precisely the absolute position X,Y and thetas<sub>z</sub> with a high resolutions. The principle of this design relies on a target with a specific periodic pattern with absolute position information encoded in it. To improve the reliability and the resolution of the absolute position of the target, we derived efficient and optimized (in term of complexity and time of computation) image processing algorithms.

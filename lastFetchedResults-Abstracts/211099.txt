Perfectionism and self-esteem are two important components of
personality that have received the attention center of the psychologists,
and various investigations have attempted to study each of them
separately. But a number of studies have sought to investigate
simultaneously the two variables. The main objective of the present
research is to study the comparison of relation between perfectionism and
self-esteem in the subjects from the scientific and athletic elites ami the
non-elite individuals .For this reason, 200 elite subjects (100 and 100
athletic elites) and 200 non-elite subjects (100 non-elite subjects in
accordance with the scientific elites and 100 non-elite subjects in
accordance with the athletic elites) were studied. Measurement of the
above-mentioned variables were performed hy the positive and negative
perfectionism questionnaire of Short et al (1995) and self-esteem
questionnaire of Nugent and Thomas (1993).
The results showed that there were a positive significant relation in the two study groups between positive perfectionism and self-esteem and a
negative significant relation between self-esteem and negative
perfectionism. Also, the findings suggested this point that there was a
significant difference between the perfectionism and self-esteem of elite
and non-elite subjects but there was no significant difference in the rate of
relation between the two variables among the two elite and non-elite
groups.

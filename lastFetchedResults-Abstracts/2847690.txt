Although prolonging network life time in target tracking has been extensively studied in the literature of wireless sensor networks, the problem of energy efficiency with well tracking performance is still an open issue. In lots of exited works about target tracking in WSN, energy cost and uniform sampling interval was taken into consideration. While it ignored the remaining energy selected sensors as well as the changing of the target dynamic. In this paper, a target tracking scheme based on minimizing the ratio between the total energy cost and the remaining energy and maximizing the sampling interval is proposed. It contains two parts: the target sensing based on the Kalman-Consensus filer that active sensors receive/broadcast information with its active neighbors and estimate the position of target, the sensors scheduling scheme that selecting the tasking sensors by a predicted objective function. In this function, the tradeoff between tracking performance and network energy costs is obtained. Simulation results show its better performance in target tracking.

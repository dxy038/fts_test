The objective of this study was to evaluate the gene expression of four bone-related adhesive proteins during the early healing of bone defect and bone-implant interface in animal experiments. T-shaped hollow pure titanium implants with dual acid-etched surfaces were placed into femurs of 17 Sprague-Dawley rats, and bone defects with the same size were made in the same site in 15 rats. Newly formed bone was harvested at 5 days, 8 days and 16 days respectively. The gene expression of fibronectin (FN), collagen I (COL I), bone sialoprotein II (BSP II) and osteopontin (OPN) in non-implant and bone-implant defects were examined using semi-quantity reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The gene expression of OPN in the non-implant defect was slightly higher than that in the bone-implant interface. At 8 days postoperation, FN, COL I and BSP II expression were significantly up-regulated in the bone-implant group. All four proteins peaked at 8 days. The results indicate that the gene expression of the four adhesive proteins is different between bone defect and bone-implant interface. Intracellular synthesis of FN, COL I and BSP II was accelerated in the early healing stages of the bone-implant interface

Variable stiffness composite laminates can be manufactured using Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) technology. An improvement in structural performance can be achieved by tailoring their material properties in directions that are more favorable to carry loads. During AFP manufacturing, however, the formation of defects, mainly gaps and overlaps, is inevitable. The extent of a defected zone is generally controlled by two sets of parameters: design parameters; and manufacturing parameters. In this work, we investigate how the parameters governing the formation of defects impact the set of optimal solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem, where in-plane stiffness and buckling load are simultaneously maximized. It is found that increasing the number of tows within a course reduces the amount of defected areas, where the course width is kept constant. Furthermore, the amount of defect areas significantly reduces by using a wide course, which has the effect of both increasing the deviation from the designed fiber path and reducing the number of manufacturable designs. The results show that a complete gap strategy shifts the defect-free Pareto front, obtained without considering the effect of defects, towards lower in-plane stiffness and buckling load; on the other hand, a complete overlap strategy shifts the Pareto front towards higher structural properties.

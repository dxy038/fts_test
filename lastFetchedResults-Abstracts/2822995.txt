This paper proposes a new isolated, multiport, bidirectional DC-DC converter with the least number of switches for photovoltaic (PV)-battery-DC microgrid applications. The proposed converter is able to perform the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control for the PV system when solar energy is available as well as control the charge and discharge of the battery with the PV system and the DC microgrid. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out and validate the proposed converter for simultaneous power management of a PV-battery system connected to a DC microgrid.

Objective: This study was conducted to assess survival of follicles, their oocyte maturation
and fertilization potential as well as expression of early embryo developmental genes
in in vitro cultured pre-antral follicles derived from vitrified-warmed mouse ovary.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, ovaries of 12-day old Naval Medical
Research Institute (NMRI) female mice were placed into non-vitrified and vitrifiedwarmed
groups. Isolated preantral follicles from experimental groups were cultured in
vitro for 12 days. On the 12th day of culture, oocyte maturation was induced and then
matured oocytes were in vitro fertilized. The rates of oocyte maturation and two-cell
stage embryo formation were assessed. Relative expression of Mater and Zar1 was
evaluated on days 1, 6, 10 and 12 of culture. Data analysis was performed by t test
and two-way ANOVA (P < 0.05).
Results: Our data showed no significant difference between the control and vitrification
groups in the rate of follicular survival, oocyte maturation and two-cell stage embryo formation.
The level of gene expression was higher on the 6th and 10th days of culture for
Mater and Zar1 in vitrified-warmed group compared with non-vitrified group, however,
there was no significant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion: It seems that the applied vitrification method did not reveal any negative
effect on maturation and developmental competence of oocytes surrounded in preantral
follicles and therefore could preserve follicular reserves efficiently.

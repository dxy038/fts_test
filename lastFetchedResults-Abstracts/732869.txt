Objective. To investigate factors associated with receipt of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among urban senior Chinese-Americans.

Methods. Two hundred three men and women from three senior centers completed a questionnaire that included sections on demographics, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and sigmoidoscopy use, and potential barriers to screening.

Results. Receipt of a FOBT within the prior 12 months (37.9% of sample) was associated with fewer years of US residency, lower level of worries or fears of test results, and higher level of perceived susceptibility to CRC. Receipt of a flexible sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years (22.2% of sample) was associated with higher levels of education, lower levels of worries or fears of test results, and higher level of perceived susceptibility of CRC.

Conclusions. Intervention programs may target these areas to facilitate CRC screening in Chinese-Americans so that national goals can be met for all Americans.

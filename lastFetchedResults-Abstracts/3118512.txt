The multi-value intuitionistic fuzzy sets (MIFS) can be utilized to represent an objective from multi-sides or multi-angles simultaneously without losing emphasis of information in original data. This paper deals with problems of multi-value intuitionistic fuzzy entropies and their significant properties. To this purpose, a method for computing multi-value intuitionistic fuzzy entropies is proposed with the definition, and some of properties, such as max-min property, comparison principle, entropy of a complement set, relation of variety of entropies, judging criterion of entropy value, of them are exposed by Theorem 1-6. The investigation shows that MIFS theory is a kind of extension of Intuitionistic fuzzy sets in effect, and this theory is helpful to solve practical problems.

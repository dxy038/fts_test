The structure and operation of the Federated Computer-Aided Control Design System is discussed. The system is termed "Federated" to indicate that it consists of several independently developed subsystems tied together by a unified database. The objective is to provide the user with a unified system that spans the entire control design problem: modeling, design, and simulation. This paper discusses how the management of the database is handled and the operation of an overall system supervisor. A set of supervisor commands are given which allow considerable flexibility to add subsystems and to tailor commands to the individual installation.

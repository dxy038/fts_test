The objective of this work is to determine the mixing behavior of fluid in a laminar mixer. Turbulent flow is utilized in many cases, such as in liquid mixing and is positively responsive. However, it consumes a great amount of energy, especially for fluids with a large Schmidt number. It has been proven that mixing with Stokes flow can reduce this energy consumption rate. In this article, the effect of molecular diffusion has been neglected and a potential flow mixer has been introduced, which is cinematically similar to Stokes flow. Consequently, effective parameters have been realized and optimum amounts determined. This article demonstrates how the chaos theory can be applied for studying laminar mixing. By using the chaos theory, Poincare maps for different potential mixers have been represented. Analysis of these maps has revealed the dynamics of flow in the mixers and has determined the optimum values of parameters for efficient laminar mixing.

The problem of the fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (FMADM) is studied, in which the information about attribute weights is known partly and the decision maker has preference information on alternatives in the form of fuzzy reciprocal judgment matrix. The attribute values and the preference values given by the decision maker(s) are in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers. A maximum difference minimizing model is introduced to assess the weights of attributes in a FMADM problem, which integrates subjective fuzzy preference relations and objective fuzzy decision information. Theadditive weighting method is used to obtain the fuzzy overall values of alternatives. By using the priority formula of triangular fuzzy numbers, the decision alternatives are then ranked. Finally, a numerical example is given.

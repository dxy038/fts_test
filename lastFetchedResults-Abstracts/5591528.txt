A simple learning control approach for controlling a pH neutralization process has been developed in this paper. A one-step-ahead Q-learning, namely Q(&#955;)-learning, using a lookup table is developed and applied to a pH process: weak base - strong acid process. The objective of the controller is to maintain the pH within the goal state. The application at a laboratory pilot plant shows that the proposed Q(&#955;)-learning regulates the process well, even in the presence of reference changes.

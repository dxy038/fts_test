A computer algorithm for optimal voltage control with voltage regulators, suitable for large radial distribution networks is given in this paper. An objective function concerning the total cost of the voltage regulators (investment and maintenance cost) as well as the cost of losses of the examined networks is developed and constitutes the base of the algorithm. This algorithm makes the initial selection, installation and tap setting of the voltage regulators, which provide a smooth voltage profile along the network, utilizing former algorithms suitably modified and optimized. Then it attempts to minimize the number of the initially selected voltage regulators as much as possible, by moving them in such a way as to control the network voltage at the minimum possible cost (maximization of the objective function). The algorithm is fast, efficient and reliable as its application to practical distribution networks shows

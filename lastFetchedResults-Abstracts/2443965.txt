Background: Antioxidants are used to increase the shelf life of the food. Vegetables and fruits are good sources of antioxidants including polyphenols, vitamin E and vitamin C.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of citrus aurantium mesocarp extract on shelf life of rainbow trout.
Methods: This experimental study was conducted at the Urmia University of Medical Science in 2014. Forty five rainbow trouts were divided into two groups including control group (packed in vacuum without extract) and treatment group (immersed in a solution of 5% extract for 30 min and packed in vacuum) and were stored in a refrigerator (4Â±1?). Sensory and chemical properties including pH, peroxide value (PV), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured at days zero, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21. Data were analyzed using Levene's test, Duncan, and ANOVA.
Findings: PH, TVB-N, PV, TBA, and FFA in the treatment group were significantly lower than the control group.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that the citrus aurantium mesocarp extract reduces the oxidation process and increases the shelf life of rainbow trout and can be an appropriate alternative for artificial preservatives.

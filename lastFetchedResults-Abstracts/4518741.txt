The future spatial SWOT mission will use a new altimetric sensor "KaRIn", which is a Ka-band interfero metric SAR system operating on near-nadir swaths on both sides of the satellite track [1]. The objective is to study the height of the earth\Â´s water surfaces, mainly oceans, but also continental water surfaces such as lakes and rivers. This article dedicated to water surface detection methods, presents a multi-scale line extraction approach that has been adapted to the specificities of the KaRIn instrument, and gives some preliminary results obtained on simulated SAR images.

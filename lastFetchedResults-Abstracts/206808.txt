Mixing by free jet is utilized in various processes and apparatus such as combustion, mixing of liquids and reactors. Fluid dynamics of these systems are turbulent and in order to optimize the process, understandings of the mutual interactions in the, fluid are essential. The objective of this work is to solve the corrected Pope's k -epsilon, k omega and Mixing Length models numerically for three different geometries (plane, rounded and radial jets) and consequently to employ the appropriate model. To solve the discretized equations, the SIMPLE algorithm in conjunction with Gauss-Seidel method and TDMA was adopted At the end, a comparison between the numerically obtained results and experimental values are made.

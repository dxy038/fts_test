A fault simulation and test-pattern-generation environment is specified. It includes a multiple-valued algebra, allows the natural treatment of loops and bidirectional devices, and models the physical failures. The authorsÂ´ main idea is to define what is possible when no extraction to gate level and no creation of transistor groups are performed. Two fault groups are distinguished: the faults which can be modelled in a downward layout, and the faults which can be modelled in an upward verification. This distinction induces difference in the switch network obtained, as the second group allows to model the line resistances

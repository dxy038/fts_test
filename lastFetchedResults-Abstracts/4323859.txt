In the electricity market environment, the quantified description from power quality synthetic evaluation is a vital basis for power quality evaluation (PQE) and electricity pricing. This paper presents a synthetic evaluation method for power quality based on fuzzy cluster analysis (FCA). First of all, with the membership function, the degree of membership of the different indices for different monitoring places was obtained and the fuzzy similar matrix was established. After a series of conversions for fuzzy similar matrix and operations, different clustering of power quality can be obtained. With the dynamic clustering diagram, the power qualities of different monitoring places were sorted and evaluated. Some typical example analysis shows that the FCA is practicable for the synthetic evaluation of power quality, and it is also a new idea. As a matter of fact, the FCA overcomes evaluation standard limitation too definitely on evaluation results, takes into the effect of general elements on power quality and ensures objective and precision. The FCA offers a scientific basis for customers to select power suppliers and price according to power quality.

This paper presents a study protocol for comparing the effectiveness of two different configurations of multi-pad electrode array (MEA) in functional electrical stimulation (FES)-evoked cycling. In this study protocol, muscular force produced by quadriceps and the duration of achieving muscular fatigue would be compared between two different stimulation configurations of MEA. The first configuration uses an MEA to stimulate asynchronously 4 effective cathodes whereas the second configuration uses the MEA to stimulate 12 effective cathodes. Vibromyogram (VMG) sensors would be used for measuring force production and thus, detecting muscular fatigue. Pedal-based torque sensors would be used as well for obtaining the power output for both of the configurations. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of increasing the number of effective electrodes in MEA for producing muscle force and delaying muscular fatigue.

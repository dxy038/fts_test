Objective of farmers and policy makers in using some resources including agriculture water may be different. Farmers commonly tend to use more water in order to reduce production risk and to increase their income, while policy makers are interested in to get sustainable use of scarce water resources. So in this study trade offs between decreasing water use and decreasing production risk, and increasing gross margin was determined, using the multi objective programming (MOP) based on data gathered throughout a randomly selected sample of Fars province {Fasa district) farmers. MOP approach generates a large number of solutions, so more desired solutions were recognized using fuzzy logic based criterion. The results showed a trade off among the goals. It was also revealed that lower water use as a goal results in considerable reduction in importance of present cultivation pattern. Coefficients of risk elasticity with respect to water and gross margin showed a more important role of gross margin in risk change as compared to water. The utility function consisting of the goals revealed the higher importance of gross margin in comparison with water and risk. The optimal solutions developed for three classes of farmers showed high ability of wheat and maize in providing the goals jointly compared to other crops.

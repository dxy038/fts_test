Study objective: To investigate the agreement between contact tympanic membrane (TM) and noncontact infrared ear thermometers in children. Methods:  Twenty-three children (ages .5 to 10 years) undergoing elective tympanostomy tube placement were studied. An assistant used standard technique to record temperature with an infrared ear thermometer before and after TM temperature was obtained with a bead thermistor placed against the anterior-inferior quadrant of the TM. Results:  Mean temperatures were not significantly different: initial IR ear, 36.66°±.33° C; TM, 36.71°±.42° C; final infrared ear, 36.57°±.33° C. The mean bias (difference between initial individual IR ear and TM temperatures) of −.05°±.29° C and the 95% limits of agreement of +.53° to −.63° C indicate an acceptable confidence (error range within 3.2% of average TM temperature) for use of the initial infrared ear temperature as an estimate of TM temperature. Conclusion:  The IR ear thermometer provides an accurate estimate of TM temperature in healthy children and may accurately reflect core body temperature.

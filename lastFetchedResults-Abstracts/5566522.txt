In this paper, the bandwidth of channels is finite in a practical video compression and transmission system, down-sampling techniques are usually adopted to reduce the rate of bit stream in the transmitter before video compression. Thus the reconstructed frames need to be inserted into the video sequences as the missing frames in the receiver after video decompression. Based on traditional temporal frame interpolation method using bidirectional motion vectors, an improved algorithm is proposed to classify the motional relationship to determine the weighting ratio between the adjacent frames, which is used to reconstruct the missing frame by interpolation.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of total replacement of fish meal by cottonseed meal (CSM) supplemented with various levels of iron in practical diets on growth performance, feed utilization, body composition and some biological and haematological parameters of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.). Juvenile fish (average weight 3.78 +-0.1 g) were stocked in 18 glass aquariums (80 L each) at 25 fish per aquarium. Fish meal (50% of the diet) was used as the sole source of animal protein in the control diet 1. Diets 2-6 had 100% CSM (0.145% free gossypol) protein with various levels of supplemented iron (86, 486, 972, 1458 and 1944 mg Fe kg diet-^1) in diets 2-6 respectively. Diets were fed to fish twice daily at a rate of 3% of body weight during the first 12 weeks then 2% of the total fish biomass daily until the end of the experiment (30 weeks). The results of this study revealed that, groups of fish fed diets 1, 4, 5 and 6 had significantly (P<= 0.01) the higher average body weight and specific growth rate than those of fish fed diet 2 (100% CSM without iron supplementation) and diet 3 (100% CSM plus 486 mg Fe kg diet-^1). The best values for feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and condition factor (K) were recorded with groups of fish fed diet 4 (100% CSM plus 972 mg Fe kg diet-^ 1). Red blood cell count, haematocrit and haemoglobin were increased with increasing levels of iron and significantly affected by dietary iron. Hepatosomatic index for diets 3-6 were not significantly different (P>0.05) and superior to that of diet 1 control [100% fish meal (FM)]. The gonadosomatic index of males of Nile tilapia was not influenced by CSM diets with or without iron, while females of Nile tilapia were significantly influenced with iron and the lowest values were recorded with groups of fish fed diet 2 (100% CSM without iron supplementation). Apparent digestibility coefficients of protein, fat dry matter and energy were relatively high for most diets supplemented with iron and increased by increasing iron supplementation. There were no significant differences between groups of fish fed diet 1 (100% FM) and diets 5 and 6 which contained 100% CSM with additional 1458 and 1944 mg Fe kg diet supplemental iron-^1 respectively. Proximate composition of whole body was not influenced by diet. Adding 972 mg Fe kg diet-^1 from ferrous sulphate to the CSMbased diets that contained 972 mg free gossypol (1:1 iron to free gossypol ratio) for Nile tilapia reduce the negative effects of gossypol and improved growth performance, feed utilization and blood parameters and can totally replace fish meal in tilapia diets.

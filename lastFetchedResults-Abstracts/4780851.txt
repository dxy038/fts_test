Due to the high concerns about environment protection and increasing cost of virgin bituminous material, using reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) has become more and more popular. Polymer modified binder (PMB), such as styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), is commonly used in pavement engineering. Therefore, recycling of aged modified asphalt pavement has drawn a great deal of attention from transportation agencies. The objective of this research is to show the combined effect of different rejuvenators such as recycling agent and modified additive on the performance of recycling PMB. The Penetration grade tests including penetration, soften point, ductility and elastic recovery and Superpave&#8482; PG grade tests including DSR, BBR and DTT are both used to evaluate the modified recycling performances of aged PMB by both recycling agent and a new modified additive named Domix&#8482;. The results indicate that the recycling agent with Domix&#8482; can restore the characteristics of aged PMB. Domix&#8482; rejuvenator additive is recommended to modify PMB recycling.

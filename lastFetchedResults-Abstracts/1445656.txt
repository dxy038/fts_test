The present study has presented a method to obtain the best non-dominated point (the point having the least distance to the ideal point) for the multi-objective assignment problems which is more efficient and is so quick while simple, compared with other similar methods in other studies. This method does not need any parameters or point (even the ideal point) to solve the problem and effectively turns solving a multi-objective assignment problem into solving the single-objective assignment problem. Moreover, it gives the best non-dominated point as the solution. Finally, a numeral example has been brought to compare this method with proposed methods in other studies.

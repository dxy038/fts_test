Since most of chaotic communication systems are based on conventional synchronization, it is necessary to develop a high quality synchronization scheme having less dependence on parameter matching between transmitter and receiver. In this scheme, our objective is to separate chaos generation as well as message encoding/decoding from the transmitter/receiver dynamics. Therefore, we focus on how to maintain synchronization between the transmitter and receiver with minimum distortion and with fewer constraints on parameter mismatch. To check the validity of the system, a message which was introduced at the transmitter was successfully recovered at the receiver end. We expect this scheme to be useful for moderate security requirements as well as in increasing the availability and serviceability of the system. Also it can be used in a one- to multi-point communication system since some parameter mismatch is allowed for the same synchronization performance.

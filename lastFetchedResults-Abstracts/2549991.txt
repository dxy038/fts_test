Background and Aim: Relationship is an essential aspect of human life. During the course of illnesses and hospitalization, studentpatient relationship significantly contributes to patient satisfaction and nursing care quality. The objective of the present study was to identify the factors affecting studentpatient relationship from the perspectives of patients. 

Materials and Methods: This descriptiveanalytical study was conducted in 2013 on 100 patients hospitalized in Imam Reza (PBUH) and Valiasr (PBUH) teaching hospitals, Birjand, Iran. Data collection was done by using a researchermade instrument on patients  perspectives on factors affecting studentpatient relationship which included the four subscales of personal, social, environmental, and clinical factors. Data analysis was performed by using the SPSS software (v. 16.0), the measures of descriptive statistics, and the inferential statistics tests such as the independentsles t, the oneway analysis of variance, the Mann-Whitney U, and the Kruskal-Wallis. The level of significance was set at below 0.05. 

Results: The most and the least significant factors affecting studentpatient relationship were respectively environmental factors (with a mean of 3.74+- 0.98) and personal factors (with a mean of 3.22+- 0.71). There was a significant correlation between social factors and participants  gender and history of hospitalization as well as between environmental factors and participants marital status (P<0.05).

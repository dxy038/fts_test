The fact that airports contribute to the downgrading of the air quality of the nearby cities arouses the interest of examining the
planes’ emissions and dispersion in detail. Hence this study focuses on a single take-off and investigates the pollutant dispersion of
two different airplane types, for various wind directions each. Calculations are performed with ADREA-HF, a 3D unsteady
Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics code using a one-equation turbulence closure model.
Moving plane source is considered as a series of jets emitting the one after the other. Concentration levels are presented through time
and space and different cases’ results are compared and discussed. The main objective of this work was to identify the high
concentration areas throughout the take-off, in order to help in determining the best positioning for remote optical pollutant
measurement instruments. Modelling reveals interesting plume propagation as the airplane moves, with a characteristic blister near
the brake release point. The latter is proven to be the best place to have measurements, regardless of wind speed and direction.

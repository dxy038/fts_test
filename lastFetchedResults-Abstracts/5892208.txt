We propose an optical labeling scheme whereby the optical label and payload are transmitted separately on two different fibers that carry bidirectional traffic. This eliminates the complex optical label and payload separation and combination processes which are usually required at the intermediate optical switching nodes. Another novel feature of our proposed scheme is the use of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise as a light source for the optical labels. The labels are modulated using a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) that is injected with a narrow-band ASE noise from a low-cost broadband ASE noise source. The effects of Rayleigh backscattering and reflection noise on this bidirectional transmission system are also demonstrated experimentally.

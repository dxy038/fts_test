The concentrations of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and ozone characterised by very fast chemical reactions can significantly vary within urban street-canyon due to the short distances between sources and receptor. With the primary objective to analyse this issue, NO, NO2, NOx, O3, BTX, and wind flow field were continuously measured for 1 week at two heights (a street-level yard and a 25-m-high rooftop) in an urban canyon in Suzhou (China). The yard ozone concentrations were found to be up to six times lower than on the roof. Different frequency distributions (FD), dynamical and chemical processes of the pollutant variations from yard to roof are discussed to explain the findings. The predominant factors for the dissimilar pollutant vertical diffusion at the two measurement locations were associated to dissimilar fluid-dynamic and heterogeneous removal effects that likely induced dissimilar ozone chemical processes relative to NOx and BTX precursors.

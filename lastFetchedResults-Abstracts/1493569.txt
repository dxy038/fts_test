A major factor attributed to the problem and consequences of underage alcohol use is binge drinking. The objective of this study was to examine binge drinking and other alcohol-related problem behaviour among high-risk male and female adolescents who were from alternative schools and programs because of learning and/or behaviour problems. Self-report data were collected from a purposive sample of 917 adolescents in Israel who ranged from 12 to 18 years. Binge drinking during the last 30 days prior to the survey was reported by 33% of males and 23% of females ( p &lt; . 001 ) . Results of other alcohol-related behaviour showed gender status not related to being in a car when the driver had been drinking (12%) or having driven a car or motorcycle after drinking (5%). Multiple regression analysis showed binge drinking related to what a youth does with time; a decline in relations with family members; selling drugs; and, having been in a serious fight during the last 12 months. Country of origin, i.e. born in Israel or the Former Soviet Union, was not found linked to binge drinking. Further research of binge drinking and alcohol-related problem behaviour among high-risk youth is important so that it can be applied to immediate and longstanding prevention efforts.

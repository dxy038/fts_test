Background and Objectives: Research evidences showed that adipocytokines secreted by adipose tissue play an importance role in the development of obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a single bout of exercise on serum leptin levels and insulin resistance in adult males with type 2 diabetes.

Methods: Fifteen adult obese men with diabetic aged 38-50 years participated in this semi-experimental study. Concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, serum leptin and insulin, as well as insulin resistance were measured before and immediately after a short single bout exercise on a fixed bicycle in studied patients. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.

Results: In this study, exercise protocol did not cause any changes in the mentioned variables, except glucose concentration. In other word, blood glucose concentration significantly decreased after exercise test (p < 0.03).  

Conclusion: The finding of this study showed that a short single bout exercise has no acute effect on leptin levels and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. It seems that serum leptin is decreased in response to long time exercise with high energy expenditure and negative energy balance.

This paper presents an efficient error concealment method for multiview video plus depth (MVD) delivery over error-prone channels based on the view synthesis information. Specifically, we propose an enhanced temporal error concealment (TEC) method by estimating the probable partition and missing MVs of a corrupted macroblock (MB) using the synthesized information. Furthermore, the view synthesis error concealment (VSEC) approach that directly uses the synthesized pixels to conceal the corrupted MBs is also adaptively utilized together with the TEC approach. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the existing methods in terms of both objective and subjective measures.

As more and more attention fixes on environmental protection, economic dispatch problem is no longer a pure problem of minimization of fuel consumption (operating costs) or purchasing electricity fee in power system, how to reduce the emissions of pollutants must be taken into consideration. This paper study comparatively three load dispatch models, they are respectively: (1) pollution emissions function is taken as the objective function to form multi-objective programming problem; (2) pollution emissions is taken as the punishment item added to the objective function; (3) pollution emissions is taken as constraints. Through the simulation experiment, compares and analyzes the characteristics of different methods, obtains some valuable conclusions. On a long view, the multi-objective optimization model is fairer and more reasonable than other models.

Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) with multiple constraints handling is employed for multi-objective optimization of the topological structure of telescope skin, in which a bit-matrix is used as the representation of a chromosome, and genetic algorithm (GA) operators are introduced based on the matrix. Objectives including mass, in-plane performance, and out-of-plane load-bearing ability of the individuals are obtained by finite element analysis (FEA) using ANSYS, and the matrix-based optimization algorithm is realized in MATLAB by handling multiple constraints such as structural connectivity and in-plane strain requirements. Feasible configurations of the support structure are achieved. The results confirm that the matrix-based NSGA-II with multiple constraints handling provides an effective method for two-dimensional multi-objective topology optimization.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the endocrine and behavioral features of estrous-induced Alpine goats. A total of 36 nulliparous, 40 non-lactating and 42 lactating does were treated with intravaginal 60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate sponges for 9 d plus 200 IU eCG and 22.5 μg d-cloprostenol 24 h before sponge removal. Plasma progesterone concentration was analyzed from blood sampled on days 0 (sponge insertion), 5, 8 (cloprostenol administration) and 9 (sponge removal) in 11 nulliparous, 13 non-lactating and 11 lactating does. Estrous response did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) among nulliparous (97.2%), non-lactating (90.00%) and lactating does (85.7%). Interval to estrus and duration of estrus did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) among nulliparous (22.8 ± 9.9 and 25.6 ± 6.8 h), non-lactating (23.7 ± 15.8 and 25.0 ± 6.0 h) and lactating does (22.2 ± 10.4 and 24.9 ± 4.2 h). The accumulative percentage of does in estrus during the first 36 h after sponge removal was 88.1%. The correlation between interval to estrus and duration of estrus was r = −0.32 (P &lt; 0.001). Endogenous progesterone production is decreased until day 8 or suppressed by MAP on day 9. Conception rate was greater (P &lt; 0.01) in lactating (77.8%) than non-lactating (44.4%) but similar (P &gt; 0.05) to nulliparous (60.0%) goats. Estrus can be efficiently induced by means of hormonal treatment in goats and acceptable fertility can be obtained regardless of animal category.

There has been major changes in the emergent standards of wireless networks. These changes aims to improve more and more the wireless performance and the network efficiency. It would be interesting to achieve high level of throughput without requiring sophisticated software improvement. In this context this paper stands to introduce an experimentation of the 802.11n standard. It displays a number of simulation based on a C++ program. This application implements one side of the 802.11n MAC improvements: frame aggregation. The main objective is to demonstrate the contribution of such technology on wireless performance and the network response.

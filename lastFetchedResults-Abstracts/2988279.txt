In the present paper, a fuzzy logic based maximum torque control is proposed for a single-phase induction motor (SPIM) with a controlled capacitor. The objective of the control algorithm is to find the capacitor value related to the maximum torque for any rotor speed value during the starting period. The fuzzy logic-based method has the advantage that adaptively changes the step size of the control variable and in this manner fast convergence is achieved. The complete control system has been developed and validated by simulation results

During the last decade, electrochemically prepared coatings have gained widespread acceptance for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) applications. The current review classified these coatings as electropolymerized conductive polymers (CPs), electrodeposited metal oxides, electrophoretically deposited carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and anodized metals. These electrochemical methods resulted in easily controlled and reproducible SPME coatings with inherent characteristics such as biocompatibility, thermal stability and porous structure. The objective of this review is to provide a concise overview of recent developments in the electrochemically prepared SPME coatings and their analytical applications.

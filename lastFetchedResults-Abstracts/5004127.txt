In this paper, we design a cross-layer power allocation scheme for cellular network incorporating cooperative diversity techniques to minimize the power consumption of the whole network. The objective of our power allocation scheme is to find the optimal power allocated to the transmitters and optimal data flow to route data. The implementation of the cross-layer algorithm and the convergence analysis is given to show that the algorithm can converge and it can provide significant network performance improvement in terms of power consumption due to the using of cooperative diversity techniques.

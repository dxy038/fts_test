The basic functions of public traffic terminals are distributing passengers to different traffic districts in order to adjust traffic flow. Public traffic terminals locating problem, as a multi-objective optimal decision problem, has important significance to ease the stress of the road and lead traffic flow. In this paper, a dynamic traffic districts partition based public traffic terminals locating model with multi-objective was presented, and the solving algorithm was described in detail. A calculating example is performed and the results show that proposed model and algorithm are practical and effective.

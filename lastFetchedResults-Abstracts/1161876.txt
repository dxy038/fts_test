Nuclear power plant experiences a number of transients during its operations. These transients may be due to equipment failure, malfunctioning of process systems and unavailability of safety systems. In such a situation, the plant may result into an abnormal state which is undesired. In case of an undesired plant condition generally known as an initiating event (IE), the operator has to carry out diagnostic and corrective actions. The operator's response may be too late to mitigate or minimize the negative consequences in such scenarios. The objective of this work is to develop an operator support system based on artificial neural networks that will assist the operator to identify the IEs at the earliest stages of their developments. These abnormal plant conditions must be diagnosed and identified through the process instrument readings. A symptom based diagnostic system has been developed to investigate the IEs. The event identification is carried out by using resilient back propagation neural network algorithm. Whenever an event is detected, the system will display the necessary operator actions in addition to the type of IE. The system will also show the graphical trend of relevant parameters. The developed system is able to identify the eight IEs of Narora Atomic Power Station. This paper describes the features of the diagnostic system taking one of the IEs as a case study.

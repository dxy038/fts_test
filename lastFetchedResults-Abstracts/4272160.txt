Partner selection is a key problem of organizing a virtual enterprise. A multi-objective optimization model, which analyzes these candidate enterprises quantitatively is proposed and accomplished by an improved genetic algorithm. This algorithm sorts several single object fitness using quick-sorting algorithm and selects based on total fitness, crossovers and mutates using the self-adaptive probability, and finds the global optimal solution at last. Through comparison with standard GA and the improved self-adaptive GA, simulation example testifies the latter efficiency.

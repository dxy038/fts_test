Batteries are the most commonly used electrical energy storage devices. The cost and performance of an electric vehicle (EV) are strongly affected by the proper selection of technology, number, and arrangement of the battery cells used. This paper formulates the problem of optimal sizing of the battery unit (BU) for a plug-in EV (PEV), given the specifications of the vehicle, battery cell data, and drive cycle. This paper employs a metaheuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal size of the BU with the objective of minimizing the overall cost. Feasibility of the optimization results in terms of respecting the constraints is verified via simulation. The developed optimization platform is highly flexible and allows use of different vehicle designs, component data, and drive cycles.

The paper presents the development of a multiple joint mobile minirobot, able to perform a creeping motion. The main objective of the research activities was to determine the robot model for evaluating its wormlike movement possibilities, but an adequate computer control system was developed, as well. The prototype of this one was implemented by means of I/O boards and Lab VIEW programming

OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of three-dimensional ultrasonography in visualizing fetal digits was examined. STUDY DESIGN: The digits of 72 fetuses, including 2 with skeletal dysplasia, were examined prospectively with both conventional and three-dimensional ultrasonography. RESULTS: Complete visualization of all fetal digits was obtained more often with three-dimensional ultrasonography than with two-dimensional ultrasonography. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional ultrasonography has the potential to facilitate depiction of fetal digits, which may enhance prenatal identification of fetal malformations and chromosomal abnormalities in high-risk pregnancies.

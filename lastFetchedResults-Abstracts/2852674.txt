Emerging applications require networks to provide dynamic and reconfigurable services in order to efficiently use network resources for cost reduction. In this paper, we propose a novel integer linear programming (ILP) based approach for network reconfiguration to compute optimized routes for connections, and also to strategically migrate connections to their optimized routes, with the objective of minimizing the total number of connection disruptions. Our main contribution is to integrate the resource assignment of connections with different bandwidth requirements and the construction of a resource-oriented graph in the ILP-based approach. We compare the proposed ILP-based approach with a heuristic approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the ILP-based approach by simulations.

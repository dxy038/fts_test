AbstractObjectives
ectin (FN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein, is a key factor in the compatibility of dental implant materials. Our objective was to determine the optimal dimensions of microgrooves in the transmucosal part of a dental implant, for optimal absorption of plasma FN and expression of cellular FN by human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs).
s
roove titanium surfaces were fabricated by photolithography with parallel grooves: 15 μm, 30 μm, or 60 μm in width and 5 μm or 10 μm in depth. Smooth titanium surfaces were used as controls. Surface hydrophilicity, plasma FN adsorption and cellular FN expression by HGFs were measured for both microgroove and control samples.
s
nd that narrower and deeper microgrooves amplified surface hydrophobicity. A 15-μm wide microgroove was the most hydrophobic surface and a 60-μm wide microgroove was the most hydrophilic. The latter had more expression of cellular FN than any other surface, but less absorption of plasma FN than 15-μm wide microgrooves. Variation in microgroove depth did not appear to effect FN absorption or expression unless the groove was narrow (∼15 or 30 μm). In those instances, the shallower depths resulted in greater expression of cellular FN.
sions
crogrooves improved expression of cellular FN, which functionally compensated for plasma FN. A microgroove width of 60 μm and depth of 5 or 10 μm appears to be optimal for the transmucosal part of the dental implant.

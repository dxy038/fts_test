ldquoManagement of Technology (MOT) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates science, engineering and management knowledge and practice. The focus is on technology as the primary factor in wealth creation. Wealth creation involves more than just money: it may encompass factors such as enhancement of knowledge, intellectual capital, effective exploitation of resources, preservation of the natural environment, and other factors that may contribute to raising the standard of living and quality of life. Managing technology implies managing the systems that enable the creation, acquisition, and exploitation of technology. It involves assuming responsibility for creating, acquiring and spinning out technology to aid human endeavors and satisfy customersÂ´ needs. Research, inventions, and development are essential components in technology creation and the enhancement of technology progress. However, more important for the creation of wealth is the exploitation and commercialization of technology. It is when the technology is connected with a customer and that its benefit is realized. A customer is a beneficiary and could be individual, a corporation, or a government entity such as a defense establishment. An invention made and put on a shelf is not contributing to wealth. An idea that emerges and is not exploited, even if it was patented does not bring monetary returns. Technology generates wealth when it is commercialized or used to achieve a desire strategic or operational objective for an organization.rdquo* ......

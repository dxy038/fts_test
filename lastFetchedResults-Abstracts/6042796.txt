This paper presents power sources models for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV). These models are designed in order to be integrated in a complete HEV simulation. Moreover, the final objective of this simulation is to study two control levels: the local control of each subsystems and the energy management of the entire system. Consequently, a multi-physics control oriented formalism is used: Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR).

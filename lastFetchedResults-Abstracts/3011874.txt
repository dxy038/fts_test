Operational Maneuver From the Sea (OMFTS) and its implementing concept, Sea Based Logistics (SBL) stress the need for logistically supporting forces ashore directly from a sea base. This study analyzes the capability of a current LHD-class amphibious ship to sustain a force deployed ashore through direct Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM) of replenishment and logistics support. We have developed a simulation model that can evaluate performance of STOM operations using an LHD-class amphibious ship as a sea base. Results indicate a substantial increase in the number of aircraft, and reliability of those aircraft, and/or a substantial reduction in sustainment requirements are needed in order to successfully accomplish the scenarios used in this study. The results of this study could support the design of future LHD-class ships.

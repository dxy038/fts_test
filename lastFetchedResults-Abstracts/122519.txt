TB is a universal health problem and considered by WHO at the top of 6 common and dangerous infectious diseases.Objective: To determine the clinical, laboratory and histopathological findings in 45 patients with the diagnosis of cutaneous TB over a 10-year period in Ahwaz.Patients and Methods: This is an existing data study on the records of all patients with the diagnosis of TB admitted to Sina Hospital in Ahwaz from November 1990 to March 1999. Data on the age, localization, clinical features were extracted from hospital records. Results: The age range of patients was between 1-76 years.

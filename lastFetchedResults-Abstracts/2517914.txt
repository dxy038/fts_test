<div><p class="Abstract"><strong>Objective:</strong> Reports of increased level of Myeloperoxidase (MPO) in plasma and placental extracts of Systematic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) has been proposed that MPO may have an important role in this pregnancy complication. In present study immunohistochemical MPO expression was investigated in placental samples of SLE women compared with normal controls.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Ten patients with SLE were recruited as case group. Control group was selected from mothers with normal uncomplicated pregnancies. A monoclonal antibody specific for MPO was used for immunohistochemical staining and then the staining was quantified and differences between groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> There were significant differences in the expression levels of MPO in the syncytiotrophoblast cells and the extravillous trophoblast cells between the control and SLE groups (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression level of MPO in the vascular endothelium and the relative number of the MPO-positive leukocytes in placental tissue between SLE and control groups (p &gt; 0.05).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The present study showed that MPO expression is increased in syncytiotrophoblast cells and the extravillous trophoblast cells of SLE placentas compared to healthy subjects. It seems that these changes are able to impress structure and function of placenta and survival of the fetus.</p></div>

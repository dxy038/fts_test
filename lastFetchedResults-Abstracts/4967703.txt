A paperless electronic diary/spirometer instrument has been tested in a home monitoring program for subjects who have undergone lung transplantation. The objective of the program is to provide early defection of infection or rejection so that therapeutic intervention can be instituted at the earliest sign of potential clinical problems. This study reports on the early detection capability of the home monitoring program, focusing on example cases of chronic rejection (OB) and infection (CMV). Declines in spirometry and increases in respiratory symptoms appeared in the home data 30-90 days before infection or rejection diagnoses were made in clinic. Thus home monitoring can provide a method for the early detection of infection or rejection after lung transplantation

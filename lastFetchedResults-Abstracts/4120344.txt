The general architecture and an implementation of a classification-based production system (CLASP) are presented. The main objective is to extend the benefits of classification capabilities in frame systems to the developers of rule-based systems. Two major processes of CLASP, a semantic pattern matcher and a pattern classifier, are described. The semantic pattern matcher extends the pattern matching capabilities of rule-based systems through the use of terminological knowledge. The pattern classifier enables the system to compute a ruleÂ´s specificity, which is useful for conflict resolution, based on the semantics of its left-hand side. The paradigm not only enhances the reasoning capabilities of rule-based systems, but also helps to reduce the cost of maintaining such systems because definitional knowledge is explicitly represented in a form that facilitates sharing and minimizes duplication of effort

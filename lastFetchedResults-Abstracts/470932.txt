Objective
We hypothesized that glycodelin stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in response to oxidative stress.
Study design
EM42 (human endometrial epithelial cell line) and primary endometrial epithelial cells were subjected to oxidative stress with minimally oxidized low density lipoprotein (mLDL). Cells were also incubated with no LDL (control) or native LDL (nLDL). Each condition was incubated with and without glycodelin antibody. Glycodelin and VEGF protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were analyzed. Primary cells were cultured with glycodelin peptide to evaluate the effect on VEGF protein and mRNA.
Results
Glycodelin and VEGF protein and mRNA were higher for cells grown with mLDL (P < .05), while glycodelin antibody attenuated the increase in VEGF protein (P< .01). Glycodelin peptide increased VEGF mRNA and protein (P< .05).
Conclusion
Glycodelin may act as an autocrine factor within endometriotic implants to increase VEGF expression during oxidative stress.

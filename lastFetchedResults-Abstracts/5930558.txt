Many research results show that in real world, networks are neither regular nor random but ones with the feature of scale-free characteristic. Applying this feature in telephone network, traffic behavior has been proved to have significant relationship with the user network. However, in a particular scenario, objective existence of user network cannot be changed and each user can only be occupied in one call, so the traffic behavior under this scenario is determined, which means no improvement strategies can be proposed. Based on this point, base station network is proposed: its relation can be changed by adding some new base stations; whatÂ´s more, base station can support many calls simultaneously, then the limitation factor is subject to the number of capacity at each base station node, which can also be controlled. In this situation, some configurations can be proposed to improve the system performance. In this paper, we establish the base station network with weighted scale-free property. Through comparing with fully-connected base station network which was widely used in the previous model, we research on the effects of network relation on traffic behavior. Then a channel capacity distribution strategy is proposed to improve the system performance, which also verifies the advantage of base station network establishment.

Distributed computer control in complex embedded systems oversees diverse electronic control units connecting hundreds or thousands of analogue and digital sensors and actuators. These systems are also called today sensors networks. Nodes in sensor networks can sense, compute, build links and communicate (Including relaying, setup and discovery) without a central control. The application possibilities can be wildly imaginative leading to use highly intelligent real-time distributed systems. The publish/discover/subscribe/distribute paradigm matches well with these possibilities. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that our definition of the new protocol labeled "control area network inter-ORB protocol - CIOP\´ is bound closely to the features of the RT-CORBA, to the information models of the OMG\´s DAIS specification and to the CAN bus, well known as a real-time underlying network. So, the first section gives the reasons in favour of the use of CAN bus conjointly with the OMG\´s DAIS specification. The second section describes a ClOP specification. The third section describes the implementation of CIOP in CORBA environment. In the fifth section we give our actual and future works in this field.

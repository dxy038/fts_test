We propose to design and develop awireless based continuous health monitoring system for old age people and kindergarten children. The vital parameters such as body temperature, heart pulse rate data is transmitted and monitored through wireless sensor network(WSN). WSN consists of a large number of low-cost, low-power, multifunctional sensor nodes to monitor physical conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion, etc. A sensor network is composed of multiple sensor nodes that communicate with each other via a wireless network, and the data of each node are integrated. The objective of these applications is to ensure a continuous monitoring of vital parameters of temperature, Odour and Heart pulse rates while giving them the movement and thereby better quality of information. Theproject is designed to collect triple data(vital parameters) from base station which can then be viewed on a mobile phone/any other display unit in real-time. Mobile node has the ability of computing and communicating either among each other or directly communicating with sink node. Monitoring the datalogger to gather data over a long term period in order to establish a continuous link which can in turn be used as baseline information to detect a possible change in a mobile node. The base station was capable of receiving data from sensors wirelessly and forwarding the collected data to a GPS or user mobile phone. The transmission range obtained can be 800m-1km.

Understanding environment is a very complex task to solve. Modeling and Development of components of the environment in a symbolic way permit to simplify and clarify functional parts of components and interactions. In order to have a complete system specification, a rigorous behavior description is needed. Different levels of abstraction of behavior are taking in to account. The objective of our semantic modeling is to enhance architectural design and reduce complexity. It permits to understand the environment, manage events and adapt the architecture. Management of behavior and all concepts of components of the environment are stored under event frames written in knowledge representation language. We present in this paper, a generalized meta-model of behavioral aspects, that indexes the various environment behaviors in three ontologies. We have fully linked abstraction level with modeling and execution of scenarios. We will show how software semantic agents can be modeled to build any interactive architecture.

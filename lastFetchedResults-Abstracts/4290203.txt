The basic objective of this paper is to develop a framework based on an explanatory and conceptional model capturing the dynamic and complex system behaviour in compounded international production systems. The elements of a production system are supposed to be evaluated in terms of static (in the dimension of regional and factual heterogeneity of production of goods) and dynamic behaviour (in the dimension of processesÂ´ stability and responsiveness) and aggregated to an overall system. The focus is directed to the effects and propagation of unplanned and inevitable process disturbances within non-hierarchical networks, which in practice, lead to a failure of the entire production network. Thus, the goal is to develop an explanatory and conceptional model which helps to consider the described system behaviour during the process of location structure planning.

Wireless multihop networks hope to provide increased total capacity and enhanced coverage at possibly low cost. In this paper, we are interested in the jointly optimal routing and power allocation, i.e. cross-layer design between the physical and the network layer. We formulate this as a convex mathematical programming problem, with objective function to minimize the total power, and propose a distributed solution method. Based on the theoretical results we implement a heuristic solution algorithm and study the performance on a set of test problems. We manage to establish convergence for the standard solution method and also for a more practically realistic model where the information passing between the nodes is limited.

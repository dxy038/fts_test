This paper investigates the synthesis of discrete supervisors for hybrid systems where the control objective is to enforce a language inclusion specification in the presence of plant´s uncertainty. The discussion is set within Willems´ behavioural system theory, where we find a relationship between the robustness of closed-loop performance and earlier results on abstraction based synthesis. From this relationship, we develop our main result: a method for the synthesis of robust supervisory controllers. Note that virtually any engineering system must possess a certain amount of robustness in order to fulfil even minimal reliability requirements. This commonly accepted fact is of a particular importance for hybrid control systems, since the motivating application areas are safety-critical and high-confidence systems as air traffic control or medical instrumentation.

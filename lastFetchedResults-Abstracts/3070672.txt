This paper describes a multilayer architecture for flexible, efficient and uniform utilization of control activities for intelligent environment. The multilayer organization is not a composition of heterogeneous techniques merged together to achieve a final objective but a rethinking of several complex issues, such as sensor utilization, hardware transparency and independency, reconfigurable services under the vision of the recent applications of the semantic Web. It is important to realize that Web searching is only one potential application of semantic Web technologies, other important applications of the semantic Web will include decision support systems, information sharing, knowledge discovery, automation, integration of distributed embedded systems (e.g., sensors), negotiation for goods and resources (e.g., for e-commerce or defense logistics), business development, and administration. As common feature of these applications, we find transformation of data from targeting human consumption to being machine readable. Our multilayer architecture employs markup-based technologies to transform rough information on sensors, actuators and services towards "smart data". We use this approach in the design of ambient intelligent systems.

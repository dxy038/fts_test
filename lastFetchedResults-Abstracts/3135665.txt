Large discrepancies are observed between snow albedo in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and from satellite observations in the case of high vegetation. Knowledge of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of snow-forest system is required to solve the problem. The 3-years SNORTEX (Snow Reflectance Transition Experiment) campaign acquires from 2008 in situ measurements of snow and forest properties in support to the development of modelling tools and to validate coarse resolution satellite products (POLDER, MODIS, MERIS, METOP). The measurement scheme and some first example results are presented from the Intensive Observing Period (IOP) of 2008, which can be decomposed into airborne and ground operations. Multi-temporal BRDF at a metric resolution were acquired from OSIRIS (airPOLDER) onboard a helicopter and from ground with FigiFiGo spectrogoniometer. The same helicopter embarked a pair of UV sensors, pyranometers and a wide-optics camera. Ground component includes exhaustive snow measurements.

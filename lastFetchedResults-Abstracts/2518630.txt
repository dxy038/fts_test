Abstract
Background and Objective: In recent years, researchers have focused on the effect of physical activity on Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unclear that what kind of physical activity is preferable for this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of strength training on spatial learning and memory in B-Amyloid25-35-induced rat model of AD. 

Materials and Methods: AD model was inducted by ICV administration of B-amyloid25-35 in the Wistar rats (n = 8 for each group). Then, AD and control animals were subjected to 8 weeks of progressive strength exercise in a vertical ladder apparatus three times a week by the connection of weights to the tail and spatial learning and memory was evaluated by Morris water maze test. 

Results: The results showed that AD group has a significantly higher escape latency time to reach the hidden platform and less spent time in the target quadrant as compared to healthy control (p  <  0.005). However, strength exercise in control group and AD group results in less escape latency time and more spent time in the target quadrant, respectively, as compared to healthy control and AD group without train (p  <  0.005). 

Conclusion: Strength training could improve spatial learning and memory in animals with AD and prevents the progress of disease. 

Key words: Resistance training, Alzheimer's disease, Spatial learning and memory.

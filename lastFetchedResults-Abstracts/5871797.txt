This article presents the implementation of a designed model for the simulation of three telecommunication services (File Transfer, Video on Demand and Voice over IP) using a queueing theory. The main objective of this article is modelling and simulations of IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) network based on single servers (with a Poisson distribution of job arrivals and an exponential job service time) with FIFO queues of unlimited capacity in Matlab environment. Also, for IMS performance improvement new algorithms for S-CSCF selection were designed and implemented in this mathematical model of IMS subsystem. The results of designed algorithms obtained by simulations are evaluated and compared with each other. It was shown that new algorithms improved IMS performance compared with standardized solution.

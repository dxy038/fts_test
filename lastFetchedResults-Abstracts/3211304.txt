Extended analysis of the performance of Amplitude Phase Shift Keying (APSK) modulation in the Pulsed-OFDM Ultra Wide Band (UWB) communication systems. APSK is recognized as spectrally efficient baseband modulation scheme. The objective of this paper is to elaborate on the 16-APSK performance in the Pulsed-OFDM UWB Communication systems and to provide the comparison with Multiband-OFDM Systems. The performance of APSK modulation for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) is analyzed for different UWB indoor propagation channels (CM1, CM2, CM3 and CM4) provided by the IEEE 802.15.3a Standard activity committee and its performance is compared with MB-OFDM.

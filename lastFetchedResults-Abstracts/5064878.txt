Based on the demands of constructing a saving society, protecting natural environment and resources, G. Z. Bai introduced a special two-objective programming problem, and gave its mathematical model. This paper will give the definitions of premise optimal solution and satisfying solution, and a new method called the Quasi-Goal Programming Method for solving the problem. Also provide an example that illustrates how to solve the special two-objective programming problem by the method introduced in this paper.

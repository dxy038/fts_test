An open-loop method on the basis of acceleration compensation to reduce liquid surface oscillation generated during a high-speed transfer will be presented in this paper. In order to suppress the undesirable liquid vibration effects, so called `sloshingÂ´, a new simple and effective methodology consisting of adapting the gripper orientation is proposed. The assumption of slosh-free movement will be valid so long as there is no relative motion between the container and the liquid. To accomplish this objective, the maximum acceleration in every time-instant has to be considered in the computation. This represents that our method operates basically in maintaining the normal of the liquid surface opposite to the entire systems acceleration until the completion of the transportation. Experimental results using a manipulator KUKA-KR16 will be demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

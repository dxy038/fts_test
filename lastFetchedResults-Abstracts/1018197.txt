The objective of this work is to analyze electronic transport phenomena, due to ionized impurity scattering in Î´-MIGFET (Delta-Multiple Independent Gate Field Effect Transistor). In this work, we report theoretical results for electronic transport in a delta-MIGFET using the device electronic structure and analytical expression of mobility and conductivity. The results show that the analytical mobility and conductivity are a good way to analyze transport in this device. We find the relative mobility as a linear and increasing function in different modes; also, we find transconductance as an almost flat function in all the evaluated interval. Finally, we analyze the differential capacitance and resistivity, and we report regions where this device is operating in digital and analogue mode. These regions are delimited in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of this device in symmetrical mode.

The objective of this study was to examine the quality of successive dominant follicles (DFs) after induced heat stress. Non-lactating dairy cows expressing estrus at normal intervals were allocated randomly to heat stress (HS; n=8) and control (C; n=8) groups. Cows received GnRH (100 μg, i.m.) on Day 0, a progesterone CIDR-B device on Day 4 and prostaglandin (PGF2α; 25 mg, i.m.) on Day 7 upon removal of the CIDR device. The DF and follicles &gt;5 mm were aspirated on Day 8, and GnRH (100 μg) injected following aspiration, to initiate a new follicular wave. In this manner, a DF was aspirated every 8 days (one “follicular cycle”) for 10 cycles. After the first follicular cycle, HS cows were placed in environmental chambers for 7 days during the second follicular cycle (8 h per day at 43.3°C set point and 16 h per day at 24°C for 4 days, and 8 h per day at 43.3°C set point and 16 h per day at 32.2°C set point for 3 days; relative humidity, 40%) and thereafter maintained outdoors with control cows at a mean ambient temperature (18.5°C; range 12.7–26°C). Rectal temperature increased (P&lt;0.001) in HS as compared with C cows (39.28±0.01°C versus 38.78±0.01°C). Concentrations of estradiol (E2; 1662±189 versus 1493±188 ng/ml) and progesterone (P4; 44.7±5 versus 54.1±5.1 ng/ml) in follicular fluid (FF) of DF did not differ between C and HS treatments, respectively. Total FF protein concentration was greater (P&lt;0.05) in HS (99.7±2.3 mg/ml) than in C (92.7±2.3 mg/ml). Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) in FF was not altered by heat stress. IGF-II ligand blots were conducted with FF samples (n=79) from four HS and four C cows. There was a predominance of IGFBP-3 in 76 of 79 FF samples, indicating healthy follicular status, and only three FF samples had the lower molecular weight IGFBP-2 indicative of a poor quality follicle. Plasma P4 and E2 concentrations did not differ between C and HS groups. The number of class 1 and 3 follicles increased during and just after heat stress, but the number of class 2 follicles did not differ between C and HS cows. Heat stress appeared to induce a decrease in follicular dominance, but GnRH-induced follicular cycles resulted in development of healthy preovulatory follicles in both groups.

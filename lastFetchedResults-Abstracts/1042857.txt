The objective of the paper is to analyse the effects of flow turbulence and inlet moisture on the process of spontaneous condensation of supercooled steam. Calculations of steady and unsteady spontaneously condensing transonic turbulent flows in Laval nozzles are presented. Comparisons of model predictions with experimental data are discussed.

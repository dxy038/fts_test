Background: To reduce the use of organic solvent, Subcritical water extraction has become a popular green extraction technology for production of phytochemicals from a variety of biomasses. Phytochemicals, such as phenolic component, essential oils and carbohydrates, have countless applications in the pharmaceutical, food and other industries.
Objective: To review the literature that describes the current status of subcritical water extraction on production of phytochemicals.
Methods: This study was based on literature reviews of recent publications in the field of extraction of bioactive compounds by subcritical water.
Results: This article was attempted to give overall view about different features of subcritical water extraction include properties of subcritical water, the application of this solvent to extract the bioactive compounds from different plant materials, the parameters affecting subcritical extraction efficiency (such as temperature, flow rate, extraction mode, matrix composition, pH, pressure, modifiers and additives), the technique to modify the extraction of thermally labile bioactive materials, the studies on kinetics and modelling of subcritical water extraction, water as solvent and anti-solvent, Precipitation techniques and particle formation by subcritical water, future trends and perspectives of upcoming potential applications this technology are reviewed.
Conclusion: Subcritical water extraction is a simple, inexpensive, convenient and environmentally friendly approach and easily coupled with other extraction and purification methods. Further study and development of appropriate models are required to achieve the best operating conditions and Development of Industrial Application of this method.

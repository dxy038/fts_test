The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of manufacturing an aluminum automotive component (a small sized car door panel) using a highly reconfigurable and cheap forming process. Specifically, the sheet hydroforming process and rapid tooling technique were combined, with the objective of making the resulting process more flexible and less expensive.

Sheet hydroforming experiments were carried out using a layered die created assembling 2D laser cut layers and testing three Al alloys (AA2024, AA5754, AA7475); process parameters (Closing Force and Pressure) were evaluated by means of finite element simulations, mainly focused on the curve defining the Closing Force as a function of the forming Pressure and on friction conditions, which have a significant effect on the distribution of sheet thickness in formed parts.

This paper incorporates the basic concepts of subjectivity with the objective of decision theory to develop a method which intellectualizes ambiguity into multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. An outranking intensity is introduced to determine the degree of overall outranking between competing alternatives, which are represented by fuzzy numbers. The comparison of these degrees is made through the concept of overall existence ranking index. Comparative examples, as well as a case study, are given to illustrate the approach.

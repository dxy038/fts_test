Motion compensation-discrete cosine transform (MC-DCT) coding is an efficient compression technique for digital video sequences. However, the compressed video signal is vulnerable to transmission errors over noisy channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of parity-check motion vector (PMV) into the MC-DCT coder in order to improve its error robustness. By inserting the redundant PMVs systematically into the compressed bitstream, the proposed algorithm is capable of recovering very severe transmission errors, such as loss of an entire frame, in addition to detecting the errors effectively without requesting any information from external devices. The proposed algorithm is implemented based on the H.263 coder, and tested intensively in a realistic error prone environment. It is shown that the proposed algorithm provides much better objective and subjective performances than the conventional H.263 coder in the error prone environment

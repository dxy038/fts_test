The development of methodologies to manage and orchestrate virtualised resources and network functions is a fundamental enabler for optimally utilising physical ICT infrastructures. Algorithms for optimal location (embedding) of network functions, IT and CT resources, services and corresponding states, especially at the network edge, will enable new business models and provide a key competitive advantage to network administrators. This paper introduces a novel Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for a coordinated node and link mapping onto the underlying network infrastructure. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior art formulations: two digit gains were attained in terms of resources utilisation, embedding, revenues and, especially convergence time. The proposed methodology is applicable to a number of relevant use cases, as constraints and objective functions can be flexibly defined by network operators.

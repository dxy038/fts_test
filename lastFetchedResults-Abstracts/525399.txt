Fars province contains a high potential in developing aquaculture. The objective of this study was to appraisal investment in aquatic projects in Fars province. The data set obtained thorough aquatic growers by interviewing in 2005. Internal Rale of Return. Net Present Value and Benefit-Cost Ratio are the applied criteria to get the objective. In order to determine representative farm the selected farms were clustered using Compare Mean Test. Then, sensitive analysis of calculative criterion and costs and gains were computed. The results showed that financial rate of return of coo! water growing projects in farms with 10. 32 and 100 tone capacity are 38, 62 and 107 percent respectively. The Benefit-Cost Ratio of the farms with discounting rate of 15% was obtained 1.17, 1.29 and 1.48 respectively. The corresponding figures for warm water growing farms with 1.5. 6 and 10 hectare are 4, 17.4 and 31 percent respectively. In the case of processing enterprises with capacity of 200 and 500 tones the financial rate of return were obtained 26.7 and 34.2 percent. In general. Except for warm water farms of 1.5 capacity that are far from break even point and cool water farms of 6 hectare that are close to break even point other scale of fish growing farms are economically feasible. It was also revealed that cool water farms are more feasible economically compared to warm and processing units.

Introduction & Objective: Adiponectin exerts anti-tumor effect through connection to its receptor. Some studies have shown that polymorphism in Adipor1 results in insulin resistance, diabetic type 2 and colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence mutant allele of adiponectin receptor 1 polymorphism rs2275738 and to examine the association of genetic variant in ADIPOR1 rs 2275738 with the risk of colorectal cancer.
Materials & Methods: This study was a case-control type. Genotyping of adiponectin receptor 1 gene was determined in series of 106 colorectal cancer patients and 106 controls by the use of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping assay (PCR-RFLP). We calculated odd ratio and confidence interval (CI) of ADIPOR1 genotypes by SPSS 16 and ?2 to examine if this polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer.
Results: The frequency of TT,CT,CC genotype for adiponectin receptor polymorphism rs2275738 in the patients was 27.4, 50, 22.6 percents, respectively. Frequency of TT,CT,CC genotype in the controls was 40.6,22.6,36.8, respectively. Allele frequency of T,C was 41 and 59 percents in the controls respectively and 52.4 and 47.6 in the patients. Incidence of mutant allele among the patients and the controls shows significant differences (OR=1.57 CI=1.07-2.31 P=0.01).
Conclusion: These findings suggest that polymorphism Adipor1 rs 2275738 is associated with increased risk of CRC.

ABSTRACT

Background and Objective: Balance disorder is one of the widespread problems in patients who suffer from multiple sclerosis (MS). Imbalance causes decline in performance independence, expansion of disability, and also increase in danger of falling. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of Tai Chi training program on balance of patients with MS.
Materials and Method: The present study was a quasi-experimental on women aged 30 to 40 years with multiple sclerosis in 2012 admitted to the MS Society of Mashhad, Iran. The subjects of the present study were chosen through purposive and convenience sampling and then randomly assigned into experimental (n = 15) and control groups (n = 15). Tai Chi training program comprised of 8 weeks (3 sessions a week). Berg Balance Scale was used to measure the balance in MS patients. The obtained data were analyzed using dependent and independent t-tests.  
Results: the results showed that there was a statistical significant difference between the average points of balance in experimental and control groups (P  <  0.001). Therefore, the amount of balance in experimental group was significantly increased after the training phase (P  <  0.001). Whereas the control group did not show any statistical significant differences 
(P = 0.136).
Conclusion: Tai Chi exercises can lead to increase in balance and decrease in danger of falling in patients with MS.

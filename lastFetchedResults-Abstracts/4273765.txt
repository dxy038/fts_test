Deregulated power industries increase the efficiency of electricity production, distribution and more reliable electricity at low prices. In a deregulated environment, utilities are not required to meet the total load demand. Generation companies (GENCOs) schedule their generators with an objective to maximize their own profit rather than compromising on social benefit. Profit Unit commitment (PBUC) in deregulated power system has a different objective than that of traditional unit commitment.. This paper presents a hybrid model between Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) and an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, to solve the profit-based unit commitment problem. The proposed approach is investigated on ten units 24 hour test system and numerical results are tabulated. Simulation results shows that this approach effectively maximize the GENCOÂ´s profit when compared with existing methods.

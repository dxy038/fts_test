Estimating a radio link quality for WSNs &#8220;Wireless Sensor Networks&#8221; becomes a big challenge when these networks are deployed in harsh or hostile environment. The quality of a radio link is a useful information for higher layer protocols as it has an impact on the network performance. The harsh or hostile outdoor conditions have a strong impact on signal propagation and make communication difficult or unreliable. Hence, deploying a wireless sensor network in such an environment requires a full knowledge of radio channel characteristics provided by the hardware designed to tackle the deployment. This paper describes a novel experimental testbed platform and a method to estimate the radio link quality and to determine WSN deployment parameters by using nodes shaped to the monitored site. The objective is to design a platform, independent from the environment, that can be used to estimate the radio link quality independently from the deployment context. This SDR &#8220;software defined radio&#8221; based solution will be used in this paper to estimate the parameters of an overwater radio link.

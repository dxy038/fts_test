This paper presents the optimization of integer program, which combines linear lighting with energy saving as the objective function to manage the illumination. Most illumination usually donÂ´t abide by the design limits at the initial time of installation, so this would make the intensity of illumination extremely high. In this paper, an improved method of optimizing the energy-saving objective function is proposed. The solution procedure can be divided into two parts. Firstly, the related parameters of illumination can be obtained by using linear lighting method. Then the optimization of illumination management would be performed by using the binary integer program and defining the energy saving as the objective function, according to the limits in CNS. From the simulation results, the proposed method focused on the plant Illumination not only can save the energy but also can conform to the limits in CNS.

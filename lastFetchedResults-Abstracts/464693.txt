OBJECTIVE: The potential usefulness of a new color Doppler ultrasonography technique called color power angiography in imaging fetal anatomy is presented. STUDY DESIGN: An ultrasonography system set on color power angiography was used to image fetal anatomy. Perfusion of normal organs was compared, with several fetuses demonstrating pathologic disorders of these organ systems. Color power angiography was compared with standard color Doppler imaging. RESULTS: We were able to demonstrate detailed imaging of the fetal vasculature in the lung, kidney, and brain. Abnormal lung and renal anatomy could be visualized by the distinctive perfusion ”footprint.” Fetal movement compromised the ability of color power angiography to visualize these structures but could be overcome by judicious use of the cineloop and persistence functions. Color power angiography was found to be more sensitive to low-flow states than was color Doppler imaging. CONCLUSION: Color power angiography, which is more sensitive to low-flow states than color Doppler imaging is, may be useful in the imaging of normal and abnormal fetal anatomic structures.

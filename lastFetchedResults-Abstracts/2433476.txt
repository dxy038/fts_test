During the past decade, a variety of run-to-run (R2R) control techniques have been proposed and extensively used to control various semiconductor manufacturing processes. The R2R control methodology combines response surface modeling, engineering process control, and statistical process control, with the main objective of fine-tuning the recipe so that the process output of each run can be maintained as close to the nominal target as possible. In this paper, the single-input single-output (SISO) model is addressed. To overcome the shortcomings in the traditional R2R EWMA controller, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) control strategy is proposed. When a process has large autoregressive parameters, traditional EWMA control methods cannot establish stable SISO process control. To solve this problem, an SISO process control model based on an FNN was used to build an SISO process control procedure. The analysis results from a numerical simulation indicated that when the coefficient of autocorrelation Ï• &gt; 0.6, the MSE ratio when using the FNN controller was 97.11% lower than when using the EWMA controller and 61.12% lower than when using an adaptive EWMA controller. This showed that the FNN control method established better SISO process control than the EWMA and adaptive EWMA control methods.

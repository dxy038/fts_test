We propose a multiobjective optimization (MOO) technique to design an orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar signal for detecting a moving target in the presence of multipath reflections. We employ an OFDM signal to increase the frequency diversity of the system, as different scattering centers of a target resonate variably at different frequencies. Moreover, the multipath propagation increases the spatial diversity by providing extra &#8220;looks&#8221; at the target. First, we develop a parametric OFDM radar model by reformulating the target-detection problem as the task of sparse-signal spectrum estimation. At a particular range cell, we exploit the sparsity of multiple paths and the knowledge of the environment to estimate the paths along which the target responses are received. Then, to estimate the sparse vector, we employ a collection of multiple small Dantzig selectors (DS) that utilizes more prior structures of the sparse vector. We use the &#8467;<sub>1</sub>-constrained minimal singular value (&#8467;<sub>1</sub>-CMSV) of the measurement matrix to analytically evaluate the reconstruction performance and demonstrate that our decomposed DS performs better than the standard DS. In addition, we propose a constrained MOO-based algorithm to optimally design the spectral parameters of the OFDM waveform for the next coherent processing interval by simultaneously optimizing two objective functions: minimizing the upper bound on the estimation error to improve the efficiency of sparse-recovery and maximizing the squared Mahalanobis-distance to increase the performance of the underlying detection problem. We provide a few numerical examples to illustrate the performance characteristics of the sparse recovery and demonstrate the achieved performance improvement due to adaptive OFDM waveform design.

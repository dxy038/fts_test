In this paper, a new power electronics topology is introduced for battery pulse charging. The topology is based on a bidirectional isolated Cuk converter. The charging method provides positive and negative current and resting periods. This charging method results in less generated heat and longer battery life cycle. Different operating modes of the system and its small signal analysis are presented. The small signal system has been modeled using MATLAB. Simulation results are also provided to validate the mathematical analysis

There are many risky behaviors that threat adolescents and must receive specific attention. Research has shown that personality pattern behaviors have a significant relationship with risky behaviors. The objective of this study was to clarify the role of personality pattern behaviors in risky behaviors of high school students in Chabahar city. Three hundred high school students from Chabahar city were selected at random for this study and filled Type A and B pattern behavior profile and Type D personality and sensation seeking (Type T Personality) questionnaires. To analyze the data, Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple stepwise regression were applied. Results revealed that type of sensation seeking (Type T personality) and Type A behavior pattern were significantly correlated with risky behaviors. Type D personality had a significant negative correlation with risky behaviors. Type B behavior pattern was not significantly correlated with risky behaviors. The results of multiple stepwise regressions demonstrated that type A behavior pattern, type D, and type T personality explained 11.4% of the variance in risky behaviors, respectively. Type T and type A personality was a positive and type D personality was a negative predictor of risky behaviors. In conclusion personality pattern behaviors had a unique role in risky behaviors of high school students in Chabahar city and the training and education organization should identify their personality patterns to prevent risky behaviors among them.

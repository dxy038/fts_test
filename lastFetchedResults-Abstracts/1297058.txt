This paper considers the problems of coordinating serial and assembly inventory systems with private information where end-item demands are known over a finite horizon. In a private information environment, the objective function and cost parameters of each facility are regarded as private information that no other facilities in the system have access to. The solution approach decomposes the problem into separable subproblems such that the private information is partitioned as required. Global optimality is sought with an iterative procedure in which the subproblems negotiate the level of material flows between facilities. At the core of the solution procedure is a supplierâ€“buyer link model that can be used as a building block to form other supply chain configurations. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology provides promising results when compared to competing methodologies that disregard information privacy.

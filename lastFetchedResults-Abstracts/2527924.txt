Objective(s): The objectives of this work was to assess the benefits of the application of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models in patients with different neuroendocrine tumours (NET) who were treatedwith Lu177 DOTATATE. The model utilises clinical data on biodistribution of radiolabeled peptides (RLPs) obtained by whole body scintigraphy (WBS) of the patients.Methods: The blood flow restricted (perfusion rate limited) type of the PBPK model for biodistribution of radiolabeled peptides (RLPs) in individual human organs is based on the multicompartment approach, which takes into account the main physiological processes in the organism: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). The approachcalibrates the PBPK model for each patient in order to increase the accuracy of the dose estimation. Datasets obtained using WBS in four patients have been used to obtain the unknown model parameters. The scintigraphic data were acquired using a double head gamma camera in patients with different neuroendocrine tumours who were treated with Lu177 DOTATATE. The activity administered to each patient was 7400MBq.Results: Satisfactory agreement of the model predictions with the data obtained from the WBS for each patient has been achieved. Conclusion: The study indicates that the PBPK model can be used for more accurate calculation of biodistribution and absorbed doses in patients. This approach is the first attempt of utilizing scintigraphic data in PBPK models, which was obtained during Lu177 peptide therapy of patients with NET.

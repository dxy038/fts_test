Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mechanical properties of an experimental formulation (Exp. 1) in order to assess its potential as a denture soft lining material. The same properties of a popular commercially available denture soft lining material (Molloplast-B) were determined and compared with the properties of Exp. 1.

Methods: Exp. 1 specimens were obtained by curing for 24 h at room temperature after the addition of the appropriate amounts of catalyst and cross-linker. Molloplast-B specimens were obtained after curing according to the manufacturer's instructions. The properties measured in the study were hardness, tear resistance, tensile strength and the bond strength of the material to a heat-cured acrylic denture base material.

Results: Exp. 1 had a significantly greater tensile strength, percent elongation, tear resistance and peel strength (p<0.0001) than Molloplast-B. There was no significant difference in the hardness values of the two materials, although Molloplast-B had a significantly higher tensile bond and shear bond strength (p<0.05).

Conclusions: It was concluded that there was no significant difference in the hardness of Exp. 1 and Molloplast-B. Exp. 1 had superior tensile and tear properties. Its peel bond strength was superior to that of Molloplast-B, although its tensile bond strength and shear bond strength were less.

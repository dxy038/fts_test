In computational electromagnetic simulations, most validation methods have been developed to quantify the similarity of two datasets, making them an objective tool for test engineers to discuss data on a similar basis. However, these methods do not always agree with the expert´s opinion. The main problem when a validation method is used, is not taking into account the `pre-processing´ required by the expert to analyse a particular characteristic in the comparison. In this study, two different pre-processing techniques are used to show the influence they have on the results of the validation methods in relation to the opinion of the expert.

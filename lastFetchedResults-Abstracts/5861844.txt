In this paper, we propose a distributed power control algorithm for multihop ad hoc CDMA networks. The algorithm attempts to maximize the QoS of each user as well as a global network utility, given a set of routes and link schedules. By defining the local objective of each node as a summation of its own utility and that of the "bottleneck" nodes in its vicinity, users are considered partially cooperative. Since the overall QoS of a single flow is determined by the minimum received QoS among all of its subflows, the global network utility is defined only based on these bottleneck QoS\Â´s for each user.

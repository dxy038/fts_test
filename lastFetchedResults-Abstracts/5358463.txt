A Pin-Grid-Array (PGA) package router is presented in this paper. Given a chip cavity with a number of I/O pads around its boundary and an equivalent number of pins distributed on the substrate, the objective of the router is to complete the planar interconnection of pad-to-pin nets on one or more layers. This router consists of three phases: layer assignment topological routing, and geometrical routing. Examples tested on a windows-based environment show that our router is efficient and can complete the routing task with less substrate layers. Compared to manual routing, this router features a friendly graphic user interface and can be practically applied to VLSI packaging

In, we introduced Smart Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation using Decomposition (SDMOPSO). The method uses the decomposition approach proposed in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), whereby a multi-objective problem (MOP) is represented as several scalar aggregation problems. The scalar aggregation problems are viewed as particles in a swarm; each particle assigns weights to every optimisation objective. The problem is solved then as a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO), in which every particle uses information from a set of defined neighbours. This work customize SDMOSPO to cover binary problems and applies the proposed binary method on the channel selection problem for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

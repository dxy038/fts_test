This paper deals with the problem of preemptive scheduling in a two-stage flowshop with parallel unrelated
machines and renewable resources at both the stages. The resource requirements are of a 0â€“1 type.
The objective is the minimization of makespan. The problem is NP-hard. Four heuristic algorithms using
linear programming are proposed for solving this problem. Performance of the algorithms is analyzed
experimentally by comparing heuristic solutions with the lower bound on the optimal makespan. Statistical
comparative analysis of the developed algorithms is carried out. The results of a computational
experiment show that the proposed algorithms are able to produce good quality solutions in a small
amount of computation time.

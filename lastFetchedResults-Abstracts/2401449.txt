Hybrid power filter is effective equipment for preventing harmonic pollution and enhancing power quality. The design of passive power filters is one of the important parts of hybrid power filter. Conventional approaches for the design of passive power filters depend on the experiences and single technology criterions, which are difficult to achieve the optimal solution. An optimal design method based on genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. Two objectives including minimum total harmonics distortion of current and minimum cost for equipments are constructed, and reactive power compensation is used as constraint condition. The objective functions for an asymmetrical powers system are deduced, thus the fitness functions are determined. And the parameters of passive power filters are achieved by adopting genetic algorithm. Passive power filters applied in practical system are designed and the simulation model is given. Simulation results show that the filter designed by the proposed algorithm has better harmonics suppression effect and lower initial investment for equipments than conventional approaches.

By analyzing the operating characteristics of the groundwater heat pump, this paper puts forward an integrated optimal mathematical model with an objective function of the annual total costs according to technical and economic optimal principle. A computation program is also developed. On the premise of ensuring that the unit will fulfil the heating and cooling requirements of buildings, this model is used to calculate and optimize some key operating parameters and components according to different temperature and depth of the groundwater. It combines the reliability and economy of heating and cooling and achieves the most optimal match of each part of the system. The present method will lead to a greater improvement in the performance of the heat pump than the traditional method.

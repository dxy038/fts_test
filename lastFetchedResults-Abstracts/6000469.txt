Introducing System simulation and modelling course as well as laboratory in the curriculum of computer science and information science program is of great challenge. The course focuses more on discrete event system. In laboratory, experiments are conducted using simulation software tools like Flexsim&#174; or Arena&#174;, where discrete system are realized by modelling and simulating job manufacturing process. These tools fail to narrate computer science and engineering related environment. The feedback collected by student during academic year 2010-11 clearly shows that the course is not connected with the program, and they find tools used focuses more on mechanical manufacturing process. The students have strongly recommended eliminating this course from curriculum. An attempt is made to address these issues in academic year 2011-12, by redesigning the laboratory content so as to bridge these gaps. The laboratory content is divided into two parts; A and B. The term works of Part A is simulation of system using Flexsim&#174; tool, while Part B is designed with the objective that the student should be able to design and develop simulation tool for computer network or operating system domain by integrating emerging technology such as C# with .NET and OpenGL or Windows Presentation Form. These new initiatives have resulted in better learn-ability among students, as well as it has enhanced the skill to model and simulate a given system. The feedback collected during academic year 2011-12 reveals diminishing results. The students find this course more related to the program.

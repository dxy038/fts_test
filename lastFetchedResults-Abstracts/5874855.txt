We propose and experimentally demonstrate bidirectional transmission of signal in WDM-PON using Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation based on a novel polarization multiplexing approach. Polarizing beam splitter (PBS) is used for regulating extinction ratio (ER) and achieving good optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for signal transmission.

We propose a mathematical formulation for the problem of scheduling the movements of an autonomous heliostat in order to track the sun. We make use of a mixed integer programming model where the main objective is minimizing the total energy consumption. The formulation considers the tradeoff between minimizing de energy consumption and minimizing the heliostat position deviations and guarantees the quality of the beam reflected in the central tower. We also propose a linear model to define a suitable size of the energy supply system that feeds the heliostat. Numerical results are presented for two different daily schedules. The potentiality of the method is demonstrated through comparison results with traditional solutions.

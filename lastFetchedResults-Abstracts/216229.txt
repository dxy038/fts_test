Background: The timing of maternal weight change in pregnancy
may be an important determinant of birth weight. The
objective of this study was to measure weight gain patterns
from early pregnancy until delivery, and to examine the relationship
between prenatal weight gain and low birth weight.
Methods: A total of 500 pregnant women within 15-20 days
of conception, with confirmed pregnancies and belonging to
the middle and high socioeconomic families from Mysore
city, India participated in the study. They were followed up for
the period of one-week after delivery, and their weight was
monitored monthly throughout pregnancy.
Results: Pre-pregnancy body mass index (8MI) and obesity in
16.2% of pregnant women were less than 18.5% and 11.4%
respectively. Mean total pregnancy weight gain for all women
was 8. 1(plus-minus)2.9 kg, whereas 85.2% did not meet the international
recommendations regarding weight gain for their 8M!. The
rate of weight gain was highest during the second trimester
(3.6(plus-minus) 1.4 kg) and the total weight gain was associated with
progressively decreasing birth weight. A significant association
was found between mid-upper arm circumference and
maternal weight at term, and birth weight.
Conclusion: According to Institute of Medical Guidelines,
low weight gains of the mother during pregnancy and mid upper
ann circumference below 19 ern are associated with increasing
risk of low birth weight

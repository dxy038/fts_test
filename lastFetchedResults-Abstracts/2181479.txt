Compared to most thermomechanical processing methods, friction stir welding (FSW) is a recent technique which has not yet reached full maturity. Nevertheless, owing to multiple intrinsic advantages, FSW has already replaced conventional welding methods in a variety of industrial applications especially for Al alloys. This provides the impetus for developing a methodology towards optimization, from process to performances, using the most advanced approach available in materials science and thermomechanics. The aim is to obtain a guidance both for process fine tuning and for alloy design. Integrated modeling constitutes a way to accelerate the insertion of the process, especially regarding difficult applications where for instance ductility, fracture toughness, fatigue and/or stress corrosion cracking are key issues. Hence, an integrated modeling framework devoted to the FSW of 6xxx series Al alloys has been established and applied to the 6005A and 6056 alloys. The suite of models involves an in-process temperature evolution model, a microstructure evolution model with an extension to heterogeneous precipitation, a microstructure based strength and strain hardening model, and a micro-mechanics based damage model. The presentation of each model is supplemented by the coverage of relevant recent literature. The “model chain” is assessed towards a wide range of experimental data. The final objective is to present routes for the optimization of the FSW process using both experiments and models. Now, this strategy goes well beyond the case of FSW, illustrating the potential of chain models to support a “material by design approach” from process to performances.

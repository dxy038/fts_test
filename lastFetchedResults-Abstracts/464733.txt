OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pelvic masses by B-mode and Doppler ultrasonography for identification of ovarian malignancies. STUDY DESIGN: A previously described scoring system for pelvic masses was applied in 310 women, and the lesions were classified into four groups according to the ultrasonographic structure. Pulsatility index values of vessels within the tumor and the contralateral ovary and of both uterine arteries were determined. RESULTS: A total of 259 masses were benign and 51 were malignant. The scoring system and classification into morphologic groups revealed similar sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Intratumoral and opposite ovarian blood flow and ipsilateral and contralateral uterine blood flow did not differ in benign and malignant masses except in cases of benign lesions in postmenopausal women. In malignant lesions a lower pulsatility index (0.94 ± 0.4) was measured than in benign lesions (1.06 ± 0.4, p< 0.05), although a remarkable overlap was found. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that further refinement of assessment of pelvic masses with Doppler ultrasonography is needed. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:97-104.)

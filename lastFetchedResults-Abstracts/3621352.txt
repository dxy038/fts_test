This paper discusses the short-time-scale transient processes in an isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter with phase-shift control. The deadband effect on the steady-state and transient commutating process are analyzed. The current variations caused by phase-shift errors at the boundary conditions are simulated and validated through experiments. The concept of ldquoenergy deadbandrdquo is introduced to describe those specific transients where no energy flows from source to load or load to source. A set of strategies are proposed to increase the system robustness. Simulation and experiments on a 200-V/400-V, 6-kW DC-DC converter prototype validated these strategies.

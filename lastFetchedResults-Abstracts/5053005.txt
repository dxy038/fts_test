We describe a very efficient algorithm for determining the scattering of wave-packets in 2D and 3D off a rough interface. The immediate objective is to derive effective scattering rates for utilisation in Monte Carlo simulation of MOSFET devices. Our methodology involves solving the multi-dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger equation, based on two-time iteration and direct integration.

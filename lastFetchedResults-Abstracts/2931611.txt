We present the work of our research on a human-friendly system which has an intelligent human-machine interface. The intelligent human-machine interface that we are developing gives a response in accordance with users´ intention and their knowledge. In the system an interactive decision support method is needed not only to make an answer, but also to give its positive cooperation, and interactive fuzzy programming is one of such a method. However, it does not make our system cooperative, because the user must make interactions by considering the trade-off rates between objective functions and decide reference membership values. Our decision support method uses a user model which infers the user´s information (e.g., preference, knowledge). This decision support method is implemented and its effectiveness is demonstrated

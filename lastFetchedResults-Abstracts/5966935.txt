The relatively high plant productivity, high nutrient removal efficiency, and flourishing roots of these species play an important role in water quality improvement and landscape restoration, which made they the preferred organism for ecological floating bed. The objective of the current study is to compare the uptake kinetics for P by Z aquatica, L mutiiflorum, and S. sudanense. Results show that the maximum uptake capacity (V<sub>max</sub>) and the affinity (1/K<sub>m</sub>) for for H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> have significantly influenced by three species. The V<sub>max</sub> ranked order of the three species were as follows: S. sudanense &gt;; L. multiflorum &gt;; I. aquatica. However, the affinity (1/K<sub>m</sub>) ranked order of the three species were as follows: I. aquatica. &gt;; L. multiflorum &gt;; S. sudanense. These results indicate that the S. sudanense had a high uptake potential for P at the studied supply concentration than L. multiflorum and I. aquatica. And S. sudanense has a competitive advantage over the other two species at high P levels, whereas I. aquatica are better competitors at low P levels.

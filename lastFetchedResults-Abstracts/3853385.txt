Little attention has been paid to an impairment common in motion-compensated video compression: the addition of high-frequency (HF) energy as motion compensation displaces blocking artifacts off block boundaries. In this paper, we employ an energy-based approach to measure this motion-compensated edge artifact, using both compressed bitstream information and decoded pixels. We evaluate the performance of our proposed metric, along with several blocking and blurring metrics, on compressed video in two ways. First, ordinal scales are evaluated through a series of expectations that a good quality metric should satisfy: the objective evaluation. Then, the best performing metrics are subjectively evaluated. The same subjective data set is finally used to obtain interval scales to gain more insight. Experimental results show that we accurately estimate the percentage of the added HF energy in compressed video

The endless number of capabilities and options that reconfigurable radars can provide is a huge challenge for optimal sensor control (e.g. waveform selection, beam-direction control, subdivision of antenna elements). Usually, radar optimization is driven by technical characteristics (e.g. detection probability, estimation error, task qualities), but these metrics are only indirectly related to objectives that are relevant for end-users: actual mission success. In this paper we translate the relevant operational parameter to technical parameters. In other words, a metric is developed to assess optimality of (offline/online) design and control decisions from a mission point of view. Two example cases are investigated in this paper: firstly, the optimal radar integration time has to be selected; and secondly, a radar antenna array has to be reconfigured for surveillance and communication purposes. The proposed metric allows to optimally reconfigure, select the radar settings and make the best design trade-offs in such a way that the expected mission success - the actual objective of the end-user - is maximized.

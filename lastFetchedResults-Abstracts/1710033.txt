BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: If the amount of remineralization is greater than demineralization, the non-cavitated enamel lesion can be remineralized and continues its function without restorative treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new mouthrinse on enamel remineralization.
METHODS: In this experimental study the crowns of thirty bovine incisors were divided into four pieces. One hundred and twenty resulting pieces were submerged in a demineralized solution (pH 4.4) for 48 hours. The enamel specimens were then assigned randomly to four groups (n=30) and stored in an incubator at 37oC for 14 days with different ways. First group was kept in artificial saliva with daily changing. The second group was kept in 0.05% sodium fluoride 1 minute per day, the third group was kept in new mouthwash (containing cesium phosphate and xylitol) 1 minute per day and the fourth group was kept in new mouthwash and 0.05% sodium fluoride 1 minute per day. The samples of the fourth group were kept in artificial saliva during the study period. Vickers microhardness measurements were made at the end of the study period and compared together.
FINDINGS: Mean of microhardness of groups was: group1: 20.35±5.4 kg/mm2, group 2: 24.9±8.2 kg/mm2, group 3: 83.4±37.07 kg/mm2 and group 4: 28.4±11.3 kg/mm2. Enamel hardness was significantly different in group 3 (p < 0.001). The microhardness was similar in the other groups and was much lower than the new mouthwash group. 
CONCLUSION: The new mouthwash containing calcium, phosphate and xylitol significantly improved the microhardness of demineralized enamel.

Background and Aim: One of the most important structural factors that facilitate patient's acceptance of full denture, is adequate and appropriate retention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the retentive ability of four denture adhesives in vitro: Safe Saze-Gum Sealing-Denstet-Corega.

Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted in vitro on the basis of measurement of adhesion and cohesion forces between acrylic disk and glass, with denture adhesive applied between them. At first the retentive ability of alcohol, water and artificial saliva was measured and recorded as control. Then the retention ability of different adhesives mixed once with water and next with artificial saliva was measured and compared. The procedure was repeated 7 times for each denture adhesive with 7 similar acrylic disks. Data were analyzed using. ANOVA and paired t test with p<0.05 as the limit of significance. Result: Comparison of four powder denture adhesives showed that the highest retentive ability was observed in Denstet and the lowest in Safe-Saze. The retentive ability of Gum-Sealing was higher than Corega. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, significant differences exist among the retention ability of different denture adhesives.

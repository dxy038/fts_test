Introduction: Physical violence against women in the family is the most common form of physical violence usually committed by family members especially by husbands. It is also one of the most important concerns for general health in any society which progressed rapidly. 
Objective: In this study, we aim to find out the features of individual violence and her partner.
Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study which surveyed physical violence against women by their partners in the years 2008 till 2009 who were referred to forensic medicine center of Rasht. We collected the demographic features of the women and their partners and other data such as addiction, cause of physical violence, economic status, using a questionnaire. Then, data were analyzed by SPSS (ver.16) software.
Result: The mean ages of women and their partners were 31.5±8.4 and 36.3±8.8, respectively. Most of the women had precollege education and were housewives but most of their partners had diploma of high school and were simple worker and actually not addict. In total, 80.3% of these families lived in urban areas. Most physical violence against the wives occurred in the first years of marriage. Echimosis was the most frequent sign of women when referred.  
Conclusion: Although some differences were found among other reports in Iran, these show that the phenomenon of physical violence does actually exist and requires more money and time to prevent it.

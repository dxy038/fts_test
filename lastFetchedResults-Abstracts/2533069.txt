Background and Objective: Delayed union and non union account for the most common complications of fractures of extremities in human. There are several factors influencing normal process of bone ::::::::union:::::::: among which nutrition is of extreme importance. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of nandrolone, calciumD and vitamin C on the process of healing of fractures.

Materials and Methods: 139 male patients aged 1850 years old with tibial and fibular shaft fractures treated surgically, were entered to this study and randomly assigned to 4 groups. Patients in group 1 received nandrolone decanoate, patients in group 2 received calcium carbonate plus vitamin D3, patients in groups 3 received vitamin C and group 4 as the control group did not receive any treatment. The groups were compared based on radiographic and clinical criteria for fracture ::::::::union::::::::. SPSS version 22 was used for statistical analysis. Anova was corporated for comparing groups in terms of their age along with Chi Square and Binary Logistic tests which were used for comparing ::::::::union:::::::: in groups.

Results: In the first 3 months following the surgery, patients in nandrolone group developed significantly better ::::::::union:::::::: compared to the control group, whereas there was no significant difference in calciumD and vitamin C groups.

Conclusion: Nandrolone in the first 3 months after the surgery accelerates fracture union but calcium, vitamins D or C do not bring about any effect.

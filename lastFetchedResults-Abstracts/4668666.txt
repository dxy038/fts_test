A novel error concealment method is proposed for two-view based stereoscopic video coding to address the challenging problem of adaptively combining inter-view correlation and temporal correlation. First, the disparity vectors of the lost macroblocksÂ´ neighboring macroblocks are used to recover the lost or erroneously received motion or disparity vectors. Then we propose a novel error concealment method based on overlapped block motion and disparity compensation, whose weights are determined by the side match criterion and viewpoints. Simulation results show that the subjective and objective performances of the proposed technique are both superior to those of conventional temporal error concealment methods for stereoscopic video coding.

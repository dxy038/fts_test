A novel type of interdigital transducers (IDT) on surface acoustic waves with two quarter-wavelength electrodes per one-wavelength IDT period was proposed recently for the multi-track solution consisting of alternating active IDT tracks and passive reflector tracks. Such 2D-periodic structure permits to implement single-phase unidirectional transducer behavior as well as to create non-reflective IDT for 2.45 GHz (ISM frequency band) in spite of the existing standard lithography limitations. The objective of this work is to investigate the influence of active and passive track apertures on the resonance properties of the new structure.

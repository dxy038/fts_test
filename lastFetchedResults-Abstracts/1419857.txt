Fracture toughness is often the major limiting parameter governing the use of tools manufactured from hard materials and there is a need for research aimed at increasing toughness without sacrificing good wear resistance. To aid in this objective, a simple and reliable integrated testing method is needed in which a combined action involving both fracture and abrasion occurs. One such method currently developed is presented in this paper. The method is based on the concept of edge chipping during the initial transition stage of abrasion wear, which is controlled by a brittle fracture process. The limitation of the method for tougher materials, such as tool steel, as well as for very brittle materials such as ceramics is also indicated. The empirical relationship between mass loss as a result of edge chipping during the initial transitional stage of abrasive wear and fracture toughness is presented in the form of formulae.

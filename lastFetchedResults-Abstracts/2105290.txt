Lymphoma is associated with a higher risk of sepsis as compared to other forms of neoplasia in people and dogs which might be due to alterations in cytokine production. The objective of this study was to compare bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motif-induced TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 response of whole blood from dogs with na√Øve lymphoma and healthy dogs. We hypothesized that whole blood from dogs with lymphoma would exhibit an impaired cytokine response to LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and peptidoglycan (PG) stimulation compared to whole blood from healthy dogs. Whole blood was collected from dogs with lymphoma (n = 20) and healthy dogs (n = 15) and stimulated with PAMPs or phosphate buffered saline. Whole blood production of TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 was measured. Whole blood from dogs with lymphoma had reduced TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 production capacity after LPS, LTA and PG stimulation compared to whole blood from healthy dogs. These data could partially explain why dogs with lymphoma have a higher risk for infection compared to dogs with other forms of neoplasia.

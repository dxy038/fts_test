This method introd uces the structura I error of regression deviation, which is an effective method
for the path generation of a vast type of planar and spatial mechanism. The proposed method
avoids point-by-point comparison and requirement of timing and reflects the difference between
the two curves very effectively in the objective function. By decreasing the number of the design
variables, this method would help considerably in decreasing CPU time. The objective function
that is based on regression error would converge to a global minimum by a genetic algorithm.
At the end, the effectiveness of the method is shown by two numerical examples.

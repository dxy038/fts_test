The paper presents a dual active bridge converter, i.e. an isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter composed of two full-bridge DC/AC converters and an isolation high frequency (HF) transformer, useful for application in a DC-powered microgrid. The dual active bridge converter connects a battery energy storage system to a DC bus so to provide a high level of reliability and resilience to grid disturbances. In particular, the proposed converter ensures a stable DC bus voltage when the microgrid is operated in islanded mode. Numerical results demonstrate the good dynamic response of the converter under transient condition of a step change in power balancing condition.

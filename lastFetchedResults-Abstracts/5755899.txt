The retrofitted electro-hydraulic system and hardware architecture of control system for hydraulic robotic excavator was introduced; the model of electro-hydraulic system was derived according to the principle of LUDV system. on the base of the above and results of experiments, the model was simplified, and the reference model for control was given; An adaptive controller (AC) and the adaptive control law were developed from the local parameter optimum. The test experiment on the trajectory tracking control of the excavator bucket tip was carried out, The result of tracking objective line for the AC and PID controller were present respectively. Form these results, the errors between the tested data and the target data for PID controller are more than 110mm when the level tracking velocity of the bucket speed was 107mm/s; for AC in this paper are less than 100mm at the speed of 135mm/s, the maximal nonlinearity is reduced to 3.8% from 4.8%. It shows that the proposed AC in this paper is valid and feasible.

The objective of this work is to increase the capacity of watermark information in "the audio watermarking method based on amplitude modification" which has been proposed by W. N. Lie as a prevention technique against the copyright infringement. In this conventional method, the capacity of watermark information is not enough, and it is desirable that the capacity of watermark information is increased. In this paper, we increase the capacity of watermark information by embedding multiple watermarks in the different levels of audio data independently. The proposed method has many data-channels for embedding, and hence it is possible to embed multiple watermarks by selecting proper data-channel according to required data capacity or recovery rate.

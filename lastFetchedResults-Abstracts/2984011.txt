In this paper, we propose an objective function for optimizing the power consumption of communication systems with nonlinear power amplifiers. With the proposed measure, a methodology is presented to optimise the power consumption with a general class of amplifiers, including adaptive dc bias controlled amplifiers. Furthermore, power consumption of a highly nonconstant envelope modulation scheme, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), is evaluated and optimized

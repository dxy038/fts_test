This paper presents the implementation of interactive Artificial Bee Colony algorithms based multiband power system stabilizers in multimachine power system. In the proposed artifical expert system, generator speed deviation and accelerating power are chosen as input signals to multiband power system stabilizer. The problem of selection of optimal parameters of multiband power system stabilizer is converted into an optimization problem and which is solved by IABC algorithm with the Integral of Squared Time Squared Error (ISTSE) based objective function. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed swarm based multiband power system stabilizer, simulation studies on multimachine system subjected to three-phase fault have been carried out. Simulation results show the superiority and robustness of IABC based multiband power system stabilizer over conventionally tuned controller.

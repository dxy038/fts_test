Background: Patients with early acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) may not meet the current neurophysiologic criteria.
Objective: To document neurophysiologic findings in early AIDP.
Methods: Clinical and neurophysiologic data from 38 AIDP patients, assessed within 10 days of symptom onset were reviewed.
Results: In addition to absent H reflexes and abnormal F-wave responses in the acute stage of AIDP, abnormalities of blink reflexes, upper limb sensory responses abnormalities with spared sural responses, presence of distal CMAP dispersion, and A-waves were frequently observed. Established demyelinating neurophysiologic parameters were infrequently seen.
Conclusions: Abnormalities of H reflexes and F responses were most frequently noted in early AIDP. Additionally, distal temporal dispersion, prolonged or absent blink reflexes, and A-waves were often present in the acute stage of AIDP when classic diagnostic criteria of AIDP were not satisfied.
Significance: Neurophysiologic studies in early AIDP frequently reveal abnormalities that are not specific of primary demyelinating neuropathy.

The objective of this paper is to build some typical jamming models, to evaluate the performance of different jamming modes, and finally to develop a simulation system of SAR countermeasures. For this purpose, the mathematic models of various SAR jamming modes are analyzed firstly; secondly the whole image processing from raw data simulation to jamming mode choosing are carried out, where the optimal jamming measure can be chosen out according to the three evaluation indexes discussed in this article. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the simulation system is accurate and useful to increase the survival probabilities of ground targets.

Summary form only given, as follows. This work reports progress towards development of adaptively tunable microstrip band-pass filters for use in ultra-wide-band (UWB) systems using capacitive RF MEMS switch technology. Six filters were designed, fabricated and tested to achieve higher level sub-system specifications covering 2 to 18 GHz in small steps. While low-loss was desired, it was not the primary objective and filters achieved loss of 4&#8211;10 dB depending on the frequency and state.

This paper utilizes a fuzzy PID control scheme with a real-valued genetic algorithm (RGA) to a setpoint control problem. The objective of this paper is to control a twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS) to move quickly and accurately to the desired attitudes, both the pitch angle and the azimuth angle in cross-coupled condition. A fuzzy compensator is applied to the PID controller. In order to reduce total error and control energy, all parameters of the controller are obtained by a RGA with system performance index as fitness function. For real-time control, Xilinx Spartan II SP200 FPGA (field programmable gate array) is employed to construct a hardware-in-the-loop system through coding VHDL on this FPGA.

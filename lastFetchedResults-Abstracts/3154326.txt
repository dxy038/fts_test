Differing from the traditional Economic and technological evaluation, the paper doesn´t firstly select several feasible projects to sort them by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation or linear weighted evaluation, whereas DM utilizes candidate solutions in GA´s each run, presets some distinct sample points to form the sample set L, and according to their binary relations based on the information of DM´s preference, inactively modifies the weights and fitness function, which ensure the search of optimum solution and selection of projects is synchronously proceeded. The design case is shown that the method is of the effectiveness and availability.

This paper presents a concept of biometric-based early-warning and intelligent support for physical access security system (PASS). The early warning principle exploits the real-time analysis of the biometrics of the individual being scanned. Binding all sources of information into an objective supported by intelligence tools not only provides for reliable identification of an individual, but also supplies data for situational awareness and risk management support. An intelligent approach serves for interpretation of biometric data in semantic form, as well as dialogue support between the officer and the customer. The training-extended PASS (T-PASS) is built on the PASS, and aims at assisting the security personnel in developing decision making skills. The PASS and T-PASS are directed at a wide spectrum of applications such as immigration service and border control airports, seaports, border-crossing, security of important public events, hospitals and banking

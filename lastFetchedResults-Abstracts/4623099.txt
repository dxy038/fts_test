The multi-mode project scheduling problem under multi-category resource constraints (RCPS) with fuzzy time parameters of activities is considered. A fuzzy scheduling procedure using weak and strong comparison rules for fuzzy, numbers is presented. As the problem is of multi-objective nature, a metaheuristic procedure, called Pareto simulated annealing generating an approximation of the Pareto set is applied. A discrete version of the &#8220;light beam search&#8221; procedure allows for interactive analysis of the set of generated solutions and supports the decision maker in selecting the best compromise schedule

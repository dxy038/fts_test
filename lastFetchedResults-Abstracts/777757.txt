Objective: Grape virus diseases are a serious problem in Iran. Leaves and fruits of grape
have been used for different purposes like cooking in Iran. The present investigation was
carried out to study on the cytotoxic-activities of extracts of fruits and leaves of Vitis vinifera
from both virus-free and virus-infected grape cultivars against breast cancer cell line (MDAMB-231)
and human embryonic kidney normal cell line (HEK 293).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the considered grape cultivars were
as follows: Rish Baba Sefid, Shahani Ghasre Shirin, Rotabi Zarghan, Asgari Najaf Abad,
Fars, Kaj Angor Bojnord, Sarkesh Shiraz and Siahe Zarqan. A real-time multiplex polymerase
chain reaction (real-time Multiplex PCR) assay was applied
to detect virus infected
cultivars.
The
cytotoxic effect
of the methanol extracts
of different
Vitis
vinifera varieties
on

cultured
cells
was
monitored
using
(3-
(4,
5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)
-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium

bromide
(MTT) assay
at different
concentrations (62.5, 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000 Âµg mL
).
Results: Among these cultivars, Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) along with related symp-
toms was detected in Siahe Zarqan and Fars. Methanolic extracts of leaves and fruits of Vitis
vinifera from both virus free and virus infected cultivars showed a range of limited to moderate
cytotoxic activity. However, methanol extract of leaves belonged to virus infected cultivars
was found to have strong cytotoxic effect against MDA-MB-231 at different concentrations. 
Conclusion: Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) can potentially increase the cytotoxicity of
grape cultivars.

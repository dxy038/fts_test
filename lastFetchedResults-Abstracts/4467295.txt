For fixed wireless access systems in urban areas, reflection or scattering from various environmental surfaces can cause propagation channel impairments and influence system planning and deployment. This paper presents an analytical and computational model of the propagation channel to predict the radiowave propagation characteristics with typical channels in broadband fixed wireless access systems (BFWA systems). The objective is to investigate the underlying propagation mechanisms that contribute to the statistical definition of the multipath-fading environment in terms of the K-factor of a Ricean distribution. It is employed in analysing the effects of building scatter on the variance of main link and co-channel interference levels in interference limited networks. So far the model uses relatively coarse characteristics of the urban environment topography and building surfaces reflectivity, while it accounts for the transmitter and receiver antenna radiation patterns, height and orientation.

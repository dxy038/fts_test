In the design and analysis of large microstrip reflectarrays one often uses the infinite array model as a good approximation. The objective of this work is to understand the effects of the number and type of basis functions of the moment method on the reflection phase of the microstrip reflectarrays. An infinite array of microstrip patch elements on a grounded substrate layer was analyzed using the moment method.

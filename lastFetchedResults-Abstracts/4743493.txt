The militaryÂ´s need to reduce both fuel and battery resupply is a real-time requirement for increasing combat effectiveness and decreasing vulnerability. Mobile photovoltaics (PV) is a technology that can address these needs by leveraging emerging, flexible space PV technology. In this project, the development and production of a semirigid, lightweight, efficient solar blanket with the ability to mount on, or stow in, a backpack and recharge a high-capacity rechargeable lithium-ion battery was undertaken. The 19% efficient blanket consists of a 10 &#215; 3 solar array of 20 cm<sup>2</sup> and single-junction epitaxial lift-off solar cells, which have an efficiency of &#8764;22% under AM1.5G illumination. A power-conditioning module was also developed to interface the solar panel to the battery. Thirteen systems were outfitted during a Limited Objective Experiment-1 in February 2012, and based on the results, a second version of the system is in development.

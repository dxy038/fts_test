The objective of this research is to assess customer satisfaction on fragrance notes with the aid of the expert system program developed by the authors by using artificial neural networks. The expert system’s role is in the preparation to capture the knowledge of the experts and the data from the customer’s requirements. The system has the capability to compile the collected data and form the appropriate rules for choosing fragrance notes for the products. In order to identify the hidden pattern of the customer’s needs, the artificial neural networks technique has been applied to classify the fragrance notes based upon a list of selected information. Moreover, the expert system program has the capability to make decisions in ranking the scores of the fragrance notes presented in the selection. In addition, to validate the approach, the expert system program has been tested with a variety of customer types and the results indicate that an average of 59.42% is correctly predicted from customer group selection process. The recommendations and limitations are also presented.

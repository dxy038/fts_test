The objective of this study was to determine the effects of supplemented selenium (Se) on plasma cortisol, red blood cell glutathione peroxidase activity (RBC GSH-PX-l), concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and body weight in pneumonic suckling calves. Ten Holstein suckling male calves were randomly allocated to two groups and fed either unsupplemented milk (control) or with milk supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg DM Se (Sel-Plex) for two months. Sel-Plex had no significant effect on cortisol plasma concentration. A significant increase in red blood cell GSH-PX -1, body weight and serum concentration of IgG was observed in the treated group, along with a non-significant increase in body weight. The results indicate that Sel-Plex supplementation of suckling calves with a marginal selenium status increases GSH - PX -1, serum concentration ofIgG and body weight of calves

Tree-shaped optical customer networks can be a cost-effective solution to provide subscribers with bidirectional switched service. In such a network several customers are connected to one transmitter/receiver pair in the exchange by a fiber tree realized with passive optical splitters. For the transmission of switched signals in such a tree network, electrical subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) is a very attractive transmission scheme to avoid signal collision between the different channels. An optical SCM system is described and the maximum channel bitrate is calculated for different numbers of subscribers. Carrier frequencies up to several hundred megahertz are applied. All components for such a system are commercially available

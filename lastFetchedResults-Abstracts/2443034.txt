Hierarchical classification can be seen as a multidimensional classification problem where the objective is to predict a class, or set of classes, according to a taxonomy. There have been different proposals for hierarchical classification, including local and global approaches. Local approaches can suffer from the inconsistency problem, that is, if a local classifier has a wrong prediction, the error propagates down the hierarchy. Global approaches tend to produce more complex models. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach inspired in multidimensional classification. It starts by building a multi-class classifier per each parent node in the hierarchy. In the classification phase, all the local classifiers are applied simultaneously to each instance, providing a probability for each class in the taxonomy. Then the probability of the subset of classes, for each path in the hierarchy, is obtained by combining the local classifiers results. The path with highest probability is returned as the result for all the levels in the hierarchy. As an extension of the proposal method, we also developed a new technique, based on information gain, to classifies at different levels in the hierarchy. The proposed method was tested on different hierarchical classification data sets and was compared against state-of-the-art methods, resulting in superior predictive performance and/or efficiency to the other approaches in all the datasets.

Energy and environmental issues are two of the greatest challenges facing the world today. In response to energy needs and environmental concerns, renewable energy technologies are now considered the future technologies of choice. Renewable energy is produced from natural sources that are clean and free; however, it is widely accepted that renewable energy is not a solution without challenges. An example of this can be seen in the UK, where there is much interest amongst generation developers in the construction of new large scale onshore and offshore wind farms, especially in Scotland. The stability of electric power systems is also an important issue. It is important to have full knowledge of the system and to be able to predict the behaviour under different situations is an important objective. As a result, several industrial grade power system simulator tools have been developed in order to estimate the behaviour of the electric power system under certain conditions. This paper presents a reduced Great Britain (GB) system model for stability analysis using PSCAD/EMTDC. The reduced model is based upon a future GB transmission system model and, hence, contains different types and mix of generation, HVDC transmission lines and additional interconnection. The model is based on the reduced DIgSILENT PowerFactory model developed by National Grid.

A reduced-complexity decision feedback equalizer (DFE) that uses interpolation and bidirectional equalizing with a center tap position detector is presented. DFE tap gains during information symbols are estimated using an interpolation technique to reduce the number of calculations. Moreover, a bidirectional DFE is used to reduce the number of forward taps keeping good performance. To improve bidirectional DFE performance, the center tap position is determined by estimating the impulse response. Performance is evaluated by computer simulation for the case of 512 k symbols/s 16 QAM transmission, assuming a maximum delay of 10 &#956;s sec. The proposed method is confirmed to be effective and simple for high-speed data transmission in land mobile communications

Despite the significant progress in recent years in neural recording and stimulation using silicon-based probes, there is still a lack of suitable tools for the truly three-dimensional access to large ensembles of neurons over long periods of time. The objective of the NeuroProbes project is to address such needs and to extend probe capabilities by adopting a modular and scalable approach in which chemical sensing and drug delivery are also incorporated in the same probe .

Cognitive radio (CR) introduces a dynamic spectrum access technology. One problem is how to achieve load balancing in time domain. Our objective is to balance the occupied time of slots for a fixed channel dynamically to obtain a user-optimal solution. Spectrum load balancing method with QoS support is proposed based on dynamic feed back theory and hash table (SLBDH). The performance of SLBDH are evaluated. SLBDH is an efficient and precise solution compared with spectrum load smoothing (SLS) method.

We obtained good results in the right heart bypass operation concomitant with the pulmonary arterial augmentation using the vena cava in 7 patients. We report the techniques used in 2 representative patients. The techniques used were a hemi-Fontan procedure with large superior vena caval patches and a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt with superior vena caval interposition. These techniques have advantages in that the augmented pulmonary arteries have growth potential and low thrombogenicity because the procedures can be performed without the use of prosthetic materials or xenografts, especially in cases in which it is impossible to use the autologous pericardium.

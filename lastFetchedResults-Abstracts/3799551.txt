An intelligent battery equalization scheme based on fuzzy logic control is presented to adaptively control the equalizing process of series-connected lithium-ion batteries. The proposed battery equalization scheme is a bidirectional dc-dc converter with energy transferring capacitor that can be used to design the bidirectional nondissipative equalizer for a battery balancing system. Furthermore, it can be designed as a ripple-free converter for improving the input current distortion of the battery charge supply power system. A fuzzy-logic-controlled strategy is constructed with a set of membership functions to prescribe the cells equalizing behavior within a safe equalizing region for rapid cell voltage balancing. The simulation and experimental results show the advantage of the predicted equalizing performance of the lithium-ion battery stacks. The proposed fuzzy logic control battery equalization controller can abridge the equalization time about 32%. The proposed method maintains safe operation during the charge/discharge state in each lithium-ion cell of the battery strings.

Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) type
controller is still widely used for the solution of the Load
Frequency Control (LFC) problem. On the other hand,
the optimal tuning of PID gains is required to get the
desired level of robust performance under different
operation conditions. In this paper, optimal gains tuning
of a PID controller for solution of the LFC problem in the
restructured power system is proposed using Artificial
Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The problem of robustly
tuning of PID based LFC design is formulated as an
optimization problem according to the time domain-based
objective function which is solved by the ABC technique
that has a strong ability to find the most optimistic
results. To ensure performance and robustness of the
proposed control strategy to stabilize frequency
oscillations, the design process takes a wide range of
operating conditions and system nonlinearities into
account. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method a two-area restructured power system is
considered as a test system under different operating
conditions. The simulation results are shown to maintain
robust performance in comparison with the particle
swarm optimization and genetic algorithm based tuned
PID controllers through FD and ITAE performance
indices. Results evaluation show that the proposed
control strategy achieves good robust performance for
wide range of system parameters and load changes in the
presence of system nonlinearities and is superior to the
other controllers. Moreover, the proposed control strategy
has simple structure, easy to implement and tune which
can be useful for the real world restructured power
system.

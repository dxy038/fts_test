The objective of this study was to introduce a simple method for identification of caviar species in caspian sea sturgeons. For this purpose, caviar samples of Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, A. percicus, A. stellatus, A. ndiventeri and Huso huso were collected from fishery stations, Khajenaphas, Torkaman and Chalasht in Golestan province and propagation center of sturgeons in Aghalla city. The extracted DNA from caviars  were amplified using three primers termed R1, F2a and F1a, which were designed for cytb gene in the mtDNA.  The primers of R1 and F1a were universlly introduced for all corresponding species in this study whereas R1 and F2a were spesific for A. stellatus. In addition, the results of sequencing obtained in cytb gene showed that the region studied here can be successfully utilized for identification of A. stellatus, A. ndiventeri and Huso huso species. phylogenetical study and the sequential corrolation among species studied verified the results obtained in this investigation. The results of this study can be perfectly  used for identification of caviar in forensic,import and export issues.

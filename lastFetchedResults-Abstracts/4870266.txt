Based on thermo-elastic finite element theory, the equivalent nodal thermal load is analyzed, and thermal load of each node load as a physical force is applied to the elastic field. The model of structural topology optimization of continuum structure considering thermo-mechanical coupling is established using the minimum strain energy as the goal. The solid isotropic material with penalization approach is used, the sensitivity of the objective function are computed by the adjoint method. The optimization problem is solved using the method of Moving Asymptotes. Several numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility of the presented approach in this paper.

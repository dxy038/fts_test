A method for the design of controllers with a specific arbitrary structure for linear multivariable time-invariant systems is presented. This method gives a solution to the problem of designing decentralized controllers and includes feedback from a reduced state vector and the output feedback gain matrix. The method does not need to be initialized by a stabilizing controller and is therefore a solution to the stabilization problem. A proof that the algorithm will converge to a stabilizing controller under nonrestrictive assumptions is given. The solution corresponds, at least, to a local minimum for a design objective

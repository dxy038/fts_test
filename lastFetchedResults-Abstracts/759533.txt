This study replicated and extended prior research
by examining neighborhood context as a moderator of the
relation between the constellation of hyperactivity, impulsivity,
and attention (HIA) difficulties and conduct problems
among African American youth (11â€“16 years old;
55% girls) from single mother homes (N=193). Using
audio computer-assisted interview (ACASI) software,
mother-child dyads provided ratings of HIA difficulties
and two domains of conduct problems: aggression and rulebreaking.
In addition, both subjective (mother-report) and
objective (census data) indices of neighborhood context
were assessed. Findings revealed that both subjective and
objective indices of neighborhood context moderated the
relation between HIA and conduct problems, but the pattern
of moderation differed depending on the index and
combination of reporters. Future research directions and
implications of the findings are discussed

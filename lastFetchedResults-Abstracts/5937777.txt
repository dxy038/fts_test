This paper studies a framework of controlling a system with multiple interactive control loops including a continuously activated primary loop and discretely activated secondary loops. The structure of the controller in the primary loop is unknown while its output is observable and the controllers in secondary loops are subject to design such that the control performance of the primary loop can be assisted when facing significant changes in the plant, the environment, and the control objective. Such a paradigm fits very well with driver-in-the-loop vehicle controls where the primary loop includes a driver while the secondary loops include electronic devices.

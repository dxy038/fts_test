Background: Constipation and body weight loss are prevalent among old people. Treatment with
different species of lactic acid bacteria has been suggested for various forms of gastrointestinal disorders.
Objective, participants and intervention: This pilot study was performed to assess the feasibility of administering
and consuming a drinkable yoghurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus LB 21 and Lactococcus L1A, and to
evaluate the influence on bowel movements and body weight in 15 people with dementia, aged 65-95 years in
residential care facility. Design: A drinkable yoghurt (Verum DrickyoghurtÂ©) with added bacteria was served
daily for 6 months in conjunction with ordinary food intake. Body weight, bowel movement frequency and
consistency, food and fluid intake and time spent in various activities were recorded for two weeks preintervention,
and 3 times during the follow-up period. Result: This study showed that the yoghurt was easy to
serve, with few side effects for the participants and that the various recording forms and diaries were easy for the
staff to complete. The extra intake of yoghurt did not have any detectable beneficial effect on bowel movements.
The overnight fast was almost 15 hours per day. Body weight decreased by 0.65 kg/month (95% confidence
interval. 0.27-0.97). Conclusions: The present study design was feasible in this group of old people with
dementia. The absence of any detectable effect of the supplement on constipation, but rather a considerable loss
in body weight, indicate that further research is needed in a large randomised controlled trial, if associations
between dementia, constipation and energy balance are to be understood.

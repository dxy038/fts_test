We performed diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiostomy with drainage and biopsy in 51 patients with moderate to large pericardial effusions of different etiologies from August 1991 to July 1995. Patients were divided into 4 groups (group 1, tuberculous pericarditis; group 2, suspected tuberculous pericarditis; group 3, acute pericarditis; group 4, malignancy). The pericardial fluid adenosine deaminase level in tuberculosis (87±10 U/l) was significantly higher than that in malignancy or acute pericarditis (21±4 U/l, 23±7 U/l, respectively) (P=0.0001). The mean pericardial fluid carcinoembryonic antigen level (1.8±0.3 ng/ml) in benign disease was significantly lower than that (170.7±46.4 ng/ml) in malignant disease (P=0.0001). Follow-up study has been done. With a new scoring system (each score 1 for adenosine deaminase ≥40 U/l, or carcinoembryonic antigen ≤5 ng/ml) in 25 patients since November 1993, we could diagnose 5 among 7 patients (71%) with tuberculosis, 11 among 13 patients (85%) with malignancy (adenosine deaminase ≤40 U/l, or carcinoembryonic antigen ≥5 ng/ml) and 5 among 5 patients (100%) with acute pericarditis (adenosine deaminase ≤40 U/l, or carcinoembryonic antigen ≤5 ng/ml), respectively. Our long-term follow-up study suggests that with the new scoring system we can decrease complications or avoid unnecessary procedures or treatments of patients.

This paper presents a study of Optimal Power Flow calculation, coupled with additional transient stability constraints (TSC-OPF). Besides, with some modifications to the formulation of the transient stability constraint, a better convergence property can be achieved. The framework is applied to the cases of two standard test power systems, with the objective of minimizing total active power loss. It is shown that the current TSC-OPF framework can be used for loss minimization TSC-OPF.

Stand alone PV based systems for household applications require reliable and efficient power converter configuration along with good battery performance. This paper introduces a reliable, efficient and reduced stage PV based power generating unit using battery as an energy storage element. In this paper, a transformer coupled half-bridge boost converter has been used for harnessing power from PV, along with a bidirectional converter for battery charging/discharging control and a single-phase inverter for connecting to AC loads. A control scheme for the system has been proposed for controlling output voltage, inverter dc link voltage, MPPT of PV and battery current. The scheme has been validated by performing detailed simulation studies.

To increase the quality of college student´s work, every college does the job evaluation on student´s work performance. In this way to get the ranking of the departments. The existing evaluate fine print is very trivial, the data needed is vast and the evaluated method is much subjective. This paper applies factor analysis method which can find the main factors that influence the achievement of student´s work from a great deal of data. The factor model can be built through the scores of items of every department. Thus to simplify the evaluate system. The component score can do monomial or multinomial comprehensive evaluation, so as to make the result much more objective and to reflect the college student´s management grade in an-all-round way. The last part gives the design idea and method of evaluated software.

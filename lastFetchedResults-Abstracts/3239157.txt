The development of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) applications is an arduous task, since the application needs to be customized for each sensor. Thus, the automatic generation of WSN´s applications is desirable to reduce costs, since it drastically reduces the human effort. This paper presents the use of Genetic Programming to automatically generate WSNs applications. A scripting language based on events and actions is proposed to represent the WSN behavior. Events represent the state of a given sensor node and actions modify these states. Some events are internal states and others are external states captured by the sensors. The genetic programming is used to automatically generate WSNs applications described using this scripting language. These scripts are executed by all network´s sensors. This approach enables the application designer to define only the overall objective of the WSN. This objective is defined by means of a fitness function. An event-detection problem is presented in order to evaluate the proposed method. The results shown the capability of the developed approach to successfully solve WSNs problems through the automatic generation of applications.

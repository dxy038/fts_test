This paper discusses an optimized double-precision floating-point multiplier that can handle both denormalized and normalized IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. Discussions of the optimizations are given and compared versus similar implementations, however, the main objective is keeping compliant for denormalized IEEE 754 floating-point numbers while still maintaining high performance operations for normalized numbers.

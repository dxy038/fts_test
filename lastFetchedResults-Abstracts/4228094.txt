We present an objective audio quality measurement scheme by using semi-fragile digital audio watermarking. The scheme is based on the digital wavelet transform (DWT) and quantization. The original audio signal is not needed. The watermark is a PN-sequence generated from a secret key. We also discuss the optimization of the quantization step for different audio signals by employing an adaptive control method.

This paper presents the idea of using a full wireless control feedback loop to control the water level in a water tank. Most of the literature reviewed either implements wireless data acquisition or remote control. The objective is to maintain a fixed water level on a remote plant. The control algorithms used are proportional-integral control and model-reference adaptive control. FM modulation is used to transfer the pulse-width modulated information of the water level at 418 MHz frequency and pumping speed at 433 MHz frequency. It is found the wireless system performance is almost as good as the wired system

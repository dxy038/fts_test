The palatability and effectiveness of great works in the world of literature can be largely related to their creators' skillful use of linguistic tools or devices. Many literary scholars believe that Hafez has had a great obsession with language use and continuously modified his words in an attempt to select linguistic elements that well suited to their contexts of use. This might explain why there are so many different versions of Divan-e-Hafez. The present author believes that the most appropriate way to understand the mysterious words of Hafez can be careful examination of linguistic elements in their contexts of use. Accordingly, one needs to closely examine all the linguistic elements, from the smallest to the largest ones, in order to understand which literary devices are involved and which specific subtleties are employed through them. The objective of this study is to investigate the creative application of two Persian demonstrative pronouns, namely "this" and "that" in Hafez's poetry. It seems that not only has Hafez had enormous capability for the use of linguistic tools, but also he has been more successful than his counterparts in the artistic application of the two demonstratives.  Based on the findings, Hafez has benefitted from all the figurative senses, as they have been mentioned in the semantics and grammar of language, of the two terms. Furthermore, he has assigned some new functions to these words. Indeed, he has benefitted from the secondary senses of these two terms 780 times through the whole of 250 sonnets cited in Hafez Nameh,  referring to ambiguity, humor, glorification, degradation, and surprise etc.

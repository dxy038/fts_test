A two-layer perceptron feedforward backpropagation network architecture with a minimum number of hidden neurons is designed using the backpropagation training algorithm for a noncomplex application, namely, controlling a plant inventory system. The design objective is to determine the number of hidden neurons and what type of data must be entered to get the backpropagation algorithm started. The convergence of the algorithm within a reasonable amount of time is sought. Test results are promising

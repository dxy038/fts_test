In this paper a new soft switching bidirectional DCâ€“DC converter is introduced which can be applied as the interface circuit between ultracapacitors and batteries or fuel cells. All semiconductor devices in the proposed converter are soft switched while the control circuit remains PWM. Due to achieved soft switching condition, the energy conversion through the proposed converter is highly efficient. The proposed converter is analyzed and a prototype converter is implemented. The presented experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.

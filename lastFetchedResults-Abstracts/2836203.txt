This work aims at the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generation (DG) in distribution feeders. It is used an objective function which computes a penalty for voltage deviation in each bus coupled with the active power losses of the system. In this way, it is considered the equality and inequality constraints concerning the power flow, total apparent power of DG, number of installed DGs, fixed or variable power factor and voltage limits. To this end, it is implemented a nonlinear programming model with discontinuous derivatives, which employs binary variables to define the location of the generation through a classical optimization approach.

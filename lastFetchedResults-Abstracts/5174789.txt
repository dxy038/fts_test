A novel scheme for fast decompression of grey level image data has been presented in this paper. One of the major motivations for this work is to evolve a scheme to support on-line decompression of image data files. The throughput of the decompression hardware block has been shown to support on-line decompression of image data. The results presented in this paper show that the algorithm for decompression achieves good compression ratio as well as acceptable subjective and objective image fidelity

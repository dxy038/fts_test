The continuous evaluation and genetic improvement of fleece traits in Angora goats are of
major importance to the Angora goat industry. The objective of this study was to estimate
variance components and genetic parameters for both physical and quality traits of mohair
in South African Angora goats. The data used for this study were collected on between 898
and 6211 kids (depending on the trait measured) born between 2000 and 2006 in 11 different
Angora goat studs. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated with
the ASREML programme for fleece weight, fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of fibre
diameter, standard deviation of fibre diameter, comfort factor, spinning/effective fineness
and standard deviation of fibre diameter along the length of the staple. Most of these traits
(excluding fleece weight) are measured using OFDA technology exclusively, and this study
was the first attempt to calculate genetic parameters for these traits in South Africa.Amodel
including the direct additive genetic effects only, were the most appropriate for estimation
of all parameters. Heritability estimates were 0.24±0.03 for fleece weight, 0.45±0.03
for fibre diameter, 0.37±0.10 for coefficient of variation of fibre diameter, 0.32±0.11 for
standard deviation of fibre diameter, 0.63±0.10 for comfort factor, 0.61±0.10 for spinning/
effective fineness and 0.14±0.08 for standard deviation of fibre diameter along the
length of the staple. Results from this study can now be applied for the estimation of breeding
values for fleece production of South African Angora goats and in incorporation into
selection programs.

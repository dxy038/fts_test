A flexible manufacturing concept in which production systems are built from standardized machine building elements is outlined. The principal objective of the modular protection system (MPS) concept is to produce totally integrated component production and assembly systems that can be readily configured for a specific production requirement. A study undertaken to evaluate the practicality of redesigning a torch explicitly for MPS manufacture using a set of design guidelines is reported. It is concluded that redesigning the chosen product for MPS manufacture is feasible

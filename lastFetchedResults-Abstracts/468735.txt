Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors that are associated with significant birth weight discordancy.
Study design
As a part of an ongoing collaborative study of twins, maternal and fetal data were obtained from the medical records of twin gestations at eight medical centers. The study population was divided into groups by difference in birth weight discordancy (≥20%, ≥25%, and ≥30%)
Results
Severe birth weight discordancy was associated with fetal growth deceleration by 20 to 28 weeks (adjusted odds ratio, 4.90; 95% CI, 3.15-7.64) and between 28 weeks to birth (adjusted odds ratio, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.72-7.06). Antenatal bleeding (adjusted odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.08-3.21), preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.70, 95% CI, 1.21-2.41), and monochorionicity (adjusted odds ratio, 2.35, 95% CI, 11.71-3.23) were also associated with birth weight discordancy.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate the importance of the early diagnosis of placental chorionicity, because monochorionicity is associated with a 2-fold increase in birth weight discordancy in twin gestations.

Background & Objective: Education is one of the fundamental pillars for developing capabilities, skills and competencies in the society. Comparing e-learning and traditional teaching methods help teachers and educational stakeholders in designing, developing and implementing appropriate learning courses for learners. The purpose of this study was to compare lecture-based and e-learning methods effects on learning and motivating physicians on the topic of acute respiratory failure using models, strategies and techniques of instructional design.
Methods: In a quasi-experimental study, 60 general physicians selected by available sampling were divided into two equal groups (n = 30) based on the two instructional methods. Learning content in the control group was based on the compiled programs of Continuing Medical Education and in the e-learning group it was based on the same programs with integration of the instructional design models. Data were collected in pre-test, post-test using motivation assessing questionnaire using Merrill and Reigeluth models.
Results: There was no significant difference between pre-test and post-test scores of participants (P  >  0.05). But after educational programs, the motivation of physicians in control group (126.1 ± 3.97) was significantly (P  <  0.05) less than experimental group (143.83 ± 5.45).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed a significant increase in participants' motivation after using electronic medical continuing education.

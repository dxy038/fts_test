The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between technical standardization and innovation in the ICT sector. In many ways, this exercise involves revisiting the themes or sub-themes of much work already done in this growing area. In others, it involves linking the dominantly economics standards-oriented literature with systems-oriented innovation-studies and other cross-disciplinary approaches. Our objective here is to review some of this literature and, hopefully, provide a synthesis that advances our appreciation of standardizationÂ´s role in the innovation process. This is an important exercise as a sure-footed understanding of the fundamental relationship allows one to appreciate the effects and implications of the standardization process within the changing environment, especially, implications for user-participation

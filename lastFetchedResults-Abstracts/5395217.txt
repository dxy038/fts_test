The ambiguity in the sense of polarization measurement, using amplitude measurements only, comes When four antennas, with polarization of each, located in the same great circle on the Poincare polarization sphere are employed. A mathematical proof of the fact that correct sense of polarization is impossible to determine when four antenna polarizations in the same great circle on the polarization sphere is presented. In great detail, the mathematical and physical relationships are derived for the prescription of complete scattering matrix measurements, i.e., what kind of measurements need to be performed for extracting complete polarimetric information so that the relative phase scattering matrix S(A,B) for any polarization vector base can be reconstructed. It is the prime objective of this detailed analysis to assist developing efficient polarimetric radar measurement design concepts.

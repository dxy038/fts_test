One key technology for a humanoid robot is to sense the environment accurately and control the movement of the robot in realtime. This paper addresses this problem and focuses on the visual servoing control of an anthropomorphic robotic arm. A high precision, image-based visual servo algorithm for an eye-in-hand visual system is proposed to control the movement of the anthropomorphic arm. The control objective of the controller is to lock all the feature points at fixed points on the image plane. Then, impedance control law is implemented to keep the flexible of the arm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified by experiments on our humanoid robotic arm platform.

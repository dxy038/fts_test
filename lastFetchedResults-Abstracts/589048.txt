Ewe abortion and neonatal mortality are serious problems to sheep farmer. The objective of this paper was to report isolation of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from aborted fetuses in a flock in Tehran, Iran. Abortion occurred in 10% of ewes in the flock. The fetuses were well developed and pinpoint, necrotic-like lesions were recorded on the placental cotyledons, whilst the inter-cotyledonary areas appeared normal. E. rhusiopathiae was isolated in pure culture and heavy growth were seen in abomasumal fluid, lungs, heart and liver of fetuses and vaginal discharge of the aborted ewes. The grown bacteria were identified using conventional bacteriological technique and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was confirmed. On the basis of the available evidence, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae might be one of the ovine abortion causes in Iran.

Anthracosis is black pigment discoloration of bronchi which
can cause bronchial destruction and deformity (anthracofibrosis).
A prospective, case-control study was performed to evaluate
potential underlying causes of anthracosis on 190 subjects
who referred for various indications. Age of patients ranged
from 10-85 yrs. 46% of male patients were farmers and 27%
were manual workers, whereas 91% of female patients were
housewives. During bronchoscopy, special attention was given
to anthracotic plaque, bronchial deformity, infiltration, or vegetation.
Broncho-alveolar lavage was performed for further cytopathological,
acid-fast bacilli staining (AFB) and culture in all
cases. No correlation between occupational exposure to dust
and two kinds of anthracosis (anthracotic plaque and antracofibrosis)
was present. In anthracofibrotic patients, 81% were nonsmokers.
The principal finding in bronchoscopy was simple
plaque of anthracosis in 21% and anthracofibrosis in 12%. Sputum
smear showed macrophages containing anthracotic granules
in 71%. Patients with anthracosis had positive histopathology
for tuberculosis (2] %) that was not significantly different
from subjects without anthracosis. Of 40 patients with simple
anthracotic plaque and 22 with anthracofibrosis, only two and
one patients, respectively were proven to have bronchogenic
carcinoma that was not statistically more common than in the
control group. Other etiology for anthracofibrosis should be
invest igated.

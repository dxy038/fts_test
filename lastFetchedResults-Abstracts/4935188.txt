A two-stage Ka-band gyro-TWT amplifier experiment operating in the TE/sub 10/ rectangular tapered waveguide mode at the fundamental cyclotron frequency is underway at the Naval Research Laboratory. The objective of this program is to demonstrate the stable wideband operation of a low voltage tapered gyro-TWT having high gain and good gain uniformity. Initial experiments operating at 33 kV and 1.5 A have demonstrated a linear gain of 30 d8, saturated gain of 26 dB over an 8% 3 dB-bandwidth, and maximum efficiency of 15%. The operation is compared with theory.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

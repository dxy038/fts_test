The Generalized Bernstein Problems (GBP) is a class of optimization problem with redundancy resolution. The control of robot motion has a large number of redundant degrees of freedom if only the task objective is given. A universal criterion should be introduced instead of giving an artificial criterion function for task by task. In this work, using &#8220;easiness&#8221; as such a criterion easiness-based motion planning and control for a simple joint with a redundant muscle is investigated in order to establish a general solution for GBP.

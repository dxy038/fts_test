The Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) is the underground (UG) mine which is located on the East ErstbergSkarn System (EESS) of Grasberg-Ertzberg Au-Cu district in Tembagapura Papua. The DOZ mine is operated by block cave mine method with average of daily production is 80 ktpd ore. Geological information is the important information required for planning, developing, and monitoring the underground mine.

roject was initiated in 2007 using the commercial database management software. The objective of the project is to establish the common and centralized underground geology data as well as improve the information transparency. Geological data recording in every draw points is to collect information of rock types proportion, grade and dilution estimates, water condition, clay contents. Solid data integration would help in 3D block model versus the drawn material reconciliation as well as mine planning processes.

rst phase of UG geology database management system was successfully to accelerate the creation of routine geological report and improve data and report quality. The second phase of this project was designed to integrate the geo-science data for UG operation support. The paper will be devoted to the management system of geological data collected from production in order to map the characteristics of rock. This may subsequently be used in order to improve all processes including mine planning, production scheduler, draw order, mud rush potential anticipation and mud rush mitigation.

Anchor points play an important role in DEA theory and application. They define the transition from the efficient frontier to the “free-disposability” portion of the boundary. Our objective is to use the geometrical properties of anchor points to design and test an algorithm for their identification. We focus on the variable returns to scale production possibility set; our results do not depend on any particular DEA LP formulation, primal/dual form or orientation. Tests on real and artificial data lead to unexpected insights into their role in the geometry of the DEA production possibility set.

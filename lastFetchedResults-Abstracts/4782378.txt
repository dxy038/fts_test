A global optimal mathematical model of increasing pressure for large-scale territorial gas pipeline network is established, and it takes maximum annual benefits of pipeline network system as objective function after comprehensively considered the upstream gas producing conditions, the downstream gas utilizing conditions, the balance equation of nodal flow capacity, and the power, amount, position of new compressor stations etc. Based on the strategy of evolution algorithm, a new hybrid genetic algorithm with embedded simulated annealing has been presented to optimize operating parameters of new building compressor stations in the territorial pipeline network. The analysis of an example in a certain pipeline network system with 19 nodes, 22 pipelines demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of the established model and algorithm, and it makes the decision on the optimal increasing pressure scheme for gas pipeline network.

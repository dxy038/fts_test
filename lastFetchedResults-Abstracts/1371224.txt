This study provides an alternative approach to decision making and its application in selecting the best attack helicopter. In this way, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to find the weights of the criteria after identifying the effective criteria for the evaluation and selection of attack helicopters. These weights, then, applied in the objective function of Goal Programming (GP) model. Finally, the best option was selected through implementing GB model per corresponding parameters for the available options. Several advantages of the model, such as less reliance on userâ€™s perceptions and subjective opinions, greater emphasis on real data, removing multicollinearity among the evaluation criteria, significant reduction of evaluation problem dimensions without much loss of information, flexibility in the application of quantitative and qualitative criteria, and ease of application show the proposed approach is more capable in solving the evaluation and selection problem.

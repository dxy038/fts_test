The SIAS s.r.l. company has had an active participation within the MIMICS Project (Esprit Project 20574), not only by developing base software for H.320 A/V/data multi point conference which was the objective of the project, but also as minor partner responsible for the field trial MCMCS (Multi Conference Medical Consulting System). The reason why MCMCS has been really appreciated both by the users and by EEC is the really innovative technologic subject we have treated. MCMCS application allows users to rake part in H.323 conferences using the T.120 protocol too. MCMCS users can have audio/video/data conferences by using the TCP/IP protocol. This feature allows one to distribute the service to a big number of users and, thanks to the quickly improving technology, to grant good quality/cost performances and more and more diffusion will be possible. The article describes the result of the MCMCS field trial evaluation in the period starting from November the 1st 1999

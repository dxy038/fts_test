Motivated by the autonomous developmental process of higher animals and humans from infancy to adulthood, the objective of our SAIL developmental robot project is to investigate how to enable a robot to develop its cognitive and behavioral skills through online, real-time interactions with the environment. In other words, our goal is to enable a robot to learn autonomously from real-world experiences. The work presented here focuses on the development of its auditory behaviors. Both simulation results and experiments on real robot are reported.

In linear analysis model on Ad Hoc network link inference, when the rank of routing matrix is not equal to that of its augmented matrix, there is no solution for the non-homogeneous linear equations. In order to solve this problem, The paper brings forth a link performance inference method based on multi-objective optimization. Firstly, link performance inference problem was transformed to a multi-objectives optimal one through simple mathematical transformation in the paper, Secondly, genetic algorithm was used to obtain a sub-optimal solution. The simulation experiment verifies the effectiveness and correctness of the method in this paper.

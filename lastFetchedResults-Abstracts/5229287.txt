The choice of the UHV lines depends on surface electric field of the bundle conductors. Based on existing calculation methods, the optimized charge simulation method is used to calculate the conductorsÂ´ surface electrical field of &#194;&#177;800 kV UHVDC transmission lines in this paper. During calculation, the offset distance is set as the variance of the objective function, the position and the quantity of the simulation charges are optimized with the gold section method, and the surface electrical field is calculated when the charge is in the optimal position. The result shows that the distribution of the surface electrical field and its maximal value can be calculated accurately with this method, although less number of simulation charges is used in this proposed method and the calculation is simple.

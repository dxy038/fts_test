In order to characterize indoor air quality at important public spaces in HuaiNan, two shopping malls, a waiting room of railway station, a teaching building and two restaurants were investigated. The indoor air contaminations measured included CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, TBC (total bacteria count), SO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matters with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 &#956;m), CO and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). The indoor and outdoor concentrations of these target air contaminations at these public spaces were measured and compared. The results indicated that indoor air of all public spaces except teaching building has relatively higher levels Of CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and TBC and their concentrations were higher than the Hong Kong Objective indoor air quality (HKIAQO) standard. Indoor SO<sub>2</sub> pollution was the most serious and the maximum SO<sub>2</sub> level reached 1880 &#956;g/m<sup>3</sup>. For PM<sub>10</sub>, some of them were above HKIAQO standard and concentrations of CO and VOCS were below the standard with a few exceptions for VOCs. Statistical analysis indicated that indoor air quality at these public spaces was poor and some advices were given to improve indoor air quality in HuaiNan.

A power allocation algorithm for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under the real-time price (RTP) of smart grid is considered, where RTP is related to the energy consumed by the base station. The optimization objective maximizes the economic energy efficiency (EE) utility, and the barrier method with damped Newton method is used to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results validate that, the proposed power allocation method can change the consumed energy with RTP, meanwhile the net economy EE utility is maximized.

The main objective of this paper, based upon a Pre-phase A study founded by ESA, is to define a preliminary design of a spaceborne rain radar from a precise review of user requirements proposed for climate research and operational meteorology purpose. A mission analysis defines the most suitable space segment, taking into account the instrument related aspects and mission constraints. As a result of several trade-off, the dual frequency rain radar design is described presenting in particular the way pulse compression is implemented to achieve a pulse response with a side-lobe level lower than -60 dB. Finally simulated performances shows this feasible spaceborne rain radar is in compliance with the user requirements

We present application of EM-simulators for studying characteristics of line parameters of different planar transmission lines. The main objective is to realize different planar transmission lines in EM-simulators and compare their line parameters ( de-embedded and non de-embedded) against results from experiments and analytical models for wide range of data, which further proves the validity of the analysis. The study has been done for microstrip, CPW, CPS and slotline on six different substrates with permittivity ranges from 2.5-37 in the frequency range 0.1 GHz - 200 GHz and conductor thickness ranges from 0.25 &#956;m - 9 &#956;m. It is a general approach, applicable to any line.

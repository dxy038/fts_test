Generally, the power management system of fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV) requires a unidirectional DC/DC converter for the fuel cell (FC) and a bidirectional DC/DC converter for the battery. To manage the various power flows between these modules with a simpler way, a new band-gap reference voltage (BGRV) control strategy is proposed. The proposed method easily controls these variable power flows by setting the reference voltages of each converter to slightly different values, and it can be simply implemented by commercial controllers as well. The operational principle of proposed method is presented and verified experimentally by the 400 W prototype.

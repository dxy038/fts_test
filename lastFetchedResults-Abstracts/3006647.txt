The objective of the IST project MIND (Mobile IP based network developments) is to facilitate IP-based broadband services for mobile users in various operating environments. Activities within MIND concentrate on the development, optimisation and harmonisation of the appropriate layers involved. The physical (PHY) layer was chosen to base on the high performance radio local area network type 2 standard (HIPERLAN/2). The work presented here demonstrates the applicability of HIPERLAN/2 to scenarios with increased mobility. Initially, HIPERLAN/2 was designed for rather static environments providing hot spot data rates of up to 54 Mbps. Mitigation techniques to overcome the drawbacks of a fast fading environment are thus studied within IST-MIND. The extracted transceiver structures allow the deployment of HIPERLAN/2 in almost any environments currently envisaged. Particularly, the system deployment of HIPERLAN/2 to a vehicle-to-vehicle communication scenario is studied and preliminary system level performance results presented.

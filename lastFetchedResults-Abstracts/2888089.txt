In the current scenario, wireless sensor network (WSN) is used in substantial number of applications. Mobile WSN (MWSN) is preferred over static WSN in many applications especially in mobile object tracking and trapping system. Coverage is strongly related to object trapping as it is easier to trap an object in fully covered area compare to partially covered area. MWSN becomes default selection when it comes to trap a mobile object in a partially covered area because mobility of sensor nodes can be utilized to enhance the coverage of the network and thus able to detect and trap target. One of the fundamental problems of MWSN is how to coordinate these mobile sensors in such a way that they can move together in order to achieve their common goal. In this paper, we present a game theory inspired mobile object trapping system (GT-MOTS) where mobile nodes form a coalition such that they trap a mobile object by exchanging some key information between themselves. Through this information exchange movement of one sensor influence the movements of its neighbours. The objective of the proposed scheme is to minimize the trapping time by reducing travel distance of each sensor node. The concept of cooperative game theory is used for coalition and concept of pursuer evasion game is used for mobile target trapping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with random way-point mobility model (RWP) and three other variants of RWP using NS-3 simulation.

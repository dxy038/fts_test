The main objective of this paper is to design a chip printed monopole antenna for WiBAN application at 6.0GHz. The implantable antenna in this study is submerged into canola oil which provide lossy environment representing the human breast tissue. The antenna performances are evaluated in term of gain, return loss, efficiency, radiation pattern and operating bandwidth. Both simulation and measurement results are in good agreement and hence satisfactory performances are achieved. The antenna gain of 5.8dBi with efficiency of 97% is achieved from the simulation. The antenna radiation pattern shows directional pattern with 6 lobes indicating that the antenna can cover more directions and this would be a very beneficial considering of body movement. Overall results prominently show that the chip implantable antenna is a useful candidate for Wireless Implantable Body Area Network (WiBAN) Applications.

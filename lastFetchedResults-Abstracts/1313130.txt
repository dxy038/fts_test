The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of inoculation with the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas sp. DW1 on eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) growth, mineral uptake and activities of the antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) of plant leaves under salinity stress. The study was conducted in pot experiments using eggplant (S. melongena L., cv. Yinjia) and a coastal soil. The NaCl concentration of the coastal soil was 0.57 g (kg soil)−1. Four NaCl levels were tested: 0.57, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g NaCl (kg soil)−1, by adding NaCl to soil, respectively. Pseudomonas-inoculated seeds had an increase in the germination percentage over its non-inoculated seeds under salinity. Salinity negatively affected growth of eggplant; however, plants inoculated with Pseudomonas sp. DW1 grew to a significantly greater extent than plants that were not treated with this bacterium. Salinity significantly decreased K+ concentration, increased Na+ concentration, and did not significantly decrease Ca2+ content in shoots of eggplants. Inoculating with Pseudomonas sp. DW1 increased shoot Ca2+ of eggplant compared to the non-inoculating eggplant plants under salinity. Inoculating treatments with Pseudomonas sp. DW1 had no effect on shoot Na+ concentration in 0.57 and 1 g (kg soil)−1 NaCl, but there were significant decreases in inoculated treatments than in non-inoculated ones at 2 and 3 g (kg soil)−1 NaCl. Salinity decreased SOD activities and increased POD activities, and inoculated Pseudomonas sp. DW1 had an increase effect on SOD activity in the leaves of eggplants. Alteration of mineral uptake and increase in the antioxidant enzyme activities may be two mechanisms for the alleviation of salt stress. Based on the results of the experiment reported herein, the use of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium treatment may provide a means of facilitating plant growth under salt stress.

The main objective of this research was to determine the effect of systematic 
motivational counseling (SMC) method on university students' academic achievement 
motivation and test anxiety. 30 students were randomly chosen and were divided into two 
control and intervention groups. Both groups responded to the inventory of school motivation 
and test anxiety questionnaires as the pretest. At first, 15 sessions of systematic motivational 
counseling were held for the intervention group and then both groups recompleted the 
mentioned questionnaires as the post test. After gathering the data, results were analyzed 
through statistical methods such as Analyzing Co-variance (ANCVOVA) and Multiple 
Analyzing Covariance (MANCOVA).Results indicated that SMC has increased the linear 
combination of depended variables (motivational anxiety) by 83/9% (F-64/936, P < 0.05). 
Moreover, SMC has increased the level of academic motivation to 73% (F-70.182, P < 0.05) 
and has decreased test anxiety to 62% (F-43.707, P < 0.05). According to the results, it could 
be concluded that Systematic Motivational Counseling (SMC) would have an effect on 
increasing the academic achievement motivation and decreasing test anxiety.

Evaluating the enterprise network security becomes more and more significant and important. The enterprise network security and its characteristics are introduced and analyzed. The quality evaluation system framework of enterprise network security index is established. Fuzzy evaluation index system is put forward to consider various factors. Through case study, it is concluded that comprehensive fuzzy evaluation can evaluate and solve the unclear boundary of some enterprise network security indexes and inaccurate fuzziness. As to the initial fuzzy evaluation and calculation of network security, the vector forms of results reflect the fuzzy distribution of the evaluation conclusions, which is more objective and scientific.

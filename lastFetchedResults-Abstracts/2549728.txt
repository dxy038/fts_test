Objective (s): Newspapers along with other mass media have a significant role in increasing health literacy of the general public. Pediatrics related information is one of the most important issues in newspapers. The goal of this study was to perform a content analysis of the newspapers in Iran for pediatrics information.
Methods: This was an applied survey performed in year 2014 using the content analysis method. Data were collected via a checklist designed by the researchers. The statistical population consisted of all of the messages printed in 694 volumes in five most widely circulated Iranian newspapers (Iran, Jamejam, Keyhan, Resalat and Etelaat). 
Results: In all 426 articles were assessed. Distribution of pediatrics related information published was as follows: Jamejam (7.50%), Etelaat (5.26%), Iran (18%), Keyhan (5.3%) and Resalat (17.1%). ‘Mental disorders’ (19.6%) and ‘Nutrition’ (19.27%) had the highest and ‘Pathophysiology of body fluids and fluid therapy’ and ‘Gynecological problems in childhood’ had the lowest (0%) frequency. There was little attention to ‘Human Genetics’, ‘Metabolic disorders’ and ‘Children with special needs’.
Conclusion: The Important messages in newspapers were more compatible with the needs of Iranian society. Iranian pediatricians and journalists have to pay more attention to the neglected subjects and perhaps update themselves with newer information in pediatric filed.

An important goal sought by holy prophets and their successors was to establish good life or ideal society. Although the term "Utopia" meaning the Idealized City is not mentioned in the Holy Quran or any other narrative texts, this issue is deeply rooted in the prophets' teachings and many verses and narratives regarding the objective and quality of ideal life or Hayat-e-Tayeba lead us towards it. From Holy Quran's point of view and as mentioned in many narratives by the Infallibles (Masoumin), achieving an Ideal Society is not only possible, but the main goal sought by the prophets. 
The main question proposed by this article is what the features of the Ideal Society in Razavi Culture are. Quran and Ahl-al-Bayt are the two legacies left by the Holy Prophet and Imam Reza (PBUH), as a member of the Prophet's family, inherits from holy prophets and previous Imams. Both theoretically and practically, they struggled to realize this goal. This article examines the most important features of the Ideal Society as expected in Razavi Culture which include: objectivity, justice, beneficence, rule of Imam, development of knowledge and economic growth.

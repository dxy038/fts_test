Background and Objective: Metformin and acarbose are two drugs, currently used for treatment of diabetes. The present study examined their effect, alone or combined together, on glycemic control, lipid profile and serum visfatin level in nicotinamide/streptozocin type 2 diabetic rats.

Materials and Methods: Type 2 diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (60 mg/kg body weight), 15 minutes after the i.p. administration of nicotinamide (110 mg/kg body weight). After one week, diabetic rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Three diabetic groups were treated with 150 mg/kg/day of metformin or acarbose 40 mg/100g of diet and a combination of them for six weeks. Body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR and visfatin were assessed and compared with control group.

Results: The data showed that all treatment methods down-regulated visfatin levels in diabetic rats, but the reduction was significant only in metformin group (162±21.7, 195.66±6.45, p=0.001). Serum insulin level also decreased in all treated groups, but it was significant in acarbose (p < 0.05) and in combination therapy group (p < 0.05). Fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin decreased significantly in all treated rats, especially in the treated combination group. Lipid profile improved in all treated groups and HOMA-IR was improved in combination therapy group.

Conclusion: Compared with acarbose or metformin monotherapy, addition of acarbose to metformin has a superior anti-hyperglycemic efficacy and provides an efficacious and safe alternative for treatment of type 2 diabetic rats.

The objective of device-level simulation of power converters is to obtain detailed performance information such as device voltage and current waveforms and power dissipations. The resulting model can also be used in the course of design to help optimize component choices. Issues involved in device-level simulation such as applications, problems, limitations and advantages are discussed. An example full-bridge converter is simulated and used for illustration

In this paper, we propose three IMS Architectures for evaluation QoE of the IPTV service considering Subjective Measurement; in this case, we added QoE AS, which applies in a periodical time a survey to collect the QoE value, Objective Measurement; in this architecture, we propose collected information about the QoS from the IMS Policy and Charging Control entity, then, We could calculate the QoE value using a mathematical model. Finally, an Automatic Measurement; in this case, we propose an comparison of the videos (the original video and the received video) and according with the results of comparison we could calculate the QoE value. Also in this paper shown how they could be implemented for future works.

Provides details concerning the design of an integrated voice and data communications link which is applicable to small local area networks. Through the use of baseband signaling the information requirements of 5 kHz full duplex sampled audio and 9600 Bd of continuous bidirectional data have been satisfied. The type of baseband signaling used reduces the possibility of interference problems and time division multiplexing guarantees the elimination of any contention. The design can provide power to eight remote terminals and one central controller. This is accomplished on a four wire parallel system such as standard residence telephone wiring. The communications link was constructed as described and was tested in the laboratory with excellent results

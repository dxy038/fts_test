Introduction: Selection and employment of clerks and managers is a crucial factor in modern organization and, recruiters try to select the best candidates in all organizational levels. One challenge which has been harmful for management stability is Similar-to-me (STM) effect. This effect explains that people usually tend to select a person with whom they have common demographic and attitudinal characteristics. Determination of all factors and challenges related to STM was the main objective of the present study. 
Method: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study performed on all managers of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS). A four-dimension questionnaire was applied with more than 0.7 ? Chronbach coefficient for all dimensions. Moreover, its content validity was approved by expertsâ€™ perspectives. SPSS 18 and Person correlation were used in to analyze the data.
Results: According to the results obtained with the participation of 60 mangers of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, narcissism had a significant correlation with STM effect (0.805). Also a positive correlation was observed between STM and groupthinking (0.875). Another result of the current research was the negative impact of functional conflict on STM (-0.685) 
Conclusion: Findings of the study revealed that the destructive consequences of similar-to-me effect through narcissism, groupthinking and functional conflict avoidance can affect the performance of SUMS managers negatively.

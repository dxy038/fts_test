According to the properties of non-cooperative multi-microgrids´ operation mode and electricity´s of different use forms, considering the difference of electricity trading price of each microgrid and the objective of electricity using, the economic operation model is established based on time sequential weight and the price difference of microgrids. The model can be assured a total minimum cost under the premise of according to each microgrids trading price to distribute benefits rightly. Finally tested the proposed model under 4 microgrids system, obtained the optimal operation mode of each microgrid, and through the analysis to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.

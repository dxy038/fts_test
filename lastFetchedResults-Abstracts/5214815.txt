The electromagnetic spectrum is one of the most prominent natural resources. Hence the quest to improve the efficiency of spectrum management has led to the evolution of a new form of radio. The smart software radio is an advanced technology which would not only be capable of managing spectrum efficiently but also providing reliable communication. The paper considers a frequency smart radio and the implementation of a smart receiver. An optimum model for the smart radio to operate in the radio environment has also been simulated. The most important objective of the smart radio user being, to reduce the interference introduced to the primary user. The model reduces it by using the concept of frequency hopping. Hence the simulated model can be used to study the behavior of a smart software radio in a real world environment.

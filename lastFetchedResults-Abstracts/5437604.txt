The validation test plans for embedded software need to be very rigorous and thorough. The information technology framework and a vehicle-centered intelligent system presented aims at facilitating this process. This system is designed with the objective of enabling a quantitative determination of the reliability of real-time systems. Software quality metrics are needed in the standardization of software in safety-critical applications, such as those pertaining to the operations of a vehicular microcontroller. A relational DBMS is utilized for a normalized tracking of requirements and the associated tests used in their validation. A granular and non-redundant representation of test-cases enables our system to derive the set of operations that are common to a large number of test-cases. As is demonstrated in this paper these common operations form the basis for test-unification and lead to an automated generation of the singular meta-test cases that are functionally equivalent to two or more lower level test cases

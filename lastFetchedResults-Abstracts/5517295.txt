Existing power efficient geographic routing algorithms have been shown to be able to reduce power consumption and hence prolong the lifetime of multi-hop wireless networks. However, in practical deployment scenarios where location errors inevitably exist, these algorithms are vulnerable to a substantial performance degradation in terms of energy consumption. Since location errors always exist no matter which localization technique is used, there is the need of a geographic routing protocol which can tolerate location errors and achieve reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we study the optimal distance of existing power-saving geographic routing algorithms. Through incorporating location errors into an objective function, we propose a novel geographic routing algorithm. Extensive performance evaluations show that our proposal is robust to location errors, thus statistically minimizing consumed transmit power as a packet is relayed from source to destination.

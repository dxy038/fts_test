Clinical diagnosis of a variety of neurological disorders requires accurate measurement of the horizontal, vertical and torsional position of the eyes, as both brain and peripheral vestibular pathologies affect the control of eye movements at rest and in response to sensory stimulation. We have developed and validated a video-based system for accurate binocular 3-dimensional (3-D) eye position measurement over a large range of eye movements. Clinical applications of this system have focused on eye position measurement for evaluating the function of the vestibular system, which exerts close control over eye movements. The objective determination of ocular alignment of the eyes for measuring strabismus, and for evaluation of the effectiveness of surgery for ocular realignment, is another area where the high-precision of this method has application

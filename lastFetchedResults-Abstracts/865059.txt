Surficial sediments and blue mussels were collected around the perimeter of Halifax Harbour. Samples were analysed for the levels and fingerprint of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). The objective was to explore the relationship between contaminant profiles in sediments and in mussels and to explore the possibility of deducing their sources, pattern of deposition and circulation in the harbour. Combustion derived compounds predominated in both sets of samples, with more variability observed in the level of petroleum derived hydrocarbons in mussel samples. Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF, dry/dry wt.) varied throughout the harbour, ranging from means of 0.006 to 1.26, where generally fluoranthene displayed the highest BSAF. Sediments and mussels give complementary views of the geographical distribution of contaminants, they reflect the state of benthic and pelagic habitats. Results observed for Halifax Harbour are discussed from the perspective of published data.

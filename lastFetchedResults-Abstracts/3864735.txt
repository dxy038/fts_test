Multipulse converters are suitable for high-power application with the merits of low switching frequency and perfect harmonic performance. But less controllability and poor regulation lead the restriction on its application. A bidirectional pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converter based on multipulse structure is proposed in this paper, which has the same perfect harmonic performance with very low switching frequency. A special sequential sampling space vector modulation technique, which has the sampling sequence from the lagging module to the leading module, is proposed to make the converter controllable like conventional PWM converters. The harmonic performance and linear regulation capability are analyzed theoretically. The converter is modeled in detail, and an instantaneous feedback control strategy with phase delay compensation and decoupling control is also proposed. The controller parameters are optimized to get high dynamic performance with adequate phase margin and gain margin. A 3-kVA prototype is built, and the simulation and experiment results validate that the proposed converter is quite suitable for high-power conversion.

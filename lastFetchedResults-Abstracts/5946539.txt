The objective of this paper is to get the VHDL code of the Sliding mode control of a field oriented induction motor without requiring to go through a programming language. The solution that we proposed in this paper is to use the Xilinx System Generator (XSG) blockset added to Matlab / Simulink. The interest of this proposed method is to profit of both advantages of simulink and XSG. The first simulates the control and test its proper functioning and the second allows to obtain the discrete algorithm and to have the VHDL code that can be implemented on FPGA.

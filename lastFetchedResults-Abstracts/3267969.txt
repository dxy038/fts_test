Device-to-device networks (D2D) underlaying cellular networks have been widely recognized as one of the major approaches for ubiquitous information exchange featuring future Internet of things (IoT). In this paper, we propose an interference-aware routing for wireless D2D networks. Our objective for routing is to minimize the hop-count, which can decrease not only the delay for D2D connections, but also the power consumptions in D2D networks. Moreover, our routing algorithm is designed to avoid the violation of tolerable interferences to cellular users as well as to fulfill the rate requirement of D2D services. Our proposed routing scheme jointly takes the geometric information, interference constraint, and D2D rate requirements into account, and yields only low computational complexity. Also conducted is a set of simulation evaluations in a cellular sector which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme compared over the baseline schemes.

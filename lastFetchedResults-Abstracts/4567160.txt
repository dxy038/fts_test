Study of P2P instability, acts of random nodes and so on. P2P application process makes a large number of nodes in the phenomenon of cheating. Some security algorithm based on P2P in general difficult to solve the above problems. PKI-based digital signature algorithms can solute to the above problems multi-well. In this basis, the introduction of the node behavior norms and behavior of a hierarchy of nodes, allowing for more objective evaluation of the node behavior-based and scientific, making the malicious behavior of nodes will have to pay more of the price, which contains a malicious well behavior, to some extent to improve the system security and reliability.

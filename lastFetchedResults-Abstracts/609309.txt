Objective: Experiments were conducted to find the differences between post-thaw viability
and
chromosome
aberrations
in
eight-cell
mouse
embryos
at
presence
of
dimethyl

sulfoxide

(DMSO) and 1, 2-propanediol (PROH) as croprotectants in different storage durations.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, a total number of 720 mouse embryos
from
about
250
NMRI
mice
were
vitrified
with
30%
PROH
or
DMSO;
each
diluted

with
a
solution
containing
30%
ficol
plus
0.5
M
sucrose.
Embryos
were
exposed
to
the

solutions
for
0.5
minute
at
25?C
followed
by
cooling
in
liquid
nitrogen,
then
after
appropriate
storage
duration,
they
were
rapidly
warmed.
Besides,
there
were
100
mouse
embryos
for
each
cryoprotectant
group
(totally
200
embryos)
as
control.
Embryo
survival

was
assessed
by
in
vitro
development,
and
chromosome
abnormalities
were
analyzed

by Giemsa staining.
Results: The proportion of mitotic abnormalities in PROH/DMSO vitrified embryos was sig-
nificantly higher than unfrozen control group. This was confirmed also by a reduced viability of the embryos as judged by a culture at the blastocyst stage (p < 0.05 in all test groups).
Conclusion: It can be deduced that long term cryopreservation may result in chromosomal
abnormalities and/or low viability.

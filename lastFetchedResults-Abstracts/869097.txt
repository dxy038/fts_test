In this paper we study the network planning problem of bi-directional self-healing ring (BSHR), which is a network structure providing higher survivability when there is a failure on link or node. Given a network with nodes, links, and demand pairs, our target is to design an optimal network comprising rings, which use only the existing links to satisfy all demands. The objective is to minimize the total amount of equipment (add/drop multiplexer) on nodes, thus reducing the major cost of SHR structure. We propose two integer programming models. For larger networks, we have developed an efficient solution procedure based on its hierarchical network structure. Computational results are given to show that the solution procedure is effective in obtaining an optimal or near-optimal solution.

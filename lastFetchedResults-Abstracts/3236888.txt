The mineral oil insulating power transformers is subject to deterioration due to mechanical and chemical conditions of use. In the course of use, the oil is subjected to oxidation reactions due to the presence of oxygen, water, and metals. Monitoring and maintaining the quality of the insulating oil are essential steps to ensure the reliability in operation of the transformers. The main objective of this paper is to present a methodology of Pattern Recognition based on Multivariate Statistical Technique, which identify the quality of the insulating oil how good quality, able to be recovered or to be discarded. This decision is made from the vector of chemical analysis of the basic characteristics of the oil. The automation of this rule of recognition and classification is proposed in this work by means of a computer program in C<sup>++</sup> language compatible with the systems of electricity distribution companies.

Objective
With the emergence of the concept of the leukemia stem cell, assays to study them remain pivotal in understanding (leukemic) stem cell biology.
Methods

We have cultured acute myeloid leukemia CD34+ cells on bone marrow stroma. Long-term expansion was monitored and self-renewal was addressed by replating of Leukemic-cobblestone area–forming cells (L-CAs). Also, lentiviral vectors were generated that could target L-CAs.
Results

A strong expansion was observed in about 75% of the acute myeloid leukemia cases (n = 30) and long-term cultures could be maintained for up to 24 weeks on MS5 bone marrow stromal cells. Cells that were able to initiate leukemic cobblestone areas resided in the CD34+ population and were absent from the CD34− population. Self-renewal within these L-CAs was determined by sequential passaging of these L-CAs onto new MS5 stromal layers, which resulted in the generation of second, third, and fourth L-CAs, which were able to sustain long-term expansion and generated high numbers of immature undifferentiated suspension cells. CD34+ cells that were able to initiate long-term cultures all coexpressed MEIS1 and HOXA9, and expressed elevated BMI1 levels.
Conclusion

We present a novel long-term leukemic stem/progenitor assay in which new drugs can be tested and in which genes can be overexpressed or downmodulated using a lentiviral approach in order to obtain more insight into the process of leukemic transformation and self-renewal.

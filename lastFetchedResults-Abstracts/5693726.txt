Addresses the dynamics and optimal cruise control of concentrated-driven high speed train. The dynamical model is completed by a multi-body system, in which couplers connecting adjacent vehicles are characterized by nonlinear hardening/softening springs. The design specification is a mix of command tracking and disturbance rejection. The authors apply a linear matrix inequalities approach to synthesize a multi-model multi-objective (H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance) state-feedback controller. Numerical simulations show the validity of the resulting controller

We proposed a method to solved the problem that the output is not equal to the interval of integer times caused by pitch alteration using the PSOLA method by voice/unvoice detection. The proposed method is applied to the existing PSOLA method by voice/unvoice detection in the voice region and the deletion or interpolation method about samples which are not equal to the interval of integer times in the unvoice region. We used the SNR for an objective measure and compared each sample by the existing and proposed method for a measure of the result of the proposed method. We achieved pitch altered voice which is equal to the interval of integer times and the SNR value of the proposed method is almost equal to the existing one.

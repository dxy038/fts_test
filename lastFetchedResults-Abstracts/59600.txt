The influence of amorphous clay-size materials on geotechnical engineering properties is recognized only for soils developed from volcanic ash under extremely wet, alumina-rich soil environments (called Andisols). The objective of this study was to quantify the amorphous clay-size materials in less weathered volcanic soils that are rich in silica, and to determine the influence of the amorphous materials on plasticity and shrink-swell behavior of these soils. Soil and weathered rock samples were taken from a slow-moving landslide site in Honolulu. Quantification of amorphous and crystalline clay content was performed with x-ray diffraction and the Rietveld method. Atterberg limits and shrink-swell potential of the soil samples were determined. The results showed that clay-size fraction in both soil and weathered rock samples were predominantly amorphous (55-74% in soil and 48-63% in weathered rock). Smectite and halloysite were the primary crystalline clay minerals, constituting about 15-30% of the clay fraction in soils. Atterberg limits of the soil ranged from 65 to 135 for liquid limit, from 30 to 40 for plastic limit, and 9 to 25 for shrinkage limit. Volumetric free swell ranged from 2 to 21%. The plasticity and shrink-swell potential increased with increasing the content of amorphous clay-size materials in the soil. Air drying and oven drying did not significantly change the plasticity. The study concluded that silica-rich amorphous materials dominate the clay mineralogy of the soils studied, resulting in the plasticity and shrink-swell behavior similar to that of smectite-rich soils and distinct from that of Andisols.

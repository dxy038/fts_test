This paper discusses the results of a survey on examination room assignment in University Kebangsaan Malaysia. The survey aims to measure level of satisfaction and requirement of undergraduate students, lecturers and administrators to examination room assignment. After analyzing the data from the respondents, we identified several factors that can be considered as soft constraints when assigning examinations to rooms. As a result, we model the problem of assigning examinations to rooms and proposing two new objective functions. The first objective function is to minimize the number of students move to different room in consecutive exams in the same day. Meanwhile, the second one aims to maximize room utilization.

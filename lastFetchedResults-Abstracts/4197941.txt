As the complexity of under the condition of large-scaled resource-constrained multi-project duration optimization problems, it is difficult to give its analysis solution. With the network technology in this paper, taking the minimum number of the multi-project weighted duration as the goal, then establish a mathematical model for the optimization problem. In view of the basic cellular automaton topological sorting algorithm can only work on non-resource-constraints´ single project tasks´ topological sorting under the logic constraints relationship, this paper presents an improved cellular automaton model topological sorting algorithm to solve model. Combine several projects´ network by setting virtual task nodes based on the basic cellular automata topological sorting algorithm, Start searching from the virtual node to meet the evolution rules of the Cellular Automata (satisfy the task´s logic constraints and meet resources constraints) for to be activated nodes; At the same time for multiple nodes to be activated, putting forward two sort ways by: If the priority of multi-project is different (weights not equal), then activate the task in accordance with the priority of major projects to sort of small order, major priority weights; If the multi-project ´s priority level is the same (weights is equal), then create a set of randomly activated sorting number with computer, and order them by these random number; Do so until all nodes are activated, thus obtain the objective function value. On this basis, and then got the resource scheduling solution of Multi-Project Time Optimization. Finally, this paper demonstrated the validity and practicality through a business case.

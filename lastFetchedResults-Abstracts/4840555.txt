Fuzzy optimum methods can scientifically define relative importance degrees of sample index. In order to optimize different materials configuration of the C100 high performance concrete, combine with different weight of batch mixture gained through AHP, build evaluation function of high performance concrete configuration process referred to fuzzy optimization theory on the orthogonal test. It makes fuzzy evaluation to the objective function value of different factors levels under orthogonal test on C100 high performance concrete, and it gives the selection of mix proportions and proposes ratio range of high-performance concrete. the results indicate that the fuzzy optimization methods can better solve the comprehensive evaluation problem of different indicators in the process of the high performance concrete configuration.

The inherent randomness of turbulence makes it one of the most difficult phenomena to model. The need to accurately describe turbulence gave rise to the development of empirical turbulence models. Accurate prediction of the onset of turbulence and flow separation is critical in estimating the lift and drag force on a rotating cylinder immersed in a fluid stream. The objective of this study is to narrow down the selection of turbulence models for the particular application. Using ANSYS CFX software, 28 model variations were tested. Through simple comparative analysis based on lift and drag prediction accuracy, the study suggested moving forward with either the Eddy-Viscosity Transport Equation or the SST-k&#969; turbulence models. Additional simulation runs and further literature review is needed to back-up findings in the study.

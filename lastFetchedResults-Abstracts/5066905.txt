Although air pollution control technology was very mature, air pollution situation in China was still serious. Air pollution control technology was not a single problem but a complex economic problem. Air pollution control audit has become a major work of our government audit office. But audit practices in air pollution control projects still focus on the use of funds-based. Control effects of air pollution were difficult to evaluation comprehensively. In this paper, the spread diffusion form of pollution, the concentration distribution scope of pollution and air pollution diffusion were analyzed to build the source model, the ground model of the biggest pollution, pollution migration patterns and other air pollution control trajectory model. By comparing three models on the audit object, scope economic, efficiency, effectiveness, indicators, risk and audit opinions, pollution migration trajectory model was the most comprehensive, objective and accurate audit model. It offered certain reference on carrying out the regional air pollution control audit.

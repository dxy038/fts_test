Design for reliable embedded system is a multi-objective optimization problem, which tries to locate optimal solutions in terms of reliability, availability, cost, performance, etc. Several possible solutions are considered and evaluated in order to get optimal solutions. This process is time consuming for practical systems, often incurring exponential complexity. In this paper, a Cuckoo Search (CS) optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problems arising in allocation and scheduling for reliable embedded system optimization. Results show that CS gives high quality solutions, builds steadily upon good solutions found during the process of design exploration and is less sensitive to variation in tuning parameters. These advantages make CS a good optimization approach for embedded systems design.

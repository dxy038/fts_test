Power distributing and consuming communication network is the key information infrastructure for the realization of the distribution grid automation, electric consumption information collection, bidirectional marketing interaction and smart grid, the important technical guarantee for the realization of the smart grid and the vital component for the communication networks in all regions. Integrating with the incoming development in Nanjing area of the power distribution automation pilot, electric consumption information collection pilot and community automation project and relying on the basis of index analysis for the business relating to the power distributing and consuming communication network including the business flow, business bandwidth, safety requirements, real-timing requirement and reliability requirement, this paper has made the bandwidth traffic prediction for all nodes and sections. Combining with the business demand and characteristics of all communication technologies, the main method of the EPON optical fibre of the dual bus network and the auxiliary method of the wireless public network are used for the design of the power distributing and consuming communication network.

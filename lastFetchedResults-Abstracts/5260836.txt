In this paper, a new meta-heuristic method is proposed to deal with probabilistic transmission network expansion planning. As meta-heuristics, this paper makes use of tabu search (TS) that is useful for solving a combinational optimization problem. In recent years, power networks increase the degree of uncertainties due to new environment of system liberations, the emergence of renewable energy, etc. As a result, a probabilistic method is required to handle transmission network expansion planning under uncertain environment. This paper proposes a new method for uncertain transmission network expansion planning. The proposed method solves a multi-objective optimization problem that considers probabilistic index EENS as well as the construction cost. The effectiveness of proposed method is successfully demonstrated in sample systems.

Under the control object and the structure of control system built, we set the range of parameters and the objective function and get the best parameters of PID control of the system by genetic algorithm, making use of MATLAB we can do the modeling and simulation of the PID control and fuzzy control. The results of simulation show that the dynamic response of fuzzy control is faster than PID control and the robustness of fuzzy control is better than PID control.

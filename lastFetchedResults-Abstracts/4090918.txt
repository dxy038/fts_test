The multi-objective controller provides a new method in controlling the domestic hot water load. Not only does it aim to reduce the peak system demand, but it also tries to minimise discomfort to the end-user and reduce his electricity bill. This is done by controlling blocks of households with similar energy usage patterns uniquely, and responding to a time-differentiated tariff structure for the domestic sector. Results show how the system peak load is reduced due to control, and how end-users save on their electricity bills with minimum discomfort to them. The optimisation method used for this control strategy can also serve as a load forecast and planning tool. Different scenarios can be simulated and the results compared to find optimal solutions for specific control areas

In this paper we consider resource-constrained type-I assembly line balancing problem (RCALBP-I) in which resource of different types, such as machines and workers, are required in processing tasks. The objective of RCALBP-I is to minimize not only the number of workstations needed, but also the number of resource types required. A shortest route algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution for RCALBP-I. An illustrative example is also given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

NSGAII is applied to solve the multi-objective urban traffic signal plan optimal problem. Cell transmission model is used to construct the urban intersection traffic flow model, and CTM model is embedded in the algorithm to replace the traditional objective function, analyze of the algorithm and comparison between CTM+NSGAII and other signal timing algorithm are made through an example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

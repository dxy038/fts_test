This paper details an application of model-driven development undertaken within the Celtic initiative project Madeira. The objective of Madeira is to apply model-driven approaches to investigate large-scale distribution techniques in network management. So far, the project has concentrated on building a prototype system using the peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm. For this, one of the major challenges was to provide a model supporting P2P characteristics, such as 1) self-organisation, 2) symmetric communication and 3) distributed control and domain specific concepts for distribution and management as can be found in telecommunications. Our modelling approach had to consider the views of the different participants, such as equipment vendor (Ericsson and Siemens), network operator (BT) and service provider (BT, Telefonica). To minimise the complexity of the model, we have focused on fault and configuration management in a dynamically forming network of transient elements. This paper explains the complexity of the networks we consider and of the management tasks we have to cover. This can be briefly characterized by comprising a multitude of different, sometimes proprietary, technologies and diverse business models. We motivated the application of new paradigms, in our case the P2P paradigm, to simplify management for seamless service provision to customers. Based on this, we provided a case study of how we applied a model-driven approach to capture the complexity of the task and the complexity of the management activities, which ultimately led towards the specification of management information and behaviour of network nodes. The methodology we use is presented in the form of a ´vertical slice´, where a logical portion of the project, of limited scope and functionality, is brought from the meta-level right through to the development stage, covering all modelling and architectural work as well as the underlying platform aspects

We consider a flat fading multiantenna downlink system with a large number of users where the objective is to deliver equal rates to nonoutage users with a low complexity. We show that in the limit of a large number of users, a zero-forcing beamforming strategy combined with a low complexity user grouping algorithm based on a semi-orthogonal user selection achieves asymptotically optimal performance, with respect to an upper bound that can be achieved when no interference is present among users.

The plastic response of a polymer during equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) at room temperature has been investigated by numerical simulations. The objective of this paper is to provide some basic understanding of the plastic flow in the polymer during one ECAE pass considering various process parameters such as extrusion velocity, friction conditions and die geometry. The distribution of strains, strain rates and stresses, the deformation behaviour of the sample and the loadâ€“displacement curves were analysed for slow and fast extrusion by taking into account material non-linearity of a typical semicrystalline polymer (HDPE).

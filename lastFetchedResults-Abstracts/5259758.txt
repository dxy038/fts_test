In this paper, a novel method for selecting the optimal branch conductor of radial distribution feeders, based on evolutionary programming (EP), has been presented. The aim of the optimal conductor size selection is to select a feeder so as to minimize an objective function, which is the sum of capital investment and capitalized energy loss costs. The optimal conductor type is determined for each feeder by using EP. Voltage constraints and maximum current carrying capacity of the conductors are also incorporated in the algorithm. One example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the draft paper.

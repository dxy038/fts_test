A constraint non-linear optimization procedure based on genetic algorithms has been developed for designing rolling element bearings. Based on maximum fatigue life as objective function and associated kinematic constrains have been formulated. The design parameters include the bearing pitch diameter, the rolling element diameter, number of rolling elements and inner and outer-race groove curvature radii. The constraints contain unknown constants, which have been given ranges based of parameteric studies through initial optimization runs. In the final run of the optimization, these constraint constants are also included as design parameters. The optimized design parameters have found to be yielded better fatigue life as compared to those listed in standard catalogues. A convergence study has been performed to ensure that the optimized design variables do not suffer from local extremes.

The abnormal organic acids in urine are closely related with physiological metabolism. To determinate the low-molecular-mass metabolites in human biological fluids, although there were some previous reports by both of capillary electrophoresis and ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, but it was rarely found by reverse phase of liquid chromatography using ion pair reagent. The objective of this study was aimed to suggest and compare two methods, an additional chromatographic method–ion-pair chromatography (IPC) and a sharp capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), to determinate organic acids, acting as the abnormal metabolic markers, namely uric acid, orotic acid, pyruvic acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, fumaric acid, and hippuric acid. The proposed method of IPC possessed both the extreme stability for column and the good results of reproducibility, linearity and detection limit. The optimum mobile phase was 22% methanol and 10 mM tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate (pH 4) by gradient elution. As well as the optimum condition of CZE was 5% acetonitrile and 0.5 mM CTAB in phosphate buffer. From the results, CZE showed better recovery and sharp lucid electropherogram. Finally, the two proposed analytical methods were applied to assay human urine with direct and spiked analysis. CZE showed good potency to overcome the sample-to sample variation with standard deviation less than 10%. By comparison results of urinary spiked analysis between IPC and CZE by statistical paired t-test, the results were evaluated no significant difference under P &lt; 0.05. The quantitative linearity of both methods was fitted in application of clinical biological analysis even with 50-fold dilution.

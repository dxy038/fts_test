
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Menopause is the cessation of ovarian activity and anxiety is one of its symptoms. Many studies show that anxiety is due to decreased estrogen levels after menopause. Since phytoestrogens are plant sterols that are similar to estrogen in structure and function, so the present study was done to evaluate the effect of vitex agnus castus, which has high levels of phytoestrogen on anxiety in ovariectomized rats and compare its effect with estrogen and tamoxifen.
METHODS: In this experimental study thirty-five female Wistar rats (150 to 200g) were divided into five groups as following: control group, Vitex agnus castus at the dose of 80 mg/kg, Vitex agnus castus at the dose of 8 mg/kg, Estradiol valerat at the dose of 40 ?g/kg, and the combination of tamoxifen (100 mg/kg) and herbal extract (80mg/kg). All animals were ovariectomized by cauterizing ovaries through bilateral incisions under anesthesia. After two months, anxiety-related indices (% OAE) and (% OAT) was determined using elevated plus-maze test of anxiety for 5 minutes.
FINDINGS: Compared to the control group (21.67%±3.47%), Vitex agnus castus extract at the dose of 8 mg/kg (36%±7.34%) or 80 mg/kg (48.61%±1.25) (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively (increased the open arm time (%OAT). The plant also increased open arm entries (%OAE) at the dose of 80 mg/kg (55.17%± 6.91% vs. 24.5%± 2.74% in control) (p < 0.005(. Locomotor activities were not significantly different among groups.
CONCLUSION: Based on our data, Vitex agnus castus showed estrogen-like effects on reducing anxiety-like behaviors in ovariectomized rats.

This paper presents a theoretical framework that solves optimally and in polynomial time many open problems in time budgeting. The approach unifies a large class of existing time-management paradigms. Examples include time budgeting for maximizing total weighted delay relaxation, minimizing the maximum relaxation, and min-skew time budget distribution. The authors develop a combinatorial framework through which we prove that many of the time-management problems can be transformed into a min-cost flow problem instance. The methodology is applied to intellectual-property-based datapath synthesis targeting field-programmable gate arrays. The synthesis flow maps the input operations to parameterized library modules during which different time budgeting policies have been applied. The techniques always improve the area requirement of the implemented test benches and consistently outperform a widely used competitor. The experiments verify that combining fairness and maximization objectives improves the results further as compared with pure maximum budgeting. The combined fairness and maximization objective improves the area by 25.8% and 28.7% in slice and LUT counts, respectively

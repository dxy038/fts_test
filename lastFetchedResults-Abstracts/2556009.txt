Background & objective: Industrialization has led not only to an increase in
water demand, but also to an increase in water pollution due to the discharge
of polluted industrial wastewaters with high salt content, and the organic compounds
such as phenol into the water bodies.
This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of electrocuagulation and electro-Fenton
processes in phenol removal from saline wastewater using Taguchi
exprimental design method.
Material & methods: This experimental study was performed in a reactor (1
liter) with synthetic phenolic saline wastewater. In this study for electrocoagulation
process, the effects of five operation parameters on phenol removal effi-
ciency including reaction time (20-80 min), electrolyte (1-4%), pH (3-5-7-9), initial
phenol concentration (500-1000-1500-250 mg/L) and current density (4-16
mA/cm2) were investigated in four levels by Taguchi L16 orthogonal array. Also
for electro-Fenton process, the effects of six operation parameters on removal
efficiency in five levels including reaction time (20-80 min), electrolyte (0-4%),
pH (2-3-4-6-8), initial phenol concentration (250-500-1000-1500-2000), current
density ( 0-16mA/cm2) and hydrogen peroxide (50-300mg/L) were evaluated
by Taguchi L25 orthogonal array. The concentration of phenol was determined
according to the estandard method in spectrophotometric wavelength of 500
nm.
Results: Experimental data showed that the optimum phenol elimination condition
in electrocuagulation process was initial phenol concentration of 250
mg/L, pH = 5, electrolyt = 3%, curent density of 8 mA/cm2 and reaction time of
60 min. The most influential factor in removal efficiency was the initial concentration
(63.2%), and the lowest effect belonged to the electrolyt (4.2%).
The optimum phenol removal condition for electro-Fenton process was initial
concentration of 250 mg/L, pH:3, electrolyt:2%, hydrogen peroxide:150 mg/L,
current density of 8 mA/cm2 and 20 mine contact time. The most influential
factor in elimination efficiency was the curent density (29.12%), and the lowest
influence on response variable belonged to the reaction time (3.08%).
Conclusion: This study showed the electro-Fenton process was effective in the
removal of phenolthat can be used as an appropriate process in wastewater
treatment

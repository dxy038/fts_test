For the novice translator, who has not gained much experience, looking for equivalences and translation occurs in the first mental layer. Influenced by the translation of old texts, the novice translator learns to write down the meaning of every word under it. He is afraid of carefully delving into the meaning of the words, and writing down the different equivalences that come into his mind.This article seeks to find some methods and approaches to translate a text fluently while maintaining accuracy. The goal of this paper is to wipe out the complexities and uncertainties that formerly overrode the translated texts so that the readers of the translation experience the same joy and entertainment that the readers of the original text experience.

The main objective of this paper is to analyze models, techniques, algorithms and infrastructures needed to complete cooperative engagement for warships with constrained bandwidth based on the geodetic coordinate system. To increase the performance of maneuvering target tracking, the 2D and 3D target motion models and the observation model based on the geodetic coordinate system are derived. In order to cope with the target tracking and fusion problems which arise from the intense non-linearity and decentralization in a geodetic coordinate system, two decentralized fusion algorithms denoted as SR-UKF (TR) and SR-UKF (CI) which we developed before are used. Considering the limited bandwidth of the communication network in a battle environment, an adaptive selection scheme which captures the competitive and cooperative relations among the neighbor sensor nodes is developed for decentralized information dissemination. The simulation results show the efficiency, adaptivity and robustness of the proposed algorithms with high precision.

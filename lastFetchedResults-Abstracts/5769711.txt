A method for evaluating the profile error of complex surfaces, particularly the profile error of worm, with Minimum Zone Method (MZM) by way of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. According to the minimum zone condition, the mathematical model of complex surface together with the optimal objective function is derived. The principle and implementation of PSO are explained and PSO algorithm is introduced to search the optimal solution. Experiments show that PSO method is capable of evaluating nonlinear optimization problems such as the profile error of complex surface and can obtain optimal solutions. The solutions agree well with the result given by Least Square Method (LSM). Moreover, the PSO-based approach features simple and easy to implement in computer. It can be applied to deal with the measured data of the profile error of complex surface obtained by three coordinate measurement machines (CMM).

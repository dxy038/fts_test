An optimisation software package for high-speed electric motors has been compiled. High-speed motors are modelled with finite element and thermal network analyses. A genetic optimisation algorithm is chosen for the optimisation and parallel computing is used to speed up the optimisation process. High-speed motors of 53,000 RPM; 50 kW and 100,000 RPM; 100 kW have been optimised. The objective of the optimisation was to minimise the motorsÂ´ losses. The results justify the use of genetic algorithms and emphasise their accurate thermal modelling of high-speed motors

Food industries are forced to develop productions without secondary residues. Therefore, there is a considerable emphasis on the recovery, recycling and upgrading of wastes. The possibility has been suggested for the conversion of onion waste into food ingredients, but with a stabilisation treatment being necessary. The objective of this work was to study the effect of sterilisation on fibre fractions, fibre composition and physicochemical properties of onion by-products to evaluate the use of sterilised onion by-products as a source of fibre.

isation produced insoluble dietary fibre decreases and soluble dietary fibre increases, improving the soluble:insoluble ratio. Uronic acids of insoluble dietary fibre were partly solubilised and losses of cellulose and Klason lignin were observed. Physicochemical properties slightly changed with sterilisation. Sterilised by-products showed less oil holding capacity, cation exchange capacity and swelling capacity than control ones, although their physicochemical properties were generally higher than those of cellulose. Therefore, sterilisation would be considered a good method to stabilise onion by-products to use as a potential dietary fibre ingredient.

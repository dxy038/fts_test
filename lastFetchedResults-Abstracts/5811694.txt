This paper presents a formulation of security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with emphasizing on wind farm. In past years, a fast growth in development of wind generation has been experienced in power system. The problem is finding a solution which satisfies the constraints and maximizes the objective function. The proposed model is solved using a standard Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) solver. Case studies with the eight-bus system are presented in detail in this paper.

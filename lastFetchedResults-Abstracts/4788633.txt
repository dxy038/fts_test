Our paper discusses how active warden operates and why it is important for steganographers to understand the impending threat in which they possess. It was a common belief that the main adversary for steganography is coming from steganalysis detection. However, we have found in some situation, the destruction of hidden information is more easily achievable compared to the task of detecting it. Active Wardens are attackers of steganography which aims to demolish possible hidden information within a carrier media. If the enemyÂ´s objective is to disrupt the communication of hidden information, then the active approach is definitely a better choice compared to passive time consuming steganalysis.

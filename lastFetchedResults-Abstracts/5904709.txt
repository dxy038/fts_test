In this paper, the Morse-type FK model is applied to the study of friction control required in many fields. Based on the Morse-type FK model, a feedback tracking control law using limited accessible elements is designed to realize an accurate tracking whose objective is to make the average system reach a designated velocity. In addition, the motion properties of each single particle are analyzed. Simulation results show satisfactory performances.

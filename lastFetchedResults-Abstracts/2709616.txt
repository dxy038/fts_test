In order to interface one photovoltaic (PV) port, one bidirectional battery port, and one load port of a PV-battery dc power system, a novel nonisolated three-port dc/dc converter named boost bidirectional buck converter (B3C) and its control method based on three-domain control are proposed in this paper. The power flow and operating principles of the proposed B3C are analyzed in detail, and then, the dc voltage relation between three ports is deduced. The proposed converter features high integration and single-stage power conversion from both PV and battery ports to the load port, thus leading to high efficiency. The current of all three ports is continuous; hence, the electromagnetic noise can be reduced. Furthermore, the control and modulation method for B3C has been proposed for realizing maximum power point tracking (MPPT), battery management, and bus voltage regulation simultaneously. The operation can be transited between conductance mode and MPPT mode automatically according to the load power. Finally, experimental verifications are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology and control method.

The objective of this work is to discuss the modeling of auctions of long-term electricity supply contracts for new capacity in Brazil. The modeling of risks such as price-quantity (hydrological) risk, project completion risk, environmental constraints, climate change and regulatory risks are discussed. An analytical model will be developed to price these risks and case studies will be presented for real projects that have participated in the Brazilian contract auctions for new capacity. We also discuss selection of projects with different risks.

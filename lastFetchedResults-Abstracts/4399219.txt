Advance infrastructures have changed the passive consumers into active because now they can share information, perform automatic control as well as directly influence the electricity market via demand response (DR) programs. Till today, many DR Programs are proposed in Smart Grid (SG) paradigm and are facing enormous challenges. This paper concerns the DR scheduling problem of the dispatchable loads at the end consumer premises. In DR Programs, the electricity prices vary over time and users receive the reward payment by the energy service providers, if the users modify the consumption during DR events. Thus, the paper devises the independent atomic dispatchable model which could be used for investigation of different kinds of DR Programs. The another objective of the paper is to formulate the generic scheduling problem i.e. how to schedule the operation of the dispatchable loads, taking in account the overall energy cost, the comfort level and the timeliness. Paper also performs the simulations for two different DR Programs namely Time-Of-Use (TOU) and Energy Bidding (EB), and results show that the scheduling problem is suitably formulated for real-life instances and is applicable to other types of loads.

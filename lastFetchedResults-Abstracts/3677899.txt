An inference network is proposed as a tool for bidirectional approximate reasoning. The inference network can be designed directly from the given fuzzy data (knowledge). If a fuzzy input is given for the inference network, then the network renders a reasonable fuzzy output after performing approximate reasoning based on an equality measure. Conversely, due to the bidirectional structure, the network can yield its corresponding reasonable fuzzy input for a given fuzzy output. This property makes it possible to perform forward and backward reasoning in the knowledge base system

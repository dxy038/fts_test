Background Psychological distress and well-being
underlie the continuum of susceptibility to common mental
disorders. Our objective was to provide a simple and
acceptable measure of psychological distress and wellbeing
to collect information from subjects and informants
in non-clinical samples, to explore its internal structure,
concurrent and external validity.
Method Self and partner versions of the ten-item Everyday
Feeling Questionnaire (EFQ) were administered to
5,279 adults. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ) was used to establish concurrent validity. Socioeconomic
status, child psychopathology, and family functioning
served as external validators.
Results The EFQ was internally consistent with all items
loading strongly on a single common factor. Item response
analysis showed excellent sensitivity of the ten items,
balanced contribution of well-being and distress items and
good information content across a broad range. The internal
structure of partner version did not differ from selfreport.
The constructs measured by the EFQ and GHQ
were distinct, but highly correlated. The EFQ’s correlations
with external validators were stronger than GHQ’s ones.
Conclusion Psychological well-being and distress are
measurable as a single construct, using the EFQ. The
partner-report version will facilitate the collection of data
on multiple household members or on the same individual
from two or more sources

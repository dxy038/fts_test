The objective of the paper is to develop a strategy for the navigation of mobile robots in uncertain indoor environment. A modified ART-2 network is put forward to identify the surrounding environment correctly for mobile robot which considers not only the similarity of direction but also magnitude of input vectors in environment sorting. Then a fuzzy controller for mobile robotÂ´s navigation in an unknown environment is designed based on the correct environment classification information provided by ART-2 network. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and real-time ability of the proposed approach, we report a number of simulation results of navigation in an unknown environment.

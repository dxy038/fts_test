Introduction & Objective: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant that is widely used by anesthesiologists especially at induction time to facilitate intubations. Fasciculation is common after intravenous injection of succinylcholine and preceeding relaxation may cause myalgia, rhabdomyolysis and increase in blood level of myoglobulin. On the other hand, narcotics are the main components of induction protocols and alfentanil as a short acting narcotic is widely used. Decreasing fasciculation can be achieved probably by use of alfentanil. Alfentanil and sufentanil were used in our study to evaluate this proposal. Materials & Methods: Patients were selected randomly (female aged 20-50, ASA I). Induction of anesthesia was done by thiopental Na (4mg/kg) and relaxation for intubation reached by succinylcholine (1 mg/kg). Premedication was as follows: in the 1St group alfentanil (10µg/kg, 2 minutes before succinylcholine injection); in the 2nd group sufentanil (0.1 µg/kg, 4 minutes before succinylcholine injection) and in the 3rd group (control group) normal saline (0.5-2 ml, 2 minutes before succinylcholine injection). Results: The zero score was 64%, 12% and 8% in groups I to 3 respectively while the three scores were 15%, 50% and 57% in groups 1 to 3 respectively. Conclusion: Statistical analysis revealed that alfentanil induced more fasciculation suppression than sufentanil (p<0.0001).

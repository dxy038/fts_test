This paper proposes a distributed scheduling algorithm of demands of multiple households/consumers in order to achieve a power balancing in total. Assume that an autonomous energy management system is installed in each household and that those households are capable of communicating with an aggregator. Then, it becomes possible to negotiate via the autonomous energy management systems to find an agreement point that takes both the users´ demands and the aggregator´s objective into account. The key aspect of the algorithm is that it enables us to encapsulate the particular control and objective in each household, and realizes the negotiation based on power profiles. We also show the proposed framework can be smoothly integrated with a probabilistic generative model of power profiles.

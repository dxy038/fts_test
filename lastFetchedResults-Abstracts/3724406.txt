The paper describes a procedure to optimize the configuration of magnetically levitated high-speed transport systems of the electrodynamic type. The procedure is based on the definition of a suitable analytical objective function, with given rated values of speed, levitation and propulsion forces. The function takes into account the system efficiency, as well as the material saving, and fulfils design constraints such as coil size ranges, upper and lower boundaries of electromagnetic and mechanical quantities. An example application is given, starting from a reference configuration and applying a multivariable search technique

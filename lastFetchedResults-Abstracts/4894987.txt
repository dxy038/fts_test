Distributed Generation (DG) sources are becoming more prominent in distribution systems due to increased demand for the electrical energy. The locations and capacities of DG sources will have an impact on system losses of distribution network. In this paper, a novel hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) / Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for solving the problem of optimal location and sizing of DG on distributed systems is presented. The objective is to minimize network power loss and better voltage regulation with in frame-work of system operational and security constraints in the radial distribution systems. A detailed performance analysis is carried out on 33 bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

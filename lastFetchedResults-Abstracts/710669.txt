Objective
Congenital agenesis of the uterine cervix and vagina is one of the rarest congenital defects. The objective of this manuscript is to present our experience and effects of a surgical treatment in five girls with inborn agenesis of the uterine cervix and vagina, who were operated in our clinic.
Method
The vagina is reconstructed in four stages: (1) formation of vaginal recess; (2) phantomization of vagina; (3) joining of the reconstructed vagina with the uterus; (4) revision and correction of the junction. GnRH analogs were administered to avoid menstrual blood flow into the peritoneal cavity during phantomization.
Results
Patency of the uterovaginal junction was maintained with a #6 intubation tube. Normal menstruation was restored in all patients. Atresion of the canal at the uterovaginal junction was disclosed after 3â€“8 months in three of the patients. Patency was restored with surgical hysteroscope and the canal was mechanically distended. Clinical and ultrasonographic followup in the patients will continue.

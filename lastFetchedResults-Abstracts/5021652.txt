Due to rapid development of robotic technology, service robots for daily life will be a picture at a modern home in near future; therefore, how to make robotic devices more autonomous and secure, i.e., working restrictedly under commands becomes an urgent need. Humanoid robots exiting in a digital home for daily chores or entertainment is a good way of promoting robots. The objective of this work aims at applying a modularized platform to embody intelligence capability for robotic puppets.

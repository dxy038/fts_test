In an effort to develop a simulation framework for evaluating the performance of wireless access technologies for vehicular networks, the authors have studied the internal structure of the simulator, NS-2, as well as the draft wireless technology IEEE 802.11p. This intended framework aims at replicating, as far as possible, the access technology characteristics in the simulator and with the help of realistic scenarios intends to give an objective view of the performance of applications destined for intelligent transport systems. The framework is first designed to meet the requirements set for vehicle to infrastructure communications, with a view of later extending it to vehicle to vehicle communications for vehicular ad hoc networks.

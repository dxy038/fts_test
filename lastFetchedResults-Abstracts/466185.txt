Objective: Pregnancy complicated by diabetes is associated with maternal complications and fetal abnormalities. Animal models of diabetes suggest that heightened free radical production may be implicated in the pathogenesis of this condition. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate oxidative stress in plasma from diabetic rats and their fetuses through measurement of concentrations of 8-isoprostaglandin F2α, a stable marker of lipid peroxidation. Study Design: Diabetes was induced in virgin and pregnant rats with streptozotocin. Blood samples were collected after 20 days of diabetes. Adult and fetal plasma 8-isoprostaglandin F2α concentrations were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy. Results: Significantly higher plasma 8-isoprostaglandin F2α concentrations were observed in the virgin rats with diabetes and in both the pregnant dams with diabetes and their fetuses when compared with their respective control groups without diabetes (P< .001). Conclusion: Oxidative stress was induced in both mother and fetus in rodent pregnancy complicated by diabetes. This finding may have implications for fetal dysmorphogenesis and in fetal programming for adulthood disease. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1035-40.)

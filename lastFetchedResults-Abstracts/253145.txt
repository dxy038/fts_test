Xanthomonas campestris pv. pelargonii (Xcp) and
Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) are the two most important
bacterial pathogens of commercially cultivated gerani-
ums (Pelargonium spp.), both causing bacterial wilt and
leaf spot. Asymptomatic infections are important reser-
voirs of infections in commercial growing facilities. Our
objective was to design a multiplex PCR (Polymerase
Chain Reaction) assay to detect infection by either or
both of these pathogens. We used a previously charac-
terized PCR primer pair for Xcp that ampli®es a region
of 200 bp. In addition, we designed a new primer pair
speci®c for Rs that ampli®es a region of 822 bp. With
these two primer pairs, we could detect either or both
pathogens. As geranium tissue extracts frequently con-
tain inhibitors of the PCR process, a negative PCR
could result from either an accurate indication that the
plant was pathogen-free or from a false negative assay.
We therefore designed `ampli®cation competence' pri-
mers, targeting a portion of the geranium 18 s rRNA
gene, and generating a 494-bp ampli®cation product
that con®rms ampli®cation competence and validates a
negative assay result. Thus, the triple primer pair
multiplex PCR screens for the two most important
bacterial pathogens of geraniums simultaneously con-
®rms ampli®cation competence for each geranium
sample.

[Methods] 126 Kunming mice were divided randomly into DDP group, DDP + PDTC group and control group according to body weight. Single dose of DDP (12 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally, and 50 mg/kg PDTC was used subcutaneously once a day for 3 days, and the same volume of natural saline was given as control. Body weight of 10 mice in each group was measured and survival time was observed subsequently. Blood samples were obtained from the orbital venous sinus of 10 mice in control mice and DDP and PDTC groups at 6, 24, 48, 72 h after DDP administration. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cre) were measured. [Results] Compared with control mice, body weight of mice decreased, and serum BUN and Cre elevated significantly 48h after 12 mg/kg DDP administration. 66 % of mice died in 3 d after DDP injection (P&lt;;0.01). Compared with mice treated with DDP, 50 mg/kg PDTC could alleviate the degree of body weight loss, prevent the elevation of serum BUN and CRE level, and increase the survival rate of mice after DDP administration. There are significant differences between DDP group and PDTC group (P&lt;;0.01). [Conclusions] PDTC could significantly improve the side effects of 12 mg/kg DDP on mice, and prevent the mice from DDP-induced acute renal failure effectively.

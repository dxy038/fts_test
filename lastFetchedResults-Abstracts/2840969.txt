With the increasing number of unpredictable accidents and power shortages on utility systems, the need to improve the reliability and security of electric power networks is imminent. Energy management systems that use traditional computer-aided tools to monitor and control generation and transmission systems using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) actually have low sampling and update rates. In recent years, wide area monitoring system (WAMS) can possibly meet these challenges based on the state-of-the-art data retrieval technology. WAMS makes it possible to monitor power utility networks in a real-time dynamic manner using phasor measurement units. These sensor devices can provide synchronized measurements using global positioning satellite systems (GPS). In this paper, we study the power management problem under different scenarios. We present several multi-objective optimization models which can provide a deeper insight into operations on smart grid. We also consider contingency constraints and optimal allocation of these sensor devices on utility systems.

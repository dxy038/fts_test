Objective
Diagnosis of abnormal fontanel size, a potential clue to recognition of different
disorders, requires an understanding of the wide variation of normal fontanel
size. The anterior fontanel is the largest, prominent and most important for
clinical evaluation. The aim of this study was to establish and define normal
range of fontanel size from birth to 24 months of age in healthy Iranian children
that might be generalized to other populations.
Materials & Methods
Totally, 550 subjects enrolled randomly in this cross sectional study. They were
apparently normal healthy children, from birth to 24 months of age, including
208-term newborn and 342 infant from birth to 2 yr old. Fontanel size was
measured and recorded as the mean of the length (anterior- posterior dimension)
and width (transverse dimension). Mean anterior fontanel sizes in our samples
were classified for periods of 3 months. Nomograms and statistical analyses
were performed and depicted by Excel Microsoft Office 2007 and two-tailed
t-test respectively.
Results
The mean ±2SD of anterior fontanel size was 2.55±1.92 cm in newborns,
3.37±2.48 (largest size) in 3 months of age. It was closed in all cases in 15-18
months of age. The mean posterior fontanel size was 0.8 cm in newborns and
closed in all infants in 2 months of age. There was no significant difference in
anterior fontanel size between two genders except in newborn and 6-9 months
old (P > 0.05).
Conclusion
Abnormal fontanel can indicate a serious medical condition. Therefore, it is
important to understand normal variations, to utilize standardized techniques for
measurement and appropriate standards of normal range in different age groups
and populations. This study provides a normal range of mean fontanel size in
Iranian infants as a local reference. It might be generalized to other populations.

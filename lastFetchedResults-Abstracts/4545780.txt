This paper presents the performance analysis and comparison of two different types of bidirectional DC-DC converters - Cascaded Buck-Boost (CBB) and Combined Half-Bridge (CHB) for use in Plug-in EV and HEV. The comparison of the two converters is based on device requirements, rating of switches and elements, control strategy and performance. Each of the converter topologies has some advantages over the other in certain aspects. Feasibility studies are carried for practical applications in specific scenarios. The simulation and experimental results are provided for both converter types to support the theoretical findings.

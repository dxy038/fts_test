We clarify the transmission performance of our proposed multichannel wireless local area network (WLAN) system based on radio-over-fiber techniques. We developed a practical and effective method for the analysis of multichannel performances from the measurement of single-channel performances by incorporating the spectral distribution of a modulation signal into a calculation of the composite triple beats. Furthermore, using our developed method, we can clarify the maximum capacity of the multichannel WLAN system and its system parameters with a focus on the performance of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation channel. For example, the cell diameter for realizing the bidirectional transmission of seven-channel WLAN signals becomes 10 m.

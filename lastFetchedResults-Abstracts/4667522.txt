In this paper, an optimum efficiency control scheme of synchronous reluctance motors is presented. There exists a variety of combinations of d and q-axis current which provide a specific motor torque. The objective of the optimum efficiency controller is to seek a combination of d and q-axis current components, which provides minimum input power, that is, minimum losses at a certain operating point in steady state. A small amount of perturbation is added to the d-axis current reference for the purpose of searching a minimum input power operating point

With the Neolithic, of new ways of life based on agriculture and the breeding diffuse themselves in all the Mediterranean basin. Corsica knows it also the emergence of these new ways of life as well as the tools related to the appearance of agriculture as the polished axe and the adze. These polished objects are found on the whole of the island; the studies undertaken on the site of Carcu-Modria can let to us suppose that the axes found on the site could have had many uses and in particular the demolition or splitting for construction of habitat or enclosure. The data geological, palynologic and experimental, help us with better apprehending the life of the men of the Neolithic.

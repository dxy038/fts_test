As one kind of new technology, wireless sensor network has a wide application area such as military, environment monitoring, object tracking, science observing and forecasting. Resource optimization is the important problem in the development of the wireless sensor networks. Through the deep analysis of existing resources optimization algorithm, the paper used method to mesh the continuous wireless sensor networks. By the definition of the probability function as the optimization objective function, establishing the regional-coverage and cross-coverage model, the paper introduced the genetic algorithm to choose the set of optimal overlay nodes.

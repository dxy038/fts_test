Enteryx (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer) was developed as a bulking agent to be injected endoscopically at the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) to increase the competency of the gastro-oesophageal barrier in patients suffering from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Preliminary clinical studies have shown that Enteryx implantation is a fast, minimally invasive and safe procedure. In prospective multicentre studies, significant improvement in reflux symptoms, reduction in the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and objective improvement in acid oesophageal exposure time were observed after 6 months of follow-up. Improvement of GORD symptoms seems to be correlated with the persistence of the implant. Preliminary data suggest a lengthening and an increase in the LOS relaxation pressure as mechanisms of action of this injection technique. Longer follow-up and controlled sham studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this technique before it can be proposed as a routine alternative to medical or surgical therapies for GORD.

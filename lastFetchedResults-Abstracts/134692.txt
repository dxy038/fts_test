It is well-known that dryland wheat cultivation has an important role in supplying Iran's nutrient requirements. Recent investigations make it obvious that about 15 percent of the total wheat produced in Ardebil is cultivated in dryland regions. Obviously, the cultivation and production of this strategic crop is based on annual rainfall and the distribution of montly rainfall during the growth season.
Therefore, the primary objective of the current research was to determine all suitable areas in the region enjoyed the highest annual precipitation rates. The subsequent aim was to find appropriate time for the cultivation with reference to the monthly precipitation variations. For this reason, the rainfall data was collected from 15 weather stations from 1975 to 2000 (26 years). Having benefited from the Hottling and T-observational statistical methods, all accessible data were compared with the required climate norms. Then, the spatial distributions of statistical findings were correspondingly mapped using The Geographic Information System.
The final results revealed that some areas situated in the northern part of the study area; such as Gara-Aghg, Sarein and Boran stations were the best places for dryland wheat cultivation. In addition, it was determined that september and October were the most appropriate months respectively for the cultivation of dryland wheat in Ardebil province.

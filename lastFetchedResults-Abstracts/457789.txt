Objective
In addition to lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, statins modestly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in humans and decrease cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mass and activity. Our aim was to determine whether the increase in HDL depends on CETP expression.
Methods and results
APOE*3-Leiden (E3L) mice, with a human-like lipoprotein profile and a human-like responsiveness to statin treatment, were crossbred with mice expressing human CETP under control of its natural flanking regions resulting in E3L.CETP mice. E3L and E3L.CETP mice were fed a Western-type diet with or without atorvastatin. Atorvastatin (0.01% in the diet) reduced plasma cholesterol in both E3L and E3L.CETP mice (−26 and −33%, P < 0.05), mainly in VLDL, but increased HDL-cholesterol only in E3L.CETP mice (+52%). Hepatic mRNA expression levels of genes involved in HDL metabolism, such as phospholipid transfer protein (Pltp), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1), scavenger receptor class B type I (Sr-b1), and apolipoprotein AI (Apoa1), were not differently affected by atorvastatin in E3L.CETP mice as compared to E3L mice. However, in E3L.CETP mice, atorvastatin down-regulated the hepatic CETP mRNA expression (−57%; P < 0.01) as well as the total CETP level (−29%) and cholesteryl esters (CE) transfer activity (−36%; P < 0.05) in plasma.
Conclusions
Atorvastatin increases HDL-cholesterol in E3L.CETP mice by reducing the CETP-dependent transfer of cholesterol from HDL to (V)LDL, as related to lower hepatic CETP expression and a reduced plasma (V)LDL pool.

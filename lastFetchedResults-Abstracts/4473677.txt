Despite standardization efforts the seamless exchange of business documents often poses a problem, due to a large number of different formats. Also, there may be several standards initiatives in the same business domain, all equally important. Consequently, transformation between various document formats on the instance layer becomes necessary. To ease the implementation of transformers we propose an XSLT-based generation framework that allows for bidirectional transformations. Furthermore, we rely on Core Components as an intermediary format. As a proof of concept we developed a prototype based on the open source tool named VIENNA Add-In.

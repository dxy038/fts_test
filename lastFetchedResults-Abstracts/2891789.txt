The concerns of sustainability and climate change have posed a significant growth of renewable energy associated with smart grid technologies. Various uncertainties are the major problems need to be handled by transmission system operator (TSO) planning. This paper mainly focuses on three uncertain factors, i.e. load growth, generation capacity and line faults, and aims to enhance the transmission system via the multi-objective TSO planning (MOTP) approach. The proposed MOTP approach optimizes three objectives simultaneously, namely the probabilistic available transfer capability (PATC), investment cost and power outage cost. A two-phase MOPSO algorithm is employed to solve this optimization problem, which can accelerate the convergence and guarantee the diversity of Pareto-optimal front set as well. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective planning approach has been verified by the 77-bus system.

This paper presents how the genetic algorithm (GA) can be applied to design of cascade stilling basins. Genetic Algorithm is adaptive method, which can be used to solve search and optimization problems over a period of generations, based upon the principles of natural selection and survival of the fittest ones. The objective of this research is to minimize total cost of construction effectively which is a function of height of falls and length of stilling basins, while fulfilling the hydraulic and topographical criteria. The efficiency of GA discussed here has been tested for a benchmark example and the result for this algorithm is compared with the other method introduced by Vittal and Porey. The results clearly reveal superiority of the GA algorithm

The objective in this study was to investigate the effect of metabolisable energy (ME) and crude protein on fattening performance (growth) of growing young male camels. The design was a factorial 3*3 including three levels of metabolisable energy 2.56, 2.19 and 1.85 Meallkg dry matter and three levels of crude protein namely 14.4, 12.6 and 10.8 percent (9 treatment diets). Thirty-six male camels of 1-2 years age and 182+7.7 kg weight were chosen from Sabzewar region and fed for 80 days during the fattening program while kept in Sabzewar Research Station. Generally, the energy and protein levels significantly increased the daily gain as well as feed efficiency (P<0.05), except for the diet containing the lowest levels of energy and protein for which daily gain and feed efficiency were not significant (P>0.05). In general, results indicated that diet 2 containing 2.56 Meal ME/kg dry matter and 12.6% crude protein was the most suitable for native camels 1-2 years old. The average daily gain, feed efficiency, dressing percentage, lean meat with fat and bone percent for that diet were 688 gram, 0.184, 54.3%, 77.24% and 22.8% respectively.

The present study focuses mainly on the effect of solar heat gain on the energy demand of courtyard building form with different proportions. Several methods can be employed to improve the building's utilization of solar heat gain. This includes using light colours for the external surfaces to reduce the solar radiation absorption in summer, using shading devices and improving the thermal properties of the external walls and roof. However, it is of great importance before using any of these methods to have the courtyard building's architectural design adapted to have full advantage of the available solar heat gain. Therefore, the main objective of the present examination was to find out to what extent the building's solar heat gain and consequently the energy requirements are influenced by the building's configurations. A computer Tool (IES) was used to carry out the investigation taking Rome as an empirical background to temperate climate. The results showed that the proportions of the courtyard building considerably influence the need for heating and cooling.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of correlation on the fatigue reliability of a riveted lap joint with multiple rivets using a fast reliability assessment approach based on the detail fatigue rating method. The detail fatigue rating method, DFR method, is based on the nominal stress fatigue approach. The DFR represents the inherent characteristic of fatigue capacity of a structure independent from the applied fatigue load. The fatigue reliability assessment model of a structure is proposed based on the relations of fatigue loading, characteristic fatigue life and DFR. The upper and lower bounds of fatigue reliability of a riveted lap joint structure with multiple rivets subjected to fatigue loading is analysed using the DFR and Ditlevsen approaches accounting for the correlations between rivet holes failures.

The prime objective of this Research is the development of effective reading skills in Machines. After reading the text and comprehending the meaning, it would self-program itself and according to the program it would implement the instructions. Here we are exploring a new era of computer vision and related Research. The current investigation presents an algorithm and software which detects, recognizes text and character with specific protocol in a live streaming video and programs itself according to the text. The protocol used for text consists of a Start word and an end word with embedded c instructions between them in special font. The proposed algorithm first detects the frame having text from live video streaming. The character is at its best view which means no broken point in a single character and no merge between groups of characters. The image processor tallies the images and burns the main microcontroller accordingly. This technology can prove to be immensely important to various human activities in day to day life.

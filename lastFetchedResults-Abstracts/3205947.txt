Wireless networks of sensor nodes are envisioned to be deployed in the physical environment to monitor a wide variety of real-world phenomena. Wireless sensor networksare becoming popular in military and civilian applications such as surveillance, monitoring, disaster recovery, home automation and many others. These networks demand low power and low cost transceiver design. The power consumed by node transceiver electronics is non-negligible and has a major impact on battery life. The main objective of this paper is to design a low power transceiver for indoor wireless applications. This transceiver operates at 2.4GHzwith data rates up to 1.0Mbit/s with QPSK modulation. The required transmitter power is -5.0 dBm. The design exhibits a noise figure of 4.2 dB at transmitter side and 4.225 dB at receiver side.The error vector magnitude (EVM) is 9.7% and receiver sensitivity is -95dBm for bit error rate of 10<sup>-3</sup>. Agilent Advanced Design System (ADS) is used for design and performance evaluation of our system.

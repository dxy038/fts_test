Today, husbands’ violence against wives is a pervasive problem which knows no cultural, social, and economic boundaries. The main objective of the present study has been to identify and to analyze the influential social factors on husbands’ violence against their wives. The method of the study was survey and data collected through self-administrated questionnaire which its reliability was (?= 0.91) and its validity was confirmed by construct and content validity.
The study population includes all married women at age of 15-45 living in Tehran (region four). Totally, 400 women were selected on the basis of multistage cluster sampling. Theoretical frameworks were Patriarchal theory, social learning and resource theories. Independent variables which explain the dependent variables (husbands’ violence) have been social support resources, gender ideology, tolerance toward violence, wife power in the family structure, relative socioeconomic status and violence in the family of origin.
The results of regression analysis showed that among six independent variables, wife power in family structure with regression effect coefficient (B= -0.43) was the most important variable for explaining the husband’s violence against wives. Also such variables as violence in the family of origin, tolerance toward violence, social support resources, gender ideology and relative socio-economic status were other predictor variables, respectively.

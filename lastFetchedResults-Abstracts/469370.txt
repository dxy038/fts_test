Objective
The purpose of this study was to formulate growth references that reflect triplet fetal and neonatal populations at each gestational age by combining serial ultrasonographic estimates of fetal weights and measured birth weights.
Study design
This historical cohort study was based on 188 pregnancies of live-born triplets of â‰¥23 weeks' gestation. Ultrasonographic fetal weight measures were modeled as a function of gestational age for each infant. Linear regression models were used to fit the data, and weight percentiles were generated.
Results
Well-grown triplets fell substantially below singletons by 30 weeks and twins after 34 weeks. Trichorionic vs monochorionic or dichorionic placentation resulted in 27% higher growth at the 10th %ile, 5% higher growth at the 50th %ile, and 4% higher growth at the 90th %ile by 34 weeks.
Conclusion
The overall pattern of fetal growth for well-grown triplets does not differ from that of singletons and twins until late gestation, confirming that, in utero, well-grown children have similar growth potentials, regardless of plurality.

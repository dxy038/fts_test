The main objective of this paper is to develop an autonomous navigation system for robot arms so that they can operate in complex environments, such as kitchen, factory, etc. In order to solve the problem of planning in the dynamic environments, we proposed a CT-RRTs (bi-direction RRTs in configuration time space) planner, which can make the robot arm reach goal successfully in the partially known dynamic environment while remains the greedy heuristics of the RRT-Connect. It is planned in the augmented state-time space of the robot arm configuration and the positions of the moving objects. Various techniques are used to accelerate planning and enhance its safety. We used the new planner to develop the dual-arm planner, and it can be used as the basis to solve higher level problems in motion planning. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively resolve the dual-arm motion planning problem.

The objective of the paper is to carry out an analysis of tools used for performing external security audits. All the tools with the capacity to remotely detect vulnerabilities which are currently available in the market were used to carry out this analysis. Although these tools are sometimes used to carry out internal audits of operating systems, this paper is exclusively centred on the capacity that these tools have for detecting security holes in remote machines. To produce this paper we have used a testbed composed of two UNIX machines running Solaris 2.5, and a PC with Windows NT 4.0. Whenever versions of the tools permitted it, attacks were carried out from Windows NT against Solaris and vice versa

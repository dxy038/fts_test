This paper presents an application of artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for multi-objective optimization problem in power system. Considering the environmental impacts that grow from the emissions produced by fossil-fuelled power plant, the economic dispatch that minimizes only the total fuel cost can no longer be considered as single objective. Artificial bee colony algorithm strategy based on mathematical modeling to solve economic, emission and combined economic and emissions dispatch problems by a single equivalent objective function. Artificial bee colony algorithm has been applied to two realistic systems at different load condition. Results obtained with proposed method are compared with other techniques presented in literature. ABC algorithm is easy to implement and capable of searching near global optimum solution at fast convergence and efficiency.

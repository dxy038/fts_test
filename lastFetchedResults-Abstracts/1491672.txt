The paper is devoted to cold-formed thin-walled channel beams with double-box flanges. Geometric properties of the C-section are described in terms of dimensionless parameters. The warping function and the warping inertia moment are analytically determined. The optimization criterion and the dimensionless objective functions are defined as a quality measure. The space of feasible solutions is constrained by the strength, global, local buckling, and geometric conditions. Analytical solutions of the problems of global and local buckling for thin-walled beams are presented. Results of the numerical calculations of the optimal shaping problem are presented in tables and figures.

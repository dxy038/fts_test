Objective
cents infrequently present for preventive health visits. The 3-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine may result in increased health care visits and thus indirectly improve health services for teens. We examined whether other health services were delivered in conjunction with the second (HPV2) or third (HPV3) dose of the HPV vaccine.
s
ducted a chart review for girls 9 to 20 years of age (n = 571) who received HPV2 or HPV3 within 4 months of its due date at any of 9 clinical sites. Analyses were limited to the 422 visits (72%) where HPV vaccine was specified as a reason for the visit. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate the impact of site of care on delivery of other health services.
s
 half (43%) of adolescents received another medical or preventive health service at the time of HPV2 or HPV3 vaccine administration. Most common services were 1 or more other vaccines (30%) or medical services (35%). Older teens were more likely than younger teens to receive reproductive health services and sexually transmitted infection screening. After controlling for age and adjusting for clustering within sites, receiving care at an academic health center versus a private practice was strongly associated with increased odds of receiving other medical or preventive health services at follow-up (odds ratio 2.07; 95% confidence interval 1.44â€“2.97).
sions
cents, especially those receiving care at an academic health center, often received other health services at the time of HPV2 or HPV3 vaccination. Because visits occurred within 6 to 8 months of the prior vaccine dose, our findings suggest vaccine visits may lead to improved delivery of adolescent health services.

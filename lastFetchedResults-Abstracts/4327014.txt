The application of the modified MTGS method offers a practical alternative to elementary statistical calculation for generating objective quantitative metric to measure the similarity between two data sets. Since the MTGS method can capture many degrees of variation between two data sets and discriminate between data sets which have dissimilar average magnitudes, correlation coefficients and uniformity, its application is much more efficient than elementary statistical analysis that evaluates each metric individually. The feasibility of modified MTGS method for similarity analysis, which used the difference in MD values calculated with MTGS method for the antenna radiation pattern similarity comparison, was successfully demonstrated through three test cases.

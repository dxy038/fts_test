The objective of this article is to highlight design challenges for low-power and dual-video standard requirements, especially in mobile applications. Due to the advent of the newly announced H.264, a generic problem of standard incompatibility has appeared between H.264 and prevalent MPEG-x video standards, which must be resolved on both algorithmic and architectural levels. Furthermore, several low-power techniques targeted at achieving lower memory requirements and processing cycles are also described and discussed

<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Over 165 million cases of shigellosis occur in the world each year, mostly in developing countries. Outbreaks of shigellosis are associated with poor sanitation, natural calamities, contaminated food and crowded living conditions. In late summer 2006, during the final stage of an outbreak of shigellosis at a vast region of Isfahan province, Naein &amp; Ardestan, our laboratory was assigned to investigate the outbreak in order to determine the causative agent.<br />Â <strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>A total of 146 rectal swabs which had been collected from the patients by local laboratories on separate days were screened using a battery of conventional and molecular tests.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Thirteen specimens tested positive for <em>Shigella </em>spp. They were identified as <em>S. sonnei </em>(6, 46.1%), <em>S. dysenteriae </em>(4,30.8%), <em>S. flexneri </em>(2, 15.4%) and <em>Shigella </em>spp (1, 7.7%) by conventional and molecular microbiological tests. According to ribotyping results the isolates were grouped into 3 distinct clusters encompassing the majority of isolates and a single line of descent representing isolate S122 which was nonreactive with any <em>Shigella </em>polyvalent antisera.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This diarrheal outbreak appeared to be the result of shigellosis. Despite the fact that <em>Shigella sonnei </em>was the predominant organism isolated from patients, the causative agent of outbreak diarrhea remains obscure, since other <em>Shigella </em>species were also involved. The serologic testing supports this conclusion, as do the molecular patterns of the <em>Shigella </em>isolates. Having considered the time of investigation which was in the late stage of the outbreak, it was very likely that a collection of endemic and epidemic clinical samples was screened resulting in isolation of various <em>Shigella </em>species.</p>

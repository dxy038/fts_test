In recent years mechanical activation technique has been utilized to synthesize the nanocrystalline form of compounds resulting in enhancement in the properties. Also, microwave sintering is being preferred over conventional sintering due to rapid processing and uniform temperature distribution throughout the specimen. In the present work, nanocrystalline non-stoichiometric strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) of the composition Sr0.8Bi2.2Ta2O9 ferroelectric ceramics were synthesized by microwave sintering process (with sintering temperatures of 1000 °C and 1100 °C) and conventional solid state reaction process (with sintering temperature of 1100 °C) with an objective of comparing the properties of the synthesized specimens by the two processes. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the formation of single phase layered perovskite structure formation by both the processes. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the formation of a finer granular microstructure in the specimen synthesized by microwave sintering compared to that in the specimen prepared by conventional sintering. The specimen prepared by microwave sintering process exhibits improved electrical properties with higher dielectric constant, higher piezoelectric and pyroelectric coefficients and lower dielectric loss.

Imaging of dielectric and conducting objects which are located in a known medium, based on null space reconstruction is presented. For this, we use the proper numerical methods, corresponding to the known background mediums, to formulate the direct scattering problems. Then, we modify the subspace optimization method (SOM) by using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for solving inverse scattering problems. Also the effect of null space on the imaging results is determined by defining the radiating objective function.

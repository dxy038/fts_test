This article surveys wireless Internet technologies whose goals are to enhance networking performance. These technologies are organized into seven categories: power saving, mobile performance, Multimedia Quality-of-Service, application performance, transport-layer characteristics, data-link layer, and non-TCP options. For each category, the main technical characteristics are outlined, the architectural aspects are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. The objective of this article is to contribute to the overall understanding of the technologies available for constructing the forthcoming wireless Internet infrastructure.

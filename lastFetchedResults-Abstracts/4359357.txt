When inspection equipment based on visual recognition is integrated into production sites, the recognition logic is custom designed to satisfy the specific inspection specification, normally requiring constant attention and recognition program modifications by specialty engineers. In order to improve the situation, the paper proposes &#8220;programless (programming-free) visual recognition technology&#8221;, a core technology used in inspection equipment that can autonomously improve the recognition algorithm by feeding human know-how back into the system. As a step to realizing the objective, the matching kernel adjustment agent, inspection logic database and macro commands are described

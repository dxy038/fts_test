The purpose of the present work is to correct some inaccuracies of the paper “Bonori, G., Barbieri, M., Pellicano, F., 2008, Optimum Profile Modifications of Spur Gears by Means of Genetic Algorithms, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 313, pp. 603–616”; in that work, the aim was the reduction of vibrations in spur gears by means of profile modifications. This goal was achieved by using an ad hoc genetic algorithm, where the objective function was the peak to peak or the harmonic content of the Static Transmission Error (STE) computed by Finite Element calculations.

ficiency in terms of vibration reduction of the optimized profile reliefs was checked using a one degree of freedom dynamic model. This dynamic model considers time varying mesh stiffness, backlash, and profile error. In the original paper the effect of intentional profile modifications was considered as part of the mesh stiffness, thus overestimating their effect in vibration reduction.

 present corrigendum, the dynamic model is updated, keeping into account profile deviations by means of an error function. Finally, the optimal profile modifications found in the original paper are checked using the updated model.

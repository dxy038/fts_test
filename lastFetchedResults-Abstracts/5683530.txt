Cloud and clear-sky detection is a crucial part in the analyses of AIRS (Atmospheric InfraRed Sensor) measurements. Currently cloud detection is done using spectral tests, which are based on well understood properties of the atmosphere. This paper gives an account of an investigation in using binary classification and feature extraction techniques to develop an AIRS cloud mask, where CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR with Orthogonal Polarization) observations were used as &#8220;oracle&#8221; data. The objective was to produce an AIRS cloud mask which is either on par or better than the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) cloud mask.

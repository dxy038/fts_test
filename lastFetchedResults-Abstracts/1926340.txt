The objective of this study was to determine if oxytocin-induced release of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α; measured by the stable metabolite, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2α (PGFM)) was inhibited following intrauterine infusion of bovine interferon-αI1 (rboIFNαI1) into postpartum cows anticipated to have short estrous cycles following first ovulation postpartum. Cows expected to have short estrous cycles were assigned to receive twice daily intrauterine infusions of either placebo (SCP; n = 11) or 2 mg rboIFNαI1 (SCIFN; n = 14) on Days 1–16 following hCG injection (2500 IU; day 0) on Days 30 or 31 postpartum. On Day 5 following hCG, each cow was injected with 100 IU oxytocin (i.v.) to induce the release of uterine PGF2α (as measured by PGFM). Other treatment groups consisted of cows expected to have normal estrous cycle lengths following pretreatment with a 9 day norgestomet implant on Days 21 or 22 postpartum followed by hCG injection to induce ovulation. Cows expected to have normal estrous cycle lengths received twice daily intrauterine infusions of either placebo from Days 1 to 16 of the cycle and 100 IU oxytocin (i.v.) on Day 5 (NCPE; n = 11) or twice daily infusions of placebo (NCPL; n = 7) or rboIFNαI1 (NCIFN; n = 10), from Day 13 post-hCG injection until luteolysis. Oxytocin was injected (100 IU; i.v.) into cows in the NCPL and NCIFN groups on Day 16. The calculated areas under the curve (arbitrary PGFM units) were: 164 ± 18 units, 96 ± 16 units, 93 ± 18 units, 137 ± 27 units and 53 ± 20 units for SCP, SCIFN, NCPE, NCPL and NCIFN, respectively (SCIFN &lt; SCP; NCIFN &lt; NCPL; P &lt; 0.015). Mean luteal phase length was calculated as the number of days from injection of hCG until progesterone declined to below 0.5 ng ml−1 and was: 6.7 ± 1.0 days, 10.5 ± 0.9 days, 12.0 ± 1.0 days, 18.0 ± 1.3 days and 20.7 ± 1.1 days for SCP, SCIFN, NCPE, NCPL and NCIFN, respectively (SCP &lt; SCIFN = NCPE &lt; NCPL = NCIFN; P &lt; 0.01). In summary, luteal phase lengths were increased and oxytocin-induced release of PGFM was reduced by rboIFNαI1 infusion in cows anticipated to have short luteal phases.

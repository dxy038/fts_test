The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the systems compensated by a proportional fuzzy logic controller (PFLC) are capable of producing responses similar to those obtained from the systems compensated by a classical proportional-plus-derivative (PD) controller. Analysis of the output equation of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) shows that the PFLC output is a linear combination of the inputs over different ranges of operations. This linear combination for each specific range of operation can be designed to provide overshoot and rise time reduction similar to those obtained from the classical proportional-plus-derivative (PD) controller but without the derivative input. Simulations of a control system demonstrate the improved performance of the PFLC over the classical proportional controller

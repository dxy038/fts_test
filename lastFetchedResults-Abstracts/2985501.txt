The attachment and growth of vascular smooth muscle cells on biomaterials used as components of devices implanted in the vascular space may influence the biocompatibility of such materials. The nature of the materials may affect the attachment and/or the activation of these cellsÂ´ procoagulant responses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to measure the strength of adhesion of these vascular cells to potential biomaterials (polydimethylsiloxane, low density polyethylene). The procoagulant response of the cells was evaluated by measuring the tissue factor (TF) activity promoted by cell adhesion on the different materials

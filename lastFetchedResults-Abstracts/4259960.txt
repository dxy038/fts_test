In the article, Authors present the issue of proper choice of grammar by presenting analysis from GPSG (generalised phrase structure grammar) to HPSG (ang. head -driven phrase structure grammar). The objective of the choice is an optimal description of considered tonal harmony with a future possibility of extension, for example for jazz harmony. The proper choice is important primarily for subsequent verification of obtained harmonic sequences and forms a basis for further work in this field.

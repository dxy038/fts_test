Ability of measuring the Host resource is useful in several domains like Cluster and Grid computing. Ganglia monitoring system provides the ability to monitor the resource information of hosts which are present in Grid or Cluster computing environments. The objective of this research paper is to present an architecture study of ganglia monitoring system with focus on embedding new custom metric. Moreover, the paper also presents detailed methodology to build a new custom module. Main steps of custom module development: compilation, insertion, and testing of newly developed custom metric are presented. Moreover, presented steps of custom module development are demonstrated with practical implementation of custom module to collect value of &#8220;Anon Pages&#8221; of the host. The presented work would be very useful to researchers who work in the area of resource monitoring in distributed environment.

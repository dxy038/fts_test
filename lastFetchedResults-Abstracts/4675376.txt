We used Plane Wave Expansion Method and a Rapid Genetic Algorithm to design two-dimensional photonic crystals with a large absolute band gap. A filling fraction controlling operator and Fourier transform data storage mechanism had been integrated into the genetic operators to get desired photonic crystals effectively and efficiently. Starting from randomly generated photonic crystals, the proposed RGA evolved toward the best objectives and yielded a square lattice photonic crystal with the band gap (defined as the gap to mid-gap ratio) as large as 13.25%. Furthermore, the evolutionary objective was modified and resulted in a satisfactory PC for better application to slab system

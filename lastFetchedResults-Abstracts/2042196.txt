Sonochemical removal of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) has been investigated using ultrasonic bath, with an operating capacity of 7 L, fitted with a large transducer with longitudinal vibrations having a 1 kW rated power output and operating frequency of 25 kHz. It has been revealed from calorimetric studies that maximum power is dissipated at a capacity of 7 L. The concentration of DNP has been monitored with an objective of evaluation of the efficacy of ultrasonic reactor in combination with process intensifying approaches for the removal of DNP. The effect of operating pH and additives such as hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron activated persulfate on the extent of removal of DNP has been investigated. It has been observed that the extent of removal is greater at lower pH (pH 2.5 and 4) than at higher pH (pH 10). The combined treatment strategies such as ultrasound (US)/Fenton, US/advanced Fenton and US/CuO/H2O2 have also been investigated with an objective of obtaining complete removal of DNP using hybrid treatment strategies. The extent of removal has been found to increase significantly in US/Fenton process (98.7%) as compared to that using US alone (5.8%) which demonstrates the efficacy of the combined process. First order kinetics has been fitted for all the approaches investigated in the work. Calculations of cavitational yield indicated the superiority of the reactor design as compared to the conventional ultrasonic horn type reactors. The main intermediates formed during the process of removal of DNP have been identified.

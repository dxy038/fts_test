Objective
The aims of this study were: (1) to define and classify those connective structures of the female pelvis that are of potential clinical interest, (2) to evaluate the adequacy of the Terminologia Anatomica (official nomenclature) and (3) to establish a correspondence between the official nomenclature and the most commonly used terms.
Study design
The results of 30 macroscopic and laparoscopic dissections of fresh cadavers with and without vessel injection of colored latex solutions were compared with the descriptions and definitions in the Terminologia Anatomica and the most frequently cited English and non-English literature from 1890 to 2003.
Results
We identified 3 groups of fasciae, parietal pelvic fascia, visceral pelvic fascia, and extraserosal pelvic fascia, which could be divided into diverse clinically relevant anatomical structures characterized by different locations, spatial orientation, and consistency. These structures differed considerably with regard to number and nomenclature from those described in the Terminologia Anatomica and part of the literature.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that the official terminology applied to the connective structures of the female pelvis could be profitably revised and expanded. We offer a complete description of these structures and suggest a classification that may be useful for teaching and clinical purposes.

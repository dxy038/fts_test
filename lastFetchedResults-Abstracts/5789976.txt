Many different numerical methods have been developed to compute trajectories of optimal control problems on the one hand and to approximate Pareto sets of multiobjective optimization problems on the other hand. However, so far only few approaches exist for the numerical treatment of the combination of both problems leading to multiobjective optimal control problems. In this contribution we combine the optimal control method Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control (DMOC) with reference point techniques to compute Pareto optimal control solutions. The presented approach is verified by determining a multiobjective optimal transfer for a space mission. Due to the approximation of the Pareto set, structurally different kind of mission trajectories can be detected which would not have been found by local single-objective optimal control methods and provide important information for a mission designer.

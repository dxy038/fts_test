Objective
The effectiveness of modified radical neck dissection with concomitant chemoradiotherapy in patients with N2/3 advanced head and neck cancer was evaluated.
Study design and setting
Retrospective study of 35 patients treated at the University Hospital, Medical University, Innsbruck. The treatment consisted of a split course radiation up to 70 Gy with concomitant chemotherapy with Mytomicin C and 5-fluorouracil. Neck dissection and/or tumor resection was performed between the two cycles of radiation and chemotherapy.
Results
The 2-year progression-free survival was 64%, locoregional control 92% and overall survival 55. Observed toxicities included mucositis (grade 3, 35%; grade 4, 16%), neutropenia (grade 4, 28%), and thrombocytopenia (grade 4, 26%). No complications related to modified radical neck dissection were observed.
Conclusion
Intermittent neck dissection was highly effective in controlling the neck disease. Mitomycin C-based chemoradiotherapy for treatment of locally advanced cancer seems to be an option to cisplatin-based regimens

The objective of the present work is the investigating of the capabilities of piezoelectric actuators as active vibration control devices for wing structures. The first step of the study is that of providing the basic order two structural equation of the system by an ANSYS FEM structural modelling, as it was proceeded in recent works of the authors. The enhancing of the wing dynamic behavior is then based on the robust LQG/LQG synthesis. It is shown how this procedure can be systematically applied and proven, having as comparison term the robust ideal LQR synthesis. Numerical simulations are presented, thus pointing out the efficacy of the piezo actuators in the developing of smart structures.

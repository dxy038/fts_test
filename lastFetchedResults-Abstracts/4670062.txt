This paper presents an approach to reduce the transmission loss based on the practical system operation of North China Grid (NCG). The main idea is to handle the loss reduction issue using a new and practical angle from both a post-analysis perspective and a security constrained unit dispatch perspective. The objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the losses in the concerned dispatchable area as well as a list of specifically designated branches. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the past performances, and provide guidance for future operations. The proposed method for loss minimization and the related sensitivity calculation have been applied to NCG practical power system. The sample results and the practical analysis as well as future enhancements are also provided in the paper.

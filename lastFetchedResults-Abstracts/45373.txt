The critical excitation method is promising as a robust method for accounting for inherent uncertainties in predicting forthcoming earthquake events and for constructing design earthquake ground motions in a reasonable way. Most of the proposed theories are based on deterministic approaches and deal with displacement responses. A stochastic acceleration response index is treated here as the objective function to be maximized. The power (area of power spectral density function) and the intensity (magnitude of power spectral density function) are fixed and the critical excitation is found under these restrictions. It is shown that the original idea for stationary random inputs can be utilized effectively in the procedure for finding a critical excitation for nonstationary acceleration responses of nonproportionally damped structural systems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the characteristics of generalized time-varying frequency response functions for models with various stiffness and damping distributions.

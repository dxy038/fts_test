In this paper, several new sufficient conditions are given to ensure existence, uniqueness and globally exponential robust stability of the equilibrium point for bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks with delays. This novel approach, based on the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) technique, removes some existing restrictions on the systemâ€™s parameters, and the derived conditions are easy to verify via the LMI toolbox. In addition, two examples are given to show the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed results.

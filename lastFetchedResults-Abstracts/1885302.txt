Renal cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers, and solitary metastasis to bone occurs in 2.5% of these patients. Localization of solitary metastasis to the elbow joint is rarer still, and data about these patients are limited. Because, in these cases, metastasis presents with osteolytic bone destruction, radical removal of solitary lesions should be considered. The aim of this treatment is to control the tumor locally, to reduce pain, and to restore function. We describe 4 patients with a solitary metastasis to the elbow from renal cell carcinoma who had the tumor resected and were then fitted with a custom-made elbow prosthesis. After surgical reconstruction, all patients reported markedly reduced pain and had a good functional outcome. The literature and our experience indicate that the prognosis for patients with just a solitary metastasis is sufficiently encouraging to warrant the use of all surgical and oncologic treatment options, especially if the interval between the diagnosis of the primary tumor and the development of the metastasis is lengthy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lead poisoning have been reported from many parts of the world. They are one of global clinical problem that effect all body organs and many deaths every year. This review was done to survey toxicological aspects of lead compounds
METHODS: The data bank used in this study is web of science, scopus, pubmed, pubmed central, SID. The keywords are Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, medical plants, acetylcholine, antioxidant.
FINDINGS: Metallic lead is used industrial, organic lead eg., tetraethyl and tetramethyl lead in gasoline additives to prevent engine knock, and inorganic lead salts combined with other elements. Majority of absorptive lead through the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Lead compounds can lead to clinical manifestation in neurologic system, hematopoietic, kidneys, cardiovascular, reproduction, bones.

Patients of lead toxicity need to decontamination (GI tract irrigation), supportive cares, use traditional and new chelating agents to combination therapy, also antioxidants, vitamins, and nanoparticle. 
CONCLUSION: Based on the survey, it is recommended to detect contaminated areas and consider an educational plan for the exposed people to prevention of lead poisoning.
KEY WORDS: Lead Compounds, Dimercaprol, Dimercaptosuccinic Acid, Antioxidants.

In this paper, a non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization (NSPSO) is proposed for solving multi-objective economic dispatch considering wind power uncertainty. Two objectives including operation cost and system risk in terms of wind power penetration are considered. The Pareto fronts of optimal solutions are compared with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II). Simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus test system indicate that NSPSO can provide a better trade-off Pareto front solution in a less computation effort.

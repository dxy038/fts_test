Objective (s): The male personality trait may be related to contraceptive method use and unwanted pregnancy.  The main purpose of this study was to analyze whether personality trait of the men influences the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy. 
Methods: In a descriptive correlation study, a total number of 600 pregnant women, attending to Babol antenatal clinics in Bobol public and private medical centers, were randomly selected. A standardized Personality Questionnaire Short Form was used to elicit information about characteristics of the personality traits. The statistical associations between unwanted pregnancy and the personality trait were then investigated using logistic regression analysis. 
Results: The prevalence of unwanted pregnancy was 14%.  In the wanted pregnancy, the average scores for the men personality trait with extraversion (p =0.031), agreeableness (p =0.001) and conscientiousness (p =0.003), was higher than unwanted pregnancy. After adjusting for possible confounding variables, the results shown a significant association between the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and conscientiousness (95% CI, 0.908-0.977, p=0.0001) and agreeableness (95% CI, 0.901-0.976, p=0.02). Nevertheless, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) showed no significant associations between neuroticism, extroversion and openness with unwanted pregnancy. 
Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that the male personality trait had a strong effect on the incidence of unwanted pregnancy.

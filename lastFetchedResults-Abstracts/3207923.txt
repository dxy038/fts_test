As installed capacity of wind power retains a significant proportion of generation in the power system, the dispatch of wind power brings some new problems to the system. It is an effective way to increase the capabilities of wind farms to regulate active power for grid optimal dispatch support. Particle swarm algorithm is an excellent optimization algorithm for its robustness and versatility, and it has been widely used in the field of power system optimization in recent years. In this paper, an active power dispatch model of wind turbine generators is presented, in which the optimization objective is to minimize the line loss of the wind farm, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization function. Testing results show that this calculation method could track the power dispatch upon operatorÂ´s request more accurately than the conventional distribution method, and the active power loss of wind farm can be reduced.

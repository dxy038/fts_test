When a firm is unable to meet its debt, it may have to seek more expensive sources of funds or even liquidate its assets. This paper provides a normative study of minimizing such debt payment risk through the optimal dynamic choice of the maturity structure of debt. The conclusion is that short-term financing is helpful for a firm with good financial position to readjust its maturity structure more quickly in response to value swings of the assets.

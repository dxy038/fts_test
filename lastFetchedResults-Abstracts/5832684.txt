A specific objective of the EURO-NGI network is the development of a Macro-tool which provides a homogeneous environment for hosting and interrelation of the software tools developed by the research labs of the network. The development of such a software environment raises several coordination and integration issues. This paper proposes tool integration under a common user access interface as an optimal solution and proposes the Web interface as the most natural option. The paper explains several innovative aspects in the field of remote software tool execution, secure access, customized interfaces and sharing environments for simultaneous execution and exposure of the main aspects of a sharing environment for network planning tools, named WeBaSeRex and its application for tasks in the EURO-NGI network of excellence.

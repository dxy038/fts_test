Battery fast charging is a crucial issue in both research and application to realize and promote the mass commercialization of electric vehicles, especially pure electric vehicles. However, due to the strong nonlinear properties of batteries, the charging process should take into consideration various factors such as state of charge (SoC), temperature, and charging current, so as to assure the safety, reduce charging time, and enhance charging efficiency. In this paper, we propose a fast charging strategy under the model predictive control framework. Two models are employed to predict SoC and temperature under a sequence of future charging currents. SoC predictor is based on RC equivalent circuit and temperature predictor is based on thermal conduction and convection. The prediction of battery future states allows optimization of the control sequence, with the objectives to follow a predetermined SoC trajectory and to minimize battery temperature rising. Genetic algorithm are introduced to solve the constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The results using Advisor platform demonstrate the availability and efficacy of the proposed framework and prove that it has the ability to reduce charging time and heat generation simultaneously.

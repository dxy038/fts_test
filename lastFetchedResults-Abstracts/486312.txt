Introduction & Objective: The incidence of human visceral ; leishmaniasis (VL) has recently increased in the Nourabad- j Mamassani district of Fars province. This study was designed to j detect fauna and bioecology of Phlebotomiae sand flies which j are vectors of leishmaniasis worldwide.
j Materials & Methods: The study was a descriptive - cross I sectional which was carried out during 2004 to 2005. Sand flies j were caught using CDC miniature light traps, sticky traps and j aspirators. Microscopic dissection and a Leishmania species j specific seminested-PCR technique using miriicircle kinetoplast j DNA primers were used to detect leptomonad infection.
j Results: A total of 12688 sand flies were caught, of them, 7040 j specimens (55.48%) were male and 5648 (44.52%) were j female. The fauna was identified as 25 species (14 Phlebotomus j and 11 Sergentomyia species). Six species consist of four j Phlebotomus species (P. ansari, P. salehi, P. eleanorae and P. j bergeroti) and two Sergentomyia species (S. squamipleuris and j S. africana) were reported for the first time in the Fars province, j Ph. papatasi and S. dentata were the dominant species in indoor j (39.2%) and outdoor (21.1%) places, respectively. Monthly j activity of sand flies begins in mid Ordibehesht, lasting to mid j Aban with a peak in mid Mordad. Leishmania leptomonad j infection was observed in two dissected specimens of each of j Ph. alexandri and Ph. papatasi species. Anthropophilic indices of ; these two sand flies were 32.8 and 37.3% using ELISA j technique.
j Conclusion: Sand flies fauna is rich in this county because of j high bioecological diversity. P. papatasi and P. alexandri are j introduced as the vectors of cutaneous and visceral j leishmaniasis in this focus, respectively. Our findings will be j used as the basis of leishmaniasis control strategies in this i focus.

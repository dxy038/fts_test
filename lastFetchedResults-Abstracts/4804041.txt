This paper addresses the distributed resource optimization issue in heterogeneous Web environments, where both resource nodes and service requests may be heterogeneous. Specifically, this paper presents an agent-based mechanism, where agents are employed to carry service requests. Agents are equipped with three behaviors, namely, least-loaded move, less-loaded move, and random move, to search for appropriate resource nodes. Every time, agents probabilistically choose a behavior to perform. As a whole, the multiagent system can accomplish the objective of load balancing and resource optimization. Through experiments on a computing platform, called SSADRO, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. As compared to our previously proposed load balancing mechanism in Liu, Jin and Wang, (2005), the one in this paper can address dynamic load balancing in heterogeneous environments.

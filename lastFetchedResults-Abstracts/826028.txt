The objective of the French Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate (DSIN) is to have a safe, unambiguous, and thorough system for managing radioactive waste generated by nuclear installations. This system requires the responsibility of the waste generators and the traceability of waste management. In order to be exhaustive, together with the existing management rules for low, medium and high level radioactive waste, DSIN is at present implementing those principles in the case of very low level radioactive waste. The approach chosen deals with `waste studies', zoning of nuclear installations, identification of suitable pathways of management and strict regulatory control.

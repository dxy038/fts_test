Future multimedia services will require the transmission of very high data rates over broad-band radio channels. In order to provide these services to mobile users, an appropriate transmission technique has to cope with frequency-selective and time-variant radio channels. The computation complexity for an equalizer increases in a frequency-selective radio channel for high data rate applications. Furthermore, the overhead for channel estimation procedures increases in time-variant channels. To overcome these drawbacks orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered for broadband applications in many publications. The objective of this paper is to describe the large potential, the flexibility and adaptivity of the OFDM transmission technique in frequency-selective and time variant radio channels. Several technical aspects of OFDM transmission systems are discussed, especially the topics of differential modulation for which we compare different demodulation methods and channel coding with soft decision decoding. For higher level differential modulation, multilevel coding is taken into consideration

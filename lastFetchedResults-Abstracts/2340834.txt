The flight control system of a fly-by-wire (FBW) passenger airliner with a complex framework and high feedback gain augmentation would change the original characteristic of a loaded signal and suppress the excitation of an airplane’s pertinent motion modes. Taking a research example of an FBW passenger airliner model with longitudinal relaxed-static-stability, a new method of signal type selection and signal parameter design is proposed, through analysis of signal energy distribution and plane body’s frequency response. According to CCAR60—the Appraisal and Use Regulation of Flight Simulator Device, the simulation validation of the FBW passenger airliner’s longitudinal aerodynamic parameters identification is put forward. The validation result indicates that the designed signal could excite the longitudinal motion mode of the FBW passenger airliner adequately and the multiparameter comparison in simulation meets the objective test request of CCAR60. Meanwhile, the relative errors of aerodynamic parameters are less than 10%.

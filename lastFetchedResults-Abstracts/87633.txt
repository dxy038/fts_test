The precise cellular mechanism of primordial germ cell (PGC) migration remains unknown. Cell surface galactosyltransferase (GalTase) is known to play unique roles in the process of locomotion of many migratory cells. With an objective to seek evidence for possible involvement of GalTase in the migratory process of PGC, we evaluated germ cell migration in the rat following experimental modulation of embryonic GalTase activity. Pregnant rats were laparotomized under anesthesia on Day 10 of pregnancy. While embryos of one uterine horn received lysozyme (100 µg/fetus), those of the other received (alpha)lactalbumin (LA; 100 µg/fetus), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc; 250 nmole/fetus), uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP; 2.5 µmole/fetus), uridine diphosphate-galactose (UDP-gal; 250 nmole/fetus), or a combination of 250 nmole of UDP-gal and 2.5 µmole of UMP/fetus. Between gestation Days 12 and 14, embryos were dissected out and processed for histochemical localization of PGC on the basis of binding of Dolichos biflorus agglutinin on the surface glycoconjugate of the germ cells. The number of PGC in each embryo was counted. There was a daywise increase in the number of PGC in all groups. As compared with lysozyme-exposed controls, the numbers of PGCs at the day-specific sites on all days of examination were significantly lower in the LA- as well as GlcNAc-exposed groups. UMP or UDP-gal individually exerted little or no influence, while the total PGC count rose significantly over the respective control values under simultaneous exposure to UMP and UDP-gal. The present findings suggest a likely catalytic role of GalTase in the process of germ cell migration.

The objective of this paper is to develop an object recognitlon system through the combination of 2-D tactile image array and visual sensors. A video camera is used to acquire a top view image of an object and two tactile sensing arrays mounted on a gripper are used to detect the tactile information about the lateral surfaces of the object. 3-D reference object models are established as a decision tree, and recognition of unknown objects is accomplished through measuring and comparing input object features hierarchically with these of the reference objects associated with the decision tree. The clustering process and recognition procedures are described. The recognition scheme has been implemented. The resulting decision tree is also presented.

This paper proposes the construction method and the formal description of Web service discovery oriented ontology, then gives the definition of ontology based knowledge base. As the data layer and semantic layer of the whole framework of semantic Web services discovery, Web service oriented ontology based knowledge base is different from traditional knowledge base. It represents the domain knowledge (domain in this paper is travel domain), the formal description of Web service and even the description of personal interest model which supports the formal specification of request query; then proposes an algorithm to realize the objective of discovering the Web services through the way of manipulating the relations between ontology. This paper shows the applied merit of this model through illustrating a use case of Web services discovery, and compares between other ontology construction methods.

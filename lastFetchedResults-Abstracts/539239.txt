As a sociological construct, social capital regards as important both objective and subjective aspects of social relationships. In its core, the construct points to social resources that can be relied upon, and trusted, in maximizing the likelihood of an achievement aimed in any purposeful action. It is, no doubt, the utilization of these resources that plays a crucial role in enhancing a veteran’s quality of life as well as his psycho-somatic state, all that improves his social life in general. Given these positive functions the present article tries to find out the extent to which a psychiatric veteran with spinal cord injuries enjoys the resources defined above as being included in the social capital construct. More specifically here, the resources are meant to be provided by the immediate family and the relatives beyond the household, friends,   neighbours, the Martyr Foundation and the like, and people in general to whom we refer as society.
Considering the significance of social capital, and more importantly, the lack of any survey on the social capital concerning the psychiatric veterans with spinal injuries in the Mazandararn Province, the present research attempted to find the answer to the question as formulated above (extent of the veterans’ enjoyment of resources). This is a survey research which initially set out by considering a population consisting of 838 veterans classed as suffering at least a 25% rate of injuries, and defined as in need of psychiatric help and with damages to the spinal cord. It was out of this statistical population of 838 that a sample of 269 veterans was selected randomly. The Chester and McCall's table (1982) was used for determining the appropriate size of simple random sampling with the confidence level of 98 percent.  In order to collect the data, a constructed questionnaire was used, and the data analysis was carried out utilizing the SPSS. Some notable findings of the research are as the following: 
•	On the type of reliable and trustworthy social networks, the immediate relatives stand as the first, with intimate friends and the neighbours occupying the following positions of the second and the third, respectively. 
•	As we move away from the family and approach the more general notion of the society, the social capital of the veterans decrease significantly; while 73 percentage of the subjects enjoyed the social capital via their immediate family, almost 75 percentage of those surveyed believed that society’s climate is not trustworthy and that they are not treated respectfully by the general public. 
•	The survey suggests an investigation aimed at clarifying reasons why the subjects’ social capital erodes as we move from the family towards the society. The research also recommends studying the social pathology that is the negative outcomes, resulting from such a fact. Furthermore, this paper proposes a national research to be conducted on the topic of the veterans’ social capital.

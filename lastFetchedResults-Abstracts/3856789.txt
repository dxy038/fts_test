The author describes a unified approach for the topological analysis of nonhierarchical and hierarchical packet networks. The approach differs from previous approaches in adopting an end-to-end mean delay objective and including a variety of practical routing constraints. These include limits on the number of paths allowed in a route, limits on the number of hops allowed in a path, and constraints due to prevalent virtual circuit implementations. For a broad range of networks, quantitative analysis based on this approach provides new insights into the complex relationships between network topology and routing and delay constraints. It is shown that the sole use of a network average delay criterion often leads to network designs that exhibit poor end-to-end mean delays for some node pairs, and that it is possible to configure networks that meet an end-to-end mean delay objective for every node pair at little or no additional cost

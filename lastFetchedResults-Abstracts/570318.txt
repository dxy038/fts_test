 The objective of this study is to derive a money demand function compatible  with the Islamic Economic Rules, i.e., Prohibition  of Reba. This rule, evidently eliminates the loan market from the  economy.Therefore, we propose that the Islamic financial markets  could link the real and  nominal sectors of the economy and provide  the information needed by both the financial intermediaries and the Central  Bank authorities to allocate financial  and liquid assets, respectively.  Meanwhile, the nature of speculative activities are discussed. and  conditions that facilitate  harmful speculative activities are identified  and the policies that are  required to eliminate those conditions are  proposed.  Based on this  financial market model, both demand for and supply of  financial resources  as well as demand for money balances are derived.  This  demand for money  balance  is  formulated  as a function of rate of return of  shares  exchanged in the stock market, real GDP, and inflation rate. The  estimation result of this function using the cointegrated maximum  likelihood  Johanson-Josilious method shows that the demand for money is a  stable and  significant function of the above mentioned variables. 
 Specifically, the  logarithm of the money demanded (m1) is a significant and negative function  of dividentâ€™s rate of return, but positive and   significant function of real  GDP and inflation rate.

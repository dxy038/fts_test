In ASIC development, effective simulation leads into functionally more reliable chips as well as faster development time. This paper describes the design and the simulation techniques used in 3 ATM ASIC developments in ETRI. The three ASICs described are: ASAH-NIC-a 155 Mbps ATM SAR chip with internal PCI interface and SDH framer; ASAPI-L4-a 622 Mbps bidirectional ATM layer processing chip with UPC, OAM, QOS buffering capabilities; and ASAH-P4-a 622 Mbps ATM physical layer chip

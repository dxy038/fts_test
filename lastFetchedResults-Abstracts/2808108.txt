The penetration level of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is predicted to increase continuously in next two decades. As a result, the charging loads of PHEVs may build up load peaks and affect the stability of the distribution grid if no smart charging schedule is applied. In this paper, two charging methods, V1G and V2H, are introduced to mitigate the peak loads by re-scheduling the daily charging plan. V1G methodÂ´s objective is to make better use of excess wind energy and save electricity cost for each consumer. In V2H method, the battery of PHEV serves as an energy storage device to reduce the variation of household loads. After the optimization considering both methods, the daily charging load curve could be smoother. In other words, the stability of the distribution grid is enhanced.

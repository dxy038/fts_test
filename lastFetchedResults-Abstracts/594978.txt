Objective: Proteinuria is a common manifestation of Glomerular diseases, which may or may not be accompanied by haematuria and renal impairment. We conducted a prospective study to assess the value of renal biopsy, complications and the type of renal pathology at the Department of Medicine Hayatabad medical complex Peshawar from September 1998-2001.Material and Methods: One hundred (100) patients having significant proteinuria, confirmed on 24 hours urinary protein estimation underwent ultrasound guided renal biopsy. Initially Tru-cut needles were used but later on monopty gun was used.Results: There were 70 male patients (70%) and 30 female patients (30%); the mean age at presentation was 29.5 years (range 10-90 years). All patients tolerated the procedure well and there were no failure. The common complications noted were pain at biopsy site in 15 patients (15%), gross haematuria in 10 patients (10%). None of the patients needed blood transfusion or prolonged hospitalization. Nephrotic syndrome was the most common indication for biopsy followed by lupus nephritis and interstitial nephritis. Among the Nephrotic patients, minimal change disease and post- infectious glomerulonephritis (GN) were the commonest findings in patients below the age of 25 years, membrano-proliferative GN ranked first in adults while membranous GN and amyloidosis were more common in the elderly.Conclusion: We conclude that renal biopsy is associated with an acceptably low rate of complications in our practice and that the pattern of renal histology varies slightly from those reported from other countries.

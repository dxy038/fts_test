This paper describes an auto-parking system, which is based on the binocular theory and the bidirectional path-planning method. At first, according to the binocular theory, two CCD cameras are used to get image information of their surroundings and then constraint information is extracted via the three-dimensional reconstruction techniques. Second, a bidirectional path-planning method is applied to design an optimal auto-parking path. At last, a path-planning simulation based on OpenCV platform is carried out and the result is relatively good.

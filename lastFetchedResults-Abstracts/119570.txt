Digitized colour infrared images are a potential information source for multi-source forest inventory applications and particularly for estimating the forest characteristics of relatively small areas. The main problem in computer-aided image analysis of aerial photographs is the presence of bidirectional reflectance, which causes the spectral values of the image pixels to depend on their location in the image. Because of this, and the lack of operational methods for radiometric correction, the full potential of aerial photographs has not been utilised. This paper presents a local radiometric correction method that can be used for reducing the effect of bidirectional reflectance. The method employs satellite images that are less affected by the bidirectional reflectance for the local adjustment of the registered pixel values of aerial photographs. Because of the different spatial resolution of the aerial and satellite imagery, the local correction coefficients are computed for units that are larger than a single aerial photo pixel. In this way, the general level of brightness of the correction units can be determined on the basis of the satellite imagery while retaining the finer spatial resolution of the original aerial photo. The main advantage of the suggested method is that it does not require complex mathematical models for simulating the effect of bidirectional reflectance, neither does it require a priori knowledge of the actual forest attributes in the inventory area, but relies only on the image data.

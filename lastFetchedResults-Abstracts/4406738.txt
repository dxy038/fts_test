This study discusses the optimized design of a low speed Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) Synchronous Generator (1 kW, 100 rpm) with TORUS-S structure to be used in direct drive wind turbine applications to obtain DC voltage. Optimization problems usually deal with two main questions: namely, what the best choice for an objective function is and which parameters have the most influence on the selected objective. The present study provides discussion on how the suitable parameters were selected as genes to be used in Genetic Algorithm (GA) method for efficiency optimization. Afterwards, using GA from MATLABÂ´s optimization toolbox, an initial design was optimized. Finally, the results were verified by finite element analysis and simulated using Maxwell 14.0 software. To obtain the desired DC voltage as the output, a diode rectifier was utilized, whereby the simulation results met the expected results.

There has been an exponential increase in health care costs in the last decade. Seniors have to make frequent visits to their doctor to get their vital signs measured. There is a huge market for non-invasive methods of measurement of these vital signs. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a reliable, cheap, low powered, non-intrusive, and accurate system that can be worn on a regular basis and monitors the vital signs and displays the output to the user´s cell phone. This paper specifically deals with the signal conditioning and data acquisition of vital sign: blood pressure. Blood pressure combines the methodologies of Electrocardiography to continuously monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Here remote monitoring of a patient´s blood pressure (BP) is described. The data is transferred to a central monitoring station using a wireless sensor network for displaying and storing.

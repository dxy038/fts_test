Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications are looking forward for better and effective environment because of its heterogeneous and wearable nature. Recent applications of WBAN need to be support both real time traffic (sensitive to end-to-end packet delay) and non-real time traffic (sensitive to packet loss), which further origin the problem of diverse QoS requirements. So the first step of this paper is to study QoS issues related to each layer and extort why transport layer is more devoted to QoS issue. Then we inspect the limitations of current existing transport protocols for WBAN system. Considering these limitations we have designed a protocol, which tries to handle QoS in an efficient way. As we know transport layer deals QoS significantly, proposed protocol was structured to overcome some QoS problems related to this layer like packet handling, reliable packet transmission with loss recovery and congestion control. The intention of proposed schema is to provide end-to-end bidirectional (both upstream and downstream) and bi-functional (both packet based and event based) reliability module. This is also taking care of each kind of packets loss. Its intelligent packet handling method provides priority fairness to overcome starvation problem. This proposed work is making an effort to reduce retransmission of duplicate packets and relevant to control congestion.

Three performance indicators allowing an objective post-evaluation of implementation of lake Micro Prespa level management provisions are presented. Indicator I1 measures the success in keeping level within predetermined elevation amplitude by plotting the level time series and adding all outlying surfaces. Indicator I2 quantifies the degree of convergence of lake level to a goal elevation by taking the square root of the sum of squares of all daily deviations from goals. Indicator I3 quantifies the degree of establishment favorable fish spawning conditions by counting all potentially productive days for a water temperature depended time period. All indicators developed can also be applied to other lakes under similar level management plans.

It is a multi-objective optimization problem to autogenerate a test paper from test bank. In this paper an autogenerating test paper method based on latent semantic analysis and genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly the relationships of keywords among test items in a test bank are analyzed with LSA, and the weights of the test items are calculated. Then using the Genetic Algorithm to compose the test paper accorded to the weights. The proposed method can effectively select test items from Chinese test bank to compose a test paper.

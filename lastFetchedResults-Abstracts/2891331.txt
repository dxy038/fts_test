Many software project lag behind schedule because in actual work activity duration get changed due to unexpected things, hence this study considers different duration types of the same activity. This system considers activity which is time-dependent, random and normal. Objective is to schedule software project using time-dependent and random activities within deadline. This type of project cannot be schedule using simple critical path method. Hence we integrate critical path method and stochastic technique to find stochastic critical path.

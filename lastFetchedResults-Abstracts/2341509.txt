Objective
The present study was performed to examine the effects of two speech therapy
methods on six verbal behaviors of autistic children, including oral speech,
listening, organizing, speaking, semantics, and syntax.
Materials & Methods
In this study, thirty children with autism were assigned to one of two groups:
imitative and cognitive groups. Before starting the main procedures of the study,
the children of both groups were homogenized concerning their autism level.
In the first phase of the study, the speech development level of the two groups
was measured in a pre-test, in which both groups showed similar results. Then,
both groups of children received 6 months of speech therapy instruction, during
which one group was taught using an imitative method, while the other group
was being worked with cognitive method.
Results
After 6-month treatment period, a post-test was done, and the t-tests based on
the data of the two groups revealed a significant difference between the results.
Conclusion
The statistics showed that after the teaching period, autistic that worked
with cognitive method gained a better development in their speech abilities,
comparing to those worked with the imitative method.

The next generation of symmetric multiprocessors will add another level of memory hierarchy and new barriers to effective use of supercomputers. Helping scientists overcome such barriers to using high-performance computers was a key objective in the relocation of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The relocation makes it easier for NERSC to collaborate closely with scientists at Berkeley Lab and throughout the energy research community, with scientists at the adjacent University of CaliforniaÂ´s Berkeley campus, and with major computer and data communications companies throughout the San Francisco Bay area

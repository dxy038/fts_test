In this paper, we investigate spectrum sharing and multiple access problems for the high-rate ultra-wideband (UWB) systems. Based on the use of the linear precoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (LP-OFDM) proposed as an evolution of the well known multi-band OFDM (MB-OFDM) solution supported by the WiMedia Alliance for future high-rate UWB systems, the objective of this paper is to study a multiuser optimization spectrum sharing scheme for LP-OFDM UWB systems. This optimization study leads to a novel multiple access solution for the high-rate UWB systems. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the use of the LP-OFDM transmission technique in the multiuser spectrum sharing scheme. Besides, the novel LP-OFDM multiuser spectrum sharing solution shows its capacity to provide a good tradeoff between the QoS support of the high-priority users and the fairness between the competing users.

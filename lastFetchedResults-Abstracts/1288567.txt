Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and it is estimated that one-third of the world’s population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among a series of tested compounds, we have recently identified five synthetic chalcones which inhibit the activity of M. tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase A (PtpA), an enzyme associated with M. tuberculosis infectivity. Kinetic studies demonstrated that these compounds are reversible competitive inhibitors. In this work we also carried out the analysis of the molecular recognition of these inhibitors on their macromolecular target, PtpA, through molecular modeling. We observed that the predominant determinants responsible for the inhibitory activity of the chalcones are the positions of the two methoxyl groups at the A-ring, that establish hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues Arg17, His49, and Thr12 in the active site of PtpA, and the substitution of the phenyl ring for a 2-naphthyl group as B-ring, that undergoes π stacking hydrophobic interaction with the Trp48 residue from PtpA. Interestingly, reduction of mycobacterial survival in human macrophages upon inhibitor treatment suggests their potential use as novel therapeutics. The biological activity, synthetic versatility, and low cost are clear advantages of this new class of potential tuberculostatic agents.

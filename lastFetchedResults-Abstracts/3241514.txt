An adaptive fusion algorithm of CT and MRI medical images based on NSCT is presented in this paper. The source images are decomposed in a multi-direction way by using the nonsubsampled pyramids (NSP) and the nonsubsampled directional filter banks (NSDFBs). In band-pass directional sub-band coefficients fusion rules, we use local energy and the weighted average combination, meanwhile for the larger selection of absolute value of the coefficient are applied in the highest levels . The combination of the adjustable parameter and objective evaluation index of the adaptive fusion rules are used in low frequency sub-band fusion.The experiment verifies the feasibility of the method in terms of visual quality and objective evaluation criteria, entropy, standard deviation, space-frequency and mutual-information etc.

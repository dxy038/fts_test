This paper presents a power control and channel assignment tool for wireless network design. It takes the location data of the mobile stations which were generated by a user traffic modeling and simulation tool, computes the operating power levels of the mobile stations, and assigns the mobile stations to the set of base stations with the objective of minimizing the interference. It takes into the consideration of the sector antenna angle overlap and the soft/softer handoff

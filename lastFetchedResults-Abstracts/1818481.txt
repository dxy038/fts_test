Objective: We examined the stress–strain and stress–relaxation properties of the periodontal ligament (PDL) in the rat molar at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age to elucidate age-related changes in the tooth support function of the PDL. Design: From the dissected left and right mandibles in each rat, a pair of transverse sections (ca. 0.45 mm in thickness) of the first molar was cut at the middle part of the mesial root. We then obtained a load–deformation curve for the PDL, using one of the paired sections. The other section was loaded to as much as 50% of the maximum load as determined from the contralateral section, and keeping the deformation constant for 10 min, a load–relaxation curve was obtained and analysed. Results: The maximum shear stress and tangent modulus decreased between 2 and 24 months of age. As the maximum shear strain increased with age (P&lt;0.001), the failure strain energy density did not change between 2 and 24 months of age. The stress–relaxation during the 10 min period decreased from 2 to 24 months of age (P&lt;0.01). The relaxation process of the PDL in each age was well described by a sum of three exponential decay functions. The age-related decrease in the relaxation was found to be mainly due to the increase in the relaxation time for the long-term relaxation component. Conclusion: These results indicate that the maximum shear stress and stiffness of the rat molar PDL decrease between 2 and 24 months of age; but its toughness remains unchanged due to an increase in the extensibility. Our findings further indicate that the fluid flow and movements of macromolecules within the stretched PDL fibres during the stress–relaxation decrease with advancing age.

Objective: To study the utility of Transradial Coronary Angioplasty in Patients with Chronic stable Angina discharged on same day. Methodology: This was a single center observational study with prospective data collection of 228 patients underwent transradial coronary angioplasty from January to December 2010, at Post Graduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. Patients of both genders and all ages who had transradial coronary angioplasty for chronic stable angina and were discharged on same day were included in the study, using purposive non-probability sampling technique. Patients with unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome who had to stay for more than one day, were excluded from the study. Patients were followed at one month of hospital discharge in out patients department and clinical outcome data was recorded. Results: A total of 228 patients were included in the study. Male were 64.9% and 35.1% were female with mean age of 56 ± 9years. All the patients had coronary intervention through right radial artery. Baseline characteristics of the patients were; diabetic 46.4%, hypertensive 45.6%, smokers 32.8%, dyslipidemic were 47.8% and mean values of serum creatinin and Hemoglobin were 1.2±0.5 and 12.8±2.4, respectively. The frequency of various complications were as follow; mild hematoma 1.7%, nausea and vomiting 1.3%, pain in hand 10.5%, readmission to hospital for chest pain 7.4%, need for revascularization 3%, hand ischemia 2.5%, minor bleeding 0.8%, and mortality was 1.3%.There was no access site major bleeding or hematoma. Conclusion: The radial artery approach for coronary angiopalsty is found to be very useful with low degree of access site vascular complications and an early patient mobilization.

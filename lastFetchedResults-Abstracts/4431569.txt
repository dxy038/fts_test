This paper discusses the application of a dual active bridge converter (DAB) as a bidirectional interface between the energy storage system and the main dc bus in a dc nanogrid. A novel control technique based on control loops competition is proposed to perform the energy management between both systems, which allows the dual active bridge to concomitantly regulate the main dc bus and control the battery bank charging process with a four states method.

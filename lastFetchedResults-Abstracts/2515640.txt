Background and Objective: Obesity is a complex chronic condition which is defined as an increase in body fat. Today obesity has become a major public health problem in the world, so with the increasing prevalence of obesity, the prevalence of adverse effects associated with obesity increases. The amount of body fat is more important than weight that due to some advanced techniques, we are able to assess it. But difficulty and high cost of these procedures, recalls the need to find an alternative method.
Subjects and Methods: In this study, 272 Ahvaz students were selected using stratified random sampling and body Fat Percentage by the Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) devices and their anthropometric characteristics were assessed.
Results: Strong correlation between AVI, BMI and WHtR in men and BMI, BAI and WHtR in women with percentage of body fat have been observed. Linear regression models were created to predict percentage body fat from anthropometric variables so that the variables sex, BMI, AVI described 85% of body fat percentage differences. 
Conclusion: Our regression model enables us in estimating body fat without using body composition techniques, using only height gauges and scales.

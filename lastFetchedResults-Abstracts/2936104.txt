This paper describes a PC-based multilayered data integration and classification system that is under development for monitoring coastal oceanographic processes. For data integration and sensor fusion, the authors have developed a multilayered &#8220;hypercube&#8221; that includes data from satellite ERS-1, multi-frequency airborne SAR imagery, AVHRR imagery, in situ measurements of temperature, salinity and the calculated sound speed. The authors show examples from a number of the systems applications that include: georeferencing, sensor fusion, pattern classification and automatic frontal detection, geophysical parameter extraction, objective interpolation, and prediction of acoustic propagation loss within the water column

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repeated and
persistent attempts to control thoughts and actions with rituals. These rituals are used in order to
prevent feared or personally distressing outcomes. Cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT)
has been reported to be effective for treating OCD patients. However, about one-third (30%) of
patients do not benefit fromCBGT. Some of these patients do not showsignificant improvement
and continue to use rituals following CBGT, partially because they fail to complete the exposure
and ritual prevention (ERP) exercises. Consequently, it is important to motivate patients to fully
engage in CBGT treatment and complete the ERP exercises. Aims: A randomized behavioral
trial examined 12 weeks of manual directed CBGT, with the addition of individual sessions
of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Thought Mapping (TM), and compared treatment
outcome to the effectiveness of CBGT group alone. Method: Subjects were randomized
(n=93) into a CBGT group or a CBGT group with MI+TM. Results: When the two groups
were compared, both groups reduced OCD symptoms. However, symptom reduction and
remission were significantly higher in the MI+TM CBGT group. Positive outcomes were also
maintained, with additional symptom reduction at the 3-month follow-up for the MI+TM
CBGT group. Conclusions: Adding two individual sessions of MI and TM before CBGT
successfully reduced OCD symptoms and was more effective than using CBGT group alone.

The aim of the present work is to develop an application of the LArge Time INcrement (LATIN) approach
for the parametric analysis of static problems with multiple contacts. The methodology adopted
was originally introduced to solve viscoplastic and large-transformation problems. Here, the applications
concern elastic, quasi-static structural assemblies with local non-linearities such as unilateral contact with
friction. Our approach is based on a decomposition of the assembly into substructures and interfaces.
The interfaces play the vital role of enabling the local non-linearities, such as contact and friction, to
be modelled easily and accurately. The problem on each substructure is solved by the  nite element
method and an iterative scheme based on the LATIN method is used for the global resolution. More
speci cally, the objective is to calculate a large number of design con gurations. Each design con guration
corresponds to a set of values of all the variable parameters (friction coe cients, prestress) which
are introduced into the mechanical analysis. A full computation is needed for each set of parameters.
Here we propose, as an alternative to carrying out these full computations, to use the capability of the
LATIN method to re-use the solution to a given problem (for one set of parameters) in order to solve
similar problems (for the other sets of parameters).

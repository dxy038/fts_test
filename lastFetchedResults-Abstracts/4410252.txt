This paper presents modified topologies for the Z-source inverter. The main objective of the modifications are to get higher boost factor, less voltage stress across the switches as well as reduction of the number of passive components. Two types of inverter topologies are presented in this paper. They are ripple-input current proposed inverter (r-proposed inverter) and continuous-input current proposed inverter (c-proposed inverter). Different operating states and their analysis are explained for both the topologies. Matlab/Simulink software is used to validate the analysis made.

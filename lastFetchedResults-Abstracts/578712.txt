ABSTRACT: Objective: The prime goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of the school games on the manipulation skills of the first to third grade male students of Khorramabad primary schools who suffer from adhesive deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Methodology: The methodology of the research is semi-empirical. The statistical population consists of 40 ADHD suffering male students, of which 20 were selected by referring to the counseling center located at Khorramabad education and training organization. These students were classified into two control and experimental groups, each containing 10 subjects (similar average age P= 0.649, similar manipulation skill P= 0.897). The training group was then subjected to 18 forty-five-minute long sessions of school games selected from “sport for everybody” program of the American Human Kinetic Institute, from which the control group was deprived. The manipulation skills of these students were assessed using the Ulricht’s tool and through direct observation. The kolmogorov-smirnov test was applied to study the normal distribution of the data, while paired samples t-test and independent samples t-test were used to compare the means in a significant level of P < 0.05.
Results: The results suggested that the data conformed to a normal distribution, and that school games could significantly improve the manipulation skills of the experimental group. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that compared to the control group, the experimental group is superior in terms of the manipulation skills (P= 0.0001).
Conclusion: Based on the results of the current study, it is suggested that the school games be incorporated into the educational curriculum of the ADHD suffering students to ensure the improvement of their manipulation skills.

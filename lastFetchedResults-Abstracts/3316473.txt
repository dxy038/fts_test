Manufacturing companies have to deal quickly with increasing competition and more individual customer requests. New intelligent technologies like RFID combined with appropriate organizational structures or decentralized and real-time based production control can handle these challenges. The efficient analysis of a production process, the selection of appropriate technical solutions or developing new approaches to deal with the special requirements of the area of manufacturing problems are essential for a successful participation on the market.The objective of the mini track is also to explore suitable paradigms to design, implement and deploy intelligent systems or adapt them to given contexts. We want to discuss the transferability of general-speaking concepts to shop floor level in the perspective of both, research and practice. Articles should illustrate the application decision making approaches in manufacturing context.

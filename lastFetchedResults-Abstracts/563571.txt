Background and Objective: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disease. Patients suffering from PKU must adhere to a lifelong low-phenylalanine diet. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a unique source of protein for PKU patients, because it contains no phenylalanine. The objective of this study was to extract GMP from whey and  purify it in order to obtain  a product with a minimum  phenylalanine content. The ultrafiltration membrane technology was used to separate GMP from the whey protein concentrate solution at different pH values.
Materials and Methods: Two ultrafilteration disc membranes with 50 and 10 kDa cut-off were used to extract glycomacropeptide from a solution of whey protein concentrtae (10% protein w/v).The experiments in triplicates were performed at the ambient temperature (25±2 °C) and  a  pH of 3.5, 4 or 4.5. The diafilteration technique was used for purification of glycomacropeptide in both ultrafilteration phases; the protein, phenylalanine, and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) contents were measured.
Results: The phenylalanine and NPN contents of the ultrafiltered whey at a pH of 4 were at the lowest and highest level, respectively, indicating the high purity and recovery rate of glycomacropeptide. 
Conclusion: Sweet whey, the major type of whey produced in the country, is the best alternative available for producing a new food source for phenylketonuria patients.

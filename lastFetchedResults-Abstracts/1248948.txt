For numerical simulation of crack modelling in fracture mechanics the eXtended finite element method (Xfem) has been recently accepted as a new powerful and efficiency methodology. In the paper we present the details of implementation of the Xfem algorithm in our in-house finite elements based software. Also, in this study, we investigated the impact of the node enrichment variations on results of the developed numerical procedure. In this study, objective was to examine the properties of standard Xfem algorithm without using of Near Tip enriching functions in order to create possibilities for future application Xfem in the zone of plasticity. In order to evaluate the computational accuracy, numerical results for the Stress Intensity Factors are compared with both theoretical and conventional finite element data. Obtained numerical results have shown a good agreement with the benchmark solutions. For calculation of the Stress Intensity Factors (SIF), we used the J-Equivalent Domain Integral (J-EDI) Method. Computational geometry issues, associated with the representation of the crack and the enrichment of the finite element approximation, are discussed in detail.

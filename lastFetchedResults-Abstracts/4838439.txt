Being parallel to frequency domain robust steering controller designs, time domain approaches attract considerable interest in the last decade. Based on previous research results, a synthesized time design framework is proposed in this paper. The design task is constructed as a multi-objective optimization problem which simultaneously considers system stabilization, disturbance rejection, actuator saturation and time delay. A mixed L<sub>1</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> robust controller is finally obtained by solving a set of linear matrix equalities (LMI) that guarantee driving performance requirements. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate prognostic factors in patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma who had undergone a primary radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Study Design: A retrospective analysis of 177 patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for stage IB to II disease at a single institution was performed to evaluate clinicopathologic parameters, time to recurrence, pattern of failure, use of salvage therapy, and survival after recurrence. Results: The 5-year survival rate from diagnosis of recurrence in this series was 10.1%. Survival after recurrence was significantly decreased in patients with pelvic lymph node metastasis at primary surgery and adenocarcinomaâ€“adenosquamous carcinoma histologic type. Patients with extravaginal recurrences receiving chemoradiation for recurrent cervical carcinoma had significantly better outcomes than those receiving radiation alone. Six patients who had a distant relapse at a sole site had prolonged survival after salvage therapy, which was accomplished by chemoradiation, surgery plus radiotherapy, or surgery alone. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy in the treatment of recurrent cervical carcinoma. Salvage multimodality treatment should be offered to selected patients who have isolated relapse at a single distant site. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:518-24.)

Background: There are several studies about the correlation of blood glucose level and prognosis in traumatic patients.

Objective: To determine the relationship between the on-admission plasma glucose (G) level with the type and severity of trauma.

Methods: In this analytical study, 270 patients who were admitted to the trauma center of Alzahra general hospital in 2006, evaluated for plasma G level, GCS, TS, and the type of trauma upon admission. In cases with plasma G (BS1) grater than 140 mg/dl on admission, the plasma G (BS2) was re-checked the next 24 hours. Data were analyzed using t-test and correlation ratio. Findings: The incidence of different types of trauma and their mean BS1 were as follows: head and neck trauma (45%, BS1=238±104 mg/dl), multiple trauma (28%, BS1=193±82 mg/dl), extremities trauma (16.1%, BS1 = 140±12 mg/dl), abdominal and chest trauma (7.4%, BS1=200±89 mg/dl), and pelvis trauma (2%, BS1= 152±10 mg/dl). The Mean plasma G level in patients with TS=11-16, TS=6-10, and TS=l-5 was 130.74, 273.78, and 340 mg/dl, respectively.

Conclusion: In the emergency stage of trauma, hyperglycemia is common. In addition, an increase in plasma G level has a direct correlation with severity of trauma and head injury.

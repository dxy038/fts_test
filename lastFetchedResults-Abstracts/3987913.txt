Analytic models for a bidirectional coupled-inductor Cuk converter operating in sliding mode are described. Using a linear combination of the converter four state variable errors as a general switching surface, the expression for the equivalent control is derived and the coordinates of the equilibrium point are obtained. Particular cases of the general switching surface are subsequently analyzed in detail: (1) surfaces for ideal line regulation, (2) surfaces for ideal load regulation, and (3) surfaces for hysteretic current control. Simulation results verifying the analytical predictions are presented

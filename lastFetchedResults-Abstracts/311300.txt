Objective. The hypothesis tested was that the increased load on the medial arch in the adult flat foot can be reduced through a 6 mm subtalar arthroereisis.

Design. A three-dimensional multisegment biomechanical model was used in conjunction with experimental data and data from the literature.

Background. Biomechanical models have been used to study the plantar fascia, medial arch height, subtalar motion, medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy and distribution of forces in the foot.

Methods. Responses of a normal foot, a flat foot, and a flat foot with a subtalar arthroereisis to an applied load of 683 N were analyzed and the distribution of support among the metatarsal heads and the moment about various joints were computed.

Results. The flattened foot results in an increase in the load on the head of the first metatarsal from 10% to 24% of the body weight, and an increase in the moment about the talo-navicular joint from 3.4 to 11.9 N m. Insertion of a 6 mm cylinder into the sinus tarsi, subtalar arthroereisis, results in a shift of the load back toward the lateral column, decreasing the load on the first metatarsal to 6% of the body weight and decreasing the moment about the talo-navicular joint to 6.0 N m.

Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that a 6 mm subtalar arthroereisis in an adult flat foot model decreases the load on the medial arch.

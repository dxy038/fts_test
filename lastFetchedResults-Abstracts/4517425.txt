The optimum shape of the pattern of a satellite antenna depends on the objective of the satellite and on restrictions derived from international agreements, launcher limitations and cost budget. Frequently high-performance reflector antennas are required which exhibit the capability of almost homogeneous illumination of the coverage area, low spillover in neighbouring areas, small dimensions, low weight, and simple design

Subjective Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is the most reliable way to evaluate the visual quality of digital images perceived by the end user. It is often used to construct image quality datasets and provide the groundtruth for building and evaluating objective quality measures. Subjective tests based on the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) have been widely used in previous studies, but have many known problems such as an ambiguous scale definition and dissimilar interpretations of the scale among subjects. To overcome these limitations, Paired Comparison (PC) tests have been proposed as an alternative and are expected to yield more reliable results. However, PC tests can be expensive and time consuming, since for n images they require (<sup>n</sup><sub>2</sub>)comparisons. We present a hybrid subjective test which combines MOS and PC tests via a unified probabilistic model and an active sampling method. The proposed method actively constructs a set of queries consisting of MOS and PC tests based on the expected information gain provided by each test and can effectively reduce the number of tests required for achieving a target accuracy. Our method can be used in conventional laboratory studies as well as crowdsourcing experiments. Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art subjective IQA tests in a crowdsourced setting.

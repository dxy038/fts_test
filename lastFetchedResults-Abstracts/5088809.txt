The objective of this paper is to detail an analytical method allowing the stability study of an electric system constituted by an input filter connected to an actuator (inverter - Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor or induction motor). The proposed approach supposes that a classical control structure of the actuator is used. This control structure is slightly modified to implement an oscillation compensating block which allows increasing the stability margin and thus permits a reduction of the DC-link capacitance value. An example with an input filter connected to an inverter-PMSM system designed for aircraft application is treated. The influence of the control and the input filter parameters on the stability of the DC power supply will be discussed.

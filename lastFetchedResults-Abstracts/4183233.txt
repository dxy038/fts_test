A DSP (digital signal processor) VLSI with a price/performance ratio enhanced by using properties unique to DSP is presented. The objective was to achieve much of the performance of this third-generation DSP chip at a substantially lower system cost. The device provides a 50-ns cycle time with single-level pipelining, and is packaged in a 68-pin plastic leaded chip carrier. The device is fabricated in a 1-&#956;m CMOS process. Attention is given to the system environment, the DSP architecture, and the block sample processing

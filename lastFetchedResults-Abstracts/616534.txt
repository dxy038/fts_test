With the objective to assess the relevance of competitive effects in respect of the humic colloid-borne migration of actinides in case of release, the influence of Al(III) on humate complexation of La(III) as an analogue of trivalent actinides was investigated for various humic materials by using 140La as a radioactive tracer, allowing measurements in very dilute systems to simulate realistic settings. Generally, competition by aluminium is not detectable unless the metal-loading capacity of the humic colloids is nearly exhausted. For average contents of organic carbon, a threshold value of 10âˆ’6 M Al(III) can be specified. The metal exchange turned out to be kinetically hindered. Effects on co-adsorption of La(III) and humic acid were found to be less important. Immobilization by the concomitantly induced flocculation process outweighs the role of displacement effects. Comparative studies on complexation and flocculation of humic acid with Al(III), Ga(III), In(III), Sc(III), Y(III), and La(III) were undertaken in order to evaluate the influence of specific properties apart from ion charge and to characterize the mechanism of flocculation. In spite of considerable variations in the binding affinities among these metals, it can be inferred that the possibility of significant competitive effects in natural aquatic systems is confined to Al(III). Complex stabilities and flocculation efficiencies proved to be interrelated. Precipitation is thus attributed to homocoagulation of humic colloids induced by charge compensation, which is further supported by flocculation experiments with Al(III) depending on pH, ionic strength, and humic acid concentration.

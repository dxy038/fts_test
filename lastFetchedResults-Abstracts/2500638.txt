<p><strong>Background and Objectives: </strong><em>Salmonella </em>is an important food-borne pathogen in humans. Strains of <em>Salmonella </em>spp. That producing extended-spectrum Î²-Lactamases have become a concern in medicine regarding both antimicrobial treatment and infection control program. The objective of this study was to describe the antibiotic susceptibility, ESBL production and determining the prevalence of the <em>bla</em>CTX-M-1 group among clinical isolates of Salmonella spp.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>A total of 110 <em>Salmonella </em>isolates collected from four Tehran hospitals during May 2012 and April 2013. The specific monovalan <em>Salmonella </em>antisera were used for serogrouping of <em>Salmonella </em>isolates. Antibacterial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and ESBL phenotype was confirmed by combination disk method. The <em>bla</em>CTX-M-1 group was identified by PCR with specific primers. The transferability of the <em>bla</em>CTX-1 group was tested by conjugation with broth matting method.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The prevalence of <em>Salmonella </em>serogroups consist of 56.4% serogroup D, 13.6 % serogroup C, 10 % serogroup B, and 1.8 % serogroup A and 18.2% other serogroups. Maximal resistance in <em>Salmonella </em>isolates was noticed against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (63.6%) and nalidixic-acid (47/3%). All isolates were susceptible to imipenem and ciprofloxacin. Four isolates (3.6%) showed ESBLs phenotype. All <em>Salmonella </em>spp. that produce ESBls have <em>bla</em>CTX-1 genes group. A conjugative plasmid containing <em>bla</em>CTX-1 group was found in one <em>Salmonella </em>isolate.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This study demonstrates the predominant presence of the gene encoding CTX-M-1 group among ESBLs producing of <em>Salmonella </em>spp. They can transmit to bacteria of this genus or even other genera of enteric bacteria.</p>

This paper explores a new modeling method of pharmacokinetics mathematical model. The complex human body can be regarded as a grey system based on grey system theory. The pharmacokinetics mathematical model can be established based on the blood drug concentration data, grey system theory and information re-use method. In this new method, there is no need to simplify the complex human body model for a compartment model. Therefore, the established model based on this new method could better reflect the objective reality.

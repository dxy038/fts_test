A reconstruction technique for estimating boundary conditions in natural waters from in situ radiance data is presented. The inverse problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The objective function is defined as the square Euclidean norm of the difference vector between experimental and computed data. The associated direct problem is solved by LTSN method.

This paper shows how &#8220;multiple resonance networks&#8221; of any order an with several structures can be systematically designed using standard passive filter design techniques. These networks are composed of capacitors, inductors, transformers, and a switch, and have the property of transferring completely energy initially put in one capacitor, insulated by the switch, to another capacitor in the circuit through a linear transient when the switch is closed, usually with the objective of producing very high voltages

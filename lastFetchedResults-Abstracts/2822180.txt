In the conventional phase-shift control of isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters, the phenomenon of power backflow is quite obvious. General improved phase-shift control methods can reduce the power backflow of the input. However, they do not take the power backflow of the output into consideration. In this paper, a novel phase-shift control of isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters for unidirectional power flow is proposed. It can eliminate the power backflows of both the input and the output at the same time. Furthermore, the converters in the proposed phase-shift control can achieve the zero-current switching in the whole power rang. Experimental results from a prototype verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed control method, and show superior performance.

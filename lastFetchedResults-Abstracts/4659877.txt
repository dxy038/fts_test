This paper presents a practical way to design gain-scheduled controllers for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. An existing state-space model interpolation method for LPV systems is exploited in order to derive the desired controller. The interpolation requires designing local LTI controllers for local working conditions of the system, which is performed using a multi-objective H<inf>&#8734;</inf> approach. To simplify the weighting function design, the H<inf>&#8734;</inf> objective is broken apart into different H<inf>&#8734;</inf> design objectives and constraints, each related to various input-output combinations. The developed LPV control design approach is illustrated on an over-head crane system.

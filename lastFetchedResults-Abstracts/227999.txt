A new configuration of the three-phase three-level voltage source inverter has been
presented. The proposed inverter is based on the two-level inverter. The inverter is built of one
two-level conventional inverter, an auxiliary circuit which comprises of three bidirectional
switches, and two bulk capacitor banks. A selected harmonic elimination control scheme is
employed to achieve lower harmonic contents in the inverter output waveforms. Two-level inverter
switches operate at the line power frequency (50 Hz) whereas the auxiliary circuit switches operate
at twice line power frequency (100 Hz). To validate the proposed inverter, a low power prototype
inverter has been designed and implemented; analytical, simulation and experimental results have
been provided.

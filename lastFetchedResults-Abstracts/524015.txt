Objective: Diazinon (DZN) and Hinosan, two of the most important organophosphate pesticides, are widely used for pest control in gardens and agriculture. These compounds adversely effect enzyme activation and reproductive organs. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated DZN and Hinosan impacts on the structure of testis tissue and sexual hormones in mice.
Materials and Methods: For this study, 60 male Balb/C mice were divided into the fol- lowing groups: DZN, Hinosan, control and sham. In the experimental groups, mice were injected with a single dose of DZN (30 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and Hinosan (20 mg/kg intraperitoneal), sham (corn oil) and control (no injection). Animals were sacrificed 35 days after the latest injection. Blood samples were collected and testosterone, luteinz- ing hormones (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were assayed. Testis tissues sections were provided to investigate the changes of spermatogenic and Leydig cells. Testis and seminiferous diameter were assayed with micrometer and eye piece, respectively. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: In the present study, no significant differences in testis and seminiferous di- ameter and number of blood vessels were noted. However the number of germ cells, spermatocysts, spermatids and Leydig cells on the testes of mice decreased (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the parameters of the sham group compared to the control group.
Conclusion: These results suggest that DZN and Hinosan can exert a decrease in sperm production. Therefore, application of DZN should be limited to a designed program.

This paper presents a particle swarm optimization approach for the placement of distributed generation (DG) in the distribution system. DG installation in the distribution system is very useful in reducing the line losses, as well as improving the voltage profiles. The proposed method combines particle swarm optimization and the Newton-Raphson load flow method to determine the location and size of the DG. The objective function to be minimized in this problem is the total power losses of the system. The proposed approach has been tested on IEEE 69-bus distribution test system and the program was simulated using MATLAB software. Test results show the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

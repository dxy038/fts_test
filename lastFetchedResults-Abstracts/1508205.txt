This paper deals with cracking of vegetable oils and animals fats in the presence of zeolite catalysts, the objective being preparation of liquid products similar in their properties to fossil diesel. The effects of oil/fat type on the liquid condensate yields and parameters were monitored. The tests were carried out with rapeseed, sunflower, soybean and jatropha oils as well as with used frying oils. Liquid condensates with yields of 85 to 90% relative to the input oil were obtained at temperatures of 350 to 440 °C applied for the period of 20 to 30 min in the presence of zeolite catalysts NaY and clinoptilolite. The input oil types had no significant effect on the yields and characteristics of the treated condensate. In this respect, used frying oils (UFO) as a feed material match other types of fresh oils and fats. Treated condensates blended with fossil diesel (5–7% of the condensate by volume) are compliant with the EN 590 standard and can thus be used as a component of diesel fuels.

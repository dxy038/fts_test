Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess the association between abnormal connective tissue remodeling during labor as reflected by plasma concentrations of extracellular matrix remodeling proteolytic enzymes and adverse obstetric outcomes.
Study design
A prospective observational study of 176 nulliparous women who attended the antenatal clinics at the Mercy Hospital for Women (Melbourne, Australia) from 1999 to 2000.
Results
Patients with a prolonged second stage (>120 minutes) had a significantly increased plasma concentration of matrix metalloproteinase 9 after delivery compared with control subjects (P< .001); patients in labor who underwent an emergency caesarean delivery had a significantly lower concentration (P< .001). Patients with a prolonged duration of labor (>11 hours) had a significantly lower urokinase plasminogen activator plasma concentration compared with control subjects (P< .01).
Conclusion
Altered plasma concentrations of extracellular matrix remodeling proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and urokinase plasminogen activator were found to be associated with abnormal labor and delivery outcomes. This finding may provide a useful predictor of abnormal obstetric outcomes.

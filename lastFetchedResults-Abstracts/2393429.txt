Solar radio bursts at long wavelengths provide information on solar disturbances such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and shocks at the moment of their departure from the Sun. The radio bursts also provide information on the physical properties (density, temperature and magnetic field) of the medium that supports the propagation of the disturbances with a valuable cross-check from direct imaging of the quiet outer corona. The primary objective of this paper is to review some of the past results and highlight recent results obtained from long-wavelength observations. In particular, the discussion will focus on radio phenomena occurring in the outer corona and beyond in relation to those observed in white light. Radio emission from nonthermal electrons confined to closed and open magnetic structures and in large-scale shock fronts will be discussed with particular emphasis on its relevance to solar eruptions. Solar cycle variation of the occurrence rate of shock-related radio bursts will be discussed in comparison with that of interplanetary shocks and solar proton events. Finally, case studies describing the newly-discovered radio signatures of interacting CMEs will be presented.

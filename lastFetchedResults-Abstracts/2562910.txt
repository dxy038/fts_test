Background and Objective: The concurrent effect of exercise and diet on various factors such as Irisin is raised as a new subject. The present study was done with the aim of investigating the effect of acute aerobic exercise following four different diets on Irisin serum levels in overweight men.
Subjects and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 8 overweight men (aged 23± 6.1 y and BMI 23.29 ± 0.47), who attended our physiology lab in four separate sessions at weekly intervals were the subjects of this study. In each session, after eating usual food, high carbohydrate, high-protein and high-fat, the subjects performed a treadmill test for 30 min with 60-70% of maximum heart rate. Three blood samples were taken in fasting, two hr after a meal (before exercise) and after exercise. Statistical methods: one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA with repeated measure were used to analyze data.
Results: Statistical analysis of the data showed that consuming four different types of food before exercise reduces the irisin concentration, and this reduction was significant only in high-fat diet (P?0.038). In addition, during exercise, after consumption four different diets, irisin increased significantly (high-carbohydrate P=0.049, high-protein P=0.001, high-fat P=0.003, usual food P=0.021). 
Conclusion: Despite the reduction in irisin after eating different diets, exercise following different diets can cause significant increase in serum irisin in overweight young men. However aerobic activity followed a high-protein diet, more than other diets, showed a significant increase in serum irisin.

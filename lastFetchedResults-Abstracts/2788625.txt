For OFDM channels, we propose a content-aware subcarrier allocation scheme for multiuser video transmission that maximizes user perceived quality while minimizing power consumption. The scheme utilizes utility function-based genetic algorithms to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of perceived quality and consumed power.

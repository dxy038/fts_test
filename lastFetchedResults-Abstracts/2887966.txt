Our objective is to include in stereoscopic 3D acquisition systems new technologies to automatically detect deformations on aircraft fuselages. We propose in this paper a semiregular mesh reconstruction dedicated to stereoscopic scanners, combined to a multiresolution analysis tool that detects dents on smooth surfaces. The proposed technique for reconstruction is based on a coarse-to-fine approach, and creates semiregular meshes directly from the stereoscopic images. The output of our scanner is thus a structured mesh, by the way well suited for many applications unlike most of scanners that generate only point clouds. Local distances are then calculated between this semiregular mesh and a smooth version of it, in order to automatically detect dents on the scanned surface. The smooth version is obtained via a technique based on multiresolution analysis. Experimental results show the reliability of our contributions on scanned aircraft fuselages.

In this paper we have constructed a centralized power control algorithm based on the tradeoff between the maximization of the total throughput of the users and the minimization of their total transmitted power in cellular systems. Power control algorithm for total throughput maximization has been proposed in K. Chawla et al. (1998). In our algorithm, we use the same throughput maximization objective, but another objective for power minimization has been added. The multi-objective optimization problem has been solved using weighting method. A centralized power control algorithm has been obtained. The algorithm is a scaled version of the maximum throughput algorithm obtained in K. Chawla et al. (1998). The simulations show that at low additive white noise levels the total transmitted power can be reduced up to 95% compared with the algorithm given in K. Chawla et al. (1998) while the total throughput has reduced only by less than 3%.

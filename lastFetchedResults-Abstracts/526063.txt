The main objective of this research is to identify the most propulsive industrial cluster in Tehran Province. For this purpose we have screened 111 industries in three steps. In the first step we have identified 58 industries which their location quotient is more than one. In the second step we have selected those industries which have strong links with the other sectors using input-output table and information which we have collected in our sample survey.

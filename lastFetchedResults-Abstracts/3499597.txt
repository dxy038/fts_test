Describes the development of two bidirectional digital amplifiers for use in cellular switching structures and cellular computers. An evaluation of several circuits resulted in the development of two new and different circuits, which meet the previously mentioned requirements. The circuits have been evaluated by computer simulation and one of the circuits was constructed on an integrated circuit chip to prove its practicality. The resulting circuits are different from all other bidirectional digital amplifiers. They require no clock signals for operation and noise does not cause them to latch up. This represents a significant advance in the design of bidirectional digital amplifiers and makes possible their use in areas in which they were previously considered impractical.

In large part due to the expertise of many manufacturer brands that are private label suppliers, the objective quality gap between private labels and leading manufacturer brands is small-to-none in many cases. The current research examines how consumer beliefs about the manufacturer brand origins of private labels may enhance their subjective appeal, by testing the effectiveness of two retailer-controlled tactics that create specification similarity and sourcing inferences regarding private labels, and the degree to which these inferences close perceptual gaps between private labels and targeted manufacture brands. Both the private label copycat packaging and invitation to compare to the manufacturer brand tactics are found to create such inferences and significantly narrow perceptual gaps, while enhancing retailer attitude.

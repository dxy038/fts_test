Objective
jective of this study was to test whether an automated external defibrillator (AED) training program would positively affect the mental health of family members of high-risk patients.
s
l of 305 patients with ischemic heart disease and their family members were randomized to 1 of 4 AED training programs: 2 video-based training programs and 2 face-to-face training programs that emphasized self-efficacy and perceived control. Patients and family members were surveyed at baseline and 3 and 9 months postischemic event on demographic characteristics, measures of quality of life (Short Form-36), self-efficacy, and perceived control. For this study, family members were the focus rather than the patients.
s
sion analyses showed that family members in the face-to-face training programs did not score better on any of the mental health status variables than family members who participated in the other training programs except for an increase in self-efficacy beliefs at 3 months after training.
sion
ndings suggest that a specifically designed AED training program emphasizing self-efficacy and perceived control beliefs is not likely to enhance family member mental health.

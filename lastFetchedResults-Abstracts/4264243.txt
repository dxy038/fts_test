This paper introduces a new modeling method for improved engineering processes in product modeling. The proposed modeling is intended to be implemented in current product lifecycle management (PLM) systems. It is relied upon the information content based product modeling as proposed earlier by the authors. In this modeling, human intent based engineering objective and contextual connection definitions are applied at the generation of adaptive actions in order to control parameters of engineering objects at engineering decisions. In this paper, methodical elements of information content based product modeling are introduced and discussed. Activities connecting levels of the content structure and developing human intent into decision level-by-level are explained. Following this, human intent definition based definition of engineering objectives is explained as one of the main content processes. Next, spaces are defined where intent, behavior, and decision entities are paired with engineering object entities. As key elements of the proposed modeling, decision process and consequence analysis for a change defined by an adaptive action as a result of a decision are outlined. Finally, basic issues for implementation of the proposed product modeling are discussed.

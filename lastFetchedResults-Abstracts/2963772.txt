The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and the albedo of a land surface are determined by its three-dimensional structure and by its optical properties. By investigating the relationship between BRDFs based on model inversions of observations (and the resulting albedos) and known landcover types, the ability of the MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm to capture the realistic variability of surface is explored

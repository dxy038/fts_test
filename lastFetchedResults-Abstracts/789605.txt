Due to the importance of coastal areas, is of the highest interest to implement purification systems that with minimum cost are able to assure water quality standards in agreement with the regional legislations. This work addresses the optimal design (outfall locations) and optimal operation (level of oxygen discharges) of a wastewater treatment system. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a two-objective mixed design and optimal control problem with constraints on the states and the design and control variables.

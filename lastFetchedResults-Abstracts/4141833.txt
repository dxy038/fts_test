The sparseness and decorrelation properties of the discrete wavelet transform have been exploited to develop powerful denoising methods. However, most of these methods have free parameters which have to be adjusted or estimated. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based denoising technique without any free parameters; it is, in this sense, a &#8220;universal&#8221; method. Our approach uses empirical Bayes estimation based on a Jeffreys´ noninformative prior; it is a step toward objective Bayesian wavelet-based denoising. The result is a remarkably simple fixed nonlinear shrinkage/thresholding rule which performs better than other more computationally demanding methods

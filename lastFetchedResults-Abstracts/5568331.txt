MLB (Mobility Load Balancing) is one of the use cases of SON (Self-Organizing Network) discussed in NGMN and 3GPP. The objective of MLB is to reduce the number of low throughput users and the call blocking rate, when cell loads such as radio resources are unbalanced among cells, by adjusting handover parameters. In this paper, we focus on adjusting the HO margin which is one of the handover parameters and propose a centralized solution for MLB where a central server decides optimal HO margins considering load distribution among cells. In addition, we also present simulations results to demonstrate that our proposed solution reduces the number of low throughput users compared with a distributed solution.

Objective—To present our experience of regional anaesthesia with blocks of the foramen rotundum and the oval foramen. Design—Open study. Setting—University Hospital, Beograd, Yugoslavia. Subjects-107 patients who underwent 58 maxillary and 49 mandibular nerve blocks. Interventions-Injection of 2% lignocaine with adrenaline 1/80000 with an 18 G venflon or 20 G spinal needle. Main outcome measures—Quality of anaesthesia and morbidity. Results—49 of the 58 maxillary (84%) and 45 of the 49 mandibular (92%) nerve blocks were successful (no sensitivity to pinprick in the distribution of the injected nerve and a painless operation). There were 17 complications (26%), 8 in the maxillary and 9 in the mandibular group. All complications were minor and transient, and 6 could be attributed to anhydrous glycerol rather than the injection technique itself. Conclusion—Blocks of the foramen rotundum and the oval foramen achieve good regional anaesthesia in the maxillofacial region.

A fast liner implosion program is under development at TRINTI on the &#8220;Angara-5-1&#8221; facility, a 8-module pulsed power facility with maximum power 9 TW, pulse rise time 90 ns, and peak load current 4 MA. The main program objective is directed to high intensity soft X-ray source creation for ICF and basic research. The double liner concept has been suggested as a promising way to provide a dynamic hohlraum for pellet irradiation. As a more achievable way to obtain a pulsed power generator with tens of MA current a joint team of scientists from TRINITI, the Efremov Institute, Arzamas-16, Chelyabinsk-70, IVTAN, Tomsk and the Ekaterinburg laboratories have developed the concept of the Super Angara facility, tentatively named Baikal. The design is based on using the existing infrastructure of the T-14 tokamak in TRINITI

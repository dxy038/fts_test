This study introduces a framework for re-design of manufacturing systems into practical optimum just-in-time systems by integration of computer simulation and analysis of variance. The conventional JIT approach is mostly applicable to static production systems and the dynamic production systems require a more practical integrated JIT approach. In addition, the re-design of existing dynamic systems into just-in-time systems must follow a practical path, which can be a cumbersome task. This means, a unique practical optimum just-in-time system that considers system's limitations and its dynamic behavior must be designed. To achieve the objective of this study, first, the actual system must be totally modeled and simulated. Second, the integrated simulation model is tested and validated by analysis of variance. Third, the optimum (most fitted) JIT design is developed and tested by modeling actual system's limitations and its dynamic behavior. The framework is applied and tested for an auto production line and a heavy rolling mill workshop.

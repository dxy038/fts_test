ABSTRACT
Objective: According to the ability of personality to predict the employee behavior and also the important consequences of organizational silence, this research work was conducted with the purpose of predicting organizational silence through personality types among employees of Sport and Youth Office in the province of Kerman.
Methodology: This research method was descriptive-correlation, conducted by the field study method. The statistical population was all the employees of Sport and Youth Office in Kerman, all of whom were chosen as the statistical sample (n = N = 92). The required data was gathered through the big five personality (Den Eve and Oswald, 2012) and organizational silence (Brinsfield, 2009) questionnaires, and analyzed using the multiple and multi-variate regression.
Results: Based upon the findings, most of the employees had agreeable personalities and often showed an acquiescent silence behavior. Also the statistical analysis showed that agreeableness, neuroticism, and extraversion were good predictors for organizational silence in the future.
Conclusion: With these findings, it can be concluded that if managers want their employees, and share their questions, ideas, concerns, information, and opinions about the organization, they should consider the employeesâ€™ personality as a part of the staffing process. In this regard, it is suggested that managers give employment priority to conscientiousness and openness personality types.

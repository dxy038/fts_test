<p><strong>Objective:</strong>To evaluate the impact of luteal phase support with vaginal progesterone on pregnancy rates in the intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles, stimulated with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), in sub fertile couples.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong>This prospective, randomized, double blind study was performed in a tertiary infertility center from March 2011 to January 2012. It consisted of 253 sub fertile couples undergoing ovarian stimulation for IUI cycles. They underwent ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate (100 mg) and hMG (75 IU) in preparation for the IUI cycle. Study group (n = 127) received luteal phase support in the form of vaginal progesterone (400 mg twice a day), and control group (n = 126) received placebo. Clinical pregnancy and abortion rates were assessed and compared between the two groups.<br /><strong>Results:</strong>The clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly higher for supported cycles than that for the unsupported ones (15.75% vs. 12.69%, p = 0.3). The abortion rate in the patients with progesterone luteal support compared to placebo group was not statistically different (10% vs. 18.75%, p = 0.45).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>It seems that luteal phase support with vaginal progesterone was not enhanced the success of IUI cycles outcomes, when clomiphene citrate and hMG were used for ovulation stimulation.</p>

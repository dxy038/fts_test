Summary form only given. Based on a human visual system (HVS) based approach, digital video image quality and perceptual coding (DVIQPC) outlines the principles, metrics an standards associated with perceptual coding as well as the latest techniques and applications. It discusses the latest developments in vision research as they relate to HVS based video and image coding. It discusses subjective and objective assessment methods, quantitative quality metrics including vision model based digital video impairment metrics, test criteria and procedures. It examines post-filtering and reconstruction issues associated with color bleeding, blocking, ringing and temporal fluctuation artifacts in detail along with methods to reduce/eliminate them. It also focuses on picture quality assessment criteria. It poses new challenges to vision research and/or how to transfer vision science to imaging and visual communication systems engineering. It also poses an obvious theoretical and practical challenge regarding the concept of psychovisual redundancy (also how to define this quantitatively) and to establish theoretical bound for perceptually lossless coding.

Inroduction and Objective: The use of probiotics in aquaculture reduces the level of antimicrobial compounds (especially antibiotics), improve feed efficiency, strengthens the immune system, improve blood and the bacterial flora. The effects of the bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum (KC426951) isolated from the gut of rainbow trout Guilan province on some blood safety indicators examined the rainbow trout.Material and Methods:A total of 540 fry with an average weight 3/56±2/24 g (30 per treatment) were prepared. This study in a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 3 replications for 60 days was investigated invivo.The treatment diets were: 106 (treatment 1), 107 (treatment 2), 108 (treatment 3), 109(treatment4) and 1010 (treatment5) CFU g1 of lactobacillus plantarum and control treatment (treatment 6) without supplementation with probiotics was.Results: At the end of the experimental period,hematological and immune parameters were measured. Results showed that the highest levels of hematological indices contains WBC count in treatment 4, RBC count, Hb concentration  blood , percent hematocrit , percent monocytes, percent eosinophils , MCHC in treatment 5, the MCV, MCH and percent eosinophils,in treatments 1 and  percent neutrophilin controls, respectively. Also significant differences between treatments were examined, MCHC, MCH, percentage of monocytes and eosinophils were not observed(pgt 0.05). The highest levels of Immune factors , including Total serum immunoglobulins, IgM and Lysozym owned treatment 4 and lowest values are those belonging to the control group (pConclusions:The findings suggest that the scope of application of Lactobacillus plantarum bacteria can be dose 109  1010 CFU / g food bacteria that stimulate the immune system as introduced.

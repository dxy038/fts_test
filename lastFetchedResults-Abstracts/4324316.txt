Future systems will be shaped by advanced interconnects enabled by emerging wireline communications technologies. The objective of this forum is thus to present an overview of the opportunities, challenges, and solutions associated with emerging optical as well as electrical communication technologies. The forum begins with a talk describing design considerations for integrated Power Over Ethernet. The next three presentations focus on emerging optical link technologies, beginning with a talk describing the key enablers for next generation optical access systems. The next talk highlights the design and impact on future networks of coherent optical transceivers, followed by a presentation describing the integration of silicon-photonic devices into state-of-the-art CMOS technologies with minimal process changes. The next two talks focus on advanced electrical links, including an exploration of power-efficient equalization as well as an examiation of multiple modulation formats (NRZ and PAM4) for new 100Gbps backplane standards. The final two talks of the forum highlight the bandwidth density opportunities offered by 2.5/3D integration technologies, describing how wireline circuit techniques enable substantial performance improvements in both inductively coupled as well as TSV-based through- and a cross-chip interfaces.

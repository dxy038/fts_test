A novel grey situation decision making model is proposed for making multi-criteria and multi-countermeasure decisions. Traditional grey situation decision making model can only deal with decision information which is expressed by real numbers. This paper presents a new grey situation decision making model in which the decision matrix is composed by grey numbers. An optimization method is employed for solving the objective weights in the model based on grey entropy analysis and optimization theory. Afterwards, this paper ranks the situation of each event by using possibility of grey numbers for the final decision making. The results show that the new model can realistically reflect and deal with the uncertain information in the process of decision making. The effectiveness of the new model is demonstrated by an actual case study.

The objective of the authors is to develop an analytical model to evaluate the throughput and packet delay, in the presence of nonuniform traffic, in a MIN having multiple buffers at the output of the switching elements. The model is based on Markov chains, and uses several simplifying assumptions to make the model tractable. The validity of the model has been verified by comparison of the results with those obtained from simulations

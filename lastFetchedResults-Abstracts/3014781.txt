As the World Wide Web gains influence in teaching and learning, the role of teachers shifts from didactic to facilitative. This new role emphasizes the use of Web materials as a cognitive tool as well as learning resources, which necessitates skills to search, evaluate, and select suitable contents for educational needs out of a vast reservoir of information of the Web. To address this issue a Web-based project was developed to train participants to search and evaluate Web-based educational resources. Participants were asked to report the result of evaluating online materials and to consider how online resources can be integrated into classroom-based education. The main objective of the project was to promote the awareness of online resources and their educational values through a systematic training procedure. The paper shows that the project improved the participantsÂ´ awareness of educational Web sites and the significance of their utilization in the classroom.

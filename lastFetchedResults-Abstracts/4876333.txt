A number of communication applications are moving to digitally motivated architectures for their radio frequency module. This includes GSM-EDGE, WLAN, Bluetooth, GSM-GPRS, WiMAX. The All Digital PLL(ADPLL) forms the core of this architecture. The objective of the ADPLL is to generate a clean carrier frequency f<sub>c</sub>, based on a input reference frequency f<sub>ref</sub>. As part of the phase error measurement of the PLL, a Time to Digital converter(TDC) is used to measure the delay between f<sub>ref</sub> clock edge and carrier clocking edge. An inverter chain is used to measure this delay as a integer number of basic inverter delay. This measurement error is termed TDC quantization error and effects the phase noise present in the final carrier. Due to the coarse delay of the basic inverter available, TDC introduces large quantization noise at the output of the PLL. This is too high for systems operating at high carrier frequencies or systems which have a tight phase noise requirement. This paper presents techniques to improve TDC quantization noise.

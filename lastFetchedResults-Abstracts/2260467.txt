Shell and tube heat exchanger, singular baffles have been stimulated by means of the computational fluid dynamic technique and Fluent software. Several elliptical cross sections for the tubes are examined. So each model drawn by using Gambit software. In stimulating, 3D meshes is used for irregular Couper and tetrahedral networks. Also the performance of each of two shell and tube exchanger is compared with, one of the optimized set of elliptical tubes, and the other with circular tubes according to heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. The results accuracy is compared with Bellâ€™s theory plus using an engineering equation solver software. The main objective at this stage is finding the best geometry for elliptical tubes used in the shell and tube exchangers as a new idea among the heat exchangers for future use. The results indicate the increase in the heat transfer rate to 59.9 percent, and the rise in pressure to 9.5 percent which is negligible in comparison with a boost in heat transfer.

This paper presents a new method of localization and segmentation of colelithiasis crystals. This disease is characterized by crystals which are composed by irregular substances in the bile that appear in the gallbladder and can cause pain to the individual. Since the actual evaluation is done by radiologists and lacks precise, objective and quantitative assert, we present an algorithm which locates and segments the crystals using RunningHills algorithm, giving a quantitative approach to the diagnostic of this disease.

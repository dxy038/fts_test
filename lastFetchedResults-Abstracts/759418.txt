Evidence both from psychological research and
clinical intervention studies suggests that there are bidirectional
influences between overt child behavior problems
and parent–child relations. Very little research however, has
considered the pattern of relations that exists between
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the
parent–child relationship within a longitudinal context.
Using a longitudinal community sample from the United
Kingdom which included 194 school aged children (46%
male and 54% female) and both parents, this study examined
the relationship between child ADHD symptoms and displays
of rejection in the parent–child relationship. These
relationships were investigated separately for mothers and
fathers using cross-lagged panel correlation and reciprocal
effects analysis. Mothers and fathers reported on ADHD
symptoms and children reported on their feelings of rejection
in the mother–child and father–child relationships. Results
suggested differences in the direction of effects linking
mother– and father–child rejection and child ADHD symptoms;
with ADHD symptoms affecting the mother–child
relationship and the converse pattern of effects noted for
fathers. Implications for future research focusing on the link
between ADHD symptoms and parent–child relationships
are discussed.

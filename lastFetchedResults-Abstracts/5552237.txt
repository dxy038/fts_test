The primary objective of this study is to propose an interval type-2 controller design method for a class of nonlinear singular networked control systems encountering data-transmission delay and packet loss problems. This study assesses the stability analysis and design of the system controllers. First, the singular networked control systems are modeled as interval type-2 T-S fuzzy systems. The concept of parallel distributed compensation is then employed to design corresponding interval type-2 T-S fuzzy controllers. For system stability analysis, the stability conditions are identified using a specific Lyapunov function. The linear matrix inequalities are thus derived from the stability conditions. Furthermore, the controller gain matrices can be obtained by solving a set of appropriate linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is used to conduct simulations and analysis. The simulation results verify the correctness of stability analysis. The performance of the proposed type-2 fuzzy controller is superior to the traditional fuzzy controller.

Background and Objective: Breast cancer is a genetic and chronic inflammatory disease with an increasing incidence among Iranian women. Researchers have shown that regular exercise is presumed to have prophylactic effect and adjuvant therapy in inhibition of tumor growth. So the aim of this study was to assess the effect of endurance training on serum TNF-? in breast cancer bearing mice. 
Materials and Methods: Forty female Balb/C mice were used in this study. 20 mice performed continuous endurance exercises for 8 weeks, and then breast cancer cells were injected to all Balb/C mice. Following this, one group of each of the trained and non-trained mice performed endurance exercises 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Thus, this research contained 4 groups: Exercise-Tumor-Exercise (ETE), Exercise-Tumor-Rest (ETR), Rest-Tumor-Exercise (RTE) and Rest-Tumor-Rest (RTR) groups. Tumor volume was measured by a digital caliper weekly. Consequently, the mice were sacrificed; blood samples were taken and serum cytokine level was measured and quantified using ELISA.
Results: There was a significant difference in the level of TNF-? in the groups performing endurance exercises after malignancy (RTE and ETE) and groups not performing such exercises (ETR and RTR) pointing out an association with tumor growth rate. In the meantime, there was a strong correlation between levels of TNF-? and tumor growth rate.
Conclusion: Endurance training reduces level of serum TNF-? and tumor growth rate and decreases level of inflammation markers. Thus, regular exercises as adjuvant therapy have beneficial effects on estrogen related breast cancer treatment.

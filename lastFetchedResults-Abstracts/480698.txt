Potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) can usually be considered as an important criterion of labile nitrogen. Measurement of PMN is expensive and time consuming, therefore, a simpler alternation may facilitate routine laboratory analysis. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between PMN and biological index of nitrogen availability (BINA). The studied soil was previously treated with 0, 25 and 100 ton ha-1 of sewage sludge with 0, 1, 2 and 3 consecutive years of application. Soil samples were taken 6 months after the latest application from depth of 15 cm. PMN measured according to Stanford and Smith procedure (aerobic incubation for 22 weeks and leaching with intervals of every two weeks) and BINA measured as described by Bundy and Meisinger (7 days of anaerobic incubation at 40? C followed by extraction of NH4+). Results showed that PMN was significantly correlated with BINA (r=0.938, P < 0.001) in cow manure treated plots which can be considered as a more reliable index for estimation of PMN. Our findings showed that BINA could be considered as a simple rapid method to evaluate PMN in cow manure treatment of calcareous soils.

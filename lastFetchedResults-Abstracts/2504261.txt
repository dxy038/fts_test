Background: The value of serial measurement of serum B subunit of human chorionic
gonadotropin (BHCG) and ultrasonography in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy
has well established.
Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the diagnostic value of raising
level of serum BHCG, single measurement of progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) in
early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
Materials and Methods: Serum levels of BHCG and estradiol were measured by Radio
Immuno Sorbent Assay (RIA) and progesterone level was measured by Enzyme Linked
Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) techniques in 43 symptomatic women with ectopic
pregnancy and 42 women with normal intrauterine pregnancy in Alzahra Hospital,
Tabriz, Iran. These values were compared by T-test. By determining cut-off levels of
these parameters the efficiency and sensitivity of them in prediction of ectopic
pregnancy was estimated.
Results: The mean serum levels of BHCG, estradiol and progesterone in patients with
ectopic pregnancies (940 ± 552 mlu/ml, 593 ± 237 pg/ml, 5.83 ± 3.41 ng/ml,
respectively) were significantly lower than these levels in normal intrauterine
pregnancies (4620 ± 2030 mlu/ml, 1627 ± 435 pg/ml, 24.8 ± 6.08 ng/ml, respectively).
The average rate of BHCG rising was 8.2% for 24 hours in patients with ectopic
pregnancy (EP) and 32.8% in normal intrauterine pregnancies (NIUP).
Conclusions In this study single measurement of serum progesterone level has the
greatest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98%) in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

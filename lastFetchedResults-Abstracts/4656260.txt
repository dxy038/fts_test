The objective of the proposed panel discussion to be organized by IEEE JC Women in Engineering Affinity group in cooperation with TENCON 2010, R10 WIE and Career Center for Women Researchers, Kyushu University is to discuss and exchange information related to the status of women in their career development, particularly in scientific and technical fields, in Asian countries. Four panelists from different countries of IEEE region 10 are invited to talk on their own career development and the general situation of female researchers in the field of science and technology in their respective countries. Though the participation of women in the undergraduate studies in colleges and universities has increased in recent days, the number of women engaged in higher studies and professional activities in the field of science and technology is still quite poor. IEEE Women in Engineering is the largest professional organization dedicated to promoting womenÂ´s career in technical fields. The discussion is aimed at representing the present status, problems, needs and various measures taken in various countries to promote the women to involve actively in their career development. The participants are encouraged to actively join in the discussion, share their experiences, express their opinion about specific problems and also voice their suggestions and ideas for improvement. It is highly expected that this panel discussion through the exchange of opinions and the success stories from different backgrounds will be able to generate momentum to inspire, encourage and nurture the future generation of women leaders, researchers, scientists and engineers in Japan as well as in other places.

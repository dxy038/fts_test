In modern day construction practice, repair and rehabilitation of structures has taken a
prominent role. Mortar plays a vital part in these works. As such, the flowability of mortar
can be an added advantage when inaccessibility comes into picture like in case of congested
reinforcement or narrow cracks or fissures. Due to the application easiness and mechanical
advantages, Self Compacting Mortar is preferred for repair purposes especially in reinforced
concrete structures these days. The cement as well as the ingredients of the paste, mineral
admixtures (pozzolanic or inert nature) and plasticizing chemical admixtures should be
carefully chosen in order to obtain a suitable paste composition to enrich the granular
composition of the mix. There is no universally accepted agreement on the effect of these
factors due to the complexity of combined action; thus, it is hard to make a generalization.
The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of fiber and mesh in Self Compacting
Mortar from the viewpoint of fresh state behaviour and mechanical performance. For this
purpose two fibers (Polypropylene and Glass fiber) and two types of mesh (Chicken mesh
and G.I. wire mesh) were used. The results of 54 panels, 54 cubes and 54 cylinders for
flexure, compressive strength and split tensile strength are presented.

Objective
This study aims to identify the symptoms, signs and distributions which are associated with neurophysiological carpal tunnel syndrome (N-CTS), defined by the finding of a median nerve lesion at the wrist through neurophysiologic studies, and to compare them with those of patients with sensory or motor complaints in the upper limbs whose electrophysiologic investigation did not show evidence of this syndrome.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed, with prospective gathering of data, following a predetermined protocol. We included all patients older than 12 years who were referred for nerve conduction studies and electromyography of at least one of the upper limbs between August 2001 and January 2003. The patients answered a clinicoepidemiologic questionnaire and painted the areas in which they felt pain and those in which they felt paresthesia, and were also examined to test for classical signs CTS.
Results
A neurophysiological diagnosis of CTS was reached in 1549 upper limbs (39%). Approximately 6% of the upper limbs with N-CTS and 16% of those without median nerve lesion do not have any hand or wrist symptoms (P<0.001). Paresthesia, pain, hand weakness and cramps were the symptoms statistically associated to N-CTS, with paresthesia being the one with the greatest power of association. This is usually felt in median innervation's territory, and is frequently extended to the whole hand, but without association with N-CTS when felt in proximal region.
Conclusions
One concludes that the most characteristic manifestation of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is paresthesia. Pain also occurs very frequently but it is less specific, and weakness, meanwhile, seems to have a low frequency. We believe that the variability in the clinical presentation of CTS is largely due to the presence of associated diseases and our results provide information which could help to better define the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of this syndrome

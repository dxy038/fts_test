Summary form only given. We have proposed a novel receiver for dual-wavelength detection having an embedded fiber circuit with surface-mounted photodiodes (PDs). Using this technique, it is possible to make an in-line receiver device connected to a transmitting laser diode (LD) module, because the primary transmission media, the fiber, remains intact through the receiver module. We demonstrate a unique in-line receiver module connected to a transmitting laser diode for bidirectional wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) transmission systems. Two signal wavelengths can be detected in a single receiver module, with separate PDs, one for 1.55 /spl mu/m detection and another for 1.3 /spl mu/m detection, surface mounted on the substrate, which has an embedded single-mode fiber. Furthermore, with the in-line configuration, bidirectional transmission can be achieved, with the end of the fiber spliced to a 1.3 /spl mu/m laser diode module. We report on the performance of this receiver for incoming WDM signals and outgoing 1.3 /spl mu/m light. The receiver has very low crosstalk with low loss for the incoming 1.55 /spl mu/m and 1.3 /spl mu/m signals and the outgoing 1.3 /spl mu/m light.

Based on the step test, the nonlinear separation model of working fluid dryness and pressure difference between turbine inlet and outlet for hot spring thermal energy conversion (STEC) plant has been identified. Using the nonlinear separation control method, a solution for STEC diffuser multi-objective control has been proposed. The application results have verified its feasibility and effectiveness.

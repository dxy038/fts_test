Managers of enterprises concern with a major challenge for optimal management of human resources based on availability of domain experts and highly qualified personnel. The process of allocating right people to the right positions in a right time is a key to success. To achieve this goal, managers need to deploy evaluation tools integrated with the gap analysis method. This paper presents the concept and implementation details of an in-house developed software tool for competence evaluation of domain specific competencies and selection of professionals. A generic mathematical representation of competences in this project makes the software tool applied in a wide variety of organizations. A standard competence model has been first defined in this project with 5 main competence categories and related sub-categories including over 70 competence questionnaires in different managerial and employee levels. Test and evaluation of the software have been carried out by initializing the lab data of over 50 candidates with student groups involved in the project at the institute of Knowledge Based Systems and Knowledge Management, University of Siegen. The paper reflects the conception and the outcomes of the implementation of the software tool. The ultimate objective of this interdisciplinary project is to fill the gap in the selection process by means of an efficient and practical competency evaluation tool. The generic software tool is aimed to be used as a component in research and industrial projects of the institute.

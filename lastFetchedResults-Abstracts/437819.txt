Background.
Infection of previous collapse therapy spaces may raise challenging problems. This study evaluated a conservative surgical approach based on decortication.
Methods.

Since 1979, 28 patients (mean age, 60 ± 6 years) have presented at an average of 37 ± 7 years after artificial pneumothorax for tuberculosis. Diagnosis of empyema was made on follow-up in 12 patients and on symptoms in 16 patients. Mean vital capacity was 66% ± 16% of normal. Microorganisms were isolated in 13 patients (Aspergillus fumigatus in 5, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 4, anaerobes in 4). Decortication was made in 24 patients, associated with thoracoplasty in 4, and with partial lung resection in 2 patients. Thoracoplasty alone was performed in 2 patients, and 2 patients underwent an extrapleural pneumonectomy.
Results.

Both extrapleural pneumonectomies were complicated with empyema requiring thoracoplasty, resulting in one postoperative death. Operative mortality after decortication was nil. Mean intraoperative blood loss during decortication was 1,830 ± 1,310 mL. All patients were extubated within 24 hours, except 1 patient who was ventilator-dependent preoperatively. Prolonged air leaks were common (mean duration of drainage, 16 ± 11 days), but ultimately sealed. Existence of symptoms was predictive of prolonged air leaks (p < 0.01).
Conclusions.

We conclude that decortication may provide a one-stage cure avoiding the hazards of extrapleural pneumonectomy; the nonfunctioning remaining lung may resolve the space problem.

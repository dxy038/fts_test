This paper describes the application of computer simulation to a new and interesting problem area, the management of major theme parks. The operation and management of theme parks is becoming continually more difficult and competitive. The level of customer expectation for excitement and quality of experience is increasing at a much greater rate than the publicÂ´s willingness to accept admission price increases. As a consequence, theme park management is asked to deliver more services, at a faster pace and with higher quality, with fewer and fewer seasonal employees. VMASC has begun to work with two local theme parks, Water Country USA located in Williamsburg, Virginia and operated by Anheuser-Busch, and Kings Dominion located in Richmond, Virginia and operated by Paramount Parks. The objective is to identify management issues and operational problems where simulation may serve as an important tool to assist in the decision-making process

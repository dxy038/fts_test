The objective of this study is determination of the effect of mechanical heterogeneity on ductile crack initiation and propagation in weldments using micromechanical approach. Welded single-edge notched bend (SENB) specimens were experimentally and numerically analysed. Material properties of welded joint zones were estimated using a combined experimental and numerical procedure; strains on a smooth tensile specimen were determined using ARAMIS stereometric measuring system in order to obtain true stress – true strain curves. High-strength low-alloyed steel was used as base metal, in quenched and tempered condition. J–R curves and crack growth initiation values of fracture mechanics parameter were experimentally and numerically obtained for specimens with a pre-crack in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal (WM). The complete Gurson model (CGM) was used in prediction of J–R curves and crack growth initiation. It is shown that the resistance to crack initiation and growth can be predicted using micromechanical analysis, and that the results are significantly affected by mechanical heterogeneity of the weldment.

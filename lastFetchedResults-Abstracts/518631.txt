On December 27, 2008, Zionist regime's assault on Gaze strip was launched. It lasted 22 days,over 7000 Palestinians were injured or martyred.

The objective of the article at hand is to observe the intents and aftermaths of the 22 -day assault on Gaze, and secondly to observe the domestic, regional, and international impacts and consequences of this war. Possible hypotheses in the filed are:

1. The hypothesis concerning the intents

Obliteration of Hamas and occupation of Gaze is one of the major aims of the Zionist Regime in the 22 -day war on Gaze.

2. The hypothesis concerning the aftermaths

The 22 -day assault demonstrated the Zionist regime's impotence in oppressing Palestine's resistance and led to world-wide recognition of Palestinians as the innocent and summoned public opinion against the Zionist regime.

The approach to this paper is descriptive-analytical, that is, we first refer to different aspects of the 22 -day war through a descriptive approach and what follows is an analytical survey over the intents and aftermaths of the war.What is concluded in this research overall covers the fact that Palestinian Islamic resistance proved the potency to stand firm against the Zionist regime throughout 22 days of assault and siege by water and land, where on the other hand, the Zionist regime couldn't accomplish any of their planned targets in the war on Gaze, and that is truly Palestinians' greatest achievement. Thus, what went on at Gaza strip is to be identified as an honorable historical victory for Palestinian Islamic resistance.

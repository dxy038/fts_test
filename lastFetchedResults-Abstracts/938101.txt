Previous studies have indicated that an effective control technique for heavy metal emissions from incinerators is
to use solid sorbents to capture metals by physical deposition and chemical adsorption. However, the adsorbed heavy
metals on the retired sorbents could possibly cause secondary pollution if they are inadequately treated. The main
objective of this study is to increase the stability of four heavy metals ŽCu, Pb, Cr and Cd. on retired sorbents by heat
treatment. The stability was based on the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure ŽTCLP. tests. The parameters
evaluated included: Ž1. different temperatures Ž900, 1100 and 1300 C.; and Ž2. various heating times Ž20, 40 and 60
min.. The results indicated that most of the leaching rates decreased with increasing temperature for the four toxic
heavy metals. The heat treatment time did not regularly influence the stability of heavy metals, and affected it
slightly when the temperature was controlled at 1300 C.

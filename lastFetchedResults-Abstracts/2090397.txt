Background and purpose: Equity in access to health care has become a desirable policy objective.
Therefore, accessibility to health care should be provided based on health needs rather than socio-
demographic variables. This will lead to a better utilization of health care and improvement of equity
in health. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of family socio-economic status as an
indication of individualâ€™s socio-economic status on the utilization of their health care.
Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Ghaemshahr County, Iran
in early 2013. In this household survey, 807 individuals were randomly approached at their home.
A self-designed questionnaire was applied. The parent or every individual above 18 years were
asked to fill the questionnaire for themselves and other member of their family. Using SPSS
software analyses were performed with employing correlation coefficient, Chi-square and t-test.
Results: About 47.9% and 52.1% of respondents were living at urban and rural area
respectively. Respondents were from a quite different socio-economic and demographic
background. Utilization of health care had only significant association with the location of
respondents. Underutilization of health care has proportionately more evident in a rural area
compared with the urban area.
Conclusion: Accessibility to and utilization of health care was lower in a rural area. There is a
concern of inequity in health at rural area and is going to be expanded. Appropriate policy and
intervention are required to improve the situation.

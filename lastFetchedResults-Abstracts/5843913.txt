In this paper, we present a low-complexity power allocation scheme for non-regenerative (amplify and forward) relaying in cognitive radio systems. The main objective of the power allocation is to maximize the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the destination under the constraint of acceptable interference to the primary users (PU). In this paper, we propose an iterative power allocation using SNR upper Bound (IPAUB) for non-regenerative relaying. The proposed algorithm has low computational complexity, and we verify its effectiveness through simulation results.

Objective
Massage therapy is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative
medicine therapies for children. This study was conducted to determine the
effect of Swedish massage on the muscle tonicity of children with spastic
cerebral palsy (CP).
Materials & Methods
This study was a single blind clinical trial conducted on forty children with spastic
CP, recruited from clinics of the University of Social Welfare & Rehabilitation
Sciences. They were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups.
Routine occupational therapy techniques were performed during a 3 monthperiod
in both groups, while the intervention group also received Swedish
massage for 30 minutes before every rehabilitation session. Muscle tonicity was
evaluated at the beginning of the study and 3 months later using the Modified
Ashworth Scale.
Results
The average ages of children in the intervention (n=13) and control (n=14)
groups were 49.5 and 42.1 months respectively. Although after intervention,
tonicity of upper and lower limbs, trunk and neck in the intervention group in
comparison with controls had no significant differences, there were statistically
significant differences in reduction rate of tonicity in upper limbs and trunk
between the two groups (P  < 0.05).
Conclusion
Massage therapy is not a panacea for improvement of spasticity in children with
CP but the encouraging results of other studies on children with CP indicate
that further studies are needed for more definite results.

An effective method of peak depth correction based on the Hausdorff distance is put forward in this paper. The automatic identification of logging curve peak made up the blank of automated processing of logging curve peak depth correction. In this method, the reasonable peak is selected by using the extremum and variable sequence analysis method, and the position of similar curve segment is selected according to the bidirectional Hausdorff distance, then the best matching peak is defined through computing the unidirectional Hausdorff distance. Finally, the peak depth correction of logging curves is computed. The experimental results demonstrate that the method of peak depth correction has better speed and high accuracy, and it provides reliable and accurate data for petroleum reservoir development.

Use of chemical materials in the vase solution is one of the ways of increase the vase life of cut-flower. The objective of paper is to review the most present usable chemical materials in the researches. Sugars are effective on the vase life by providing primary material for respiration, closing the stomata with increasing the osmotic concentration in flowers and leaves, prevention of ethylene production and decreasing the sensitivity of cut-flower to ethylene. Citric acid increases cut-flower longevity by reduction of vase solution pH and the control of microbial activity. 8-hydroxy quinoline citrate and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate can delay the bacteria-induced xylem blockage with their anti microbial characteristics. For that reason the vase life of cut-flower is increased. Silver nitrate is a powerful anti bacterial and silver thiosulfate is a very powerful inhibitor of ethylene activity. Therefore, They can increase the longevity in cut-flowers. Ethanol and acetaldehyde can increase the long my of cut-flowers, by destruction of ovary as a carbohydrate sink. Use of other chemical materials such as Ammonium sulfate, benzyl adenine, gibberellic acid, and their effect on longevity of cut-flowers will be studied.

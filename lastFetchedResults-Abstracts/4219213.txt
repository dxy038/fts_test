Spline interpolation systems generally contain non-causal filters, and hence it is difficult to use such systems for real-time processing. Our objective is to design a causal system which approximates spline interpolation. This is formulated as a problem of designing a stable inverse of a system with unstable zeros. For this purpose, we adopt H <sup>alpha</sup> optimization. The H<sup>alpha</sup>-optimal inverse system can be effectively solved by standard MATLAB routines, and hence causal spline interpolation is obtained. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the result

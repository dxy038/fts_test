Distributed video coding (DVC), a new video compression paradigm is evolving for catering to emerging applications and services such as wireless video surveillance networks, wireless video sensor networks and wireless mobile video. The primary objective of DVC is to achieve low complex encoder even at the expense of relatively high complex decoder. In the literature most of the research work carried out in DVC so far is for mono-view video, only for handling luma component and with assumption of existence of a feedback channel. In this paper mono-view DVC has been extended to handle multi-view coding, including both luma and chroma components. The multi-view DVC methods have been proposed and Rate Distortion (RD) performance results of `CÂ´ model developed are presented.

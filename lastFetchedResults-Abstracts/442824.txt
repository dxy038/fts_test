This analysis was conducted in a single-surgeon clinical practice to evaluate the utility and practicality of performing ductal lavage in a population determined to be at high risk for breast cancer.
Methods

One hundred twenty patients with negative mammograms and/or negative breast examinations had nipple aspiration and ductal lavage performed by a single surgeon. All were at high risk either according to Gail risk score, a previous breast carcinoma, or nipple discharge.
Results

One hundred twenty patients underwent nipple aspiration. Thirty-two did not undergo lavage: 29 had no fluid, and 3 had unsuccessful cannulation. Eighty-eight underwent lavage: 15 had insufficient epithelial content, 51 had benign cytology, and 22 had abnormal cells. Of the 22, 20 had mild atypia, 1 had marked atypia, and 1 had malignant cells.
Conclusions

Ductal lavage can be done in a surgical practice and can stratify risk for the individual patient. This is important to both patient and surgeon in formulating a treatment plan based on objective cytologic criteria.

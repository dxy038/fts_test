In the present work, the Selective Harmonic Elimination Pulse width Modulation SHE-PWM is used to improve the output voltage quality of the AC/AC choppers. To achieve the requirement of the SHE-PWM such as a desired fundamental magnitude and the elimination of the low order harmonics contained in the output voltage, two heuristic and evolutionary algorithms were used. The problem of the SHEPWM is presented by a constrained nonlinear objective function which has to be minimized. The main aim is the calculation of the switching angles vector solution presenting the best minimal value for the objective function. The results obtained with the present application show the effectiveness of the use of the Particle Swarm Optimization. On the other side, the application of the PSO with SHE-PWM is a promising solution which can make a great improvement with different power electronics converters.

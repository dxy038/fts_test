A very small reflector has been designed, built and tested for C-band radiometric use. The objective was to provide maximum gain and minimum spillover for an aperture diameter of 330 mm which is 5.5 wavelengths at 4.97 GHz. It also required two orthogonally polarised coaxial outputs with an isolation better than 20.0 dB (preferably 30 dB) over the required bandwidth of 1%. Minimum mass and cost were also required.

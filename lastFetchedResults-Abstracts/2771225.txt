In this letter, a novel transmit-receive antenna pair selection (TRAPS) scheme is proposed for bidirectional full-duplex (FD) communications between two nodes, where each node is equipped with two antennas, used for either transmission or reception. Specifically, one transmit and receive antenna combination is selected based on two system performance criteria: 1) maximum sum-rate (Max-SR), and 2) minimum symbol-error-rate (Min-SER). For the Max-SR approach, we obtain a sum-rate upper bound. And for the Min-SER, a SER lower bound is derived, by introducing a simple near-optimal Min-Max criterion. Finally, we compare the proposed TRAPS approaches with the traditional FD communication system in terms of average sum-rate and SER, respectively. Simulation results verify our analysis, and show a significant performance improvement.

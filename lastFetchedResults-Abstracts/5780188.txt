Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is widely used control technique that varies the electrical operating point to extract maximum power available from the solar cell of photovoltaic (PV) module. Since the solar cells have nonlinear i-v characteristics, the efficiency of PV module is very low and power output depends on solar insolation level and ambient temperature. Moreover there is a great loss of power due to mismatch of source and load. So, to extract maximum power from solar panel a MPPT needs to be designed and the objective of the paper is about a novel cost effective and efficient microcontroller based MPPT system for solar voltaic system to ensure fast maximum power point operation at all fast changing environmental conditions. The proposed controller scheme utilizes PWM techniques to regulate the output power of boost converter at its maximum possible value and simultaneously controls the charging process of battery. Parameter extraction, model evaluation and analysis of boost converter is demonstrated using MATLAB/Simulink model.

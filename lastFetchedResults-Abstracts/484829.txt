Background and Objective: Arsenic (As) is a highly toxic metalloid found in ground and surface waters.
Arsenic contamination in drinking water leads to harmful effects on human health. In this study, the efficacy
of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane technology was evaluated for arsenic removal from drinking water.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was carried out on RO membrane spiral- wound module
(model: 2521 TE, CSM Co. Korea) in pilot scale. After preparation of sodium arsenate solution in the
laboratory, performance of RO membrane system in arsenic (As) removal was investigated. Experiments
were conducted with five different pressures (100, 130, 160, 190, 210 Psi), pH (4, 5.5, 7, 8.5, 10),
temperature (20, 25, 30, 35, 40Â°C) and an initial As concentration of 0.2 mg/L. The influence of different
feed concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mg/L) on As removal efficiency was also examined. In each step, flux
was measured and after 30 minutes samples were taken. Arsenic amount in feed and permeate were
measured by silver diethyldithiocarbamate (AgDDTC) method.
Results: The results of this study demonstrated that greater than 900/0 of As can be eliminated from drinking
water. Also the results showed that the pressure of 190 psi, As concentration of 0.2-0.5mg/L, temperature of
25-30oC and pH = 6-8 were the optimal conditions.
Conclusion: Arsenic removal efficiency in optimal conditions of system performance was up to 99%.

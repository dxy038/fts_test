Advancement of electronic technology has led to increase heat dissipation of the component, especially in Central Processing Unit (CPU). This problem occurs when the component has scaled down to increase the power density and the speed of data processing. This heat dissipation has increased the temperature of the device, which can reduce the reliability and the lifespan of the component. Currently, conventional air cooling technology such as fan and heat sink are used to minimize the temperature. This method is preferable because it is easy to be made and cost effective. However, a high performance heat sink is not easy to manufacture. Therefore, this paper proposes a new dimension of radial plate fin heat sink. The objective is to find the optimal design that could maximize the heat dissipation and minimize the size of heat sink on central processing unit electronic package. Based on the heat sink application reviews, thickness and the length of fins are considered for optimization. Model development of heat sink and multi objective using particle swarm optimization are explored for searching the optimal dimensions for radial plate fin heat sink design. Results and comparison of heat sink model and optimum values of the fitness functions for the radial heat sink are presented which show an increment of heat dissipation and reduction area.

The first discovery of a coelacanth off the coast of South Africa in 1938 created a scientific furore and excited both the national and international scientific communities. The second discovery off the east coast of South Africa in 2000 invoked more excitement amongst the scientific community worldwide. The Coelacanth Programme is a flagship scientific endeavour for the southern and east African region aimed at developing excellence in science and using the excitement of ships, submarines and underwater exploration to encourage youth to enter the sciences. In Africa, entry into science and retention of scientists is poor, hence this need to use the multidisciplinary programme to inspire the youth. Indeed, several governments in the region are promoting science. The environmental education programme, together with the public awareness programme, is taking science to the people to: promote ocean exploration as possible career choices; collaborate with governmental educational programmes and produce educational resources that are in line with the national curriculum in each country; provide opportunities for educators to build their knowledge base with regard to the marine and coastal environments, extending them to ocean exploration and; develop opportunities for the involvement of the youth in the programme, with the objective to share and disseminate the excitement and information. This paper describes the planning and processes that have taken place during the development of the programme, how they have been implemented and received by the education community. It also evaluates the process to ensure that a product of high quality is being produced and maintained. The paper also highlights the importance of including the people in scientific programmes through the medium of education. It also indicates the future objectives of the Programme, having learnt from this process.

The Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Team (SCAT) process is a tool to assess oiled shorelines and is now an integral component of spill response operations. The key element of a SCAT survey is a systematic documentation using standard terms and definitions of the shoreline in the areas affected by an oil spill. SCAT programs were initially established to provide objective and accurate shoreline oiling information directly to cleanup operations. The role of the SCAT program has since expanded and the information generated by the field teams is used now by planners and decision-makers and to develop shoreline treatment recommendations, to select appropriate treatment techniques, and to establish the level or degree of treatment that is appropriate. This latter point is an integral part of establishing shoreline treatment criteria or standards and treatment end points

Protein folding estimation attracts a large attention in the area of computational biology, due to its benefits on medical research and the challenge of NP-hard objective functions. In order to simulate the protein folding procedure and estimate the structure of the protein after folding, this paper adopts a Paired-Bacteria Optimizer (PBO), which is a biologically-inspired optimization algorithm. Compared with most Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), the computational complexity of PBO is much less. Therefore, it is suitable to be applied to solve NP-hard problem. The experimental studies is performed on several benchmark lattice protein combination. The experimental results demonstrated that PBO is able to estimate the folded protein structure with a superior convergence.

The convergence of previously distinct networks into an All-IP network has resulted in an increase in the number and diversity of devices, channels and communication networks available to users. This has increased the number communication options available and is evidenced by the number of different communication devices owned and services subscribed to. How-ever, this has created complexities that call for proper methods to manage these diverse and incompatible communication options. The objective of Unified Communication (UC) is to seamlessly integrate the disparate communication channels into a device independent platform that can easily be managed by users. Due its focus on a largely urban and highly connected market, UC has not benefited marginalized communities. This paper discusses the design and implementation of Unicorn, a UC solution for a middleware software platform called Teleweaver which was designed to support the development of services for marginalized communities. The solution integrates services from a telecommunication container called Mobicents. It seamlessly amalgamates voice, data and video onto one device independent unified platform easily accessible by users.

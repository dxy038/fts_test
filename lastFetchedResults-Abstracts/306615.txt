Objective: This article reviews situations in which we should be alert to the risk of trace element deficiencies, and the difficulties of assessing trace element status, as illustrated by states of potential subclinical deficiency of zinc and selenium in infants.
Conclusion: Deficiency states of many trace elements have been documented in infants, and there is probably an underdiagnosed group of infants with subclinical deficiency, from which however the great majority are protected by effective regulatory systems. Specific, sensitive, and reliable methods are needed for the detection of trace element imbalances.

Through deeply analysis of INVITE flooding attack of SIP based VoIP system, a novel VoIP flooding detection scheme called CDVFD (Call Duration based VoIP Flooding Detection) is presented. The CDVFD method makes use of SIP signaling bidirectional interaction, and it can make fast detection using Chi-square value, and can distinguish from normal high VoIP traffic. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the method.

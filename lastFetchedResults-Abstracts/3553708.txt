The paper presents a new method for designing decentralised stabilisers in multimachine power systems. Here the main design objective is to enhance the dynamic stability of a power system by applying powersystem stabilisers with parameters so determined that some or all of the system mechanical-mode eigenvalues have prescribed values. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical examples, including two multimachine power systems.

The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of two different isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), c9,t11 CLA and t10,c12 CLA, compared with linoleic acid (LA) used as control, on body composition, lipoprotein profile, hepatic lipids and fecal fat content in hamsters. Animals were assigned to the three diet groups (n=15) during 28 days. The diet was composed of 2% of the experimental fat, and throughout the experimental protocol, the hamsters experienced similar food intake. No significant differences were noted in body weight gain among the three diet groups. However, the t10,c12 CLA-fed animals showed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations (0.9±0.1 mmol/L) than those who ingested either LA (0.6±0.1 mmol/L) or c9,t11 CLA isomer (0.7±0.1 mmol/L), although the t10,c12 CLA consumption decreased hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides and increased fecal fat content compared with the other two groups. Under the present experimental conditions, the dietary c9,t11 CLA isomer showed no positive beneficial effect on plasma lipids. Furthermore, the t10,c12 CLA isomer induced undesirable higher LDL-C, although it reduced hepatic lipids and fat digestibility in hamsters.

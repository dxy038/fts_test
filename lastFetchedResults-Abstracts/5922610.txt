A tool for optimal wind turbines location in large offshore wind farms is proposed. The algorithm objective is to optimize the profits given an investment on an offshore wind farm. Net Present Value (NPV) is used as a figure of the revenue in the proposed method. To estimate the NPV is necessary to calculate the initial capital investment and net cash flow during the offshore wind farm life cycle. The problem is an integer-mixed type problem, exhibits manifold optimal solutions (convexity) and some variables have a range of non allowed values (solutions space not simply connected). This fact makes the problem non-derivable, preventing the use of classical analytical optimization techniques. The proposed optimization algorithm is an improved evolutionary algorithm, for which crossover and mutation operations, specifics to the problem of micro positioning, have been developed.

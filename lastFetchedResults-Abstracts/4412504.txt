Since 3D video has the potential to provide stronger immersive perception, evaluating the quality of 3D video becomes an important subject. This paper mainly studies the subjective quality assessment of 3D video of two views compressed by the state-of-the-art standard H.264/MVC in 3DTV system. Our goal is to obtain available opinion scores which can be applied in the research of objective quality assessment in the future. The subjective evaluation is conducted under the guidance of ITU recommendations, including test materials, test environment, test equipment, assessment factors, subjective methodologies and analysis of assessment results. Experiments showed that Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) of overall quality increases with bitrate and different 3D sequences with different complexity have different quality trends.

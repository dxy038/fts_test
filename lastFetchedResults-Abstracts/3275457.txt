Students from China are always intelligent but lack of creativity. These are somewhat stereotypes. This is partially because of the reserved or implicit culture. In an objective point of view, it is also because of the limited education resources. In the single assessment criterion education circumstance, students chase for the high marks even without knowing their interests or aptitudes. In a 12-week open experimental course, Optoelectronic Instrument Experiments (OIE), we try to encourage the students to dig their aptitudes and bring them into full play to earn more credits for the course. Self-assessment and mutual-evaluation for technical proficiency, communication skills, collaboration and leadership are carried out for the final evaluation. We also communicate with the students the speciality and skill a qualified engineer needs. We hope to help them prepare themselves for engineering-related jobs in the further.

This paper gives an outline of the JUT-ADSL driving simulator. Some modeling problems of the driving simulator, such as simulation delay, tire model, expression of steering hysteresis, rolling resistance and braking torque are discussed. Some examples of application of the driving simulator for research and development (R&amp;D) activities, such as virtual design and testing for vehicle handling, studies of active vehicle control, the study of objective evaluation technology and driver behavior and modeling are described

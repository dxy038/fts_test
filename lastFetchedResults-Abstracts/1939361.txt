Inroduction & Objective: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with epidemic potential. Diabetics are faced with complications of metabolic disorders and defects in their immune system. The use of immune system stimulating agents, such as beta-glucan is one of the researcher's interests to reduce the complications of diabetes. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of beta- glucan cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains AT-3 on the respiratory burst of peripheral blood monocytes in patients with diabetes. 
Material and Methods: Peripheral blood of 53 patients with diabetes and 50 nondiabetic patients with an average of 39 years were sampled from Vali-Asr Hospital of Zanjan. Cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AT-3 were broken using sonikator. The cell wall was isolated. Beta- glucan was extracted from the wall. Nitro Blue Tetrazolium test was used to evaluate the respiratory burst of monocytes stimulated with beta glucan. Data were analyzed using multi-way ANOVA .
Results: The results indicated that the respiratory burst of stimulated monocytes was increased in both men and women. The effect was dose dependent and it was significantly higher in women (p?0.01). 
Conclusion: Beta- glucan extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AT-3 is a potent immune system activator.

Background and Objective: The most recognized symptom during menopause is experiences of hot flashes that affect career, social activities, sleep and quality of life. The common treatment of this symptom is administration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that has some adverse effects and is sometimes contraindicated. The aim of this research was to compare licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) and HRT on hot flash in menopausal women. Subjects and Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 60 women, who passed their last menstruation 1 to 5 years ago, suffering from hot flashes and being referred for treatment to the boarding clinics of Ahvaz. The samples were randomly divided in 2 groups: the first group was given licorice (D-Reglice) containing Glycyrrhiza glabra, 3 times daily, and the second group was given HRT (0.312 mg conjugated estrogen and 2.5 mg medroxy progesterone daily). All the patients were interviewed and a questionnaire considering demographic and hot flash characteristics (using Kupperman index) was filled out for each case. Hot flash was assessed a week before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks after starting treatment. Results: The results showed that no significant differences were seen in the mean of reduced severity, time and number of hot flashes between 2 groups during the period of the study (P >0.05).

Conclusion: Licorice has the same preventive effects as HRT on the hot flashes among menopausal women. Therefore, it can be considered as an alternative therapy. Sci Med J 2010; 9 (2): 157-167

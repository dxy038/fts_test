An improved genetic algorithm based on analyzing the genetic algorithm performance bottlenecks is proposed. It applies Objective Adaptive Parallel Genetic Algorithm to solve the Markowitz model which is multi-objective limited investment restrictions. In this process, it discusses operator parameter design and studies dynamic adjustment group size and group diversity on the impact of the crossover and mutation probability technology. Matlab environment is used to compile programming for solving the model and simulating genetic algorithm search process. Research results show that improved genetic algorithm effectively improves the efficiency of the algorithm. This method is scientific and reasonable.

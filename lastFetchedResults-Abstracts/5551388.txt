The Automated Aids Positioning System (AAPS) was developed to automate the methods the Coast Guard now uses to position buoys. The objective of this computer-based system is to provide our Aids-to-Navigation fleet with Loran-C based routine navigation information and multiple input maneuvering information during buoy positioning operations. AAPS also automates the record keeping task associated with positioning buoys. The information gathered while setting buoys is the same with or without AAPS. AAPS allows the information to be processed instantly and made available to assist the conning officer while maneuvering to set buoys. AAPS constructs a positioning grid and an error plot within seconds after the buoy is set. Should this plot show the buoy is off station, the ship can reposition it while still alongside. AAPS then automatically produces the required Aid Positioning Record (APR) from the fix data that was stored while setting the buoy.

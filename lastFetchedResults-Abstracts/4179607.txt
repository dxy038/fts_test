A novel three-phase bidirectional interface using only four power semiconductor switches to simplify the hardware circuit is analyzed and designed. An accurate simulation model is proposed for convenient simulation using common PC software tools. A critical inductance condition is derived for successful current tracking. The capacity to generate maximum active power is also estimated. A systematic design method for the feedback controller is presented to find the parameters of the controller. Some simulation and experimental results are presented for verification.

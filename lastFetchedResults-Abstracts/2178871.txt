Erosion and sedimentation are main challenges in Iran, which cause the reduction of soil quality and quantity. Soil conservation and watershed management activities should be implemented to reduce the impact of these phenomena. Therefore, the knowledge of critical area is necessary through the learning the amount of sedimentation and erosion. Because of lack of sediment measurement stations in more watershed outlets in Iran and insufficient data, empirical models are proper tools for data layers generation. Factorial Scoring Model (FSM) is one of the experimental models which has been recently developed out of the country. The main objective of this research is to compare sediment yield estimated by FSM model and observed values. So, in order to evaluate the model, nine small dams of 10 years old with no overflows were selected from in Semnan province. For modeling sediment yield, topography, lithology, gully, catchment shape and vegetation cover of related catchments were studied and required data layers were prepared and scoring indexes were given and finally, the calibrated model was presented. Estimated model values were then compared with measured values. Results showed that main model equation does not have sufficient efficiency. Also, results demonstrated that calibrated FSM model has conformity with observed sediment values at 84 percent.

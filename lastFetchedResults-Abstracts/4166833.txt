Using only a single bidirectional optical delay line lattice, we present a technique for performing ultrahigh-data-rate compression and decompression of optical time-division-multiplexed (TDM) packets for photonic packet switching networks. We also present the first experimental demonstration of simultaneous compression and decompression of 100-Gb/s optical TDM packets using our proposed structure.

In this paper it is propose a routing algorithm using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization). The PSO outperforms the classical Dijkstra algorithm in that PSO could handle multi-objective routing problems while the Dijkstra cannot. A simulation model was build where PSO is distributed implemented and the optimum route is calculated on each node until destination is reached. This distributed approach gives the proposed algorithm extra avails in that no centralized arbiter is needed. The optimization also considers supporting Quality-of-Service (QoS) to routing in CRNs. It has been shown that algorithm would adapt multi-hop routing according to different QoS requirements, which makes it achievable in future CRNs.

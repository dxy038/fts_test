Product line software engineering depends on capturing the commonality and variability within a family of products, typically using feature modeling, and using this information to evolve a generic reference architecture for the family. For embedded systems, possible variability in hardware and operating system platforms is an added complication. The design process can be facilitated by first exploring the behavior associated with features. In this paper we outline a bidirectional feature modeling scheme that supports the capture of commonality and variability in the platform environment as well as within the required software. Additionally, ´behavior´ associated with features can be included in the overall model. This is achieved by integrating the UCM path notation in a way that exploits UCM´s static and dynamic stubs to capture behavioral variability and link it to the feature model structure. The resulting model is a richer source of information to support the architecture development process

Passive electromagnetic measurements of sources-of-opportunity such as FM radio stations, TV stations, Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN), VHF Omni directional Radio range (VOR), and Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) were made during the Trident Warrior 2013 campaign conducted off the coast of Norfolk, VA from July 12-18, 2013 on the R/V Knorr. The main objective was to measure effects of atmospheric refractivity on RF propagation via long-range measurements of sources-of-opportunity. This was used to validate the results of numerical weather prediction methods such as COAMPS, local measurements from radisondes, kites, balloons, drifting bouys, and Scan Eagle UAV.

The Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator is a well-known aggregation operator used to combine multiple objectives into a single objective function. Another recently proposed aggregation operator, the Unified And-Or (UAO)operator, exhibits properties similar to that of OWA. This paper evaluates the performance of the OWA and UAO operators with respect to their application to a multi-objective fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithm, a powerful optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm is used to efficiently solve the distributed local area network (DLAN)topology design problem, which is an NP-hard optimization problem. Empirical results suggest that the UAO operator shows better performance than the OWA operator.

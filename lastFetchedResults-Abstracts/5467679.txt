Technologies are discussed to realize a DC/DC Flyback converter with high power conversion efficiency. The focus is on efficiency because of its high value in the application to process electricity generated by photovoltaic modules. Experiments with a 200 W active-clamped bidirectional Flyback converter prototype demonstrate power train efficiencies above 90% between 10% and 100% of the rated power and peak value of 96%.

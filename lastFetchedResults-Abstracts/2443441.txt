A neutronics experiment on a mock-up of the EU Test Blanket Module (TBM), helium cooled lithium lead concept, is in preparation with the objective to validate the capability of the neutronics codes and nuclear data to predict nuclear responses, such as the tritium production rate (TPR), with qualified uncertainties. Three independent measurements of the TPR will be performed using Li2CO3 pellets. Other measurement techniques have been developed using thermo-luminescence detectors, and diamond detectors covered with 6LiF. Neutron flux spectra will also be measured from fast energies down to thermal energies, relevant for TPR. Comparison of measured quantities (E) with the same calculated quantities (C) will be provided, together with the related uncertainties.

per presents the results of development of the measurement techniques and their relevance for tritium measurements in TBM in ITER. It presents also the pre-analyses conducted to optimise the mock-up configuration so that the neutron spectra are as similar as possible to those in the TBM in ITER. Sensitivity/uncertainty assessments of the TPR show that the calculation uncertainty due to the uncertainties of the neutron cross sections amounts to a few %, depending on position. The largest uncertainties are due to the elastic scattering (n,2n), and (n,3n) reactions on Pb.

Hybrid Composite Structures (HCSs) are consisting of alternating layers of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer and metal sheets. Mechanical properties and responses for off-design conditions of HCSs can be improved using an innovative methodology coupling Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm and robust design method. The concept of robust design approach ensures that a structure will be tolerant to unexpected loading and operating conditions. In this paper, two applications are considered; the first is to maximise the stiffness of the HCS while minimising its total weight through a Multi-Objective Design Optimisation. The second application considers a Robust Multi-Objective Design Optimisation (RMDO) to minimise total weight of HCS and to minimise both, the normalised mean displacement and the standard deviations of displacement, considering critical load cases. For the optimisation process, a distributed/parallel Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm in robust multi-objective optimisation platform is used and it is coupled to a Finite Element Analysis based composite structure analysis tool to find the optimal combination of laminates sequences for HCSs. Numerical results show the advantages in mechanical properties of HCS over the metal structures, and also the use of RMDO methodology to obtain higher characteristics of HCS in terms of mechanical properties and its stability at the variability of load cases.

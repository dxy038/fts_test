In the present scenario, the modern microelectronic devices are demanding supply with multiple voltages from a power-efficient and miniaturized platform. Unfortunately, the power inductors used in magnetic-based switching converters are bulky and difficult to integrate. The aim of this paper is to develop Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) converter for Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) which is used as the source for supplying the load. The SIMO converter is used to boost the low input voltage of TEG to a middle voltage and high voltage with the help of the coupled-inductor. The middle and high voltage output terminals can be used for supplying power to power sources like batteries. The converter uses only one switch to obtain the various output voltages of different levels which is the main objective of this study. This study is carried out by PI controller and MPPT techniques. The MPPT technique used for this study is Incremental Conductance. The proposed SIMO converter has been modelled and simulated using PSIM software for obtaining higher efficiency. The conversion efficiency of about 96.5% can be achieved and has been reported in this paper.

This paper, borrowing the principles and methodologies of limit state design method from architecture structure norms to study the limit state theories of the crane metal structure, have built a complete calculating method including the statistical analysis of structural resistance and load cases, the certainty of partial coefficients, and the identification of objective reliable indicator. The method is applied with MATLAB, proved to be feasible by PDS in ANSYS, and provides the valuable experience for future design.

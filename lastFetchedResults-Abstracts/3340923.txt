The objective of this paper is to design a robust controller for the multivariable system having five inputs such as reel speed (U<sub>1</sub>), thick stock flow rate (U<sub>2</sub>), ash flow rate(U<sub>3</sub>), flow rate of retention aid(U<sub>4</sub>), and ash fraction in thick stock(U<sub>5</sub>) and two outputs Y<sub>1</sub> (bone dry weight) and Y<sub>2</sub>(bone dry ash weight). The controlled variables are chosen as an ash flow rate (U<sub>3</sub>) and flow rate of retention Aid (U<sub>4</sub>) for the approach flow system of a paper making process. The paper includes a mathematical model and presents Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller design for the system. The paper concludes that the LQG robust control strategy provides better stability &amp; performance objectives compare to the PID controller in the presence of uncertainty &amp; disturbances.

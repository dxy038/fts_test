This research develops a stress-based topology optimization method (STOM) using the phase-field method representing topological changes. This research shows that to apply the phase field method, regional and localized stress constraints should be addressed. Thus, we use an Augmented Lagrange multiplier approach for the stress constraints and present a new numerical solution for the Lagrange multipliers inside the Allenâ€“Cahn equation with the topological derivatives. Through several two dimensional illustrative problems, the results of the phase-field method have larger objective values, but are robust from a stress point of view compared with the results of the STOM by the density method.

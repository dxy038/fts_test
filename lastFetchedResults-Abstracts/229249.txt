Recently, there has been considerable interest in the representation of radiance in terms of wavelet basis functions. We will present a coordinate system called Nusselt coordinates  which, when combined with wavelets, considerably simplifies computation of radiative transport and surface interaction. It also provides straightforward computation of the physical quantities involved.

We show how to construct a discrete representation of the radiative transport operator Î¤ involving inner products of smoothing functions, discuss the possible numerical integration techniques, and present an application. We also show how surface interaction can be represented as a kind of matrix product of the wavelet projections of an incident radiance and a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF).

The impacts of DG on various aspects of distribution system operation depend highly on location and size of DG. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization algorithm for the siting and sizing of distributed generation is proposed. The objectives consist of minimization costs and losses of distributed system and optimization of voltage profile. This multi-objective optimization is solved by the improved honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm. HBMO is modified on mating step because of itÂ´s converges to local optima. In many cases, these objectives contradict each other and cannot be handled by conventional single or multi objective optimization techniques. For this reason, a fuzzy system is used. This algorithm is executed on a typical 70-bus test system. Results show the proper siting and sizing of DGs are important to improve the voltage profile, reduce costs and losses of distribution system. Accuracy and speed to achieved aims are the most important advantage of this algorithm.

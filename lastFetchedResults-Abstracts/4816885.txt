The objective of admission control is to keep the network load moderates as so to achieve a performance objective associated with quality of services. In this paper we briefly review the admission control techniques under queuing theory as a basis for proposing a new selection rule that selects the suitable virtual path for accepting the new request call without regrading the QOSÂ´s corresponding to calls already connected on the virtual path under investigation with regard to the availability of equivalent capacity for the new request call. Simulation results describe in detail the methodology followed by the different call admission control techniques to accept the new incoming calls according to the different general admission approaches

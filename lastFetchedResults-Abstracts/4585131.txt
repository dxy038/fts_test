In the past few years, various natural disasters, public health events and grave accidents which have caused huge casualties and economic losses, are attacking human beings more and more frequently and making damages more and more seriously. It has become very important to make deep research on the system planning of emergency supply chain, and the key factor of making the system more efficient is the rational distribution of facilities of emergency service in the system. So it has great significance both theoretically and practically to plan the sites of emergency logistic distribution centers and emergency distribution centers and the distribution paths through which the timeliness, negotiability and security of the system emergency service supply chain would be guaranteed. Based on this, this paper establishes the optimization model of the emergency supply chain system, through which the optimal location of emergency logistics centers and emergency distribution centers are determined and the optimal distribution path is fixed. And this model introduces response time to the objective function to address the dynamic time-dependent system optimization problem. This study can achieve the timeliness, negotiability and security of the system and improve the efficiency of emergency response processing. We can also improve the efficiency of cooperation among the service nodes throughout emergency supply chain.

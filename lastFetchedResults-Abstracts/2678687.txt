Cognitive linguistics includes a collection of theories which the conceptual metaphor and the image schema are regarded as the most important of them. Image schema is generated by the embodiment and objective understanding and organizes the source domain in metaphoric mappings and it is divided to three groups: 1) Containment schema, 2) Path schema, 3) Force schema. The containment schema is formed as a result of physical experience of human with the containment and it has frequent evidence and function in literary works which the containment schema of "head" is one of them. In some parts of lyric poems of Sadi and Hafez Shirazi, the ''head'' is the imagination of ''the head is container''. It is assumed so and its understanding is performed through the understanding of the container. Sadi and Hafez have common imaginations in this respect and based on them, they consider some role outcomes such as occultation and association of the performance for the container of head. Another procedure of containment  schema of head is love as contained of the head which in this dimension, Sadi and Hafez apply different romantic imaginations and psychological theories about love  and a new recognitions  of love is achieved and according to them, we can conclude that the dominate aspect of love  in Sadi’s  lyric poems is passionate love and it has some indications  such as transaction and caprice, union imagination, passion, motion, and the priority of the container on the contained which indicates the passionate love but the dominant aspect of love  in Hafez’s  lyric poems are the companionate love and some signs such as affection and union, union’s head, enthusiasm, and stability of the contained indicate to the companionate love.

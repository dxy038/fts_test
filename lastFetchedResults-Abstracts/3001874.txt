To maintain sustainable development, it is required to establish new society with low environmental load and low resource/energy consumption, i.e. recycling society. A method to design the recycling society is to raise effectiveness of resource/energy utilization and recycle of waste. The effectiveness is evaluated by regional material flows and to maximize the effectiveness the regional material flows should be optimized. The objective of this research is to develop a system to design the optimum regional material flows. The system is composed of four compartments. 1) Database 2) Analysis of current regional material flow 3) Geophysical information analysis 4) Design of industrial network 5) Optimization of regional material flow This system can propose industrial networks that maximize waste disposal and optimum region size for treatment waste

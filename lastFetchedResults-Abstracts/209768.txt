Due to inappropriate and centralized planning in the past, the quality of
development and its related infrastructure has created major issues in the
development trend of the country. The diversity and complexity of the
subject is one of the major constraints that inhibit the provision of an
appropriate model for the distribution of credit. The first step in solving the
problems associated with the imbalances driven by regional imbalances is to
recognize and categorize regions based on their economic, infrastructure,
socio-economic communication, healthcare, training and so forth.
The main objective of this study is to assess the potential for developing
human settlement in Sharekord at the sub-district level. The study used
evaluation models, and analytical and documentation methods. Based on
this, 37 indicators were identified from which 7 indices were extracted
(training, health, public utilities, communication, tourism, economic and
internal). The study was carried out in 11 sub districts and the results were
analyzed by SWOT. The findings of study show, a comprehensive planning
is required to reflect the strengths, reinforced opportunities, and combat the
threats since, the variance of development level in this county is imbalanced
and the difference and dispersion of training and health indices have the
most significant impact on the development level. The recommendations of
this study can contribute to the improvement and rehabilitation of county
level development.

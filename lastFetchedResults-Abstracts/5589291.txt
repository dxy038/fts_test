The paper deals with the experimental validations of the corrective coefficient used to take into account the skin effect in the equivalent circuit rotor resistance of induction motors with squirrel cages. Locked rotor tests have been performed at several supply frequencies on different induction motors; the collected experimental data have been used to validate the rotor parameters analytical estimation obtained by means a numerical procedure previously proposed by the authors. The reported comparison between experimental and calculated skin effect corrective coefficients shows that the adopted model allows to get satisfactory results in terms of accuracy, taking into account the objective difficulties to estimate the rotor parameters from the experimental tests.

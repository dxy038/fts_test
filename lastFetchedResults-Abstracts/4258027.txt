The main objective of this paper is the design and integration of a series of power electronics converters in order to make an induction motor work with a single photovoltaic panel as efficiently as possible. The power electronics converters that we intend to design are a Buck-Boost Converter and a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Three-Phase Inverter. The integration of a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) is also discussed. Each of these converters has its own purpose; the Buck-Boost Converter will keep a constant and steady DC output from the photovoltaic panel. The Three-Phase Inverter will change the DC output from the Buck-Boost Converter to an Alternate Current that the induction motor can use. In order to integrate the power electronic converters into the system, research has to be done in order to understand the complexity of this work; this paper will also help us to keep in mind the benefits that this kind of research can bring to the WorldÂ´s crisis of the global warming.

A novel dual-frequency dual-linear-polarization printed antenna element benefiting from a single-feed single-layer structure is introduced in this paper. The Boolean particle swarm optimization algorithm in conjunction with the method of moments (MoM) is employed to optimize the geometry of the antenna after considering three objectives: cross polarization, return loss, and boresight direction in both bands. A fuzzy-logic based ordered weighted averaging operator allows us to efficiently implement the multi-objective optimization technique. Prototypes of the optimized designs have been fabricated and tested. The measured results show excellent performance with more than 15 dB of return loss and 10 dB of cross polarization in both frequency bands of operation, i.e., 12 and 14 GHz. A gain of 4.8 dBi has been measured for both frequency bands.

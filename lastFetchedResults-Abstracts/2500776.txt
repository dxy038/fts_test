The objective of this study was to estimate the protein degradability parameters of 6 common ruminant feedstuff using the nylon bags (in situ) and the innovative in vitro method-the DaisyII incubator. Significant differences were observed between the in situ and in vitro methods in estimation of the rapidly soluble (a) fraction (Pin vitro method were highly correlated with the estimated values by the in situ method (Pin vitro DaisyII method can be used for estimating some protein degradability parameters such as parameter c, PD and ED but not for others (a, b and lag time). In addition, the ability of DaisyII method to estimate some parameters was better for some feeds (soybean meal, canola meal and corn grain) than for others (barley grain, alfalfa hay and corn silage).

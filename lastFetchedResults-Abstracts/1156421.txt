The main objective of this work is to improve the quality of the results produced by the Internet search engines. In order to achieve it, the FIS-CRM model (Fuzzy Interrelations and Synonymy based Concept Representation Model) is proposed as a mechanism for representing the concepts (not only terms) contained in any kind of document. This model, based on the vector space model, incorporates a fuzzy readjustment process of the term weights of each document. The readjustment lies on the study of two types of fuzzy interrelations between terms: the fuzzy synonymy interrelation and the fuzzy generality interrelations (“broader than” and “narrower than” interrelations). The model has been implemented in the FISS metasearcher (Fuzzy Interrelations and Synonymy based Searcher) that, using a soft-clustering algorithm (based on the SISC algorithm), dynamically produces a hierarchical structure of groups of “conceptually related” documents (snippets of web pages, in this case).

Solar power generation had been used as a renewable energy since years ago. Residential that uses solar power as their alternative power supply will bring benefits to them. The main objective of this project is to develop an automatic solar tracking system which will keep the solar panels aligned with the Sun in order to maximize in harvesting solar power. The system tracks the maximum intensity of light. When the intensity of light is decreasing, this system automatically changes its direction to get maximum intensity of light. LDR light detector is used to trace the coordinate of the Sun. While to rotate the appropriate position of the panel, a DC geared motor is used. The system is controlled by two relays as a driver and a microcontroller as a main processor. This project is covered for a single axis and is designed for residential usage. Finally, the project is able to track and follow the Sun intensity in order to get maximum power at the output regardless motor speed.

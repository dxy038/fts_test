Describes eight steps necessary to automate statistical quality control for a manufacturing facility. Successful implementation depends mainly on management support and the talent involved. The benefits of this system include improved productivity and self-sufficiency for the operator. The objective can be achieved through the implementation of automated statistical process control systems (ASPCSs) starting from the development through the manufacturing phases of the product. The underlying objective of ASPCSs is to ensure overall process optimization through the real-time identification and removal of causes of defects at the earliest point of the process. This is accomplished by integrating all of the following functions: data automation, database management, problem detection through statistical methods, problem definition through diagnostic methods, and corrective action feedback and follow-up. The author provides the step-by-step procedures for implementing an ASPCS workstation and describes the demonstration of these functions in manufacturing applications

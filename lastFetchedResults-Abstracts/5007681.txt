The objective of this paper is to review the development of a number of approaches to computer simulation models of railway systems. Attention is, in particular, given to models of train movement, power supply systems and traction drives. These models have been successfully used to enable various `what-ifÂ´ issues to be resolved effectively in a wide range of applications, such as speed profiles, energy consumption, run times etc

As designers, we are faced with a more heterogeneous group of customers, product users and learners. Learning styles, multiculturalism, and age demographics are just some of the factors that contribute to this diversity. As designers and design educators, it is our mission to look at new ways to deliver instructional material and information in an effort to propose a new paradigm in the delivery of this content. Our results of teaching at The Ohio State University are demonstrated through a variety of interactive multimedia programs focused on the objective of teaching and learning. Each student project in some way challenges current conventions in linear, static educational, and information processes. These dynamic programs, incorporating semantic typography, sound, video, and animation offer multiple but logical paths of navigation. Student designers explore how information design (complex information or systems) can be made more accessible by engaging the user through interactivity. Additional project criteria include the application of an appropriate and effective architectural structure, effective interface design, and strong typographic principles

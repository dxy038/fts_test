The objective of this study was to determine by ultrasonographic measurements, an inexpensive and radiation-free technique, the association between bone health and lifestyle factors among a large population of Japanese women. Two hundred and fifty-six pre-menopausal women and 585 post-menopausal women who underwent a voluntary medical check-up for osteoporosis in 1996–1997 were analyzed. There were significant positive correlations between the bone density (designated as the stiffness value) vs the weight, the height and the body mass index of the subjects only in the post-menopausal group. Negative correlations were also found between the bone density vs the age and the years since menopause. Our data using ultrasonographic technique agree well with previous studies using other devices. In both groups, subjects with current or past exercise habits had higher stiffness values. Dietary habits had no effects on the stiffness value. Smoking habits had a trend towards negative effects and alcohol consumption seemed to have a trend towards positive effects on the stiffness value in post-menopausal women, but these effects did not reach statistical significance. Positive effects of current exercise on bone density were maintained after adjustment for past exercise habits. These results support the effectiveness of exercise begun in adulthood. Having a good exercise habit is one of the most effective ways of maintaining good bone health.

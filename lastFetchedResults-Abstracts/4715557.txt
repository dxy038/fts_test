In order to evaluate the coordinated development among subsystems of a system, a method is designed and key procedures are involved as following. Firstly, the system is divided into several subsystems and a number of representative elements are chosen. Secondly, based on distinguishing criterions, element states are divided into three classifications: idea goal state (ID), secondary objective state (SE) and inferior objective state (IN). Then the element number of each classification in a subsystem is counted and state degree of a subsystem is determined by a designed function. Thirdly, a system state is determined by the actual state degrees of the subsystems in multidimensional spaces. Two distances (harmony degree and development degree) are used to evaluate the coordinated development among subsystems. The method is used to evaluate the coordinated development among land use, natural environment and social-economic in Tongzhou town.

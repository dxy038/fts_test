Walnut is a hardwood tree which covers a wide area of the plantation forest and
gardens. The objective of this study was the separation and identification of
compounds produced from pyrolysis of walnut wood at fixed bed reactor under an
inert gas atmosphere (nitrogen) at 350 oC for 20 minutes. The separation and
identification of compounds from bio-oil treated with N,o-bis (tri methyl sailil)
tri fluoro acetamid (BSTFA) were done by using gas chromatography/ mass
spectroscopy (GC/MS) technique. Ten compounds were totally identified. The most
important compound identified in wood at this range was levoglucosan and
?-L-galactofuranosid. The other important compounds observed at 350 oC were
propanoic acid, tetracozan, octamethyltrisiloxane, sailan, 1, 2, 3 butan triol and
Tetracosane.

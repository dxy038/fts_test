By designing global manufacturing networks still purely cost-based decisions are made, in which objectives such as delivery time, quality, flexibility, closeness to customer and coordination effort are neglected. The design and decision-making process becomes more complex, the more influencing factors of the business environment are considered. Due to the dynamic and uncertainty of these factors a decision support is required which includes all relationships in the network and its environment. This paper presents a dynamic multi-objective optimization model for global manufacturing networks, which evaluates the impact of changes of influencing factors and optimizes the global design of the manufacturing network.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish normal values for nucleated red blood cells in term singletons and factors associated with their elevation.
STUDY DESIGN: Cord blood was prospectively collected from term singleton gestations from Feb. 1 to July 31, 1995. Umbilical vein white blood cells and nucleated red blood cells were counted and umbilical arterial pH was determined. Medical records provided maternal and neonatal information.
RESULTS: Cord blood from 1112 cases was obtained and evaluated for nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells. Nine outliers were censored (nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells = 126 to 830); five cases were excluded because of missing data. The mean value of nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells was 8.55, the SD was 10.27, and the range was 0 to 89. The value did not vary by maternal tobacco or drug use, anemia, fetal presentation, or mode of delivery. Both maternal diabetes and meconium were associated with elevated values, p< 0.01. Apgar scores and cord pHs showed trends toward inverse proportionality to the number of nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells.
CONCLUSION: The mean number of nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells was 8.55, with a wide range and SD. Elevated values may be associated with markers of intrauterine hypoxia such as meconium, lower Apgar scores, and lower pH values. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1149-56.)

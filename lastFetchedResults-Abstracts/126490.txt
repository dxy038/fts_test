Background: Postpartum haemorrhage is considered as the most serious bleeding in obstetrics. Oxytocic drugs decrease the rate of postpartum haemorrhage significantly. Objective: In this clinical trial the effects of intramuscular syntocinon injection time on the rate of bleeding has been investigated.
Methods: In this study 100 pregnant women in maternity ward of Bahonar hospital in Kerman were selected with simple random sampling. Samples were divided into two groups. In the first group the intramuscular injection of 10 unit syntocinon was done after delivery of fetus and in the second group it was down after delivery of placenta, then the rate of bleeding in the first two hours after delivery of placenta was estimated by weighing of pads, tampons and cloths and compared with first group. Data were collected by a questionnaire made by researchers.
Findings: Results showed that the average rate of bleeding in two groups was 216.8ml and 261.8m1 respectively, and there was no significant difference between two groups (P>0.05). In the first group two women (4%) and in the second group three women (6%) had postpartum haemorrhage (more than 500 ml). In the first group placenta was delivered by Shultz mechanism in the most of cases and it was statistically significant (P=0.006). It was no placenta retention and between the length of the third stage, the rate of currage and side effects of syntocinon were no significant difference between two groups: (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Although there was no significant statistical difference between the rate of haemorrahage in two groups but respecting the actual difference of two group in the rate of bleeding and lack of any difference in postpartum complications, the injection of syntocinon after placenta delivery is recommended.

The design parameters and experimental results for a proposed time-division multiple access (TDMA) digital mobile system are shown. The related network architecture, frame structure, and signaling structure for a digital system are given. The proposed system structure has three-slot TDMA, &#960;/4 shifted QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying), and 25 kHz carrier spacing. A spectrum-efficient system can be realized by using radio transmission techniques, such as diversity, bidirectional feed control amplifier, and robust CODECs. Field experiments have verified the digital transmission performance of this system. A signaling structure featuring service flexibility, such as ISDN service, is presented

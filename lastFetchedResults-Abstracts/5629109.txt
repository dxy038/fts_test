Support for efficient multicasting in WLANs can enable new services such as streaming TV channels, radio channels, and visitorÂ´s information. With increasing deployments of large-scale WLANs, such services can have a significant impact. However, for a solution to be viable, the mutlicast services must minimally impact the existing unicast services which are currently the core services offered by most WLANs. This paper focuses on three objective functions motivated by different revenue functions and network scenarios: maximizing the number of users (MNU), balancing the load among APs (BLA), and minimizing the load of APs (MLA). We show that these problems are NP-hard and present centralized approximation algorithms and distributed approaches to solve them. Using simulations we evaluate the performance of these algorithms. We observe that the number of users can be increased by up to 36.9%, and the maximum AP load and the total load can be reduced by up to 52.9% and 31.1%, respectively.

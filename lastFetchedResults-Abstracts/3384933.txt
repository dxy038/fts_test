Traditionally, senior capstone projects have been used for comprehensive student assessment. Other mechanisms exist for engineering course assessments, such as teacher/course evaluations, homework and test results, student office visits, and senior exit interviews. Each of these methods has weaknesses if the primary objective is curriculum improvement. The new Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC-2000) accreditation process requires new methods to allow for continuous program improvement. This paper discusses the six-week miniproject for senior students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Bradley University. Use of the miniproject to steer the curriculum design content has been in place for eleven years. The evaluation results have been used successfully to implement course, laboratory, and curriculum modifications. The paper discusses the project, its costs, evaluation procedures, curriculum modifications and improvements, and use of the project in the EC-2000 accreditation process.

Objective: The purp ose of the prese nt study was to assess the
effect of local muscle fati gue induced at proximal and distal
segments of lower extr emit y on sagitt al plane mover on visual depend
ency in qui et standing postur al stabil ity.
Materials & Methods: In thi s Quasi - experimental study (before after
compariso n) sagittal plane prime mover s of the ankle and hip
musculature were fa tigued using isokinetic co ntrac tions at two test
sess ions wi th a rand omi zed ord er and one week interval. Twent y five
health y yo ung female students wer e se lec ted by using non probability
selec tio n and sample of con venience and asked to maintain single leg
upri ght posture as immobile as possibl e. RMS and SD of Ce nte r of
Pressure displ acements were assessed in 30 seconds and co nse quently,
the eyes we re clo sed aft er 15 seco nds . A analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
repeated measures was used to analyze the effect of the following fact or s
over two periods of 5 seco nds immediately before and afte r eye closure: ( I )
fatigue , (2) vision, (3) segment of fatigue.
Results: Th e main effec ts of each within-su bject factors (fat igue, visio n
and segment of fatigue ) were significant (P<0.05 ). The analysis of RMS and
SD of Center of Pressure demon strated a significant interaction between
fatigu e and vision, and fatigue and segment of fatigue so that the effec ts of
Fatigue on Proxim al segment and eye clo sed conditions we re incre ased .
Conclusion: The vis ua l dep end ency for co ntro l o f postural s tability
increment ed followin g muscle fatigue. Pro xim al muscle fatigue lead to
exagg eration of visual dependency for co ntro l of postu ral stability. Based
on the pr esent re sults, emphas is on the proprioc epti on of proximal
segment of lower extremity may be recommended for postur al stability
training.

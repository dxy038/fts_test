According to the flight rerouting problem caused by zonal severe weather areas along the flight path, a new reroute planning method based on the multi-objective dynamic planning algorithm (MODPA) is proposed. First, the environment model of air traffic rerouting problem is constructed, and the method for determining candidate rerouting points is given. Then, MODPA is applied in the flight rerouting problem, the distance and deflection of flight rerouting path are considered, and the corresponding MODPA model is given. Finally, the flight rerouting paths of Kunming-Haikou in three typical severe weather areas are studied, and compared with the rerouting method based on the polygon. Simulation results show that the zonal severe weather areas can be avoided safely and effectively by using the proposed method, the relevant limitations of flight are considered, and the alterant air route is simple and feasible.

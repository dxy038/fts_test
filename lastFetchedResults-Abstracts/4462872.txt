The objective of this paper is to discuss the new demands imposed on museums, the possibilities to achieve them using new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and to propose a platform to meet these requirements. The platform will provide services to the external public, the museum staff and researchers. The artifacts to be collected and interpreted belong to several Brazilian indigenous cultures.

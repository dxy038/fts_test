The expected evolution of the IoT into a huge and growing number of sensors connected to the Internet and generating a huge amount of data, translates into new challenges in the analysis phase for the extraction of useful information to the final user. This scenario opens new opportunities for the introduction of context-awareness features, as it is possible to store context information linked to the data obtained by sensors to make their interpretation simpler and useful for the user. The essential objective of the EU funded FI-WARE project, is to contribute in the development and implementation of Future Internet services and applications by using and reusing a series of building blocks called Generic Enablers (GE). This paper presents the contribution of the FI-WARE project to the IoT: it makes available to the creators of applications and services, a GE for context management and an IoT Services Enablement Architecture which allows them to create modular applications that promote the reuse of software (reducing the development time and increasing software quality) and are based on standards.

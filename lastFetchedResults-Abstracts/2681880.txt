Objectives This study aimed at developing and determining psychometric properties of Active Aging Measurement Instrument (AAIM) as per the Iranian aging society.
Methods & Materials This study was performed in two phases by applying the steps identified by Ingersoll-Dayton in 2015-2016. In the first phase, according to prior studies, a preliminary AAMI was developed through three steps. In the second phase through two steps, the psychometric properties of the AAMI were examined. A total of 350 older adults belonging to health-related educational centers in Tehran municipality were included in the psychometrics study using the three-phase cluster sampling method. Statistical tests such as item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's &alpha; coefficient, and Pearson correlation coefficient were performed by using SPSS 16.
Results The finding of the first phase was a preliminary 6-item measurement instrument with 5 point responses (none to very much). In the second phase, the result of examining the face and content validity was elimination of 6 items, which led to a 55-item AAMI. The result of psychometric tests after item analysis and factor analysis was the final 40-item AAMI consisting of six factors: 1. social-institutional participation; 2. active mind maintenance; 3. social contacts; 4. agent attitude; 5. productive engagement; and 6. physical-functional activity which explained 56% of the total variance. Reliability of AAMI based on examining Cronbach's &alpha; coefficient was 0.88, and also its test-retest reliability was 0.95 (P<0.01).
Conclusion The 40-item AAMI consisting of six factors in the present study not only was shown to be reliable, valid and appropriate for Iranian older adults but was also confirmed to have both subjective and objective dimensions.

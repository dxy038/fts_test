Introduction: Applying basic standards of anesthesia care is crucial. Patients’ status should be evaluated based on a standard checklist. In case of mismanagement, logical approaches must be conducted. The main objective of the present study is to develop a checklist for evaluation of implementing anesthesia care standards, and its application by observing the practice of anesthesiologists and their residents in Guilan Medical University hospitals.   
Methods: At first, different stages of anesthesia from patients’ arrival to the operating room till discharge from the recovery room were determined. In every stage, standard protocols were prepared. Then, the checklist items were developed based on anesthesia reference books and the modifications made according to Guilan anesthesiologists and conditions of university hospitals. After that, the adherence of twenty anesthesiologists and residents to these protocols were insensibly observed and scored for six months. Data were analyzed and frequency distribution was presented.  
Results: Rate of not-applied standards in descending orders was: 52.5% in preparation of operating room, 42.2% in pre-intubation, 40% in pre-extubation, 34.5% during maintenance of anesthesia,33.3% at discharge from the recovery room, 27.7% after intubation, 27.2% before arrival to the recovery room, 17.1% in recovery room,  13.8% at the time of intubation, 11.3% at arrival to the recovery room, 10% upon admission to the recovery room, 9% upon extubation, and 0% after extubation.
Conclusion: This study revealed the necessity of using standard checklist for anesthesia care in operating room to protect the patient and to decrease the risk of anesthesia for them. Based on the results, educational and management interventions should be designed to promote adherence to standards.

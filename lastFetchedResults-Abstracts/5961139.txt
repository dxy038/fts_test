Objective: By analyzing the effect of natural cerebrolysin (NC) on gene expression profile of rat hippocampus AlzheimerÂ´s disease (AD), to explore its molecular genetic pharmacodynamic mechanism of anti-AD. Methods: The experiment included the AD model, sham-operation and NC treated group. The changes of hippocampus gene expression profiles in the above three groups were analyzed by Affymetrix rat whole genome expression profile microarray. Results: Compared to the sham-operation group, the AD model group had 50 up-regulated genes (Fold Change &gt; 2) and 21 down-regulated genes (Fold Change &lt; 0.5) with significant difference. Compared to the model group, the NC treated group was found to have 5 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes with significant difference. Conclusion: NC can regulate hippocampal function, and further regulate the brain function of animals in multiple gene target points by a number of ways.

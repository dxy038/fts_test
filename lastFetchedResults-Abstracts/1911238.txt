Objective
ort on the feasibility and outcomes of the N-shaped pouch with an afferent tubular isoperistaltic segment as a new technique for creating a capacious, low pressure bladder substitute following radical cystectomy.
s
n April 2000 and April 2006, 42 patients (36 male, 6 female) with invasive bladder cancer were considered good candidates for orthotopic urinary diversion. All had radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution by an ileal low pressure reservoir (N-shaped) with an afferent isoperistaltic tubular segment. Of the 42 patients, 36 (86%) had squamous cell carcinoma; 6 had transitional cell carcinoma. None of the patients had positive lymph nodes after pathologic examination of the specimen. The patients were available for a median follow-up period of 24.8 months. Follow-up included clinical and radiographic studies to determine functional and oncological outcomes.
s
 patients (26.2%) had early complications during the period â‰¤ 3 months following surgery. Seven of these patients had complications such as wound infection, prolonged ileus, persistent urinary leakage, and deep venous thrombosis that were treated conservatively. One female patient developed a pouch-vaginal fistula that required repair. The remaining 3 patients had oncologic failures, 1 of which was isolated urethral recurrence. Late complications occurred in 15 patients (35.7%). These included pouch stones, outflow obstruction, mucus retention, and adhesive bowel obstruction. Daytime and night-time continence was achieved in 92% and 80% of the patients, respectively, and ureteroileal stricture was observed in 5%. The upper tracts remained unchanged or improved in nearly 95% of the patients.
sions
orthotopic bladder substitution (N-shaped) with an afferent ileal tubular segment offers good functional results with good preservation of the renal units. It is considered a safe and technically feasible surgical procedure.

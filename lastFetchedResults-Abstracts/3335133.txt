This paper describes fireworks algorithm adjusted for solving multi-objective radio frequency identification (RFID) network planning problem. RFID network planning is a hard optimization problem that attracts research attention since the usage of the RFID technology expanded in many industries. Recent fireworks algorithm was successfully applied to other hard optimization problems. In our implementation of the fireworks algorithm for multi-objective RFID network planning problem we used hierarchical approach to objectives. For experimental purposes we used standard benchmark sets. A comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art metaheuristics proved that our proposed approach outperformed other algorithms. It was successful in achieving total coverage without interference with smaller number of deployed readers and less transmitted power.

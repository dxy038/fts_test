In this paper, a new algorithm, Land Aerosol property and Bidirectional reflectance Inversion by Time Series technique (LABITS), is presented and applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data in North China. In this algorithm, we couple the Ross Thick-Li Sparse Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model and the atmospheric radiative transfer model. Assuming that the surface bidirectional reflective property is unchanged during a short period, usually 2-4 days and aerosol characteristics has a high temporal variation but is consistent spatially, then we can obtain AOD and BRDF parameters jointly by numerical iterative technique. The data used to test our algorithm is Global Area Coverage (GAC) 4KM Level 1B from AVHRR/3 on board NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 from 8 July to 9 July, 2011 in North China (110&#176;E-130&#176;E, 25&#176;N-45&#176;N). Synchronous Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) level 1.5 data and field measured data during the Ministry Of Science and Technology Aerosol Project (MOSTap) in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region in 2011 was adopted to validate our retrieved result. The correlation coefficient R is about 0.72. Also, in the area both retrieved AOD and MODIS aerosol product have an effective value, the consistency between them is quite good.

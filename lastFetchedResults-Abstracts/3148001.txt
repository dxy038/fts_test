Based on this, a multi-objective dynamic programming for its optimal operation is proposed and applied to the natural gas operation of a certain oil and gas company of Sinopec from the viewpoint of upstream gas fields to solve the aboved imbalance and instability in the continuous process of natural gas production and supply. Also, in this model genetic algorithms (GAs) is introduced to find the optimal operation strategies in avoidance of dimension disasters. Research indicates that this model can not only improve the balance between natural gas production and supply of gas fields, but also effectively coordinate the demands among the end-users.

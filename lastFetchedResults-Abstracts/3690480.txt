The objective of this paper is to present an <i>online</i> <i>parameter</i> <i>tuning</i> technique for digital power converters with predictive peak current-mode control operating in boundary conduction mode. The issues caused by both <i>inductor</i> <i>variation</i> and <i>input</i> <i>voltage</i> <i>drift</i> can be solved by the proposed online parameter tuning technique which is based upon the sampled currents between two pulsewidth modulation outputs. The proposed technique requires <i>neither</i> an additional sensor <i>nor</i> a system parameter. Furthermore, the effects of inductor variation and input voltage drift are analyzed. It will be demonstrated that the variation of the inductor and input voltage drift result in a dc offset of the inductor current and deteriorate the performance. It will be confirmed by experimental results that these effects can be coped with using the presented <i>online</i> parameter tuning technique. Experimental results derived from a field-programmable-gate-array-based digital controller will be presented to fully confirm the theoretical analysis.

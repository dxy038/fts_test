This paper presents a proposal of an expert system for inspection and diagnosis of defects in adhesive ceramic wall or floor tiling (ACT), specifically developed for recent buildings. The system proposed includes a classification of the ACT defects and their most probable causes in different groups, as well as the relationship between defects and all the causes and inter-defects, presented in correlation matrices. The system was validated via field work that included standardized inspections of 155 ACT cases. Its main purpose is to help the inspector to be more objective in his in situ activities and, at the same time, to standardize procedures.

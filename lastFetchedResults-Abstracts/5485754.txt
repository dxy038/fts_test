The link-type shape shifting modular robot permits high mobility under unstructured environment for their continuously driving and redundancy. The objective of this work is to enhance the flexibility of the primary shape shifting robot through transformation technique improvement, especially in the robot\´s torque and current reduction. The improved prototype, a manually reconfigurable and shape changeable tracked robot named "AMOEBA-1", has been introduced. To improve the system\´s controllability, a wireless remote control system has been equipped in the control platform located on the center module. The framework of the modular shape shifting robot control system has been introduced. The whole control system has been designed with the consideration of modularization in both hardware and software to enhance its expansibility and fault tolerance. A novel transformation technique has been proposed based on the cooperation work of mechanism. Finally, this transformation technique has been tested and compared with the traditional method. Experimental results show that the novel transformation technique has the merits such as lower current and less torque

The PR domain containing the 16 (PRDM16) gene, also known as the MDS1/EVI1-like gene (MEL1), may act as a bidirectional switch between brown fat and skeletal muscle in mice. The molecular characteristics and possible biological function of porcine PRDM16 gene have been less reported. In this study, the mRNA expression profile, linkage mapping and association analyses of the PRDM16 gene were carried out in the pig. The PRDM16 mRNA was expressed widely in various tissues including fat and the longissimus dorsi muscle. One SNP c.-3284+171C>T in intron 14 was identified and that made the PRDM16 gene being assigned between SWR1130 and SW122 on SSC6. The different genotypes of c.-3284+171C>T were significantly associated with backfat and loin muscle area in the ISU Berkshire x Yorkshire pig resource family, but such associations were not verified in another pig population. The discovery of additional mutations and association studies are warranted before the PRDM16 gene can be recommended for marker assisted selection in the pig

The attenuation of the low frequency noise produced by the car engine vibration has been the major concern of the automotive community with the objective to increase the comfort of the driver and the passengers. The chassis subframe is the part responsible for transmission of the engine vibration to the car body through the engine mounts. At the beginning of this paper, we briefly describe the test rig we used and which has been experimentally investigated by using system identification. Then the experimental results of the feedforward control strategy and the achieved performance are briefly presented. These results are then compared to the feedback control method utilizing Hâˆž strategy which allows us to design a robust controller requiring less sensors. Furthermore, a broadband noise attenuation could be achieved by using a robust feedback controller in the real time test.

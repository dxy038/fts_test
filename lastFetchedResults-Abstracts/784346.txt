Objective This large nationwide study describes the
prevalence and predictors of long-term antipsychotic polypharmacy
among patients with schizophrenia.
Methods A register-based longitudinal study of all people
in Finland, who had at least one hospitalization due to
schizophrenia during the years 2000–2007 and who were
alive on March 1, 2007. Entry to the cohort was defined
from the first hospitalization for schizophrenia during the
years 2000–2007, and the date of assessment of antipsychotic
polypharmacy was March 1, 2007. We studied
separately chronic (N = 8,037) and recent onset (N = 8,046)
schizophrenia patients. Antipsychotic polypharmacy was
defined as overlapping of two or more filled prescriptions of
antipsychotics for over 60 days.
Results In a total 16,083 patients with schizophrenia the
prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy was 46.2 %
(N = 7,436, mean age 47.5 years, male 55 %). The longer
the duration of schizophrenia, the more common the antipsychotic
polypharmacy. Long index hospitalization and
being male significantly associated with antipsychotic
polypharmacy among all schizophrenia patients. Especially,
in chronic schizophrenia patients, the previous use
of benzodiazepine like agents was associated with antipsychotic
polypharmacy, but the use of antidepressants
associated with less frequent antipsychotic polypharmacyConclusions Antipsychotic polypharmacy was widely
prevalent among patients with schizophrenia and it was
associated with long hospitalizations and long duration of
illness. Benzodiazepine use was associated with increased
risk and antidepressant use with decreased risk of antipsychotic
polypharmacy when the effect of other clinical and
socioeconomic factors was adjusted. Research is needed of
risks and benefits of antipsychotic polypharmacy and augmentation
of antipsychotic with other psychoactive drugs

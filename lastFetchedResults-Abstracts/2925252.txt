A decoupled current control circuit of the PWM voltage converter connected to the AC mains is presented. The two AC current ParkÂ´s components can be controlled independently. Expressions for the controllers synthesis are derived. The system performance is studied with a simulation program that allows the integration of the model equations by the Euler-forward or Euler-backward methods. Several applications of the system with the control circuit presented are referred: AC/DC bidirectional power converter in power supplies for electrical drives or in HVDC energy transmission; reactive power compensator; and active power filter. The control circuit presented leads to the possibility of realizing all the applications referred to at the same time. The PWM voltage converter connected to the AC mains is therefore a multiple applications converter

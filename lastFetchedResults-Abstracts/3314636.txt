As the computing facilities growing fastly with advance technologies, side by side problems in engineering &amp; science become so perplexed and require large computing power to handle these problems. In Grid environment, it is a challenge or a more complexive to schedule the independent tasks. An efficient task scheduling algorithm is needed to utilize the total available power of grid system for requested tasks to execute them. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Ranking Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm for scheduling the tasks in grid environment. Objective of proposed work is to minimize the average completion time of submitted tasks as compared with other scheduling methods. Internally ARTS draw up two important basic factors concerned with type of gridlets whether data centric or computation centric and assigning tasks to the resources on the basis of organization rank (OR) value in a grid environment.

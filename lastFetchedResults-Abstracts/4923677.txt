In this paper, we demonstrate a bidirectional WDM networks with one bidirectional optical cross connect (BOXC) that has a multicasting capability and four bidirectional add drop multiplexers (BADMs). The node spacing is 80 km and 14 channels of 10 Gb/s signals were used for communications between the nodes. We demonstrated the automatic line protection and the automatic retrieval within 7 ms.

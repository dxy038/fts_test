ICUBE-1, the first pico-satellite of the space program ICUBE (Institute of Space Technology Pakistan cubeSat program), is set to be launched in the second quarter of 2013 as a part of the international cubeSat program [1]. One of the objects of ICUBE-1 is to get the students familiarized with the satellite imaging system involving image capture, image analysis, compression, storage and retrieval. The objective is not to get high resolution earth images, but to take low resolution images, store them and successfully send them to ground station. A low resolution camera with low power consumption can be mounted on the satellite to achieve the desired objective. Due to mass and power constraints, communication bandwidth limitations and the passive nature of ICUBE-1 attitude control, the choice of cameras rests very limited. This communication presents a detailed survey of the imaging payloads in general and camera modules in particular, providing guidelines for future miniature satellite developers in choosing a camera module and designing their imaging payloads. The paper will describe the purpose of an imaging payload in miniature satellites, different imaging technologies like CCD &amp; CMOS, camera unit and its interfaces. It will also compare the resolution, power consumption and field of views of different cameras used in miniature satellites and in the end, will also propose a camera module best suited for ICUBE-1.

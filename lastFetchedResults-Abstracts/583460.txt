Background &Objective: In most countries, heart diseases are known as first cause of death among non-contagious diseases and in Iran it is one of the most important causes of death. Therefore assessing risk factors associated with survival of these patients is necessary. In this study, effect of some risk factors on hazard of death of subjects with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is investigated.
Materials & Methods: In this historical cohort study, 197 patients that experience AMI for the first time was studied which were admitted in Bushehr hospitals during 1997-2001. Aalen’s additive hazard model used in this study to assess the relation of death hazard rate after first AMI and risk factors like age at time of infarction, patient’s sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, LDL and HDL.
Results: Average survival time of patients in the present study was more than 4 years. The result showed that there is no significant relation between sex and survival time of patient (p > 0.05) however age at time of infarction has a significant relation with survival of patient (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: According to Aalen’s additive hazard model as age at time of infarction increases, survival risk of AMI patients increases.

The problem of reducing sensitivity to variations of the open-loop system parameters is considered for the case where the objective is to design a feedback controller which drives the open-loop eigenvalues to desired positions. The results are based on the assumption that the open-loop multivariable system is transformed to a phase-variable canonical form prior to the application of the control design procedure.

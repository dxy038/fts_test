The main objective of this study was to identify the type of accidents and car accident
full points, as well as the amount and severity of accidents at urban interchanges.
Assessment of prevailing traffic crashes are based on the crashes involving 10
interchanges that has been occurred over 3 years in the state of Virginia in America.
Analytical Hierarchy Process is used for ranking the safety level of the interchanges
based on competent and qualified experts and data were analyzed. In analyzing
the results, researches conducted in the United States using the TRIS database and
studies in the field of safety in Iran for interchanges were used. The economic assessment
of the costs of accidents, the figures provided by the Safety Council of
America has been applied. Finally it was concluded that major share of accidents
in cloverleaf interchanges are for the entrance and exit ramps and crossover region
and more than 50% of accidents in partial cloverleaf and single point interchanges
occur at the crossroads. Also rear end accident is the most common type of accident
in interchanges and there is no significant difference between the percentages of accident
occurrence. While experts and engineers express that directional interchange
as the safest interchange and because it can be different ways of passing vehicles
and the lack of crossovers.

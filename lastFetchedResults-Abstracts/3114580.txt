Efficient energy storage is one of the greatest concerns for renewable power generation. This paper focuses on the control of a battery management system (BMS) for photovoltaic (PV) applications with a high efficiency bidirectional converter. The proposed BMS control strategy utilizes the dc bus power and battery state of charge (SOC) for the charging and discharging of the battery with a bidirectional converter. The bidirectional converter includes fewer components and switches, has less switching losses with zero voltage switching, and has high gain buck-boost operations. A new control algorithm of charging-discharging control for the battery storage system is proposed. The complete PV system with a boost dc to dc converter controller to regulate the dc link voltage, bidirectional converter based battery charge controller, and an inverter with its associated vector mode controller is implemented in the Simulink/Simpower environment. The simulation results are presented and discussed to verify the validity of the proposed control algorithm.

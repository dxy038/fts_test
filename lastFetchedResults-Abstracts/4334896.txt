Models of important ground/sea targets are often based on the unrealistic assumption that the objects are completely isolated, and thus without interaction with the background or with interaction with a very simplified background model. Thus, the main objective of this project is to develop more advanced theories as well as perform dedicated measurements to get more reliable models and simulation tools.

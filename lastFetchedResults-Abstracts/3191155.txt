The aim of this study is to present a method for solving the planning and expansion problems in the distribution systems in order to determine the location and size of new substations and the development of the existing transformers and to find the optimal structure for feeders and selecting the suitable cross-section for feeders in the presence of wind turbines. The objective function of the problem has been mathematically-formulated considering uncertainty conditions in the presence of wind turbines and a pseudo-dynamic method for multi-stage design. Also the genetic algorithm has been used as an optimization tool for solving the problem. In addition, the performance of the above mentioned method on a distribution network has been discussed as well.

The objective of this paper is to propose a compact method using a novel bias magnet to induce an axial bias-magnetic force in order to reduce the radial vibration of a magnetic bearing (MB) motor. After applying the bias-magnetic force, the optimal radial vibration of the developed MB motor is only around 0.197 g (peak-peak, 1g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2 </sup>) when the natural frequency of the bias magnet reaches the resonant frequency of 62 Hz. In this optimal condition, the ratio in the radial vibration of the MB motor with the bias-magnetic force to the original one is around 89%, and the driving power of 0.24 W is saved

Objective: Oxidative stress down regulates antioxidant enzymes including superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy. N-Acetyl
cysteine (NAC) can enhance the SOD activity, so the aim of this study is to highlight the
inhibitory role of NAC against endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study at QAU from January, 2013 to March,
2013. ET-1 (50 ?g/kg) and NAC (50 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally to 6-day old neonatal
rats in combination or alone. All rats were sacrificed 15 days after the final injection. Histological
analysis was carried out to observe the effects caused by both drugs. Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) analysis and SOD assay were also carried out. Expression level of hypertrophic
marker, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), was detected by western blotting.
Results: Our findings showed that ET-1-induced cardiac hypertrophy leading towards
heart failure was due to the imbalance of different parameters including free radical-induced
oxidative stress and antioxidative enzymes such as SOD. Furthermore NAC acted
as an antioxidant and played inhibitory role against ROS-dependent hypertrophy via regulatory
role of SOD as a result of oxidative response associated with hypertrophy.
Conclusion: ET-1-induced hypertrophic response is associated with increased ROS production
and decreased SOD level, while NAC plays a role against free radicals-induced
oxidative stress via SOD regulation.

The objective of this work is to conduct performance test on horizontal single cylinder variable speed Greaves engine with various blends of cottonseed oil (B5, B10, B15, B20, B40 &amp; B100) and comparing the performance of cottonseed oil with diesel. Blending conventional Diesel Fuel (DF) with esters (usually methyl esters) of vegetable oils is presently the most common form of biodiesel. The most common ratio is 80% conventional diesel fuel and 20% vegetable oil ester, also termed &#8220;B20,&#8221; indicating the 20% level of biodiesel. The TFC and SFC of B20 remains very stable on various loading conditions and the blends B15 and B20 has a moderate NOx and CO emission. The overall comparison shows that B20 diesel with blend 20% yields the optimum value, with less fuel consumption and higher efficiencies than diesel and it is feasible us it in the diesel engine with no modification.

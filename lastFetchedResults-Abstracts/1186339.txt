The objective of this paper is to present an overall approach and to point out the methods and possibilities of a virtual design for actively controlled smart systems with the intention to use the suggested approach and methods for the subsequent prototype and real active systems development. The suggested methods of the virtual design are computer aided, including different software tools used to generate models necessary for the overall virtual design. The basis of the approach is an overall finite element (FE) or a multi-body system (MBS) model of the smart system including the passive parts of the machine or structure as well as the actuators and sensors and the control algorithm.

Weathered soils are used extensively as fill materials in slope construction in tropical and subtropical cities such as Hong Kong. The mechanical behavior of loose decomposed fill materials, particularly in the unsaturated state, has not often been investigated and is not yet fully understood. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanical behavior of loose unsaturated decomposed granitic soil and to study the effects of the stress state, the stress path and the soil suction on the stress-strain relationship, shear strength, volume change, and dilatancy via three series of stress path triaxial tests on both saturated and unsaturated specimens. It was found that loose and saturated decomposed granitic soil behaves like clean sands during undrained shearing. Strain-softening behavior is observed in loose saturated specimens. In unsaturated specimens sheared at a constant water content, a hardening stress-strain relationship and volumetric contractions are observed in the considered range of net mean stresses. The suction of the soil contributed little to the apparent cohesion. The angle of friction appeared to be independent of the suction. In unsaturated specimens subjected to continuous wetting (suction reduction) at a constant deviator stress, the volumetric behavior changed from dilative to contractive with increasing net mean stress and the specimen failed at a degree of saturation far below full saturation. It was revealed that the dilatancy of the unsaturated soil depends on the suction, the state, and the stress path.

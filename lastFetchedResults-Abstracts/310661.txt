Objective. To improve the design of the knee prosthesis, a new technique to design the tibial baseplate of total knee prostheses was developed.

Methods. One senior surgeon operated on 79 osteoarthrosis patients by using PCA total knee prostheses for total knee replacement. Four dimensions were measured intraoperatively and compared, including the anterioposterior length and the mediolateral width of the resected tibia plateau and implant. The data of anterioposterior length and the mediolateral width of resected surfaces of the tibial plateau of the 79 patients were plotted in a coordinate System. This coordinate System was formed with the mediolateral width as the x-axis and anterioposterior length as the y-axis. A circle, 5 mm in diameter, was used as the maximum coverage criterion. Five contemporary products and a new design product were used to screen the data to see how many patients would fall within the criteria. From the results of the screened data, we calculated the coverage percentage of the patients.

Results. The ratio of the anterioposterior length to the mediolateral width of the resected surfaces of the tibial plateau was greater than that of the ratio of the PCA prostheses (P < 0.05). The results showed that no single product on the market had the patients meet over 70% of the criterion. A different ratio of the anterioposterior length to the mediolateral width was designed to achieve 90% coverage of the patients that met the criterion.

Discussion. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between resected surfaces and implants is that the osteoarthrosis patients developed knee deformities that changed the surface of the tibial plateau and thus altered the knee dimensions. Since the total knee prostheses were used on osteoarthrosis patients, the dimensions of the resected tibial surfaces of osteoarthrosis patients should be considered in the design of the tibial baseplate of total knee prostheses.

To understand the neural processes within retina cell layers recent retina implant research focusses on bidirectional communication with bi-polar and ganglion cells in in-vitro retinal tissue. In order to enable this research we had developed a front-end to stimulate and record retinal cell layers with a slight time gap only and thus avoiding long recording dead times. To ease experiments with this front-end, we developed a versatile and user optimized embedded data acquisition device, named iNODE5. This can be configured using a LabVIEW based graphical user interface. We adapted the front-end to the form factor of the commercial measurement device USB-6009OEM from National Instruments. Now, for evaluation and parameter testing the front-end can be plugged into the National Instruments board and controlled via a graphical user interface which enables the export of the basic configuration parameters for later automated standalone measurement and stimulation. For this the front-end is attached to the iNODE5 which reads the experiment configuration from the personal computer via USB or SD-card. The automated electrical stimulation and recording can be started or stopped by a terminal program or a button placed on the iNODE5.

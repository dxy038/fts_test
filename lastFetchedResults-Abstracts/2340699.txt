Background and Objective: Hyperalgesia is one of the marked clinical signs of patients with diabetes mellitus that affects their lifestyle. This study was conducted to assess the anti-nociceptive effect of chronic administration of curcumin in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats using formalin, hot tail immersion, and paw pressure tests.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 40 male rats that were divided into control, curcumin-treated control, diabetic, and curcumin-treated diabetic groups. The treatment groups received i.p. administration of curcumin at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Finally, hyperalgesia were assessed using standard tests. Meanwhile, serum MDA and TNF? level was also measured.
Results: Curcumin treatment of diabetic rats significantly reduced pain score in chronic phase of formalin test (p < 0.05), increased tail flick latency (p < 0.05) and vocalization score (p < 0.05) as compared to diabetic group. Curcumin treatment also decreased serum level of MDA (p < 0.05) and TNF? (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Chronic administration of curcumin has anti-nociceptive property, partly via attenuation of lipid peroxidation and inflammatory processes.

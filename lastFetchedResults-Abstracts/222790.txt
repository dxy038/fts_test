The objective of this paper is to describe an innovative
teaching technique consisting of pedagogy and motivation
as instruments to gradually enhance the interest of Mechanical
Engineering students for minoring in Electrical Engineering. A
study was conducted comparing the performance of 87 students
in four classes majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Temple
University. Confidentially conducted student surveys were statistically
analyzed. In conclusion the number of students opting to
take up a minor in Electrical Engineering gradually increased
from 0 to 36% reflecting the gradual increase in electrical
engineering content, through an emphasis on pedagogical strategy
and the motivation provided.

In binaural synthesis, in order to realize more precise and accurate spatial sound, it would be desirable to measure a large number of the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) in various directions. To reduce the size of the HRTFs, interpolation is often employed, where the HRTF for any direction can be obtained by a limited number of the representative HRTFs. In this paper, it is determined which distortion measure for interpolation of the HRTFs in the horizontal plane is most suitable for predicting audible differences in sound location. Four kinds of HRTF sets, measured using three human heads and one mannequin (KEMAR), were prepared for this study. Using various objective distortion criteria, the differences between interpolated and measured HRTFs were computed. These were then related to the results from the listening tests through receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The results of the present study indicated that for the HRTF sets measured from three human heads, the best predictor of performance was obtained using the distortion measurement computed from the mel-cepstral coefficients, whereas the distortion measurement associated with interaural time delay predicted audible differences in sound location reasonably well for the KEMAR HRTF set. A feasibility test was conducted to verify the usefulness of the selected distortion measurement.

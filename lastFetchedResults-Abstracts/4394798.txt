In this paper, a controller design is introduced for a interleaved dc-dc converter with an LCLC-filter. In order to design an accurate controller of the bidirectional converter, a new model is proposed. First, it introduces the bidirectional converter small-signal model using a state-space averaging method and derives the required transfer functions. Second, transfer functions of the bidirectional converter are derived by using the state-space averaging method. Next, the frequency characteristics of the converter are discussed. Finally, the simulation results are analyzed to verify the proposed state-space model of the bidirectional converter.

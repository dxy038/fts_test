Objective: This study examined the association of plasma DHA, dietary DHA, and fish intake with
dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) in older adults. Design: Case-cohort study. Setting: Clinic visit in
1991-93. Participants: 266 community dwelling men and women aged 67-100 years (mean=80.2).
Measurements: Participants had neurological and neuropsychological evaluations for dementia in 1991-93.
Plasma DHA was measured in blood samples obtained at that visit. Dietary intakes of DHA and fish were
obtained from an earlier (1988-91) visit. Three DHA exposure variables were used in separate analyses;
plasma DHA, dietary DHA, and consumption of cold-water fish. All-cause dementia included AD and other
types of possible or probable dementia. Results: Among these 266 participants, 42 had dementia and 30 had
possible or probable AD. Plasma DHA in the highest tertile was associated with a 65% reduced odds of allcause
dementia (95% CI: 0.17, 0.92) and a 60% reduced odds of AD (95% CI: 0.15, 1.10). Dietary DHA in
the highest tertile was associated with a 73% reduced odds of all-cause dementia (95% CI: 0.09, 0.79) and a
72% reduced odds of AD (95% CI: 0.09, 0.93). Fish intake had similar, though not significant, reduced odds
of dementia (OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.20, 1.32) and AD (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.20, 1.48). Conclusions: Plasma
and dietary DHA appear to protect against dementia. Increasing DHA intake from marine sources may be
recommended for reducing dementia risk.

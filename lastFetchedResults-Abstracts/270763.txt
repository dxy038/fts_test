The objective of this study is to investigate the plane dynamic response of a floating plate
supported by a fluid. The fluid underneath the plate is modeled using two-dimensional incompressible
potential flow theory. The fundamental solutions are obtained first. Once the solution for
the plate displacement is obtained, the other physical quantities of interest-the temporal and
spatial distributions of the slope, moment, shear and even the buoyant force, the inertial force of
the fluid and the inertial force of the plate--can be evaluated numerically. Advantageously, using
superposition and the fundamental solutions presented in this paper, the solution for various loading
cases can be readily obtained. As an application, the dynamic behavior of a forced sub-surface
uplift problem is studied. Comparisons are then made with an added mass model. The results reveal
that the true hydrodynamic model increases the mass and damping of the plate significantly.

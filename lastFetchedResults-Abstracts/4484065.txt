This work analyzes the Real-coded Clonal Selection Algorithm (RCSA) for mono objective optimization in electro-magnetics. This algorithm presents a set of features enabling global search as well as the local improvement of the candidate solutions. An analysis of the sensitivity of the algorithm to its basic parameters shows that it is possible to suggest a basic configuration for the RCSA, narrowing the range of variation of the input parameters and simplifying the use of the algorithm. Results obtained on a test problem show that this algorithm is able to find higher-quality solutions, and also presents faster convergence than similar approaches for the problem considered.

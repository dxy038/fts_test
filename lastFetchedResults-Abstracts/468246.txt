Objective: The objective was to determine a consensus gestational age for labor induction after premature rupture of membranes between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation on the basis of the relative frequencies of adverse neonatal outcomes. Study Design: A retrospective review was undertaken of all patients with premature rupture of membranes between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation. These patients were managed expectantly whenever possible. Neonatal outcomes were stratified by gestational age at rupture of membranes. Results: Two hundred thirty-six patients with rupture of membranes between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation were managed expectantly. Prolongation of pregnancy by ≥1 week was infrequent in all cases, particularly if membrane rupture occurred after 34 weeks’ gestation. Reductions in the neonatal length of stay and the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia were observed at 34 weeks’ gestation with respect to younger gestational ages. No perinatal deaths occurred among the study cases. Conclusions: A “break point” in neonatal morbidity was observed at 34 weeks’ gestation, which supports induction of labor at this gestational age. The short latencies observed limit the potential benefits of expectant management. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:349-52.)

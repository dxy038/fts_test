The risk management and quality control are important contents of the information system project surveillance. On the basis of analyzing the workbench of information system project surveillance, which include information, surveillance, adjusting and communicating and adjusting and communicating sub-system, this paper set up the function model of risk management system which include risk identify, risk evaluation, risk control, risk plan and control mold. Then support vector machine (SVM) molds is applied to evaluate the risk of information system project surveillance and put forward to set up the function model of quality control system which include surveillance mode, quality evaluation, system maintenance and quality management, and Grey relevance decision-making model is applied to decision-making the quality control of information system project surveillance, which decreases the artificial factor as far as possible, and makes evaluation result especially objective.

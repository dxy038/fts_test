This article examines genetic algorithms to solve the forward kinematics problem applied to planar parallel manipulators. Most of these manipulators can be modeled by the tripod 3-RPR. The conversion of an equation system solving problem into an optimization one is investigated. Parallel manipulator kinematics are formulated using the explicit inverse kinematics model (IKM). From the displacement based equation systems, the objective function is formulated specifically for the FKP using one squared error performance criteria. The proposed approach implements an elitist selection process where a new mutation operator for real-coded GA is analyzed. Experiments on a typical manipulator example shows the fast convergence of the proposed method.

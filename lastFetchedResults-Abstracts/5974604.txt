Recent blackouts have fully presented the damage of the cascading overload trip. The basic reason for cascading overload trip is poor global superiority of the back-up protection and existing auto-mechanisms which only focus on action behavior of themselves to cut component, but donÂ´t consider the damage of power transferring and the change of network. This paper first illustrates the meaning of transmission and point that the objective of security protection of transmission is to maintain its integrality and transmission capacity to avoid cascading overload trip. Then, implement condition and key technology are discussed, which are online searching for transmission section, real-time prediction of cascading overload and real-time control to avoid cascading trip on transmission section. This paper has brought forward the primary scheme. Its validity is verified by calculation result of a certain real system.

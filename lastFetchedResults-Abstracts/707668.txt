The objective of this study was to examine the influence of frequent emergency department (ED) use on early returns to the ED at a large rural academic medical center. An analysis was done of all 35,440 visits by 22,442 individuals to a large rural academic medical center ED during calendar year 2000. Of 35,440 ED visits, there were 1,992 (5.62%) return visits within 72 hours (early return). Frequent ED visits (visits made by individuals making 4 or more visits per year) was a predictor of early return visits (odds ratio [OR] 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.93-3.52; Wald χ2, P < .0001). Of 22,442 individuals who came to the ED during the study period, 1,601 (7.13%) returned within 72 hours. Frequency of ED use by a particular individual (4 or more visits per year) was also a predictor of early return for that individual (OR 14.55, 95% CI 12.84-16.48; Wald χ2, P < .000001). The high rate of early returns to this rural academic ED was significantly associated with frequent visits (4 or more times per year) to the ED by particular individual.

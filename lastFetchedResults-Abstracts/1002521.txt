The principal objective of this study was to develop an appropriate, sensitive, and selective method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of phoxim and its photo-transformation product, O,O-diethyl α-cyanobenzylideneamino-thiophosphonate (DCTP) in both chicken and quail eggs. Eggs (1 g) were blended with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (1 g) for sample pretreatment and extracted with acetonitrile. The extracts were then further purified with SPE silica gel tubes deactivated with trimethylamine. Residues were analyzed via a reversed phase-liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC–MS/MS) in positive-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Tebufenozide was utilized as an internal standard for the quantification of phoxim and its metabolite residues. The identification and quantification of analytes were based on ion transitions monitored by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). LC–MS/MS analysis was performed from 0.02 to 1 mg kg−1 and correlation coefficients (r2) ranging from 0.998 to 0.999 were obtained for both analytes in blank egg extracts. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra- and inter-day variations ranged from 2.1% to 6.7% and from 2.8% to 6.4% for phoxim and DCTP in chicken and quail eggs. At all levels of fortification (0.02, 0.05, and 0.125 mg kg−1), the recoveries fell within a range of 81.3% to 93.6% for phoxim and 83.3% to 90.1% for DCTP. The matrix effect was <2%, due to the partial dilution of the sample. Decision limits (CCα) and detection capabilities (CCβ) were in the range of 0.0005–0.0044 and 0.0054–0.0224 mg kg−1, respectively. The method was evaluated further by analyzing real samples purchased from markets. All chicken and quail egg samples were free from residues of the target compounds.

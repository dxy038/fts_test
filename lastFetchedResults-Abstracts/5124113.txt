This paper provides a kind of new linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-based algorithm for multi-objective H2/L2 performance controller synthesis of linear parameter varying systems with on-line measurable dependent parameters, which are assumed to vary in a plant parameter space that is a polytope. The new LMIs enable us to parameterize controllers without involving the Lyapunov variables in the formulation. Taking advantage of this feature, we can readily design multi-objective controllers with non-common parameter-dependent Lyapunov variables and two adjustable scalars, whereas we are forced to employ a common one in the previous approach. Furthermore, to obtain the minimum cost value, the controller synthesis problem is solved with the LMIs-based algorithm by the grid of the space which is combined with these two scalars. Finally, a numerical example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposals.

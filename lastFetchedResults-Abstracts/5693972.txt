This paper is specialized to highlight the method of miniaturization and improvement the patch antenna by using the complementary metamaterial. This method is shown by two structures composed of a patch antenna integrated on its upper surface a cell of a complementary split ring resonator for the first technique. In the second structure, we replace the unit cell with a homogeneous and periodic array contain the elements of complementary split ring resonators. The magnetic resonator is placed at the middle of the radiating patch in parallel with the transmission line and with an orientation angle is fixed to 45 degrees. These two techniques widespread at the traceability applications by wireless communication for RFID technology at the operation frequency 2.45GHz. The objective is to first verify the effect of inclusion the complementary metamaterials with a patch antenna and then show the efficiency and advantage to orient the complementary split ring resonator at an angle 45 degrees. Finally, a comparison made on the two structures in order to propose the perfect technique. All simulation results were made by the CST Microwave Studio.

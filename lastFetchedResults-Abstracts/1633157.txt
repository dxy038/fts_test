The objective was to explore the potential of decanoic acid grafted oligochitosan nanoparticles (CSO-DA NPs) as a carrier for insulin. The insulin-loaded CSO-DA NPs obtained by varying the pH and concentrations of CSO and DA had a particle size of 200.6 Â± 71.2 nm, with an entrapment efficiency and loading efficiency of 61.18% and 5.56%, respectively. An in vitro study of the formulation showed typical burst of insulin and pH-dependent characteristics. The NPs administered by the in situ loop method were effective in lowering the serum glucose level of rats which was based on the synergistic effect of adhesion of CSO and permeation enhancing effect of DA. In particular, the 50 IU/kg-dose of CSO-DA NPs reduced the serum glucose level by 57.18%. Histopathology investigations showed that the CSO-DA NPs had a low toxicity. Therefore, CSO-DA nanoparticles appear to be promising vehicles for insulin transport through the intestinal mucosa.

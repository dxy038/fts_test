The objective of this study was to design a triage system for emergency patients in the pre-hospital EMS phase without special knowledge related to the triage system. For this, we selected the Manchester system considering the pre-hospital emergency situation. Through this study, without the special knowledge about the complex triage system, the paramedics were able to produce the triage result by recording information through a newly designed ambulance report.

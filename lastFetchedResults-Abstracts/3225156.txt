Cement operations increasingly depend on contractor companies to provide specialized skills and expertise. However, relying on contractors carries associated safety risks that are gaining the attention of organizations. If not managed, these risks can lead to regulatory issues, productivity issues, legal action, and eventually a serious injury or death. While cement companies and their contractors have the same objective as it pertains to safety - to prevent all injuries and accidents - it is ultimately the cement companies that determine whether contractors put &#8220;safety first&#8221;. This paper identifies methods through which cement operators may effectively manage the risks associated with utilizing contractors to improve safety results. Topics include managing the contractor during selection and qualification, setting site work expectations, setting enforcement guidelines, and establishing channels of communication.

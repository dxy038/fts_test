The main objective of this paper is to examine how innovativeness (or receptivity to new ideas and innovation) as an aspect of a faculty´s culture affects the faculty´s capacity to innovate. Specifically, the aim of the study is to examine whether participative and open decision making (PDM), support and collaboration (SC), power sharing (PS) and learning and development (LD) have an effect on a faculty´s innovativeness. On average, the respondents perceive that SC (3.39), followed by LD (3.30) and PDM (3.15) affects faculty´s capacity to innovate. Also, Science &amp; Technology lecturers are more likely than their counterparts in Social Science to think that their faculties/departments are innovative, and are less likely to be uncertain of the level of innovativeness.

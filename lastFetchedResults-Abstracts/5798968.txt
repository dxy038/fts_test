Laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS) is a powerful tool for the multielement analysis of a huge variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous samples of industrial relevance. The objective of this paper is to extend the range of elements, which can be analyzed by LIPS, via observation of atomic emission in the VUV range. Two experimental set-ups for VUV-LIPS are presented: a set-up for bulk analysis based on conventional Czerny-Turner monochromator and a new echelle spectrograph for high spectral resolution (&gt;10000) in the spectral range 150-300 nm.

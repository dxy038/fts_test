Purpose: Core stability training (CST) has increased among athletes. The study hypothesis is that neuromuscular training and exercises of central area of trunk, pelvis and hip can reduce injury risk, and specifically peak vertical ground reaction forces in drop landing task. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate kinetics during single leg drop landing test following a CST intervention.
Methods: The present research was a quasi-experimental study with pretest/posttest and a control group. After giving their informed written consent, 30 athletes (15 in the experimental group, and 15 in the control group) volunteered to participate in the training program consisting of CST sessions, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Training group was performed the CST during 8 weeks but control group did not perform these exercises. Kinetics variables in pretest and posttest during single-leg drop landing were measured by motion analysis and force plate device. To compare the obtained data, mixed ANOVA repeated measure at significance level of P<0.05 was used. All analyses were done by SPSS 22.
Results: The results revealed that the peak vertical ground reaction forces, loading rate, and average loading rate significantly reduced following 8 weeks CST intervention (P<0.05).
Conclusion: This study shows evidence that core stability training improves landing kinetics, and may reduce lower extremity injury risk in athletes.

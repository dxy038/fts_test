The objective of this paper is to develop an optimally-sized microgrid system composed of wind turbine, diesel generator and hydrogen-based energy storage system for a remote community. The goal is to meet the instantaneous demand, while minimizing the cost of electricity and adverse impacts of burning fossil fuels on the environment. The wind turbine is the main source of energy. The electrolyser is meant to absorb the excess power and store energy in the form of pressurized hydrogen. The fuel cell is operated to supply the part of demand which cannot be met by wind energy. The diesel generator is used as a back up and operated when wind turbine and fuel cell combined cannot meet the demand. Two scenarios for unit-sizing are described, their economical evaluations are performed, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

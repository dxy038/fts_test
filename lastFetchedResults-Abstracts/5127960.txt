The objective fidelity criteria used in comparing images do not always agree with the subjective fidelity criteria. A new objective fidelity criterion, which is called derivative SNR, is developed in this study and it is compared with a known objective criterion called a.c. SNR. The sensitivity of the human eye to the edges in an image is considered while developing the new criterion. Subjective tests performed on a group of observers show that the subjective decisions agree more with the new and less with the old objective criteria

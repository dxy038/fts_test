A high current, forced water cooled bus system is analyzed, which forms part of the electrode arms in a three-phase electric arc furnace between the flexible cables and the electrode holders. Due to the electrical imbalance of the three-phase secondary high-current network, unbalanced power input has caused design and operating problems. The analysis presented deals with the bus-enclosure system with the objective to analyze the different enclosure arrangements, and to control the electrical parameters. The calculated results are substantiated by measurements, indicating that the enclosure dimensions and its material do influence the electrical parameters considerably. Some optimization can be done thereby placing less demand on the cooling system

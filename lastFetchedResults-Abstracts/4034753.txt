Advanced technologies have changed the nature of business processes in the form of services. In coordinating services to achieve a particular objective, service workflow is used to control service composition, execution sequences as well as path selection. Since existing mechanisms are insufficient for addressing the diversity and dynamicity of the requirements in a large-scale distributed environment, developing formal requirements specification is necessary. In this paper, we propose a Service Workflow Specification language, called SWSpec, which allows arbitrary services in a workflow to formally and uniformly impose their requirements. As such, the solution will provide a formal way to regulate and control workflows as well as enrich the proliferation of service provisions and consumptions in opened environments.

Although some researchers have studied the humanoid running based on simplified models, the issue of humanoid running based on the whole dynamics has not been sufficiently discussed before. The objective of this paper is to study the stability criterion and the dynamic pattern generation for humanoid running based on the whole dynamics. First, the cycle and the dynamics of running are analyzed. Next, the stability criterion of humanoid running is presented. Then, the method to plan a running pattern consisting of a foot trajectory and a hip trajectory is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by the dynamic simulation examples in DADS (Dynamic Analysis and Design System).

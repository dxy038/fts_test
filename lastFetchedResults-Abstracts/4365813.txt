The nongovernment universities of Bangladesh started their operation in the early 1990s with the major objective of reducing outflow of students by giving quality education. Even after a decade, the performance of the nongovernment universities of Bangladesh is found below the standard average. Though a few of them are performing a little above average, in general most of the universities have a lot of scope to improve. The areas where the universities are particularly weak in performance are human resource development and management, and customer focus and satisfaction. They are doing moderate in the areas of quality and operational results, leadership, information and analysis. In the areas of management of process quality, and strategic quality planning the performance is a little better. Hence the universities can focus more on its human resources (e.g., faculty and staff development), highlighting customer needs (e.g., quality education, better library facility, laboratory facilities, internship assistance, etc.). Strong leadership is also found paramount important in efficient running of the universities

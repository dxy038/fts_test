This paper presents a novel DC-DC converter configuration, which successfully integrates two technologies, including switched-capacitor and switched-coupled-inductor into one converter. By adopting coupled-inductor to charge switched-capacitor, the voltage gain can be effectively increased and the turns ratio of coupled-inductor can also be reduced. Not only lower conduction losses but also higher power conversion efficiency is benefit from lower part count and turns ratios. The proposed converter is simply composed of six components, which can be further derivated to varied converters for different purposes, such as bidirectional converter or interleaved DC-AC inverter. The operating principle and steady-state analysis are discussed in this paper. A 250 W laboratory hardware prototype is completed and verified. The voltage gain is up to 11. The highest efficiency is 97.2 % and the full load efficiency is kept at 93.6%.

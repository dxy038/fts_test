Objective
m of this study was to compare the in vitro osteo/odontogenic differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the dental pulp (dental pulp stem cells – DPSCs) or the apical papilla (stem cells from the apical papilla – SCAP) of permanent developing teeth.

and SCAP cultures were established from impacted third molars of young healthy donors at the stage of root development. Cultures were analysed for stem cell markers, including STRO-1, CD146, CD34 and CD45 using flow cytometry. Cells were then induced for osteo/odontogenic differentiation by media containing dexamethasone, KH2PO4 and β-glycerophosphate. Cultures were analysed for morphology, growth characteristics, mineralization potential (Alizarin Red method) and differentiation markers (dentine sialophosphoprotein-DSPP, bone sialoprotein-BSP, osteocalcin-OCN, alkaline phosphatase-ALP), using immunocytochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
s
SCs and SCAP cultures were positive for STRO-1, CD146 and CD34, in percentages varying according to cell type and donor, but negative for CD45. Both types of MSCs displayed an active potential for cellular migration, organization and mineralization, producing 3D mineralized structures. These structures progressively expressed differentiation markers, including DSPP, BSP, OCN, ALP, having the characteristics of osteodentin. SCAP, however, showed a significantly higher proliferation rate and mineralization potential, which might be of significance for their use in bone/dental tissue engineering.
sions
tudy provides evidence that different types of dental MSCs can be used in tissue engineering/regeneration protocols as an approachable stem cell source for osteo/odontogenic differentiation and biomineralization that could be further applied for stem cell-based clinical therapies.

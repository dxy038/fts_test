In this paper, an asymmetrical &#915;Z-source hybrid power converter is proposed for fuel cell-battery hybrid vehicle application. The converter uses an asymmetrical &#915;Z-source converter to interface the fuel cell and a bidirectional DC-DC converter to interface the battery. Via the DC-DC converter, the capacitor voltage of the asymmetrical &#915;Z-source converter can be controlled into a constant value. By adjusting the modulation index of the inverter, the fuel cell voltage can be controlled into the reference value, which can ensure high operation efficiency in the fuel cell. To reduce the number of semiconductor switching in the shoot through states, the space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM) control method is implemented for achieve the maximum constant boost control for the asymmetrical &#915;Z-source inverter. To verify the validity of the proposed power converter topology and the control methods, the real-time simulation model is performed in Opal-RT Real Time Digital Simulator. The simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed methods.

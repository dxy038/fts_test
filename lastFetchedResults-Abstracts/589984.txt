In reality, scheduling consists of  assignment resources in order to perform a set of tasks in a given time horizon. Since open shop environment occurs most in real world, an appropriate and exact model presentation will be a major aid for managers and industrials. Exact data expression in scheduling problem, usually is impossible. Unforeseen events and faults in Measurment cause uncertain information. Since in operation research problems,  uncertainty in data and information expression from decider lead to analysis the problem with uncertain coefficient, in this paper we consider a novel modeling for open shop scheduling with interval coefficient and parameters. The most important features for our model, are dependent removal time, setup time separated from processing time and considering inaccessibility time for machines in order to repairing, break time of workers, etc. The objective of proposed model is to minimize the total weighted tardiness. Computational results  and implementing on AIMMS software present the application of model in finding optimal solution in appropriate time.

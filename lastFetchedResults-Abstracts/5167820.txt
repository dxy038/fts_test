We report on a microelectrode array for bidirectional communication (stimulation and recording) with electrogenic cells, for e.g., observing neuronal information processing in vitro. The chip overcomes the interconnect challenge that limits todayÂ´s bidirectional microelectrode arrays. The array has been fabricated in industrial CMOS-technology with post-CMOS processing and comprises all necessary control circuitry and on-chip A/D-conversion. Measurements from neural cell cultures with amplitudes of 500 &#956;V are presented.

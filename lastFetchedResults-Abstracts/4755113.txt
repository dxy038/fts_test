Currently, the request for SOA development and implementation (Service Oriented Architectures) does not cease growing. Service oriented modeling requires additional activities and artifacts that are not found in the object analysis and design approaches. This work presents elements of Analysis and service oriented design and describes the insufficiency of the object approach and the SOA necessary need. The objective of this paper is to define the required techniques for the identification, the specification and the realization of services, their flows and composition, as well as their required quality. With this intention, we propose a business processes based modeling, functional modeling, object modeling and service identification and structuring.

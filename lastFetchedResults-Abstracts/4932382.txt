The ability to quantify Quality of Experience (QoE, i.e. the users´ subjective perception of the ´overall acceptability of an application or service´), will play a major role in the success of future multimedia services such as mobile video watching. Such QoE-evaluations are however still challenging, especially in real life (or so-called ´Living Lab´), user settings. According to our knowledge, this paper is the first to present a methodology for the multi-dimensional quantification of QoE during mobile video watching in real-life settings. A measurement study drawing on the evaluation of objective and subjective QoE aspects by a user panel resulted in a model for quantifying QoE during mobile video watching based on user behavior and technical parameters such as network and video quality.

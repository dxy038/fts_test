Digital micro fluidic biochip (DMFB) has gained much importance in recent times, which supports various on chip biological sample analysis. The analysis is performed on a two dimensional micro array. Significant researches are going on for high performance droplet routing in DMFB using computer aided design (CAD) techniques. This paper proposes a bio inspired multi objective optimization technique for multiple droplet routing in single source-single destination net (two pin net) and also for dual source - single destination net (three pin net). Our proposed method is based on ant colony optimization (ACO) technique that optimizes the number of electrode usage and routing completion time simultaneously. We run our algorithm on in-vitro, and some other existing benchmarks, and experimental results show improvement in most of the cases.

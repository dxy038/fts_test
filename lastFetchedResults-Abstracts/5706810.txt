Construction of the Petrochemical Complex of Rio de Janeiro (COMPERJ) will introduce a new scenario to the Guapi-Mirim Environmental Protection Area (EPA) in the coming years, since it will require constant environmental monitoring so as to portray its ecological evolution. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to perform a multi-temporal analysis of the Guapi-Mirim EPA, using object-based segmentation and classification techniques applied to IKONOS II images, in order to characterize changes in land use and cover types in the investigated site. Two scenes of the IKONOS II sensor acquired on 2006 and 2008 were chosen for the study. Overall results reveal a regeneration stage for the mangrove ecosystem and a stagnation of the urban area growth within the limits of the Guapi-Mirim EPA.

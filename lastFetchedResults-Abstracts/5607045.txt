We restate the objective of the first workshop on Collaboration and Cloud Computing" in WETICE 2009; "to analyze current trends in Cloud Computing and identify longterm research themes and facilitate collaboration in future research in the field that will ultimately enable global advancements in the field that are not dictated or driven by the prototypical short term profit driven motives of a particular corporate entity." We are glad to report that the discussions started in 2009 have directly resulted in an alternative approach to self-managing distributed computing systems totally different from current industry trend showing a way to eliminate the complexity of virtual machines and Hyper visors. If this approach is proven to be theoretically sound (as a paper in this conference is investigating) and extend its usefulness (demonstrated through their feasibility in the form of two proofs of concepts in the last conference) to mission critical environments, the DIME network architecture may yet prove to be an important contribution to computer science. In addition to the two papers related to the DIME computing model, there are nine other long papers and three short papers selected out of twenty two submissions discussing various aspects of clouds, grids and their management.

The objective of this work is to study the effect of a frictional interface on the extent of
interfaci,%l debonding and internal stress distribution within a unidirectional ceramic matrix composite
under thermo-mechanical loading. The configuration considered is a concentric cylinder with
an annular crack in the axial plane of the matrix while the fiber-matrix interface is made to obey
the Coulomb friction law. The present approach of employing a variational model is shown to
satisfy all boundary and inequality conditions in the slip and stick regions and at the slip-stick
transition point. The results are also shown to be in very good agreement with a numerical elasticity
solution for points away from the matrix crack tip while some of the peculiarities near the crack tip
associated with the numerical solution are identified. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

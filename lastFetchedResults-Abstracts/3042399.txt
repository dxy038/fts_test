The objective of this paper is to study the effects of some systematic distortions such as periodic and aperiodic surface errors on the performance of membrane reflector antennas. As a case study, a cylindrical parabolic reflector antenna is studied in detail. This membrane reflector is the half scale model of a proposed precipitation radar antenna in the PR-2 mission. The performance of an aperiodic distorted reflector is simulated by introducing analytical models of distortions and representative results are also presented. These are important considerations for evaluation of large deployable membrane reflector antennas for the PR-2 mission.

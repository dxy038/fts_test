This paper presents a novel concept of utilizing PV solar farm inverter as STATCOM, termed PV-STATCOM, for improving stable power transfer limits of the interconnected transmission system. The entire inverter rating of PV solar farm which remains dormant in the nighttime is utilized with voltage and damping controls to enhance stable power transmission limits. During daytime, the inverter capacity left after real power production is used to accomplish the above objective. Transient stability studies are conducted on a realistic single machine infinite bus power system having a midpoint located PV-STATCOM using EMTDC/PSCAD simulation software. The PV-STATCOM improves the stable transmission limits substantially in the night and also in the day even while generating large amounts of real power. Power transfer increases are also demonstrated in the same power system for i) two solar farms operating as PV-STATCOMs, and ii) a solar farm as PV-STATCOM and an inverter based wind farm with similar STATCOM controls. This novel utilization of PV solar farm asset can thus improve power transmission limits which would have otherwise required expensive additional equipment such as, series/shunt capacitors, or separate Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) Controllers.

This paper presents a novel model-based design procedure for ouput-based switching policies of discretely controlled continuous systems (DCCS). The design objective is to stabilize a prespecified periodic operation while satisfying a quadratic performance critieron. As a key contribution, it is shown how to reformulate the original design problem in terms of an equivalent periodic dynamic output-feedback problem of specific structure. The solution ot the latter problem is given based on sufficient LMI conditions, which can be numerically tested for feasibility.

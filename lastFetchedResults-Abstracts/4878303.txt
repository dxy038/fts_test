The I/O routine in network storage has longer transferring time and overhead than local I/O. To well make use of the storage network bandwidth and meet demand of concurrent I/O requests, we need to find the appropriate schedule policy for I/O requests at the level of the network. The focus in the paper is on how to schedule concurrent I/O data transferring in share storage network, and to improve performance such as the response time affected by scheduling method. Our objective is to analysis the response time of concurrent requests as function their schedule order such as the sequenced, parallel and hybrid policies. We then verify our results by both the analytical method and experiment

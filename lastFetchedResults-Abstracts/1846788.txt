The objective of this study to determine a suitable scan timing scheme in contrast enhanced MRA for the depiction of the arterial, the portal and the systemic venous system in the abdomen with maximum signal intensity in healthy subjects and in patients with cirrhosis. The signal intensity in the aorta, hepatic artery, portal vein, left renal vein and the supra- and infrarenal IVC were measured in 40 consecutive orthotopic liver transplantation candidates with cirrhosis and 20 healthy renal donors in a bolus triggered arterial scan and after 30, 60, 90 and 150 s respectively. The aorta and hepatic artery showed the highest signal intensity on the arterial scan. The portal and left renal vein showed the highest signal intensity after 30 s, the suprarenal IVC after 60 s and the infrarenal IVC after 90 s. No significant differences were found between healthy subjects and patients with cirrhosis. The arterial, portal and systemic venous system in the abdomen can be visualized selectively with maximum signal intensity by proper timing of the scans, hereby reducing redundant scans. Scanning at just the right time to achieve optimal vessel opacification can be promoted by using data from this study. The proposed scan scheme is suitable for subjects with and without cirrhosis.

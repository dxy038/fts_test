Objective
Refractory convulsive Status Epilepti cus (SE) which does not respond to first line drugs (benzodiazepines, phenytoin and phenobarbital) heralds an emergen cy condition in pediatric neurology which can cause irreparable brain damage. There is no consensus on the choice of drug treatm ent for refractory generalized convulsive status epil epti cus in children. Lidocaine is a valuable forgotten antiepil epti c agent with favorabl e properties which include prompt responses, less alteration of consciousness, and fewer adverse effects such as respiratory depression.
Materials & Methods
In a retrospective study conducted to investigate clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous lidocaine in treating refractory generalized convul sive SE of children, the medi cal record s of 13 patients admitted to the Shaheed Sadoughi Hospital of Yazd between 2003 and 2005 and treated with intraven ous lidocaine, were reviewed.
Results
13 pati ents, 7 girls and 6 boys (average age 3 years, SD=2.7years) were treated with lidocaine. Neurodevelopmental delay was seen in 38.5 %, and in 46.2% of them EEG and neuroimaging abnormalities were observed. Seizures ceased in eight patients (61/5 %), with out any und esirable side effects. Two patients had to be intubated because of non-responsiveness to lidocaine, and other treatments were begun .M ean duration of ICU stay was 4.77 days, SD= 3days.
Conclusion
It is recommended that lidocaine be used as a second-line, anticonvulsive drug in the treatment of status epilepticus, especially when faced with unavailability of appropriate respir atory care and intubation equipment.

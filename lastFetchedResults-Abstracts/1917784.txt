The objective of this study was to determine whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) correlate with progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Secondarily, the long-term effect of oral estradiol on hs-CRP and sICAM-1 were determined. Data were analyzed from 180 healthy postmenopausal women aged 45 to 80 years randomly assigned to either unopposed micronized 17β-estradiol 1 mg/day or placebo in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT). Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), hs-CRP, and sICAM-1 were measured at baseline and every 6 months thereafter for 2 years. Unopposed 17β-estradiol significantly increased hs-CRP (p = 0.01) and decreased sICAM-1 compared with placebo (p = 0.04). Changes in hs-CRP and sICAM-1 did not correlate with changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness. In conclusion, although unopposed 17β-estradiol significantly altered hs-CRP and sICAM-1, neither marker was associated with progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.

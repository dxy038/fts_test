Delay is a significant parameter that is used in the optimization of signal settings for intersections and the estimation of the level of service at signalized intersections, and it is also a parameter that is difficult to estimate. Based on the existing theory of delay at signalized intersection, this paper analyzes the delay at a signalized intersection of each phase for entrance with the arrival and departure diagram for under-saturated and over-saturated conditions. Then, a delay model for signalized intersection is put forward. After that, the cycle length is discussed with delay minimization as an optimal objective based on the delay model of signalized intersection. A possible reason for the optimal cycle length being as small as possible in the minimal delay model is proposed at last.

The objective of this study was to develop a technique for analysing 14 flavour components, relevant for specialty malts. Therefore, a method was developed for the analysis of these components in dry ground malt using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. A procedure was optimised for the optimal amount of sample, fibre selection, extraction temperature and extraction time. Afterwards, the method was calibrated and validated by the quantification of the specialty malt flavour components in a colour, a caramel and a roasted malt.

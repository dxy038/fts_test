Many applications today require more computing power than offered by a traditional sequential computers. High performance computing requires parallel processing. Parallelism is utilized to depict executions that physically execute at the same time with the objective of taking care of a complex issue quicker. Multicore processing means code working on more than one core of a single CPU chip and is a subset of Parallel Processing and Multicore utilization means that efficient usage of CPU. In parallel processing, program instructions are divided among multiple processors with the goal of executing the same program in less time compared to sequential processing. Applications programs related to sorting and searching are developed encapsulating parallel processing and are tested on huge database. Experimental results based on bubble sort and linear search show that it is easier to get work done if load is shared and also quicker by parallel processing with multicore utilization compared to sequential processing.

The critical issue that confronts peer-to-peer networks is the efficient location of the node that stores a desired data item. Chord is a successful resource location protocol based on distributed hash table. However, if the desired data item is stored on a node that is count-clockwise close to the query node on the chord ring, the lookup latency might be high because of its clockwise lookup strategy. We optimize the lookup algorithm to reduce routing latency and present a bidirectional parallel lookup strategy for chord (BP-Chord). Simulation results show that BP-Chord can improve lookup performance.

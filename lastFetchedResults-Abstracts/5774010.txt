We conducted driving simulator experiments with 65 participants and investigated drivers acceptance of multiple warnings (visual and auditory displays) including forward collision warning system and lateral collision warning system while driving on Metropolitan Expressway. Three kinds of warning presentation timing (normal, long, and very long) and two kinds of sound sources of the auditory message (with and without separate placed speakers) were used in the experimental trials. We evaluated drivers acceptance of the multiple warnings by means of subjective assessment techniques as well as the behavior assessment. The results of subjective and objective measurement suggest that drivers prefer to longer warning presentation timing for accurate understanding of the provided warnings and the separate placed speakers contribute to an easy detection of the lateral collision warning via the provided sound.

Objective
t the efficacy of a previously described neutralising agent to counteract any antimicrobial activity of 0.2% of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthrinse on the salivary flora, which is only exhibited after sampling of surviving bacteria, resulting in false positive efficacy data.
s
ulated salivary samples were collected of 20 volunteers under basal conditions and at 30 s and 1 h after of a single mouthrinse of 0.2% CHX. Each salivary sample was divided into 2 equal aliquots; one was mixed with neutralising agent (3% Tween 80, 0.3% lecithin and 0.1% cysteine) and the other with a control solution. The colony forming units (cfu/mL) were determined and expressed as logarithms (log10 cfu/mL).
s
eline, the total bacterial concentrations were similar, independently of the addition of neutralising solution or control solution (8.419 ± 0.346 log10 cfu/mL and 8.462 ± 0.474 log10 cfu/mL, respectively, p = 0.440). At 30 s performing the CHX mouthrinse, the bacterial load reduction was statistically significant between both sampling methods (1.917 ± 1.275 log10 cfu/mL, p &lt; 0.001). One hour after performing the CHX mouthrinse, the bacterial load reduction was statistically significant between both sampling methods (0.537 ± 0.706 log10 cfu/mL, p = 0.003).
sions
lising agent was not toxic to the bacterial salivary flora and effectively deactivated the “residual antimicrobial activity” of the 0.2% CHX (after exposure and during processing of samples). We propose the use of this neutralising agent when evaluating the antibacterial activity of CHX mouthrinses.

A system for mesoscale analyses of selected variables has been developed. The analysed parameters
are of general interest in operational weather forecasting, but normally not available
from NWP systems, or available, but with a significantly lower quality than achieved by the
mesoscale analysis system. A supplementary objective is to produce initial information to be
used for now-casting techniques. Examples of parameters are precipitation, temperature, humidity,
visibility, wind and clouds. The basis of the analysis system is the optimal interpolation
technique (OI). The use of observations from automatic stations, radars and satellites have
been investigated. The investigation indicates that a dense network of ordinary precipitation
gauge measurements can produce more accurate analyses than more elaborate systems like
radar that suffers from anomalous echoes and other errors.

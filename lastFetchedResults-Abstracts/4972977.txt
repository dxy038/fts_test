This paper presents a modified FCM algorithm for segmentation of MRI. The proposed method has introduced by modifying the objective function of the standard FCM and it has the advantage that it can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis. The proposed method can deal with the intensity in-homogeneities and image noise effectively. have compared our results with other reported methods. The results using real MRI data show that our method provides better results compared to standard FCM-based algorithms and other modified FCM-based techniques.

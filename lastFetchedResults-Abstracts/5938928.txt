Software engineering surveillance of information technology is an important part of project surveillance. In all phases of software engineering surveillance, surveillance units have developed software units in response to the construction of an objective and reasonable comprehensive evaluation. This article introduces the Safety Surveillance and Management in software engineering and software engineering related to a target, through the study of this indicator to enable a more effective surveillance units to assist owners to complete units in the various steps of software engineering, which gives a more objective assessment.

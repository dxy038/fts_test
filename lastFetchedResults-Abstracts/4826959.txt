We report about design and construction of the bidirectional transceiver module for subscriber part of the passive optical network PON for a fiber to the home FTTH topology. The TRx module consists of a epoxy novolak resin polymer planar lightwave circuit PLC hybrid integration technology with volume holographic grating triplex filter VHGT, surface-illuminated photodetectors and spot-size converted Fabry-Perot laser diode in SMD package. The hybrid PLC has composed from a two parts - polymer optical waveguide and VHGT filter section and a optoelectronic microwave section. The both parts are placed on the composite substrate.

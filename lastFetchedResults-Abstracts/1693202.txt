This paper presents two procedures for the identification of material parameters, a genetic algorithm and a gradient-based algorithm. These algorithms enable both the yield criterion and the work hardening parameters to be identified. A hybrid algorithm is also used, which is a combination of the former two, in such a way that the result of the genetic algorithm is considered as the initial values for the gradient-based algorithm. The objective of this approach is to improve the performance of the gradient-based algorithm, which is strongly dependent on the initial set of results. The constitutive model used to compare the three different optimization schemes uses the Barlatâ€™91 yield criterion, an isotropic Voce type law and a kinematic Lemaitre and Chaboche law, which is suitable for the case of aluminium alloys. In order to analyse the effectiveness of this optimization procedure, numerical and experimental results for an EN AW-5754 aluminium alloy are compared.

This paper presents results obtained from four extensive field trials of medium wave DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) which were carried out in Madrid (Spain), Delhi (India) and Mexico D.F. (Mexico) using different transmission frequencies. The objective is to provide medium wave field strength spatial variability values for urban environments using empirical analysis methodology. The influence of the transmission frequency on medium wave propagation in urban environments is included. Both, long and short term components of the signal spatial variability are studied characterizing wide, medium and narrow streets, and the attenuation caused by different urban fast variation occurrences is statistically featured. All the results presented in this paper are essential for future network planning of new emerging digital broadcasting services and have been validated using the Generalized Lee Method.

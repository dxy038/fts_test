Understanding the information gathered thus far in a criminal investigation is of great importance, particularly in terms of guiding its future course. Since the late 1980Â´s the use of software tools to provide visualisations of this information has become increasingly common. The objective of such tools is to provide, in a readily comprehensible way, the social network of all the people involved. This may include the victims, suspects, witnesses, acquaintances and locations of interest in the investigation such as workplaces or nightclubs. Such diagrammatic representations often provide the focus for discussion among the investigating team and are incrementally added to as new facts are discovered. In this paper we present a brief overview of this important subject area and discuss how such software products could be further enhanced. We also present an example that illustrates the basic principles using a demonstrator we developed.

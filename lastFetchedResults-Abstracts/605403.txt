Objective(s): To assess the reliability and validity of the Q-LES-QSF in Iran.
Methods: The Q-LES-QSF includes 14 items. Each item was graded in 1-5 scale, and total score was converted to maximal percentage. This scale English version was translated to Persian through back & forward method. Demographic data questionnaire, one item life satisfaction scale and SWLS were also used. The samples were selected using random stratified method in Kashan Nursing & Midwifery Faculty (n=161).Reliability was determined via internal consistency (Item total Correlation, Cronbach’s alpha, and split-half) and stability (test re-test). Validity was determined via Criterion-Related validity (Concurrent V) and Construct Validity (Known-groups approach). The data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient, Intraclass correlation coefficient, Equal-Length spearman-brown, Guttman and independent t-test by SPSS-11.
Results: In 0-100 scale, Subjective well-being score was 57.04±19.17. The questionnaire reliability coefficient was 0.93-0.96. Item-total correlation and test re-test confirmed its reliability too. Its concurrent validity with SWLS (r=0.71, P < 0.0001) and one item life satisfaction scale(r=0.78, P < 0.0001) was confirmed. The known-groups approach also revealed this tool is valid (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion: The Q-LES-QSF Persian version for evaluation of subjective well-being in the university students is valid and reliable. It’s suggested after the revision in the question of “satisfaction with sexual activity or interests “more studies are carried out.

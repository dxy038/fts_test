This paper presents a dual converter employed as a rectifier with power factor regulation and bidirectional power flow. The active and reactive powers flowing into the converter is controlled using an optimized direct-power-control algorithm. The multilevel structure of the converter is exploited to control the voltage level in each subconverter by selecting the modulation method from one commonly found in the literature, with the option of clamping one of the subconverters. These modulation methods are used to control the power taken by each subconverter, providing limited dc-link voltage regulation. The system is first simulated in SIMULINK, and the results are experimentally validated using a digital-signal-processor-based test rig.

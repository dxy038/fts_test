Thermoelectric technology, in particular, thermoelectric power generation technology, has been recognized as one of the major energy conservation technologies in Japan. Recent outstanding results on the thermoelectric performance for various kinds of thermoelectric materials such as layered Co-based oxides, filled skutterudites etc. show a good potential for achieving high ZT values. These results encouraged and accelerated R&amp;D activities of thermoelectric technology in Japan. This paper provides an overview of the present state of research and development on thermoelectric technology in Japan, and some prospects for the future. R&amp;D results on thermoelectric energy recovery systems from solid waste combustion heat and from waste heat of gasoline engine vehicle carried out under several national projects is briefly introduced. Some of R&amp;D activities of an enhancement of thermoelectric materials by universities and national research institutes are also presented as an example. The R&amp;D effort of the lead-in research on the efficient thermoelectric module including novel high performance materials and proof-of-concept testing supported by NEDO, in which the objective is to arrange the coming national project on thermoelectric technology, is introduced. The development on thermoelectric cooling has been mainly carried out in private companies, which is not included in this paper. The potential contribution of thermoelectric technology to an energy system in Japan and the perspective on thermoelectric power generation technology are summarised

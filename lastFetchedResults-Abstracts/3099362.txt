Most existing stereoscopic head mounted displays (HMDs), presenting a pair of stereoscopic images at a fixed focal distance, lack the ability to correctly render the naturally coupled accommodation and convergence cues. Psychophysical studies have shown that such displays may cause many adverse consequences such as visual fatigue, diplopic vision, degraded oculomotor response, and depth perception errors. In this paper, we present a see-through HMD with addressable focal planes utilizing a novel active optical element - a liquid lens. The element, with a varying optical power from -5 to 20 diopters, is able to address the focal distance of the HMD from infinity to the near point of the eye. A monocular prototype was built from off-the-shelf elements and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed designs. We also describe both subjective and objective measurements of the accommodation responses of the viewer to the focal distances presented by the prototype.

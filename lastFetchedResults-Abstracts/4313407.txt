Information system innovation has become a hot issue because increasing enterprises have to depend on the innovation behaviors to get the better performance from information systems. The objective of this paper is to deeply understand information system innovation behaviors by examining organizational innovation climate factors. The paper proposes two patterns of information system innovation behaviors based on the exploitation &amp; exploration innovation theories from organizational management literature. Then with the deep interviews from some enterprises in Chinese, it builds four dimensions of IT innovation climate. Next the paper develops a research model to link four dimensions with two patterns of information system innovation behaviors. To test this model and proposed hypotheses, it collects the questionnaire from 192 enterprises. Data results support the research model and most hypotheses with structural equation model (SEM) and other statistics software. Finally test results are discussed and implications are given.

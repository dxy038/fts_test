The main objective of this study is to develop an algorithm that is capable of detecting the presence of human based on motion and background subtraction technique along with post-morphology processes to extract the foreground pixels from its background thus separating the human silhouette. The extracted silhouette information can later be used for traffic monitoring and analysis, human tracking and monitoring, video surveillance since silhouette-based technique tend to offer speed and simplicity. Results obtained indicate that the developed algorithm achieves its objective and successfully extract human silhouette from the analyzed video scenes.

Objective: The HLA region on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3) contains the most polymorphic coding sequences in the human genome. The frequency of HLA class I alleles and their linkage disequilibrium patterns differ significantly among human populations that determination of this variation is very important in, for example, Anthropology, disease susceptibility studies and organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to find out the frequency of HLA class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) loci at the allele level by serologic methods.
Subjects and Methods:The frequency of HLA-A, B and C antigens were determined by serologic method in 1420 subjects from ethnic groups living in Khuzestan province. Results: The most frequent class I alleles of the ethnic groups living in Khouzestan province were HLA-A2 (37.2%), -B35 (51.4%) and -CW4 (29.1%).
Conclusion: This study is the first report of HLA class I antigens frequencies in Khouzestan province. These data should therefore be useful for anthropologic studies, transplantation settings and for studies on the associations between HLA haplotypes and diseases in this population.

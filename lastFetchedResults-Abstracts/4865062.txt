In order to deal with model-reality difference, the model coefficients of large-scale industrial processes are treated as fuzzy numbers and then an interaction balance method (IBM) based on a fuzzy model is proposed. From the viewpoint of practice, the fuzzy model provides more information about real processes than the crisp model. Three types of interaction balance method: open-loop IBM, IBM with global feedback and IBM with double iterative technique are studied. Simulation results show that the approach proposed provides a faster convergence and a better objective function than that based on a crisp model. Furthermore, the IBM with double iterative technique based on global feedback and fuzzy parameters is the coordination method by which the fewest numbers of online iteration can be obtained

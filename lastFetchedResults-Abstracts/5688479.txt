This paper presents a model with 11 degrees of Freedom (DoF) describing the dynamics of a motorcycle. The bike is equipped with several sensors and a wireless communication set. The main objective is to identify the dynamic parameters and evaluate the couplings between the different submodel blocs of the whole studied system. The passivity approach is used and properties are illustrated by simulation results obtained with the Laboratory simulator SimK106N prototype. An identification method is proposed to estimate the dynamic parameters.

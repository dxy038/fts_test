This paper presents a methodology to design automatically a QFT (Quantitative Feedback Theory) robust controller for plants with model uncertainty. The method proposed has as objective to find a QFT robust controller that fulfills the control specifications for the whole set of plant models, without including parameter controller restrictions. The methodology is based on a global optimization and has been solved using a global mixed-integer nonlinear programming. The design of an active control for vibration attenuation in optical interferometers is used to validate the technique.

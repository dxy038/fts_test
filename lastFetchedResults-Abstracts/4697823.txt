This article is based on the original Range-Doppler (RD) algorithm and proposed an improved algorithm. The original algorithm has certain second phase error and no compensation, improved algorithm on the basis of the original algorithm which uses the nearest domain interpolation on range migration correction, increases the secondary range compression and uses the sinc interpolation for range migration correction, in a certain extent, realizes the second phase error compensation. Uses the subjective and objective image quality assessment standards to analyse the improved image quality. Compared to the original RD algorithm, the improved algorithm of information entropy and standard deviations have improved, through the simulation verify the feasibility of the algorithm improved.

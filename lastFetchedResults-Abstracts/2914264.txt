The paper analyzes what causal connections lie behind negative attitudes and experiences of automation and the use of technology in such projects. A number of reasons and phenomena are described. Using knowledge about these, ongoing development towards resistance and even contempt for technology can be avoided. The objective with use of technology, is to ensure that it is beneficial, supports human work and that the introduction and use of it fulfils the business goals of the company. But, as humans are an integral part of a company, acceptance must be ensured from those who will use the technology. In that respect, the technology itself becomes a minor factor and the process of the introduction of technology and how it shall perform becomes more important!

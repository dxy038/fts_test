Objective: The objectives of this study were to determine whether cytokine levels in cervical secretions were increased in the presence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes and to relate concentrations to cytokine levels in amniotic fluid, cervicovaginal microflora, and the presence of chorioamnionitis.
Study Design: Cervical secretions were sampled immediately before amniocentesis in 92 patients admitted for preterm labor with singleton pregnancies and intact membranes. Amniotic fluid was cultured and the following cytokines were measured in amniotic fluid and cervical secretions: interleukin-1β, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. The cervicovaginal microflora and placentas (n=42) were also analyzed.
Results: A total of 19.56% (18/92) of the amniotic fluid cultures had positive results. All the cytokines tested showed significantly higher levels in cervical secretions in the presence of intraamniotic infection. There were significant relationships between the concentrations of interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in amniotic fluid and cervical secretions. A concentration of interleukin-6 in cervical secretions >410 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 66.8% and a specificity of 90.5% and a relative risk of 7.7 for intraamniotic infection, higher than the other cytokines tested. There were no relationships between the presence of bacterial vaginosis and cervicovaginal pathogens and cervical cytokine levels. In the presence of chorioamnionitis, cervical concentrations of interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist were significantly increased in spite of negative amniotic fluid culture results.
Conclusion: The measurement of interleukin-6 in cervical secretions may help to noninvasively identify intraamniotic infection among pregnancies with preterm labor and intact membranes.

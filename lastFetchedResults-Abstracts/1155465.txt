The objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of design parameters of the ISB panel, an inner structured and bonded panel with metallic pyramidal inner structures, on mechanical properties and failure characteristics to obtain the optimum design of the ISB panel. Several experiments and analyses for the case of tensile and three-points bending load have been carried out to examine the influence of the crimping angle and sizes of the ISB panel on characteristic properties, including the specific stiffness and the specific strength, the deformation behavior and failure characteristics. From the results of the experiments and analyses, relationships between crimping angle and the specific stiffness and characteristics of the deformation according to the crimping angle have been obtained. In addition, a failure map of the ISB panel has been created to estimate the effects of the design parameters on the failure mode. Based on the above results, it has been shown that the ISB panel with a metallic pyramidal inner structure can be optimally designed by control of the crimping angle for the pyramidal structure.

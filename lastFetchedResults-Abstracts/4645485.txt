In this paper, a design method based on the use of the frequency response characteristics of the GEP transfer function is presented. The method uses optimization in order to minimize the difference between the PSS ideal and real frequency response characteristics. Robustness requirements are taken into account by incorporating several operating points into the objective function. The PSS has the accelerating power as the input signal. The method is applied to the New England-New York test system to evaluate its performance.

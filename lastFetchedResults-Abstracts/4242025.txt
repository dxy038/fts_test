As a form of service, Component-as-a-Service (CaaS) provides a reusable functionality which is subscribed by and integrated into service-based applications. Hence, the reusability of CaaS is a key factor for its value. This paper proposes a comprehensive reusability evaluation framework for CaaS. We derive a set of CaaS reusability attributes by applying a logical and objective process, and define metrics for key attributes with the focuses on theoretical soundness and practical applicability. The proposed reusability evaluation suite is assessed with a case study.

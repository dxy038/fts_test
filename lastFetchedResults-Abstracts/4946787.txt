An evolutionary algorithm implementation is discussed which is currently utilized as a line loading tool on an electronic card production line. The program partitions a weeks worth of jobs, awaiting assembly, into groups, with each group corresponding to a single day´s production. The objective is to partition the groups such that every day´s workload mix is basically identical. Operator effectiveness and program results are presented

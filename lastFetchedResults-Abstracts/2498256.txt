Objective: The purpose of this ‎study was to describe the moral ‎distress among Iranian registered ‎nurses‏.‏
Methods: This was a descriptive ‎‎–analytic study, in which 264 out ‎of 1000 nurses were randomly ‎selected as a sample group and ‎completed the questionnaire. The ‎nurses' moral distress was ‎assessed using Corley’s 30-item ‎Moral Distress Scale adapted for ‎use in an Iranian population. The ‎collected data were analyzed by ‎SPSS version 19.‎
Results: In this study, no ‎correlation was found between ‎the level of moral distress and ‎any of the demographic data. ‎The mean moral distress score ‎ranged from 3.56 to 5.83, ‎indicating moderate to high ‎levels of moral distress. The item ‎with the highest mean score was ‎‎“working with unsafe levels of ‎nurse staffing”. The item with the ‎lowest mean score was “giving ‎medication intravenously to a ‎patient who has refused to take ‎it”.  Nurses working in EMS and ‎NICU units had the highest levels ‎of moral distress.‎
Conclusion: A higher degree of ‎moral distress is observed ‎among nurses who work in ‎health care systems. The results ‎of this study highly recommend ‎practical and research-oriented ‎evaluation of moral distress in ‎the medical society in Iran. Our ‎findings suggest that  Iranian ‎version of MDS is a reliable ‎instrument to measure moral ‎distress in nurses.‎

Reports of targeting drugs using antibodies have appeared in the literature since 1958, but exciting clinical results in this field have only been reported in the last few years. Progress in this field has occurred largely through an understanding how drug-immunoconjugates work. The objective of this review is to draw together the fundamental principles on which this field of work is based, to examine the evidence supporting those principles, and the effectiveness and selectivity of targeted drug conjugates. The activity of many drug-immunoconjugates can now largely be accounted for by the underlying principles. Excellent development work, both with conventional anti-cancer agents and very potent drugs have led to a number of interesting clinical trials. In the best Phase I and II trials, good evidence of effectiveness have been reported, which suggest that drug-immunoconjugates may now be heralding a new era for chemotherapy.

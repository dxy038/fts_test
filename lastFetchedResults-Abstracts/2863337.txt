Advances in research on humanoid robots in recent years have brought a decrease in manufacturing costs due to design improvements and increased applications as assistants in certain tasks. Likewise, the miniaturization of electronic components and the proper use of simulation platforms used to evaluate the performance before construction permit dissemination and use of robots in most areas. The objective of this work is the design of a humanoid robot with basic capabilities of motion and with a minimum of actuators for walking, in this case of a single motor to generate the path of movement of the mechanism. By using closed kinematic chains and kinematic analysis is intended to provide an alternative to common practical solution, which uses an actuator for each joint in a biped humanoid robot. The kinematic synthesis is based on the trajectories described by human movement. The results show that it is possible to use a small number of actuators to achieve the motion of a humanoid robot, three.

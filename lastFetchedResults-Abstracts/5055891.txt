This paper attempts to classify the management control systems (MCS) model. By using a native instrument whose reliability and validity are tested empirically, the findings indicate that MCS include objective controls, action controls, outcome controls and cultural controls. This study provides a new theoretical basis for MCS to make adjustment to the new environment.

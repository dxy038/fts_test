Objective
Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs) is a useful tool in the diagnosis of clonal disorders. The human androgen receptor (HUMARA) locus is especially useful for clonality study. The present study was conducted 1) to determine the heterozygosity rate for HUMARA locus in Taiwanese women, 2) to determine the frequency of excessive skewing in different cell types, and 3) to determine the utility of XCIPs in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis.
Patients and Methods

XCIPs by HUMARA-PCR assay were performed on purified granulocytes and T cells from 73 female patients presenting with idiopathic persistent thrombocytosis (IT), 10 patients with reactive thrombocytosis (RT), and 46 bone marrow samples from female controls. XCIPs of buccal mucosa cells were also compared with those of T cells in 57 patients with IT. The percentage of clonal granulocytes was calculated after correcting for the degree of Lyonization in T cells.
Results

The heterozygosity rate for the HUMARA gene was 89.1% in Taiwanese females. The median age of informative IT patients and controls was 59 (18–92) and 58 (19–89), respectively. Excessive skewing (allele ratio <0.33) was more frequent in granulocytes than in T cells in both controls (12/43 vs 9/43, p = 0.080) and IT patients (56/64 vs 25/64, p < 0.001). XCIPs were the same for both buccal mucosa and T cells in 43 patients but were different in 14 patients. Of the 43 informative controls, 31 had a polyclonal pattern; an ambiguous pattern was found in nine; and the remaining three, aged 71, 73, and 80, respectively, had a clonal pattern. A clonal pattern was found in 42 IT patients, a polyclonal pattern in 12, and an ambiguous pattern in 10 of the 64 IT patients. The frequency of clonal, polyclonal, and ambiguous patterns in the 40 IT patients with age ≤65 was 55.0%, 30.0%, and 15.0%, respectively. None of the IT patients aged >65 had a polyclonal disease. IT patients aged >65 had a significantly higher frequency of clonal pattern (p = 0.030) and a significantly lower frequency of polyclonal pattern (p = 0.002) than those with age <65. Of the eight heterozygous patients with RT, one aged 80 exhibited a clonal pattern, and the remaining seven had a polyclonal pattern.
Conclusions

The present study on Taiwanese females showed a heterozygosity rate of 89.1% for the HUMARA gene. Our results confirmed that IT is a heterogeneous disorder in terms of clonality. Twenty-three percent of IT patients exhibited a greater than 20% difference in allele expression for buccal mucosa and T cells. Presence of a clonal XCIP in young patients with IT can serve as a positive marker for the diagnosis of clonal thrombocytosis, and elderly patients with polyclonal XCIPs are unlikely to have essential thrombocythemia.

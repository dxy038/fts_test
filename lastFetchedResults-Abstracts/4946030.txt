Integrated traffic analysis &amp; planning system (I-TAPS) is a Web based planning system that has been developed with the main objective of recommending the network capacity for various fixed telephony services. I-TAPS has been developed to produce reliable and realistic network dimensioning figures for PSTN voice services, Internet traffic services and in particular scope of this paper; ISDN primary rate interface (PRI) data services. This objective is achieved by means of teletraffic model calculations done by I-TAPS to produce network performance analysis reports for the perusal of network planners. This paper will discuss in detail on the teletraffic models that can be adapted in lieu of the primary objective of I-TAPS, using the basic argument that the ISDN PRI network structure is based on a point to point concept.

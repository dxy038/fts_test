Details are presented of the Whipple Observatory’s 10 m atmospheric Cherenkov telescope and camera, as it evolved during the period 1997 until 2006. The design of the telescope and camera’s optical and electronic systems is discussed together with a detailed description of the four-stage GRANITE (Gamma-RAy New Imaging TElescope) upgrade program, undertaken during the same time period. The objective of the upgrade was to improve the telescope’s sensitivity for the detection of very-high-energy gamma-rays. Results from the program are provided and are briefly discussed in the context of the design of VERITAS.

The objective of this study is to combine a feedback linearization technique with the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to design nonlinear regulation laws with locally optimal LQ full state feedback properties for a longitudinal axis model of F-18 HARV. The idea is realized by designing a nonlinear regulation law using feedback linearization, and then computing the feedback gains of the input in transformed coordinates from the loop shaped LQR designs in physical coordinates at equilibrium points. Frequency domain analysis and nonlinear simulations show that the closed loop system has both guaranteed stability and robustness properties, in terms of gain and phase margins of LQR at the input, and satisfactory transient response

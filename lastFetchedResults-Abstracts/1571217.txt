The management of coastal aquifer groundwater must take into account natural hydrological, biological and chemical parameters, as well as the development of anthropogenic stresses. Such stresses may result from:

radation of groundwater quality due to introduction into the aquifer of pollutants from diffuse sources (e.g. seawater intrusion, agricultural activity, etc.) and/or point sources (landfills, sanitary devices, industry, etc.);

rological deficits which may cause an undesirable groundwater flow regime and groundwater recirculation problems;

errelated chemical-hydrogeological processes.

 contaminated to various degrees, migrates through rocks having heterogeneous properties. Thus, distinct bodies of water appear in the aquifer space.

acteristic situation is demonstrated in the Hadera region of the Israeli Coastal aquifer. Efficient quality control requires the application of surface and underground management programmes. The objective is an improvement in the aquifer water budget and a reduction in the input of harmful chemical and biological pollutants.

In order to separation of Anomaly from Background is necessary to separate mineralization populations. The sediment streams in shear zone gold deposits suburbs, were sampled and used to identify the anomalies area of B, Sb, Sn, An, elements. Modeling of probability plots and concentration- area (C-A) fractal are methods that in those modeling of geochemical data are defined by data themselves rather than by an arbitrary decision of the geochemist( model- based objective techniques, MBOT). Comparison modeling results from the elements in the study areas shows that probability plots method have excess efficiency in separation of various populations (variable phases).

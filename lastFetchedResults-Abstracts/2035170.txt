Recently, with growth in utilization of renewable resources engineers and researchers have been motivated to
offer new methods for their application in distribution networks. In this regard, optimal sitting and sizing of
renewable resources as two main parameters in designing distribution network can reduce loss, operation costs
and voltage deviations. In this paper, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on fuzzy methods has been
proposed for sitting and sizing of renewable resources. The provided algorithm minimizes economic,
environmental and technical objective functions on 70-bus distribution test system. The results show that with
optimal sitting and sizing of renewable resources in different scenarios costs, pollution and loss can be reduced
significantly.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies of headache prevalence are numerous, and findings have varied according to the specific population and regions involved. No data are available regarding headache prevalence among Iranian children aged 6-13 years. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence rates of the various causes of headache in school children, with special emphasis on migraine, tension-type headache and their correlates in primary schools of Shiraz.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 2226 school children. Subjects were selected by multistage random sampling procedure. Data was collected by screening IHS questionnaire followed by clinical interviews, general physical and neurological examination, and diagnostic criteria of the international headache society. FINDINGS: The overall prevalence rate of headache was estimated to be 31% (95% CI, 29-32.9). Migraine and tension-type headache rates were estimated as 1.7% (95% CI, 1.2- 2.2) and 5.5% (95% CI, 4.6 - 6.4), respectively. The prevalence of headache types increases with age. There was no difference in prevalence of migraine between girls and boys (p>0.05) and prevalence of tension type headache was more in girls (p<0.05). Positive family history of headache and abnormal sleep pattern showed significantly association with migraine.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of tension type headache in Iran compared to other countries is higher. So it is concluded that sleep disturbances and family history of headache had most significant effects on the occurrence of migraine and tension-type headache.

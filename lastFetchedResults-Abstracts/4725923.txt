The objective of this study is to propose multiresolution data fusion scheme using multiresolution analysis (MRA). Three techniques compared, respectively based on Haar wavelet basis (HWB), Daubechies wavelet basis (DWB), and IHS transform. Daubechies wavelet basis (DWB) is far more efficient than the HWB and IHS transform, thus establishing the advantages for data fusion of formally multiresolution analysis. DWB is best for image sharpening and to maintain the information of original data. Especially, Daubechies wavelet basis is able to enhance image sharpening and preserve spectral information

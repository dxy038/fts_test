The objective of this study was to determine the growth potential of Ghe/el male lambs that fed with four levels of pasta industrial by-products containing: 0.5,10 and 15 percentages in diets. Diets were formulated isocaloric and isonilrogenous. Twenty Ghezel male lambs with around 7-8 months old and 36.8lÂ±3.17 kg initial average weights were used for a fattening period of 90 days. This experiment conducted in randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) with four treatments and 5 replications in each treatment. Feed and water were provided ad-Iibiium for all of the lambs during the experiment. Individual feed consumption and body weight of lambs were measured at two weeks intervals. Significant differences were not found between treat me nts in total dry matter intake (p>0.05). Significant differences were found on the rate of daily weight gain and feed conversion between treatments (pcO.Ol). The highest daily weight gain along with the best feed conversion rate were found in group3 animals with 10 percentage pasta industrial by-products, although The differences between group 3 and group 4 animals were not significant. In conclusion it seems that, pasta industrial by-products could be used as an energy source up to 15 percentages of the male Ghezel lambdiets without any adverse effects on performance

We study the problem of removing users from congested cells. We consider two different objectives for the removal algorithms. The first objective is to maximize the throughput. The second objective is to minimize the number of removed connections. The optimal removing problem can be classified as a combinatorial optimization problem. It is well known that there is no general closed form solution for this type of problem. Furthermore, finding the optimal solutions in medium and large sizes of these problems is usually very exhausting. Consequently, we use heuristics to solve the problem. Our proposed heuristic algorithm is very simple to implement and gives a solution close to the optimum in many different cases.

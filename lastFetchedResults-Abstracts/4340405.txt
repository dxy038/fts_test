Requirements of ATP ( Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing ) system for laser communication are expounded. According to the needs, the working of spot-detecting camera in ATP system is put forward, and the advantages of selecting CMOS sensor are explained. But the nonuniformity from CMOS sensor greatly limits the image quality of spot-detecting camera. So the nonuniformity must be corrected before image processing. In this paper, several sources of the nonuniformity and suppression methods are analyzed. The method of two-point nonuniformity correction is used to correct real-time image which is captured by STAR1000. The result of objective evaluation for the method shows that correction effect can satisfy the practical requirement. Positioning accuracy and signal-noise ratio of spot-detecting camera can be improved. At the same time energy demand of beacon used for laser communication is reduced.

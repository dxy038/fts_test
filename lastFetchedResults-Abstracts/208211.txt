In the two previous sections, three structures of compound words were
discussed. In this section, four more structures are discussed as follows:
Structure 4: Noun + "I" or"ال" + Noun, as in the words براكو and.حق التدريس.
Structure 5: Noun + Objective Adjective. Structure 6: ",خود" + Objective
Adjective. These compound words, all being adjectives, are not too many, but
because there are various syntactic relations among their constituting parts, they
are divided into four groups. Structure 7: Noun + SUbjective Adjective. The
compound words falling into this group are all adjectives; they are divided into
two groups, depending on whether they are derived from a compound verb (e.g.
•ادب آموزنده) or are made of a noun and an objective adjective (e.g. شركت كننده).

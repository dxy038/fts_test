Ergonomic evaluation of manually controlled devices is an important means of testing a man - machine interface matching in manned space medicine and engineering research. ItÂ´s one of the comprehensive evaluation method based on Delphi, AHP and Grey systems. This study proposed a mathematical model combining subjective weights and objective weights, evaluated manually controlled devices quantitatively, solved the connection between design features and an operator satisfaction. Furthermore, by conducting a real experiment with both bare hand and glove box means, it analyzed the operation of the typical manually controlled devices, and verified the feasibility of a comprehensive evaluation and effectiveness of subjective and objective indices.

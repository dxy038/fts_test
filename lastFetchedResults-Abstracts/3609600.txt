For some years, ´coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing´ (COFDM) has been emerging in many European countries. This waveform is used for digital audio broadcasting (DAB) with 1.5 MHz bandwidth and for terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB) with 7.6 MHz bandwidth. The objective of the study is to prove the feasibility of target detection using such COFDM broadcasters. After a description of COFDM modulation, the adaptive filter required for zero-Doppler paths cancellation (clutter contributors and transmitters in a single frequency network, SFN, configuration, where all transmitters are identical) is described and applied to experimental data.

Background: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in most industrialized countries. Most breast cancers are considered sporadic, with only 5â€“10% estimated to be due to inherited susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the effect of nutrition on breast cancer risk among gene mutation carriers as well as those with sporadic breast cancer. Methods: The published literature from 1999 to 2007 was reviewed to examine the relationship between nutrition and breast cancer among sporadic cases and gene mutation carriers. Results: Evidence suggests that fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, fish, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, and phytoestrogens may reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, high intake of meat, poultry, total energy, total fat and saturated fatty acids may play a causative role in this disease. Conclusions: Diet in breast cancer pathogenesis is a modifiable risk factor on which to focus prevention efforts. Identification of the relationship between nutrition and breast cancer among sporadic cases and gene mutation carriers provides necessary data for breast cancer prevention.

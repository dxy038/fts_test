Objective
tudy was designed to identify variables associated with depression in adolescents who underwent operation for congenital heart disease (CHD).
s
ere collected from 231 adolescents, aged 13 to 18 years with CHD, during outpatient clinic follow-up after open heart surgery in 3 major cardiac centers in Korea. Adolescents completed measures of resilience, depression, and parental attitude. Their New York Heart Association functional class, CHD functional index, and noninvasive saturation of arterial oxygen were also measured.
s
were significantly positive relations between depression and the 3 variables: older age, worse New York Heart Association functional class, and higher CHD functional index. Negative relations were found between depression and higher saturation of arterial oxygen, higher academic achievements, affectionate parental attitude, and higher resilience. The multiple regression analysis also showed that 62% of the variance in depression in adolescents with CHD could be explained by resilience and parental attitude.
sion
tudy demonstrated that adolescents with higher resilience and an affectionate parent were less depressed.

A new circuit geometry SAZZ (snubber assisted zero voltage and zero current transition) is presented. It has the solution to supersede the conventional hard switched DC-DC converter currently in use for an electric vehicle (EV) drive application because of the simplicity and efficiency. Through the discussion of the circuit geometry, the operation principle of SAZZ topology can be applied to the 6 basic DC-DC converters. Moreover, new SAZZ circuit geometry can be created by combining two basic SAZZ circuit types, as shown as the bidirectional converter based on SAZZ topology. A 100kHz-8kW SAZZ mini-model using IGBT was fabricated and evaluated by a fundamental operational test. In addition, the 100kHz-8kW SAZZ bidirectional converter is also presented as a case study of SAZZ geometry for an EV drive application

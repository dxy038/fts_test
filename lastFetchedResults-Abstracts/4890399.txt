This paper addresses the problem of reactive power compensation in power systems according to local control actions. These control actions are determined using an optimal power flow as a tool of analysis. Two objective functions are considered: maximization of the system loadability and minimization of system loss. As a result, some areas in the system are recommended for reactive power compensation (shunt capacitor/reactor installation). These areas are further studied under the point of view of reactive market power, and the economical aspects of the results are evaluated. The IEEE-118 bus system is used to test the proposed methodology; as the reactive power control is a matter of concern, all operating limits are considered.

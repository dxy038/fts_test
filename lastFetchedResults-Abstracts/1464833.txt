Background and Objective: The ability to control various body positions in space caused by a complex interaction of sensory, musculoskeletal and neural systems is generally defined as a postural control system. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of sensory systems manipulation on postural control in 4-15 year old boys.

Materials and Methods: The statistical sample included 160 boys with an age range of 4-14 years (in 4 age groups) and 40 males with an age range of 22-25 years that were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. To evaluate postural control, the sensory organization test of computerized dynamic posturography system was used. This test is composed of 6 conditions and can assess the sensory systems that are involved in postural control. Also, weight, height and BMI of subjects were measured. 

Results: The one-way ANOVA test results showed that there are significant differences in postural control among all groups. Based on the results of Bonferroni post-hoc test in condition 1, boys up to 15 years can not achieve to postural control similar to adults. Also, in condition 2, results showed that the differences between 13-15 year group and adults were not significant, but the differences between other age groups were significant (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in condition 3, the results were similar to condition 1. The 13-15 year group (condition 4) achieved to postural control similar to adults, so that there was no significant difference between these groups (p > 0.05). In conditions 5 and 6, subjects in all age groups were not able to achieve postural control similar to adults (p < 0.05). 

Conclusion: According to the results of the present research, it seems that boys up to 15 years could not process, integrate and organize sensory systems information similar to adults.

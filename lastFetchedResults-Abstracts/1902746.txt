A case of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) with abundant hyalinized and edematous stroma mimicking oncocytoma is presented. This stromal architecture in the current case has not been reported on CRCC to our knowledge. A further interesting finding is entrapped non-neoplastic tubules in the hyalinized and edematous stroma composing the tumor. These histological features, such as abundant hyalinized and edematous stroma containing non-neoplastic tubules, may be analogous to oncocytoma. We reported a unique case of CRCC and studied with light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.

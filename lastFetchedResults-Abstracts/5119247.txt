Design and analysis of a new coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed ultra wideband (UWB) slot antenna is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna is simple, compact and low cost. The overall dimension of the antenna is 28 times 21 times 1.6 mm<sup>3</sup> and fed by 50 Omega coplanar waveguide. The parametric analysis of the antenna is done by using MoM based commercially available electromagnetic solver IE3D. The proposed antenna is developed and its measured return loss is compared with the simulated result. The measurement is in good agreement with the simulation and the antenna offers excellent performance for UWB range from 3.1 GHz to 11.4 GHz exhibits a -10 dB return loss (VSWR &lt;2) with fractional bandwidth of 114%. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional pattern in the E plane and omni directional radiation pattern in the H plane. In this paper the time domain analysis of the antenna is investigated by using the tool IE3D to verify the capability of the proposed antenna for the UWB environment.

This research was carried out in Zagros Collection of National Botanical Garden of Iran, with an area of 3.2 ha. The objective of this research was to calculate the best allometric models for estimation of leaf biomass and carbon stock of oak species (Quercus brantii, Q. infectoria & Q. libani). Furthermore, we estimate the leaf carbon sequestration in studied species. For each species, 15 sample trees were selected, numbered and their quantitative variables measured. The leaves of a sector of the tree crown were picked off and after weighting, their dry weight were measured in laboratory. Enough quantity of leaves was burned in electrical kiln to calculate the carbon storage. Finally, amount of atmosphere CO2 absorption was determined and allometric regressions were calculated using power regression model. Based on results, the mean of leaf biomass for Q. brantii, Q. infectoria & Q. libani were 282.1, 216.3 and 152.3 kg per hectare, respectively. In adition, the mean of leaf carbon stocks were 140.2, 107.3 and 75.6 kg per hectare, respectively. The best power regression model for Q. brantii and Q. infectoria was resulted from DBH variable, while the mean of crown diameter had the main role in Q. libani.

Objective
To discover the sexual satisfaction of young women treated with vaginal dilators for vaginal agenesis.
Design
Anonymous questionnaire study.
Main Outcome Measures
Comparison of sexual desire arousal lubrication, orgasm satisfaction and pain with a normal population.
Results
There was no significant difference between the study population and controls for the domains of sexual desire, sexual arousal, and satisfaction with a sexual relationship. There was, however, a significant difference for vaginal lubrication and orgasm where the Rokitansky patients scored lower. 22.3% of patients reported some degree of dyspareunia following vaginal penetration. However, this did not affect their enjoyment of the sexual act.
Conclusion
The use of graduated vaginal dilators for patients with Mullerian agenesis is highly successful in creating a neovagina. Although the lack of adequate lubrication, pain and difficulty in reaching orgasm is significantly higher in this group, the patients subsequently enjoy sexual satisfaction that is comparable to a normal population.

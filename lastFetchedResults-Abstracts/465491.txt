Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate, with respect to obstetric intervention and neonatal outcome, a protocol for selecting fetuses in breech presentation for vaginal delivery or cesarean section. Study design: A clinical follow-up study was performed between 1984 and 1992 of all term singleton deliveries in breech presentation. Each case selected for vaginal delivery had a matched control in vertex presentation. Results: A total of 1212 infants presented as breech. Vaginal delivery increased from 45% to 57% (p = 0.004), and cesarean section for failure of vaginal delivery declined from 21% to 6% (p< 0.00001). None, however, died or had long-term sequelae because of a complicated or failed vaginal breech delivery. A total of 8.8% of those delivered vaginally in breech versus 5.0% of those in vertex presentation were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (p = 0.009). Among those with vaginal delivery, 2.5% in breech presentation were given the clinical diagnosis of birth asphyxia versus none in the vertex position (p = 0.0001 ). Conclusion: Breech presentation at term may be selected for vaginal delivery if properly managed.

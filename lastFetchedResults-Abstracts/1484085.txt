The current study was conducted to characterize objective meat quality, fiber type and their relations to postmortem proteolysis in longissimus muscle of Landrace and Korean native black (KNP) pigs. Longissimus muscles from each 10 market-weighted male pigs were removed after conventional slaughtering and chilling procedures, and aged for 1 or 7 days at 4 °C to determine WB-shear force, objective meat color, proportion of myosin heavy chain I (MyHC I), intramuscular fat content and rate of proteolysis by a proteomics approach. KNP had a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher content of MyHC I, and that concurred with greatly (p &lt; 0.05) higher intramuscular fat content and Hunter a∗ value, and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower drip loss than those seen in Landrace. One-dimension SDS-PAGE indicated that GAPDH, troponin I and creatine kinase were prominent proteolytic products during chiller ageing. By applying a gel-based proteome analysis, 26 proteins were identified, which showed different degradation properties during ageing between the breeds. Biopsied sample revealed that myosin regulatory light chain 2, myosin light chain isotype v/sb, fatty acid-binding protein and albumin were expressed at a greatly higher level for KNP, but their relation to fiber type (or genetic background) is unclear. It was particular noticeable that different actin isoforms showed various degradation behavior during ageing time.

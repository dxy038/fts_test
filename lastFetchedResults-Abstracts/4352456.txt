The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using lecture video and lab package in teaching concepts of image processing to high school students. Teacher taped the lecture video of image processing and put it on the course Website before lecture. In order to reserve more time for interaction and practicing, students watched the lecture video online before attending class while using software lab experimentation in class to enhance understanding of image processing. The focus of the study is not only on students´ attitudes toward the new teaching and learning model, but also on teacher´s perception on the change of teaching method. Practical implementation issues are also examined

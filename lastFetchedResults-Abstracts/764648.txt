In this paper, a new allocation method to solve the knapsack problems is developed and demonstrated. The method makes use of all possible item combinations to produce the optimal solution.  The allocation method is divided into two sub - allocations procedures namely, the initial allocation procedure and the objective allocation procedure. Existence of combinations is determined by the initial allocation whereas the optimality of allocation is determined by the objective allocation. The method is capable of computing all possible solutions to the problem.

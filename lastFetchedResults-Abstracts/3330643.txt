Nowadays the concept of Net ZEB is well-known and widespread in the scientific community. The European Union has set ambitious targets for 2020 and even more ambitious for 2050. In order to reduce the domestic GHG emissions by 80-95%, compared to 1990 levels-till 2050, the building sector has to do its part and to pass through a deep restructure. Therefore, it is grown the interest in design and technical solutions for achieving a zero or nearly zero energy building. This paper investigate several construction technologies and system of energy production that can be adopted to build an &#8220;enhanced saving&#8221; (parsimonious) building, which can strive for the objective of NetZEB. Moreover the economic analysis of the feasibility of the NZEB target has been developed.

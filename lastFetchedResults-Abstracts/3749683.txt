The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of micro- and macrotopography on PALSAR fine-beam dual backscattering in the characterization of iron laterites in Carajas Province, Amazon Region. The moderate linear correlation between sigma<sup>0</sup> and surface roughness indicated that, only for L-HH polarization, sigma<sup>0</sup> was modulated by the morphology of the geological surfaces.

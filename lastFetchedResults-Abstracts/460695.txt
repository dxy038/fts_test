Objective:  To ascertain the intention of the public to undergo dental treatment at dental clinics where other patients or a dentist are infected with HIV/AIDS. Study Design:  A cross-sectional design was used to interview a stratified sample of persons 18 years and older in Mexico City with use of a standardized questionnaire. Questions included the type of dental service used, the perception of risk for HIV/AIDS contagion in the dental environment, and the reported intention to continue treatment in a dental office where patients or a dentist were affected by HIV/AIDS. Results:  Of the 490 participants, 74.9% were concerned about HIV/AIDS transmission in the dental office. Only 21.2% intended to continue treatment at a dental office where HIV/AIDS patients were treated, and only 20.0% intended to continue treatment when the dentist was HIV-positive. The degree of concern about HIV/AIDS contagion and the modality of dental service used were associated with the stated intention to continue dental treatment. Conclusions:  There is a need to have good infection control standards in dental practice; to increase public trust in such standards by making them more apparent; and/or to establish educational programs to improve public knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS risks in dental practice.

The main objective of this paper is to address the concept and design of a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) and intelligent educational system in concurrent engineering environment for Saipa Automotive Industry in Iran. In order to increase speed of design and process planning and manufacturing, a feature based approach and case base reasoning technic for acquiring design specification and compare with previously designed 'features and retrieve related process planed and modify for new parts. In order to design and plan effectively, one must have a view of how the enterprise works in CIM environment, and what information needs. In this paper we will discuss a general model, in terms of its functions, what each area does, and how each area interacts with the others. we will also discuss the support functions, administration, application development and decision support functions that are common to almost every enterprise. We will also describe the architectural requirements for implementing a computer integrated manufacturing strategy in computer based concurrent engineering environment and how this architecture can support the entire enterprise in terms of its functional, information resource and organizational needs.

This paper presents the design of a vision-based controller for an underactuated, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a pan-tilt camera unit (PTCU) to achieve the objective of following a leader vehicle autonomously. The relative position and orientation information is obtained from the monocular camera utilizing homography-based techniques. The proposed controller, built upon Lyapunov design methods, achieves uniform ultimate bounded (UUB) tracking

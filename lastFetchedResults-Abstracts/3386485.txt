In summary, then, I would note first the similarity between the United States and international frequency management problems. We are dealing with substantially sovereign groups in each instance. We should apply the improved management processes indicated to each of the groups of administrative facilities. As the decision is made that each step is complete, we can move to the next. All along the way, we should make maximum use of the work already done, for example, the President\Â´s Communication Policy Board Report. Frequencies will never become finally "managed." The management process is never complete. The process is a dynamic one -- analysis, proposal, trial, evaluation, modification, new trial, evaluation, etc. If this process is followed, however, it does appear that the objective stated at the beginning of this paper will be more nearly realized, that is, that the use of radio frequencies may provide maximum satisfaction to the users compatible with equitable means for settlement of dissatisfactions which may arise from time to time.

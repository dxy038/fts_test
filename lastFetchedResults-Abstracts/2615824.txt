Objective of this research were to investigate the effects of mold board plowing on soil
displacement slope lamds (2-14% slope). Aluminum cubes, one cm3 each were placed as
tracer in to the soil at 12 cm depth in plots of 0,8Ã—0,8m and 20 cm spacing in 5 rows, 5
columns. Soil texture was loam, bulk density of 1340kg/m-3 , tractor forward speed 3,5
km.h-1 and plowing depth at 15 cm.There were 8 plots plowed parallel and 8 ones  plowed perpendicular to the contour line. More than 90% of cubes were found. A
relationship between tillage affected soil translocation and slope gradient was
determined. An average soil loss of 13,94 and 3,51 tons.h-1.y-1 per plowing operatiom in a
parallel and perpendicular indirectiong , slopes respectively. That soil displacement in
direction parall was 3,97 times higher than in perpendicular direction.Tillage erosion is a
significant contributor to the total soil loss and in creased water and wind erosion and
that was problems in stability of agricultura productivity. Tillage translocation is a
fanction of slope gradient and curvature, tillage tool shape, cutting depth, soil
properties. This methods is easy practical and reduce soil poulution and succesfull in
esteamated of soil erosion relatively. The best way toplow slopes of any steepness is
across the slope with furrows being turned only up ward.

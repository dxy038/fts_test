Opposition-based Learning (OBL) has been reported with an increased performance in enhancing various optimization approaches. Instead of investigating the opposite point of a candidate in OBL, this study proposed a partial opposition-based learning (POBL) schema that focuses a set of partial opposite points (or partial opposite population) of an estimate. Furthermore, a POBL-based adaptive differential evolution algorithm (POBL-ADE) is proposed to improve the effectiveness of ADE. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the CEC2014Â´s test suite in the special session and competition for real parameter single objective optimization in IEEE CEC 2014. Simulation results over the benchmark functions demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of the POBL-ADE compared with ADE.

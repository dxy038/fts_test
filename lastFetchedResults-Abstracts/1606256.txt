Background: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of in vitro zinc
sulphate additive to semen extender on sperm parameters (progressive motility, viability,
membrane integrity and DNA stability) after cryopreservation.
Materials and Methods: In this Prospective longitudinal laboratory study, semen
samples of 5 buffalo bulls of 3-5 years old were collected at 5 different occasions
from Iran, Urmia during summer and autumn 2011, 25 samples were used in each
treatment. Sperm progressive motility, viability and abnormal morphology were
measured before and at 0.5 (T0), 1(T1) and 2(T2) hours after diluting semen(1:10 v/v)
in Tris-citric acid based extender (without egg yolk and glycerol) at 37?C containing
none (control group), 0.072, 0.144, 0.288, 0.576 and 1.152 mg/L zinc sulphate to
investigate dose and time effects. Next, a Tris-citric acid-egg yolk-glycerol extender
(20% egg yolk and 7% glycerol) containing the same amount of zinc sulphate was
prepared, diluted semen (1:10 v/v) was cooled and kept into a refrigerated chamber
(4?C) for 4 hours to equilibrate. Sperm progressive motility, viability, abnormal
morphology, membrane integrity and DNA damage were estimated.The equilibrated
semen was loaded in 0.5 ml French straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Later, the
frozen semen was thawed and the same parameters as well as total antioxidant capacity
(TAC) of the frozen-thawed semen were determined.
Results: The results showed that zinc sulphate additive at the rate of 0.288 mg/L gave a
higher protection of sperm progressive motility (53.7 ± 1.8% vs. 40.5 ± 1.7%), viability
(70.8 ± 1.8% vs. 60.1 ± 1.5%), membrane integrity (67.3 ± 1.6% vs. 56.6 ± 1.7%), DNA
stability (10.1 ± 0.47% vs. 11.8 ± 0.33% damaged DNA) through the process of dilution,
equilibration and freeze-thawing and caused a higher TAC level (81 ± 3.3% vs. 63 ± 3.2
?mol/L) after freez-thawing compared to the control group. Adding 0.576 and 1.152
mg/L zinc sulphate, however, was deleterious to the sperm and significantly reduced the
studied sperm parameters.
Conclusion: Adding 0.288 mg/L zinc sulphate to the extender, compared to the control
group, gives a better sperm preservation upon freezing processes which in turn, may results
in higher semen fertility. But, addition of higher zinc sulphate concentrations (0.576
and 1.152 mg/L) are detrimental to buffalo spermatozoa.

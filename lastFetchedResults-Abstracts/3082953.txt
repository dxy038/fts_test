In virtual computing environments of networks, the trust that we concern with not only originates from the honesty of the node owners, but also relates to the natural life of the individual resource existence. Trust is time-sensitive and we often ignored that in the prevenient researches. Trust factors include two parts of subjective reasons and objective reasons. This paper presents an integrated trust model EDDTSTM, which synthetically takes the two aspects into consideration so that we can better deal with the trust analysis of coarse-granularity resources such as P2P nodes and even fine-granularity resources such as sharing RAMs and CPUs in grid environments. The idea of time-nonlinear-sensitive trust is similar with the social methodology based on the human mental peculiarity and supported by the mathematic probability theory. Simulation results show that our EDDTSTM design can get better performance and higher successful trade rate than the trust models without time-sensitive mechanisms

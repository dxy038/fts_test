Background and Objective: Diabetes causes damage and impaired renal function. It also causes impaired secretion of endocrine glands that leads to secondary metabolic disorders. Due to the role of curcumin in lowering blood glucose and adjusted antioxidant system, this study was conducted with the aim of investigating the effect of curcumin on the hormones of pituitary-adrenal axis and renal indices in diabetic rats.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 32 male rats were divided into 4 equal groups, control, diabetic control and experimental diabetic treated with curcumin (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.). The diabetes in diabetic control and experimental diabetic groups was induced using an intraperitoneal injection of alloxan. Curcumin was intraperitoneally injected into experimental groups for 25 days. At the end of injection, the serum levels of urea, uric acid, creatinine, albumin and ACTH, cortisol, and aldosterone hormones were measured. Kidney sections were prepared and examined by means of light microscope.

Results: In comparison with diabetic control group, serum levels of urea, uric acid and creatinine in experimental diabetic groups significantly decreased and albumin significantly increased (p > 0.05). Regarding ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone hormones, they significantly decreased (p > 0.05). Treatment of diabetic rats with curcumin in a dose-dependent manner improved kidney damaged nephrons.

Conclusion: Administration of curcumin dose-dependently increased activity of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Also, functional indices of kidney in diabetic rats was close to normal and is has favorable effects on improvement of kidney tissue damages.

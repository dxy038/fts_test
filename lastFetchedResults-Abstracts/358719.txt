Objective
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of abciximab following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with percutaneous coronary interventions.
Methods

A meta–analysis of randomized controlled trials of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab as adjunctive therapy to percutaneous coronary interventions for AMI was performed. Main outcomes measured were: (1) mortality, (2) reinfarction, (3) target vessel revascularization (TVR), (4) major cardiac events (MACE) that were a composite endpoint of death, reinfarction, and TVR, and (5) major bleeding.
Results

Six trials randomized 3755 patients who were followed for a mean of 5.5 months. Compared with the control, abciximab significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50–0.97), TVR (0.79, 95% CI 0.65–0.96) and MACE (0.76, 95% CI 0.65–0.90). Reduction on TVR and MACE was confirmed in stent patients, but not in balloon angioplasty patients. Abciximab was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03–1.87), but bleeding was observed only with a 100U/kg heparin bolus followed by a maintenance infusion (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.10–3.28) and not with a bolus of 70U/kg (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85–1.73).
Conclusions

Abciximab, as adjunctive therapy to percutaneous coronary interventions, reduces mortality, TVR and MACE following AMI. The reduction of clinical outcomes occurs with stent implantation but not with balloon angioplasty. A 70U/kg heparin bolus must be used to avoid major bleeding.

This paper presents the results of a measurement campaign conducted in the winter of 2002 around the city of Munich in southern Germany. The primary goal was to evaluate the link performance of the land mobile satellite channel at Ku-band and to characterize the temporal behavior of the channel to help in the evaluation of different fade mitigation techniques for future mobile satellite systems that aim at employing this frequency band. To achieve this objective, first- and second-order channel statistics will be presented, the outage probability of the channel analyzed, and a Markov-chain-based narrowband channel model proposed.

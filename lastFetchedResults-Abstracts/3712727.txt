The objective of this research is to study the application of Web services technology in distributed real-time data delivery systems, as well as to determine the appropriate contexts in which such a design can be considered. We focus on distributed real-time systems and more specifically, on distributed soft real-time systems, which stand to benefit most from the use of Web services technology. We provide a means to evaluate the inclusion of Web services-based middleware in real-time system design. The decision to use the standardized data representation and communications protocols of Web services can bring tremendous value and benefit to both the service provider and the end user of a real-time system; however, the temporal performance of such systems is a critical factor. This research examines the most significant general performance considerations applicable to such systems and more specifically, provides a model to be used in the determination of whether a given system configuration can meet a specific soft real-time performance target.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate how changes in gestational weight and body composition affect infant birth weight and maternal fat retention after delivery in underweight, normal-weight and overweight women.
Study design
We assessed the body composition of 63 women (low body mass index, 17 women; normal body mass index, 34 women; and high body mass index, 12 women) on the basis of measurements of total body nitrogen by prompt-gamma activation analysis, total body potassium by whole body counting, and a multicomponent model based on total body water by deuterium dilution, body volume by densitometry, and bone mineral content by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before pregnancy, at 9, 22, and 36 weeks of gestation, and at 2, 6, and 27 weeks after delivery. Infant weight and length were recorded at birth; infant anthropometry and body composition by DXA were assessed at 2 and 27 weeks of age.
Results
Gestational weight gain was correlated significantly with gains in total body water, total body potassium, protein, fat-free mass, and fat mass (P = .001-.003). Gains in total body water, total body potassium, protein and fat-free mass did not differ among body mass index groups; however, fat mass gain was higher in the high body mass index group (P = .03). Birth weight was correlated positively with gain in total body water, total body potassium, and fat-free mass (P<.01), but not fat mass. Postpartum weight and fat retention were correlated positively with gestational weight gain (P = .001) and fat mass gain (P = .001) but not with total body water, total body potassium, or fat-free mass gain.
Conclusion
Appropriate, but not excessive, gestational weight gain is needed to optimize infant birth weight and minimize maternal postpartum fat retention.

Background
The objective of the present study was to compare in a prospective randomized fashion two different management schemes for chest tubes after lobectomy: water seal versus alternate suction (suction overnight and water seal during the day).
Methods
Ninety-four patients with air leak on the morning of the first postoperative day were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 (water seal alone), 47 patients; or group 2 (alternate suction), 47 patients. The groups were then compared in terms of preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables.
Results
Alternate suction patients showed a reduced incidence of air leak longer than 4 days (p = 0.04) and longer than 7 days (p = 0.02), a shorter duration of chest tubes in place (p = 0.002), and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.004).
Conclusions
Alternate suction was superior to water seal alone in reducing the incidence of prolonged air leak and postoperative hospital stay after lobectomy. As suction was applied only overnight, this modality has the same advantage of water seal in terms of early mobilization of patients.

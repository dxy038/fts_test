Risk of blackouts is more than expected and must be considered in the power system studies. The interest of this paper is to minimize the blackouts risk during minimizing the costs in probabilistic transmission expansion planning (TEP). In this paper, a long-term reliability analysis, which was developed by self-organized criticality theory, is used in a multi-objective optimization to include risk of blackouts in TEP. The objective functions are costs and expected energy not supplied. Also, a new formulation for calculating transmission operating cost as a part of cost function is proposed. The problem is solved by a multi-objective particle swarm optimization to find an optimal Pareto set from which the decision-maker can choose the most desirable one, regarding existing budget. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 118-bus test system to investigate its applicability and scalability. The results are compared with security-constrained TEP, which uses famous deterministic criterion known as N-1. The proposed approach produces more efficient plans for suppressing cascading blackouts with less network investment. Moreover, the results provide motivation for considering the risk of cascading blackouts in TEP, which afford substantial saving to society.

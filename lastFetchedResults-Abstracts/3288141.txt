This paper proposes a high-order terminal sliding-mode control strategy for the grid-side PWM converter of Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) - based Wind Power System. The objective is to keep the DC-link voltage in a desirable value and the input or output power factors staying unitary. The high-order terminal sliding-mode voltage and current regulators are designed respectively to control the DC-link voltage and the current rapidly and exactly. The simulation results validate the proposed method.

This paper analyzes the requirement of a practical job-shop scheduling, which is different from the classical job-shop scheduling problems (JSP), more focus on strict resource constraints. First is formulated a mathematical model. Then described a new method, combined the time Petri net and the hybrid genetic algorithm, to solution of the practical JSP. The time Petri net was used to model discrete events in job shop scheduling, the scheduling results was obtained based on hybrid genetic algorithm. The objective of the new method is obtained makespan minimization in JSP. At the end of the paper, a practical example is described, and the results show that the proposed method is effective.

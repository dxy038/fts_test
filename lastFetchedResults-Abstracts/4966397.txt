Multi-objective optimization and vector variational-like inequality are two important topics in applied mathematics, and an interesting topic is to study their relationships under the generalized convexity conditions. This paper deals with the relationships between multi-objective optimization problems and variational-like inequalities under the semi-strong E-convexity assumptions and the relationships between the (weakly)efficient solutions and vector critical points for multi-objective optimization problems and the the solutions of (weak) vector variational-like inequalities are established.

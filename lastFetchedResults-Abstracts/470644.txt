Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible relationships between placental markers and endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.
Study design
A prospective study was conducted in 76 patients with preeclampsia and 37 patients with intrauterine growth restriction that were classified as early onset (<34 weeks of gestational age) or late onset, and 40 control subjects. Plasma levels of placental growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase–1, vascular cell adhesion molecule–1, and uterine artery Doppler indices were measured.
Results
In early-onset preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, placental growth factor was lower and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase–1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule–1 higher than in control subjects, although all changes were more pronounced in preeclampsia. In late-onset preeclampsia, those patients with abnormal uterine artery Doppler indices had higher soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase–1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule–1 levels.
Conclusion
Biochemical changes in early-onset preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction point to a common placental disorder and a state of endothelial dysfunction, which may require interaction with other factors to explain the maternal disease in preeclampsia. Data in late-onset preeclampsia suggest that a proportion of them may occur with minimal placental involvement.

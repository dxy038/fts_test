This paper presents the results of a research study related to the application of Functional Modeling and Design Optimization methods in a Model Based System Engineering environment. In particular the potential developments related to the integration of commercial and non commercial tools for the preliminary design phase of a given product are discussed, evaluating the possibility to integrate the functional modeling methodologies studied in the frame of the STEPS<sup>1</sup> project activity for a better product definition, through a coherent description of the system model behavior by means of simulation models instantiations. The possibility to introduce the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization approach has been also considered in an object oriented way, aiming for a deeper analysis of the systems under study and to verify the feasibility in improving the multidisciplinary system knowledge, ensuring a better performance analysis without losing the reliability of models. A reference case regarding an electrical-mechanical device for space applications has been developed, to demonstrate the benefits and verify the validity of the selected modeling and simulation approach. To achieve this objective, a scenario is identified and related to specific requirements. Thus the simulation is set to verify that the specified requirements are satisfied by the system model and optimized after a proper selection of the design variables for the system under analysis. A final discussion about the achieved results concludes the article to assess the advantages of the presented approach, integrated in a distributed modeling and simulation environment.

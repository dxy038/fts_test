Speech intelligibility prediction of noisy and processed noisy speech is important in a number of application domains such as hearing instruments and forensics. Most available objective intelligibility measures employ either a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based or correlation-based comparison between frequency bands of the clean and the processed speech. In this paper, we approach the speech intelligibility prediction from the angle of information theory and show that an information theoretic concept provides a unified viewpoint on both the SNR and the correlation based approaches. Two objective intelligibility measures are introduced based on estimated mutual information between the clean speech and the processed speech in the time and the frequency subband domain. Our proposed measures show high correlation with subjective intelligibility measure (i.e. word correct scores) and comparative results with the short-term objective intelligibility measure (STOI).

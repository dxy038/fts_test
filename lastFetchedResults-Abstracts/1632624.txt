In spite of Aristotle, who settled the fundamental basis of his philosophical system "the metaphysical difference between matter and form", to reach the difference between sensible and nonsensory and to reach the unmoved mover that is natural agent, Avicenna chose "the metaphysical difference between existence and essence" to reach the difference between necessity and possibility and to prove the divine agent, namely creational agent cause and pure being that is Allah Almighty. 
But Mulla Sadra discussed about objective reality of existence and its gradational degrees, instead of discussion about extensions of existence and conformity of the concept of existence on them, to settle the fundamental basis of his philosophical system "primacy of existence over quiddity" or "principality of existence".
This article, explains various views about agency of Allah Almighty and finally concludes that Avicenna believes in Allah Almighty as agent-by-foreknowledge in the first sense, but Mulla Sadra believes in Allah Almighty as agent by self-manifestation and, in his another view, as agent-by-foreknowledge in the second sense.

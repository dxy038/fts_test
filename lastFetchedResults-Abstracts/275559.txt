The two-dimensional position of markers in radiographs for Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) is usually determined using a measuring table. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility and the accuracy of a new RSA system using digitized radiographs and image-processing algorithms to determine the marker position in the radiographs.
Four double-RSA examinations of a phantom and 18 RSA examinations from six patients included in different RSA-studies of knee prostheses were used to test the reproducibility and the accuracy of the system. The radiographs were scanned at 600 dpi resolution and 256 gray levels. The center of each of the tantalum-markers in the radiographs was calculated by the computer program from the contour of the marker with the use of an edge-detection software algorithm after the marker was identified on a PC monitor.
The study showed that computer-based image analysis can be used in RSA-examinations. The advantages of using image-processing software in RSA are that the marker positions are determined in an objective manner, and that there is no need for a systematic manual identification of all the markers on the radiograph before the actual measurement.

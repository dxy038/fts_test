The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mechanical properties of Al/Zr02 composites produced via vortex technique. Al-356 alloy and Zr02 particles with average diameter of 0.79 micron were used as the matrix and the reinforcement, respectively. The effect of Zr02 content and casting temperature on tensile strength and fracture surfaces of the composites were studied. The results indicate that addition of Zr02 particles into the matrix significantly increases mechanical properties of aluminum alloy. In this regard, the best tensile strength result was obtained in the specimen containing 15 vol% Zr02 produced at 750Â°C which showed an increase of about 60%. The Al-356/Zr02 composite specimens fracture in a brittle manner with little or no necking has been observed.

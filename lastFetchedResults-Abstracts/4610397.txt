Isolation of translational efficiency bias can have important applications in gene expression prediction and heterologous protein production. In some genomes the presence of a high GC(AT)-content bias can confound the isolation of translational efficiency bias. In other organisms translational efficiency bias is weak making it difficult to isolate. Described here is a multi-objective genetic algorithm that improves the isolation of translational efficiency bias in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, two organisms shown to have high GC-content and weak translational efficiency bias.

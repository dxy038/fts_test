The three-dimensional structure of two potential mesoscale upwelling areas that are located in the external waters of the Philippine archipelago (i.e. northwest of Luzon and east of Mindanao) were constructed by analysis of historical data. A unique characteristic of both upwelling sites is that they can be identified by their anomalously cold subsurface temperatures rather than sea surface temperature distributions. As such, they cannot be observed in sea surface temperature fields derived by satellite imagery. The data used in the analysis were obtained from the National Oceanographic Data Center hydrographic database. Objective analysis was performed to produce monthly temperature fields at several standard depths within the upper 500 m of the region 0–30°N and 100–140°E with a horizontal grid resolution of 0.5°. The extent and timing of these upwelling areas are described. A review of existing hypothesis on the mechanisms for their evolution and seasonal modulation are presented. The change in heat content during the upwelling season is greater than 300 W m−2 in both areas. Based on the excursion of isotherms, vertical velocities of 83 cm day−1 and 26 cm day−1 were obtained for upwelling northwest of Luzon and east of Mindanao, respectively.

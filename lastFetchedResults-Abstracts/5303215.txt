This paper examines multi-platform phased missions, which involves a number of platforms working together to achieve a common objective. A simulation model for multi-platform phased mission system reliability analysis is proposed. The model simulates the fault processes of various platforms within mission life by using a modularized multi-platform phased mission system model. With the Monte Carlo method together, the reliability of entire mission and mission phases can be analyzed. A hypothetical example system is used to show the application of this simulation model and the result exhibits that the reliability conditions of system within the mission and each mission phase can be evaluated and controlled effectively.

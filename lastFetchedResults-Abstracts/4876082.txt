This paper compares some different formulations of voltage stability indices derived from the Jacobian power flow matrix in presence of the secondary voltage regulation. The work is aimed at individuating an appropriate formulation of the Jacobian power flow matrix in order to calculate the maximum singular value to be used in the objective function of an ORPF (optimal reactive power flow). The different methodologies to calculate these indices are tested on a complex model of the EHV Italian transmission system

Objective
This study evaluated the prognostic factors in Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (HZO).
Methods
A retrospective, institutional review board-approved study at a university-based hospital. A total of 81 patients consisting of 55 Bell's palsy patients and 26 HZO patients were enrolled in this study. The treatment consisted uniformly in all cases, and acyclovir was administered in the case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. All patients were followed up until they recovered or for least up 6 months.
Results
The recovery rates to House-Brackmann grade II or better were 96.3% in those with Bell's palsy and 84.6% in those with HZO. In the HZO cases, older patients had a poorer initial and final status, and less chance of making a complete recovery than the younger patients. The HZO patients without diabetes mellitus had a higher chance of recovery, a higher chance of complete recovery, and a better final status. In addition, HZO patients without essential hypertension had a higher degree of recovery. HZO patients not suffering from vertigo had a higher chance of recovery.
Conclusion
There was no prognostic factor found in the Bell's palsy patients in this study. The prognostic factors of HZO were age, diabetus mellitus, essential hypertension and vertigo.

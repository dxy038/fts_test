Fuzzy sets are used to generalize the linear programming approach to large-scale power system control problems, and to ensure that the formulated problem accurately reflects the objectives and constraints of the control problem. Multiple objectives and soft constraints are modeled using fuzzy sets. Linear membership functions for the fuzzy sets are defined. Under this definition, the fuzzy optimization problem is reformulated as an equivalent standard linear programming problem. The new objective function represents the compromise among the original competing objectives and the soft constraints. In addition discrete constraints are considered. The approach is applied to the reactive power problem. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach

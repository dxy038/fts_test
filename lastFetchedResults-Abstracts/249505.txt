Robust optimization problems are newly formulated and an e,cient computational scheme is proposed.
Both design variables and design parameters are considered as random variables about their nominal
values. To ensure the robustness of objective performance, we introduce a new performance index
bounding the performance together with a constraint limiting the performance variation. The constraint
variations are regulated by considering the probability of feasibility. Each probability constraint is
transformed into a sub-optimization problem by the advanced <rst-order second moment (AFOSM)
method for computational e,ciency. The proposed robust optimization method has the advantages that
the mean value and the variation of the performance function are controlled simultaneously and rationally
and the second-order sensitivity information is not required even in case of gradient-based optimization
process. The suggested method is examined by solving three examples and the results are compared
with those for the deterministic case and those available in the literature

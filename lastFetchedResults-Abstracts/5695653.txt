Two control law design methods are applied to a model of the longitudinal axis of an advanced fighter aircraft. One control law uses an <e1>H</e1><sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization technique with a mixed sensitivity objective function to perform multivariable loop shaping. The second control law uses numerical optimization techniques with an LQG objective function. A comparative evaluation of the two control laws is presented using time and frequency responses and structured singular value analysis. The results show that both control laws have satisfactory time domain performance and frequency responses. In addition, the two control law designs have comparable robust stability and performance characteristics

The emergence of sensor networks as one of the dominant technology trends in the coming decades has posed numerous unique challenges on their security to researchers. These networks are likely to be composed of thousands of tiny sensor nodes, which are low-cost devices equipped with limited memory, processing, radio, and in many cases, without access to renewable energy resources. While the set of challenges in sensor networks are diverse, we focus on security of Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. First, we propose some of the security goal for Wireless Sensor Network. To perform any task in WSN, the goal is to ensure the best possible utilization of sensor resources so that the network could be kept functional as long as possible. In contrast to this crucial objective of sensor network management, a Denial of Service (DoS) attack targets to degrade the efficient use of network resources and disrupts the essential services in the network. DoS attack could be considered as one of the major threats against WSN security. Further, various DoS attacks on different layers of OSI are proposed.

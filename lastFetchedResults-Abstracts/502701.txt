Background and Objective: Resistin is a novel adipokine which may play a role in insulin resistance. In this study we aimed to determine the cord blood resistin, leptin, insulin and maternal serum resistin levels during pregnancy; and to investigate correlation between these metabolic hormones; and also to evaluate their association with newborn growth indices. 
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 80 newborns and their mothers in Mousavi Hospital Zanjan, Iran in 2009. Newborn growth indices including birth weight, height, body mass index (BMI), Ponderal index, Homeostatic Model assessment (HOMA-IR) and their mothers’ BMI were determined. Resistin, leptin and insulin levels were measured by ELISA. 
Results: In this study, cord blood resistin levels were higher than serum resistin levels of pregnant mothers (10.77±1.53 vs. 7.91± 5.71 ng/ml). Moreover, serum resistin levels of mothers’ did not exhibit any correlation with cord blood resistin, leptin and insulin levels, as well as neonatal anthropometric indices. Meanwhile, there was no significant correlation between cord resistin levels, insulin resistance, fat percentage and newborn growth factors. Cord resistin levels were positively correlated with cord blood leptin levels (r=0.222; p=0.048). Also, there was a significant positive correlation between cord blood leptin and neonatal BMI (r=0.223; p=0.047), Ponderal index (r=0.212; p=0.058), HOMA-IR (r=0.426; p=0.052) and fat percentage (r=0.247; p=0.014). 
Conclusion: On the basis of the findings,   increased cord blood resistin levels may indirectly influence fetal growth through leptin or other cytokine levels. Though, further researches are needed to confirm this matter.

This paper introduces a novel service oriented pilot platform developed to support Tele-Supervised rehabilitation programs for patients after hospitalization in Intensive Care Units. The platform is developed under the framework of the TeleRehabilitation project funded by the Cross Border Cooperation Programme Greece Cyprus 2007-2013 in order to successfully meet the main technological and clinical objectives of the project. The design and development of the platform is based on composite service architecture (aggregates smaller and fine-grained services such as Web Based applications, Clinical Information Systems and Video Communication Systems). The platform delivers sustainable, maintainable and high quality services and enables multiparty, interregional bidirectional audio/visual communication between clinical practitioners and post-ICU patients, enables patient group-based vital sign real time monitoring, individualized and group-based patient online training and patients clinical record bookkeeping.

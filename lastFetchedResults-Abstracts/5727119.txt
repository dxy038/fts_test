This paper presents an approach to solve a trajectory optimization problem for a launch vehicle using particle swarm optimization. Trajectory generation for a single stage liquid propellant launch vehicle is considered by using angle of attack as a control variable. The problem is solved by considering minimization of terminal error as an objective with some path constraints and fixed boundary conditions. The burning time of the liquid rocket engine is fixed, leading to fixed time problem. Two different types of inertia weight is examined in this problem, one is the random function and the other is linearly varying. The effectiveness is verified using simulation results obtained from Matlab simulation environment.

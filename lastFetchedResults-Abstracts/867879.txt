In this paper, the life cycle of an innovative product is divided into three stages, where a nonhomogeneous
Poisson process (NHPP) with a power law intensity function is employed to illustrate the entry process
of rival firms in a competitive market. The effects of the competitors’ entry on the profits of the
incumbent firm are taken into consideration, with an objective of deriving the optimal product life to
maximize the incumbent’s profit. Furthermore, a case study of a new type of LCD (liquid–crystal display)
TV is empirically investigated to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results of the
posterior analysis suggest that the influence of the competitors’ entry on the optimal product life is overestimated
in the prior analysis. The results of sensitivity analyses indicate that the effect of competition of
the introduction and growth stages on the optimal product life is greater than that of the maturation
stage on the optimal product life, which is subsequently greater than that of the decline stage on the optimal
product life.

The clinical utility of doxorubicin, an antineoplastic agent, is limited by its cardiotoxicity. Our objective was to determine whether expression of genes encoding proteins that affect Ca2+homeostasis were altered in the hearts of rabbits chronically treated with doxorubicin. Twelve male New Zealand white rabbits received an injection of doxorubicin (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) once a week for 8 weeks. Eight rabbits were similarly injected with saline as controls. The cardiac function of both groups was evaluated 8 weeks after the final injection, as were the levels of expression of mRNA for Ca2+transport proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. The amount of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and the Ca2+uptake capacity of the protein were also quantitated. Cardiac output was significantly decreased in the doxorubicin-treated group (71±21 ml/min,P<0.05) compared with the control group (118±15 ml/min). The mRNA levels for the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins were significantly diminished in the doxorubicin-treated hearts: ryanodine receptor-2 (relative expression level compared with controls, 0.35±0.13,P<0.01), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (0.56±0.13,P<0.01), phospholamban (0.62±0.20,P<0.01) and cardiac calsequestrin (0.57±0.26,P<0.01). In addition, both relative amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase protein (doxorubicin-treated group, 69±17% of control,P<0.01) and the Ca2+uptake capacity (46.9±9.8 nmol Ca2+/mg protein-5 min in doxorubicin groupv63.2±10.4 in the control group,P<0.01) were concomitantly decreased with its mRNA expression level. Conversely, the mRNA levels for the plasma membrane proteins did not differ from those of control rabbits: the dihydropyridine receptor (relative expression level, 1.03±0.30, ), plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (0.93±0.33, ) and the Na+/Ca2+exchanger (0.87±0.34, ). These findings suggest that a selective decrease in mRNA expression for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+transport proteins is responsible for the impaired Ca2+handling, and thus, for the reduced cardiac function seen in the cardiomyopathy induced in rabbits by the long-term treatment with doxorubicin.

Quality of Experience (QoE) is a widely used metric to measure the perceptive feeling of end users for multimedia service. In this paper, a QoE-driven radio resource allocation scheme has been developed for the multiuser-multiservice OFDM system. Different from the previous schemes, we take the service type into consideration when allocating radio resource. Three multimedia applications have been discussed in this work, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and File Download (FD). For all the multimedia applications, their QoE are related to the scheduled radio resource, the objective of our scheduling scheme is to maximize the overall QoE while guaranteeing all the users can perceive a relatively good QoE level. The proposed scheduling algorithm can be divided into two parts: Firstly, allocate subcarriers to all the users in order to guarantee their minimal transmit rate requirement, then the remaining subcarriers are allocated to the users who can achieve the best QoE gain. The simulation results indicate that our algorithm can reach high overall QoE performance while maintaining an acceptable fairness in the system.

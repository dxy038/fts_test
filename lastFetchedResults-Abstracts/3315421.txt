Currently, many companies require agility in supply chains to manage disruption risks. Supplier selection is one of the most important decisions for the success of firms. It is the first step of the activities in the product realization process starts from the purchase of materials for production and then delivery products to end customers. The objective of this research is to develop a conceptual framework model for supplier evaluation based on an integrated of the fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) model and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), which incorporates the procurement risk, production risk, deliver risk, and environment risks. The proposed model will be later implemented in a manufacturing firm to priority weight factor and will be presented in a due course.

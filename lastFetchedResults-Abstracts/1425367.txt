Background: Social anxiety disorder is fairly prevalent among alcohol abusing/dependent subjects. The objective of the present study was to investigate: (a) the incidence of social anxiety symptoms in inpatient alcoholics, (b) the effect of alcohol detoxification on these symptoms, and (c) whether a combined psychotherapeutic/mirtazapine treatment during the post-detoxification phase of alcoholism has a greater impact on the aforementioned symptoms than a non-pharmacological approach. Method: Social anxiety symptoms were assessed through the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) following a 4–5-week detoxification period in two groups: group A (n=21) that followed a detoxification protocol of cognitive–behavioral orientation and group B (n=33) that was assigned to mirtazapine in addition to the standard protocol. Concomitant psychopathology was monitored through the HARS and HDRS, and level of functioning through the GAS. Results: A marked reduction of social anxiety symptoms was evidenced in both groups. However, patients on mirtazapine improved significantly more compared to controls. Limitations: A single measure of social anxiety, i.e., the LSAS was used. Also, a longer follow-up period is needed to ascertain remission of social anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The present study found a rather high incidence of social anxiety symptoms in inpatient alcoholics which subsided following alcohol detoxification; moreover, it provides preliminary evidence that a combined psychotherapeutic/mirtazapine treatment (30–60 mg/daily) has a greater impact on the aforementioned symptoms than non-pharmacological treatment alone.

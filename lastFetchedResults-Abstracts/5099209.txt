Several approaches have been introduced over the years to simplify the management of measuring systems in order to ensure the employability of automated test equipment. A key issue, in this context, is the ability of test programs to identify instruments and be aware of their capabilities, specifications and limits. This paper investigates the use of the IEEE 1451.0 electronic data sheet structure to provide computer-readable, on-line documentation of measuring instruments specifications. The paper presents as an example the implementation of a set of Electronic Data Sheets referred to the function of a Digital Sampling Oscilloscope, showing how the TEDS concept and organization nicely support this objective.

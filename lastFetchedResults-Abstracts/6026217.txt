The maintenance of generating units is implicitly related to power system reliability and has a tremendous bearing on the operation of the power system. A technique using a fuzzy search method which is based on fuzzy multi-criteria function has been proposed for GMS (generator maintenance scheduling) in order to consider multi-objective function. In this study, a new technique using combined fuzzy set theory and genetic algorithm(GA) is proposed for generator maintenance scheduling. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the simulation results on a practical size test systems.

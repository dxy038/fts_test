In order to develop the state monitoring system of the power supply cable, the hardware and software are designed in this paper. The hardware design includes the selection of sensors, the design of the signal adjust circuit, and the design of the filter circuit. The software design includes the programming for upper monitor, data acquisition, database configuration, access interface, restraining signal noise, data analysis, fault location, network transmission of data, and Web information distribution. The functions of data acquisition, calculation and analysis, database access, upper limit alarm, network transmission are fulfilled in the monitoring system for the states of power supply cable. Experiments show that the system runs stably and the objective of monitoring the states of power supply cable is reached.

A new method for the objective assessment and prediction of perceived audio quality is introduced. It represents an expansion of the speech quality measure q<sub>C</sub>, introduced by Hansen and Kollmeier, and is based on a psychoacoustically validated, quantitative model of the "effective" peripheral auditory processing by Dau et al. To evaluate the audio quality of a given distorted signal relative to a corresponding high-quality reference signal, the auditory model is employed to compute "internal representations" of the signals, which are partly assimilated in order to account for assumed cognitive aspects. The linear cross correlation coefficient of the assimilated internal representations represents the perceptual similarity measure (PSM). PSM shows good correlations with subjective quality ratings if different types of audio signals are considered separately, whereas a better accuracy of signal-independent quality prediction is achieved by a second quality measure PSM<sub>t</sub> represented by the fifth percentile of the sequence of instantaneous audio quality PSM(t). The new measures were evaluated using a large database of subjective listening tests that were originally carried out on behalf of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) for the evaluation of various low bit-rate audio codecs. Additional tests with data unknown in the development phase of the model were carried out. Except for linear distortions, the new method shows a higher prediction accuracy than the ITU-R recommendation BS.1387 ("PEAQ") for the tested data

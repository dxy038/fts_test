Raman spectroscopy with optical fibre probes, a kind of vibrational spectroscopy providing detailed information about molecular composition and structure of tissues. The great appeal of Raman spectroscopy lies in its potential for in vivo applications and its ability to therefore direct real-time therapeutic intervention. Objective: The purpose of this study was to discuss optical fibre probes for in vivo Raman Spectroscopy and its clinical implementation. Methods: Important progress of technology and application in medicine were introduced and summarized. Results: Raman spectroscopy equipment with optical fibre probes, meets important prerequisites for the development of tools for in vivo real time tissue analysis, during clinical procedures such as endoscope, biopsy, and surgery. Conclusion: In vivo diagnostic tools are much needed in many fields of medicine to take the sometimes unavoidable guesswork out of current clinical procedures, to avoid long delays caused by ex vivo evaluation of patient material, or to simply replace current invasive methods by noninvasive or less invasive techniques. In vivo Raman spectroscopy may fulfil a role in all of these fields.

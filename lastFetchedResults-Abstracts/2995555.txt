The synthesis of an orientation control system for a free-flying automated space module (ASM) with relay actuators, operating in the transportation regime with a flexible payload (ASM-L) is considered. The approach is based on the modal-physical dynamics model. Analysis of the &#8220;dynamics portrait&#8221; of the ASM structure is used to determine the functional relationship between the grasping point co-ordinates and the intensity of the elastic oscillations excited by the relay control torques. This function is a multi-extreme one. The global extremum (minimum) of this function is the objective function used for the optimal choice of the load grasping point co-ordinates. This is used to form an extremum-tuning loop that automatically adjusts the grasping point co-ordinates during the transportation regime. This scheme is found to be very effective in minimising the vibration amplitudes

In this paper, genetic algorithms were used in order to synthesize dielectric multilayer shields with symmetric structures and plane interfaces considering TEM waves with normal and oblique incidences. The genetic algorithm optimization objective is to obtain each layer thickness to get a suitable filter response related to scattering parameters. The implemented algorithm codes were created in Matlab software in a very flexible manner to permit the designer specifies algorithm parameters and physical characteristics of the structure considered. Results and analysis of the algorithm configuration and efficiency are shown. Comparison with another optimization method and frequency response variance with the number of layers and incidence angles are also presented

The increased availability of Landsat imagery provides the opportunity to monitor changes in the land surface over long time frames. This paper presents an automated method for normalizing satellite images to a calibrated reference image using pseudo invariant features (PIFs). The method is repeatable, objective and fast, and has been used to prepare a large collection of Landsat images for flood inundation detection.

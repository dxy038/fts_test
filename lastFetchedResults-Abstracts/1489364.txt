The objective of this study was to investigate natural antimicrobials including cranberry powder, dried vinegar and lemon juice/vinegar concentrate, and post-lethality interventions (lauric arginate, octanoic acid, thermal treatment and high hydrostatic pressure) for the control of Listeria monocytogenes on alternatively-cured frankfurters. Lauric arginate, octanoic acid, and high hydrostatic pressure (400 MPa) reduced L. monocytogenes populations by 2.28, 2.03, and 1.88 log10 CFU per g compared to the control. L. monocytogenes grew in all post-lethality intervention treatments, except after a 600 MPa high hydrostatic pressure treatment for 4 min. Cranberry powder did not inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes, while a dried vinegar and a vinegar/lemon juice concentrate did. This study demonstrated the bactericidal properties of high hydrostatic pressure, octanoic acid and lauric arginate, and the bacteriostatic potential of natural antimicrobial ingredients such as dried vinegar and vinegar/lemon juice concentrate against L. monocytogenes.

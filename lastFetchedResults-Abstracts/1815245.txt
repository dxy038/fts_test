Recent studies have suggested that a tumor suppressor gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) for tumorigenesis of sporadic renal cell carcinoma. In this study, we introduced 3p from normal human fibroblasts into the renal cancer cell line YCR and this introduction clearly resulted in inhibited growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we investigated several enzyme activities of original YCR cells and 3p-induced clones (YCR-151 and YCR-152) and found that only alkaline phosphatase activity in 3p-induced clones was significantly increased compared to that of the original YCR cells.

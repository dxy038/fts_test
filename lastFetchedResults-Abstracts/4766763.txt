Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a kind of mode of management which characteristic is systematic, integrative and agile. The selection of supplier is one of the crucial steps in constructing a supply chain system. In this paper, an improved analytic hierarchy process method based on the concept of attribute significance in rough set theory is adopted in the supplier selection of SCM. Firstly, an optimization model which can determine the combinatorial judgement matrix is established. On the basis of this optimization model, a combinatorial judgement matrix is constructed by combining the subjective judgment matrix derived from the AHP method and the objective judgment matrix derived from the attribute significance in rough set theory, Then an initial probing is accomplished on the selection of supplier in SCM by the aforesaid comprehensive judgement matrix. Finally, an example is demonstrated to verify the validity and feasibility of the selection of supplier in SCM based on the proposed method.

For the prevention of human malaria, vector control is an important component of the
global strategy. The objective of the present study was to observe the effect of impregnated torn
bednets with three dosages of cyfluthrin 5% on the number of bites by Anopheles culicifacies. A
glass made tunnel test was designed and hungry female mosquitoes were induce to pass through
holes cut in the pyrethroid treated nets. A guinea pig used as bait to attract mosquitoes through
circular holes in the netting. With untreated netting, 72-87% of laboratory-reared females passed
through the holes overnight and 64-92% blood-fed successfully. When the netting was treated with
cyfluthrin at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg a.i./m2, the entry index (the proportions that passed
through the holes overnight) were 43.37%, 42.82% and 24.72%; mortality rates were 66.31%,
81.45% and 95.99%; and the feeding rate were 45%, 27% and 3%, respectively. Pyrethroid
impregnated bednets using “tunnel tests” showing acceptable protection rate both in lower and
higher dosages. In addition, the higher dosages of these three dosages pyrethroid provided good
levels of protection against An. culicifacies.

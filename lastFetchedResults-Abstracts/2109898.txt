The development of industrial and post-industrial criteria has made many changes in all aspects of our lives. Accordingly, presenting social policies and measures for managing welfare services for citizens including the deprived classes of the society, in the form of the behavioral, valued, and normative necessities, is an essential action. These services will enhance contribution, solidarity, social trust, and practical development of administration of justice and social equality. Consequently, bases of social capital of civil governance are reinforced. Additionally, offering professional and technical social services in the form of social plans and policies concerning better living conditions and civil welfare result in enhancement of social capital, sustainable development and prevention of social harms. Based on James Coleman’s social capital model in the middle class, this paper aims to give a sociological explanation using objective criteria of welfare in social services management, which can be used by governments to present programs to reinforce pillars of democracy. The necessity for the existence of obligations and expectations through enforcing social policies along with using the capabilities of deprived social classes as well as enforcing practical guarantees for welfare result in solving social issues and the prevention of harmful social consequences. By presenting continuous programs, social services management can remove the obstacles that lie on the path of attracting the cooperation and trust of citizens as regards the civil mangers’ output. It can also enhance the social capital of the underprivileged classes of society through social activities such as: education, skill learning, talent finding, and social relations improvement, expanding social networks, hygiene (spiritual, social and psychological), prevention of social risks, consultation services, health and cure supporting. As a result, there is a need to recreate effective measures to create civil trust among citizens concerning the government through measures for welfare and better living conditions, social equality and continuous social engineering in three areas of structure, communication and cognition, and in the form of obligations, expectations, and potential capacities of information, and norms, as well as organizational executive guarantees

The purpose of image fusion is to merge information from multi-sensor and to improve abilities of information analysis and feature extraction. In this paper, a new image fusion algorithm based on multiwavelet transform to fuse multimedical images is presented. The detailed discussions are focused on the two-wavelet and two-scaling function multiwavelets. In the fusion algorithm, a feature-based fusion rule is used to combine original subimages and to form a pyramid for the fused image. It can merge information from original images adequately and improve abilities of information analysis and feature extraction. Experiment of fusing medical CTMRI images is presented in this paper. Comparing with other image fusion methods, satisfactory result has been obtained by applying this method on both objective and subjective performance measure.

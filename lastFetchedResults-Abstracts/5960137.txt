The primary idea of genetic algorithm (GA) and its general method in solving the problem are introduced. Multi-objective GA is proposed based on the analysis of such factors as energy, protein, carbohydrate, objective cost, other nutriment, and nutrition quality, the optimization model as well as its algorithm for nutrition meals from which some other problems that need further investigation are also discussed.

In view of the characteristics of the fixed job scheduling problem, by establishing the sequential network model among work pieces the fixed job scheduling is converted into the optimal directed path decomposition problem, and the minimal path assignment cost of the sequential network model is the optimization objective. Then a heuristic algorithm based on the simulated annealing is presented, and applied to simulate the airline aircraft dispatching problem. The result indicates that the algorithm can deal with the generally fixed job scheduling problem, whose computation complexity is O (M (m<sup>3</sup>+mn)).

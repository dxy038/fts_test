OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the characteristics of vibroacoustic devices used for fetal stimulation.
STUDY DESIGN: Intrauterine sound pressure levels over a frequency range of 40 to 5000 Hz were measured with hydrophones in anesthetized sheep. Stimulators included the AT&T (Martinsburg, W.V.) and Servox (Hearing Instruments, Piscataway, N.J.) artificial larynges, the Corometrics fetal acoustic stimulator (Wallingford, Conn.) and an electric toothbrush.
RESULTS: Intrauterine spectral patterns resulting from stimulation with the AT&T, Servox, and Corometrics devices were characterized by numerous high-level overtones above a fundamental frequency between 97 and 163 Hz. Fundamental frequencies recorded during toothbrush stimulation were 22 to 24 Hz with reduced but identifiable overtones up to 250 Hz.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal vibroacoustic stimulators that operate on the principle of the electronic artificial larynx produce very similar intrauterine sound pressure levels.

A cognitive two-way relay network scenario is considered, where a secondary user acts as a two-way relay to forward messages for two primary terminals with the objective of enhancing the service quality of primary terminals and the opportunity for the transmission of its data. Based on the outage analysis, a novel protocol of cognitive two-way relay is proposed, which combines the benefits of the two conventional schemes depending on the position of the secondary user. Moreover, a time-slot dividing policy between the primary and secondary transmissions is proposed and analyzed in terms of the ergodic capacity. Simulation results validate the studies in this paper.

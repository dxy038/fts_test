In this article, a hybrid model based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) is developed for optimal design of tall buildings. Columns and beams sizes are considered as design variables in the optimization process. Discrete variables are employed for design variables in both GA and ACO methods and weight of the structure is employed as objective function. In the proposed hybrid ACO and GA (HAG) algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm is assumed to be the main algorithm and using GA as a local explorer for searching better solutions. A new operator is proposed based on the engineering experience to fasten the convergence. Some examples are studies and the results show that the proposed model creates a remarkable improvement in the solutions and provides fast convergence.

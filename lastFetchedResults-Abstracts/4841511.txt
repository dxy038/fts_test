The objective in neuromusculoskeletal simulation consists in finding a set of muscles excitations in order to produce the desired motion and is an exciting challenge for medical operators. In this paper, muscle excitations are computed by using a second order sliding mode controller which is optimal with respect of a functional cost based on the tracking error and the torque square. The proposed strategy was tested using a two-dimensional human anthropomorphic arm composed of two joints and six muscles.

Our objective, in this paper is to study the impact of halo implant on MOS transistor. In this aim, a NMOS transistor model based on a split model approach is proposed. This model allows simulating accurately transistors with halo implant in realistic conditions. It is demonstrated that the electrical behaviour of the proposed model matches in a satisfactory way the transistor behaviour established by 3D device simulation (ISE). The computation time is significantly reduced from hours with device simulation to seconds with our model.

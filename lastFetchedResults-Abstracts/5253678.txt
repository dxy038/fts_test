In this paper, we evaluate through 2D physical simulations the impact of IGBT elementary cells spatial repartitioning on a bidirectional monolithically integrated IGBT device static as well as dynamic performances. We also show how one could improve the on-state voltage drop of the analyzed structure by using an already published technique. Afterwards, we discuss the two technologies that can be used for the realization of the devices and we enumerate the advantages and difficulties inherent to each technology. Moreover, we provide characterization results obtained on unilateral and bidirectional IGBTs realized in our (LAAS-CNRS) clean room using an IGBT flexible technological process.

This paper presents a detailed operation analysis, controller design, and realization of a high-power, bidirectional quasi-Z-source inverter (BQ-ZSI) for electric vehicle applications. The circuit analysis shows that with a bidirectional switch in the quasi-Z-source network, the performance of the inverter under small inductance and low power factor can be improved. Based on the circuit analysis, a small signal model of the BQ-ZSI is derived, which indicates that the circuit is prone to oscillate when there is disturbance on the dc input voltage. Therefore, a dedicated voltage controller with feed-forward compensation is designed to reject the disturbance and stabilize the dc-link voltage during a non-shoot-through state. An 85-kW prototype has been built. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to prove the functionality of the circuit and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

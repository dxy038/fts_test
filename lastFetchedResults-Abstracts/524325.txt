Objective-This study was conducted to determine the reference intervals for CD3+ (T cells), CD4+ (T helper/inducer cell, Th), CD8+ (T suppressor/cytotoxic cells, Ts/c), CD3+CD4+/ CD3+CD8+ ratio, CD19+ (B cells) and CD16++56+ (NK cells) in a healthy Iranian population. Method-Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems (BDIS) Simultest IMK-lymphocyte (dual color) reagents were used. The samples were first stained with appropriate monoclonal antibodies and then lysed using BDIS FACS lysing solution. The samples were analysed by BDIS FACS Caliber flowcytometry using the SimulSET software, version 2.5. Results- The study population consisted of 152 healthy, male and female non-smokers, 18 to 60 years of age. The mean CD3+ percentage was 69.95% for males and 71.46% for females, and the mean percentage of CD3+ CD4+ Th subset was 40.4% and 44.21% for males and females respectively. The mean CD3+ CD4+/CD3+ CD8+ ratio was 1.55±0.54 for male population and 1.7±0.65 for female populations. The mean percentage of B lymphocytes (CD19+) was 14.52% for the females and 13.08% for males. Conclusion- This study indicates that race, sex and age should be a consideration in the evaluation of the immune status.

This paper presents the development of a first approach to a vision-based target detection. The ultimate objective of this work is to position an autonomous surface vehicle relative to a target. Experiments in a controlled indoor environment were conducted to test the developed system. The experimental results are analyzed and show that the tracking performances achieve errors in the order of a few centimetres.

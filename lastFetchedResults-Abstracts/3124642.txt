The paper deals with load profiles of electrical consumers of distribution networks (low voltage busbars of distribution transformers). These profiles are the most important data not only for performing off-line network analyses (what-if analysis, operation and development planning, etc.), but also for providing satisfactory results of running of all real-time functions (State Estimation, Power Flow, Fault Management, etc.). The load profiles are treated as random variables. The following two proofs are the main objective of the paper: 1) The load profiles with the necessary accuracy can be derived on the basis of a relatively small number of experiments (in-field measurements) and 2) The normal distribution is the best guess for the statistical behaviour of the most number of loads.

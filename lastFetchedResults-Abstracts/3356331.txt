Complex emergency resource scheduling schemes are essential to improve the quality and efficiency of processes and software services. Despite the effort of many researchers in this direction, there are not yet mechanisms that facilitate collaborative development of resource scheduling decision-making in complex emergency systems. In order to treat these issues, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is introduced to handle multi-objective decision-making in emergency systems. In the process of collaboration, partition algorithm (PA) is proposed to divide rescue points into different sets. Experimental results have shown the proposed parallel computing method has significantly improved the computational efficiency of emergency resource scheduling schemes.

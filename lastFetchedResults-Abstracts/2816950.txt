Optimization models used for combined economic operation of CCHP system connecting to grid with and without power injection and energy storage are proposed respectively in this paper. The minimal system operation cost is taken as the optimizing objective function. The constraints are established based on the analysis of the thermoelectric and operating characteristics of relevant equipment including energy storage. In the case study, the optimal operating of a typical building in the heating period is studied. According to the heating and power load forecasting data of a typical day, the proposed combined optimization method is applied to gain the generation schemes of the internal combustion engine and energy storage. The effects of energy storage on the operating of CCHP system in different grid-connected mode are investigated. The results show that the energy storage is good for system economy and can diminish the output power fluctuation of CCHP system.

Responding to an increasing demand for mechanism synthesis tools that are both efficient and accurate, this paper presents a novel approach to the multi-objective optimal design of four-bar linkages for path-generation purposes. Three, often conflicting criteria including the mechanism's tracking error, deviation of its transmission angle from 90Â° and its maximum angular velocity ratio are considered as objectives of the optimization problem. To accelerate the search in the highly multimodal solution space, a hybrid Pareto genetic algorithm with a built-in adaptive local search is employed which extends its exploration to an adaptively adjusted neighborhood of promising points. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to a classical design problem for one, two and three objective functions and comparing the results with those reported in the literature. The comparison shows that the proposed algorithm distinctly outperforms other algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively (from a practical point of view).

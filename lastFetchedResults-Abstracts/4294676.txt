The objective of this study is to compare the cardiac extracellular potentials due to an external field, as predicted by three different models. The three models are: (1) a monodomain isotropic model; (2) a monodomain anisotropic model; and (3) a bidomain anisotropic model. The myocardium is modeled as a spherical shell with the curved and rotating cardiac fibers characterized by conductivity tensors. The field-induced potentials are calculated using 3-D finite element methods. The cardiac potentials predicted by the monodomain and bidomain anisotropic models differ by less than 5% RMS. Those predicted by the monodomain isotropic model, however, can differ from the bidomain model by as much as 21% RMS. The results suggest that (1) including cardiac fiber anisotropy has a considerable effect on the accuracy of the model, and (2) little is gained by using the complex bidomain model when calculating the extracellular potentials.

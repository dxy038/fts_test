The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the inclusion of oregano in the diet of dairy cows on the physicochemical quality of raw milk and the sensory attributes of pasteurized milk. Twelve crossbred Holstein × Zebu cows were divided into three 4 × 4 Latin squares, and increasing amounts of oregano were added to their diet. Physicochemical analysis of density, cryoscopic index, protein, fat, lactose, total solids extract (TSE), and dry nonfat extracts (DNE) was performed for the raw milk samples. The microbiological quality of pasteurized milk samples was evaluated by performing total and fecal coliform tests. Adding oregano to the diet showed no influence (P&gt;0.05) on the fat, TSE, protein, and cryoscopic index, with mean values of 3.78 g/100 g, 12.60 g/100 g, 3.24 g/100 g, and g −0535 °H, respectively. However, the levels of lactose, DNE, and density were influenced by the amount of oregano (OV) and ranged from 4.82 g/100 g to 4.64 g/100 g, 9.22 g/100 g to 8.88 g/100 g, and 1.033 g/mL to 1.032 g/mL, respectively. Based on microbiological analysis, all samples were considered suitable for consumption (&lt;3.0 × 105 CFU/mL). The sensory attributes of aroma and flavor did not alter the preference (P&gt;0.05). Only a small difference between treatments was observed in the flavor profile for the warmed-over flavor attribute. For the attributes of a sweet aroma, characteristic milk aroma, characteristic milk flavor, and sweet flavor, the intensity ranges were similar. The results showed no changes (P&gt;0.05) in the main components of milk and, therefore, no effect on its sensory attributes. Thus, it is possible to incorporate dry oregano into cattle feed for the purpose of studying its influence on other parameters of milk composition.

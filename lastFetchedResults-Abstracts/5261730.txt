A wearable physiological and environmental monitoring system and a practical implementation are presented. The technical requirements for wearable electronics and sensors have been specified with an example of ECG, oxygenometer, and wireless network-based bidirectional communication. A presented system includes micro-device design, wireless network based on TCP/IP protocol and software application. The result samples from monitoring in ambulatory environment confirm the performance and usefulness of the proposed methodology.

Background and Objective: The use of pesticides in agriculturl practices is on the increase in Iran. This is causing great concern about the public health risks due to pesticide redsidues in food products. The objective of this study was to determine the occurance of 117 pesticidc residues in vegetables marketed in the Tehran main wholesale fruit and vegetable market in 2005, by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, thirthy vegetable (10 cucumber, 10 tomato, 5 cabbage, and 5 lettuce) samples were collected from the main wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Tehran and analyzed for the organophosphorus, ganonitroge, dicarboximidc, organochlorine, triazine, pyrethroids,and strobilurin residues.Extraction of the pesticides with different physico- chemical properties was done, using ethyl acetate and anhydrous sodium sulphate as solvents , followed by purification by high-performance gel permeation chromatography and solid phase extraction. For the identification of the pesticidc residues gas chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used.
Results: Of the 30 vegatable samples analyzed, 53.33% were contaminated with insectieide residues. Endosulfan-1, cndosulfan-11, endosulfan-sulphate, chlorpyrifos and phosalone were detected in the cucumber and tomato samples. The mean pesticide recovery was calculated to be >60%, which is quite good.
Conclusion: The mean levels of the pestiticide residues in the samples were much lower than the respective maximum residue limits (MRLs) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commision and the European Community (p<0.05). Moreover, no residues of the restricted or banned pesticides, such as DDTor HCH-y or their metabolites, were present in any of the samples analysed.

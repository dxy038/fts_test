One of the most important issues in electrical modeling of physiological system is to find an effective way of making the most accurate equivalent electrical circuit. For this reason, in this research a new way of calculation of equivalent resistance of any type of vessels in biological systems has been proposed. The research presented in this paper is part of an ongoing effort to utilize mathematical models in the investigation of electrical model based estimation of any biological systems. To achieve this objective, accurate estimation of flow pathways in humanÂ´s body we chose to model the entire hemodynamic system by equivalent electrical elements (RLC) which captures the physical properties of a segment of the biological system. For now, this study is focused on how to calculate the electrical resistance. Thus, the accuracy of electrical based models has been increased such that for any part with its individual configurations, an appropriate model has been considered. In this way the ability of modeling of different biological systems with different geometries and configurations has been improved.

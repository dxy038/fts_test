This paper studies two-machine flowshop scheduling with batching and release time, whose objective is to minimize the makespan. We formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed integer programming model and show that it is a strongly NP-hard problem. We derive a lower bound and develop dynamic programming-based heuristic algorithms to solve the scheduling problem. Computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the heuristic algorithms. The numerical results show that some of the heuristic algorithms can indeed find effective solutions for the scheduling problem.

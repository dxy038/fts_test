The problem of restoring a power system to its initial steady state in minimum time after a transient disturbance is identified as a minimum time problem in optimal control theory. The optimal control obtained to achieve this objective, by use of PontryaginÂ´s maximum principle, is bang-bang control of line reactance. The implementation of this scheme on a simple power system model is shown, along with numerical results.

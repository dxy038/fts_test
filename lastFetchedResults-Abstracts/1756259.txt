Objective
rpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between symptoms of depression in workers and the common cold.
s
ow-up survey of workers at 44 small- to medium-sized companies was conducted; 1350 questionnaires were used in the final analysis. The first survey requested information regarding personal information, work characteristics and symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale); the second survey queried participants who answered the first survey about manifestations of the common cold during the previous four months. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model, which was adjusted for potential confounders. All analyses were stratified according to gender separately.
s
s for reporting symptoms of the common cold were 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.83) and 2.27 (95% CI: 1.49–3.45) in males and females, respectively. When adjusted for age, marital status, educational level, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep duration and job type, the ORs remained significant for both genders (male: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.01–1.89; female: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.32–3.23).
sions
sk of self-reported manifestations of the common cold was higher in workers who reported symptoms of depression.

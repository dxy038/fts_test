The method of auxiliary sources (MAS) has been demonstrated as a suitable for solution of diffraction and inverse problems in complex 2-D large objects. Based on MAS numerical study of 3D RCS, EMC/EMI and SAR problems, related to the EM field resonance enhancement inside vehicles and the interaction of the cellular phone radiation with the userÂ´s head are given in Zaridze et al. (2002, 2003). Objective of this paper is to present details of MAS application to the wide 3D electrodynamic problems. The area of its efficient application, some features and advantages to achieving efficient solutions, are discussed. The extension of the MAS for semi-open structures with partitions is also presented

This paper has discussed a class of practical switched systems with multi proportional-integral controllers. And the switching control principles based on the Min(Max) switching law is described and the integral saturation limiting in proportional-integral controller to guarantee a rapid switching is discussed. A conservative dynamic performance of this class of switched systems under switching is presented, which is the possible maximum value of the system dynamic output maximum percent overshoot at any different switching points. The conservative dynamic performance is dependent just on the system parameters but not on the initial states caused by different switching points, which makes it easy to present an exact performance objective in switching control design. And finally, a general switching proportional-integral control design approach for this class of switched systems is generalized and is testified to be reasonable and reliable by simulations.

The main problem in the synthesis of any mechanism is the fact that the objective function of the mechanism, which will be synthesized, should be found and simplified by using appropriate algebraic method. Finding objective function and calculation process can become complicated especially when the number of design parameters is increased for the over-constrained mechanisms. A new technique for solving the kinematic synthesis of over-constrained double-spherical six-bar mechanism is developed and applied in this work. Interpolation approximation is used during synthesis procedure. A numerical example for the kinematic synthesis procedure is given to validate the theory in application.

The objective of this study was to assess the bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cr and Fe) in the muscles of five fish species (Sander lucioperca, Liza auratus, Alosa caspia, Cyprinus carpio and Liza saliens) from Gorgan Bay in the south-eastern Caspian Sea, in order to determine the value daily intake of heavy metals by consumption of fish and human health risk assessment. The concentration of metals was estimated using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Potential health risk assessments based on estimated daily intake (EDI) values and target hazard quotient (THQ) indicated that the intakes of metals by consuming these fish species do not result in an appreciable hazard risk for the human body. The hazard index (HI) calculated was lower than 1 for all the species. However, the results indicate that the high concentrations of Pb (in the muscle of L. auratus) and Fe in all fish is alarming.

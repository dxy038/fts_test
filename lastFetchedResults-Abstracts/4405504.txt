The designers judge the advertisement design based on subjective assessment only. But we think that they need an objective assessment to evaluate it. In this research, we propose a novel system which estimates our interest in posters by our eye gaze and it is called &#8220;Intelligent Poster&#8221;. We hereby get an objective rating of the poster design and knowledge for making good posters. This paper focuses on eye gaze estimation which meets some requirements and has enough accuracy and robustness for &#8220;Intelligent Poster&#8221;. Many researchers propose various eye gaze estimation, for example, using corneal reflection, wearing measurement hardware, using only cameras. In these days, we can get high resolution cameras in cheap with developing the technology. So, we can simply construct an eye gaze system by using a camera. We combine two methods based on ellipse fitting and three-dimensional model to realize the robust estimation. The achieved accuracy of our proposed method is 6 deg.

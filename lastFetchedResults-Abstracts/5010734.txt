We propose a differentiated CDMA (D-CDMA) protocol for 3.5<sup>th</sup>-generation (3.5G) wireless cellular networks. D-CDMA employs an adaptive channel access scheme and a differentiated frame structure to support QoS differentiation and guarantee. From our simulation and analytical results, we show that D-CDMA with penalty-based adaptable reservation and admission (PARA) can achieve smaller blocking rate, given an arrival rate, and higher throughput, given a blocking rate objective, as compared to previous protocols without PARA.

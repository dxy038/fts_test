The objective of this paper is to examine the link between the attenuation coefficients and the interferometric phase center heights, for several frequencies from P-band to L-band, and to study in what extent it depends on the canopy architecture and description. This study relies on the use of a coherent and full polarimetric scattering model, which simulates the backscattered fields by a forested area. In a first part, we study the frequential behavior of the interferometric phase center heights and in the second part, we focus on the attenuation coefficients. The behaviors of these two quantities are compared and in a third part, we propose to empirically derive a relation between these two quantities and the mean forest height. Finally, we investigate if a change of the incidence angle has an impact on the determination of this relation.

Objective
Short-term cigarette smoke exposure has been associated with acute lung inflammation (ALI) and oxidative damage. We studied mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis infusion) as a possible nutritional resource for ALI.
Methods

C57BL/6 mice (n = 30) were administered with mate tea orally (150 mg/kg, CSMO), mate tea intraperitonially (150 mg/kg, CSMIP), or the vehicle (CS) and then exposed to cigarette smoke for 5 d (six cigarettes per day). The control group was sham-smoked (n = 30). One day after the final exposure, mice were sacrificed. Bronchoalveolar lavages were performed and lungs removed for biochemical (lung homogenates) and histologic analyses.
Results

Mate tea reduced the increase of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavages (cells × 103/mL) of the CSMO (214.3 ± 21.4 and 12.2 ± 4.9) and CSMIP (248.3 ± 11.1 and 12.1 ± 2.3) groups compared with the CS group (425.9 ± 28.1 and 140.5 ± 20.1). Mate tea reduced lipid peroxidation (the control group was considered 100%) and tumor necrosis factor-α (picograms per milliliter) in the CSMO group (61.3 ± 11.3 and 185.3 ± 21.8) compared with the CS group (150.0 ± 18.1 and 242.3 ± 13.2). Matrix metalloprotease-9 activity was higher in the CS group and lower in the CSMO group. Oxidative and inflammatory markers in the CSMO group were not different from those in the control group.
Conclusion

These data imply a potential antioxidant role for mate tea on ALI. Further studies are needed to determine such mechanisms and to explore its potential as an anti-inflammatory and nutritional resource in lung damaged by cigarette smoke exposure.

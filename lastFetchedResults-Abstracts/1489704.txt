Nowadays, one of the significant concepts drawing official attractions is the process safety. This is more important specifically in off-shore oil and gas platforms where releasing hydrocarbons could cause irreversible damages to both environment and staff. One important instrument device which can provide safety for process equipments in oil and gas fields is pressure safety valve (PSV). Adequate and suitable size of PSV orifice is of great importance. The main objective of the present work is to compare prediction results of different thermodynamic models regarding relieving fluid properties and also applying different methods to size PSV orifice. It has concluded that some of the thermodynamic models are not able to predict critical properties of fluid, so they are not applicable in sizing PSVs with first method (using critical pressure), however, orifice designation in methods of sizing is the same when other models are introduced, though, and using depressurizing-HYSYS produced different results.

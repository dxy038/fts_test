Lewis rats undergo a relapsing paralytic disease upon challenge with spinal cord emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Treatment with two intracardiac injections of liposomes composed of whole myelin significantly reduced the severity of disease. Protection was disease-specific since treatment with myelin liposomes did not protect Lewis rats against adjuvant arthritis (AA), a CNS-unrelated T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Myelin-liposome-treated, spinal cord/CFA-immunized rats displayed borderline reduction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) (ear swelling) reactions to myelin and myelin basic protein (MBP), but significantly reduced in vitro lymphnode cell proliferation in response to these antigens. Responses to purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD) were not reduced, emphasizing the antigen-specific nature of the myelin-liposome-mediated suppression. Spleen cell proliferative responses were inconsistent and often poor. However, when cultured in the presence of NG -monomethyl-L-arginine (MMA), antigen-specific proliferation of spleen cells from both treated and control rats was greatly enhanced, indicating that reactive nitrogen intermediates contributed to the decrease in spleen cell proliferation. Purified splenie T cells from treated rats displayed a pattern of proliferation similar to that of unseparated lymphnode cells. Treatment of rats with a single injection of myelin liposomes after recovery from the first clinical episode significantly reduced the severity of the relapses.

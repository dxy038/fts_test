The quality of suspension helical spring is very important to the stationarity and safety of automobile. Taking the automobile suspension helical spring as the research object, by using Pareto optimization theory and particle swarm optimization algorithm, the paper establishes a multi-objective optimization model of automobile suspension helical spring which is based on the Matlab optimization design platform. The purpose is to seek for the optimal structure design proposal which is under the objective of maximum natural frequency and minimum quality of spring. The Pareto optimal solution set is obtained.

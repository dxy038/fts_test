Understanding how the postural control system is impaired with aging can help identify elderly at risk of falling. In order to study the postural control, center of pressure (COP) behavior can be analyzed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to discriminate the postural control of elderly in horizontal and inclined (14 degrees) surfaces, with and without visual input, comparing the results with the ones obtained with the classical variables, like mean velocity and total COP displacement. Results with classical variables revealed significant differences in all comparisons realized, but DFA was not able to classify the differences between conditions. It is suggested further studies to verify the efficiency of DFA in physiologically different groups, like subjects with some pathology that affects the balance or the ones wearing a robotic prosthesis from healthy subjects, in which it seems to have a greater sensitivity.

In present days with increasing in load demand and with large interconnection of various networks it is essential to operate generating stations optimally within its constraints. Otherwise the price for the cost of generation increases. So it is very much essential to reduce the cost of generation. The cost of generation mainly includes running cost of generation ie., fuel cost with respect to thermal &amp; nuclear power stations. Also the major economic factor in power system planning, operation and control is with the cost of generating real power. In this paper, the main objective is to minimize the cost of real power generation by optimal allocation of generating units to load demand subjected to equality and inequality constraints. The optimum generation scheduling plays an extremely important role in optimal operation of power system. To obtain economic scheduling, a method is proposed based on lambda iterative approach using Differential Evolution programming. The Economic Dispatch (ED) is to minimize the operating fuel cost while satisfying the load demand and operational constraints. The analysis is carried out with inclusion of transmission losses and the results are presented. The proposed method is tested with two sample systems by considering various load demands. The numerical results have shown the performance and applicability of the proposed method. Also the results obtained by the proposed method are compared with the existing methods.

Objective: To examine the relationship of depression to metabolic and nutritional risk factors in older
Hispanics. Design: Crossectional study. Setting: Subjects were part of a community-based, cognitive evaluation
project that examined 301 subjects in the Eastern San Fernando Valley of Southern California. Participants: Two
elderly Hispanic groups: 53 clinically depressed, with memory complaints but not demented subjects, and 33
generally healthy, cognitively asymptomatic subjects. Measurements: The results of functional and nutritional
questionnaires, a medical and neurological examination, 12-hour fasting clinical laboratory tests, MRI or CT
scans, and neuropsychological testing. Results: Both groups were nearly identical along socio-demographic
variables. However, the depressed group differed significantly from the general healthy group not only in percent
of diabetics (38% vs.18%), but in the amount of poorly controlled diabetes, and the depressed group consumed
about half the amount of fish that the generally healthy group did. Conclusions: This study suggests that factors
such as poorly controlled diabetes combined with low consumption of foods high in omega-3 fatty acid content
such as sea fish may be associated with an increased risk of developing depression in late life. These factors may
be socio-economically and culturally influenced and are therefore amenable to modification.

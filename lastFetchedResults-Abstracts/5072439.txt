This paper presents an approach using Lagrangian method to solve the optimal chiller load distribution (OCLD) problem and to improve the deficiencies of conventional methods. The kW-PLR (part load ratio) curve of a chiller is chosen as the objective function for the reason of being a concave function. The potential performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by mean of two example systems. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed method has much less power consumption and is very suitable for application in air conditioning system operation.

In this article, an efficient methodology is presented to optimize the topology of structural
systems under transient loads. Equivalent static loads concept is used to deal with transient
loads and to solve an alternate quasi-static optimization problem. The maximum strain
energy of the structure under the transient load during the loading interval is used as
objective function. The objective function is calculated in each iteration and then the
dynamic optimization problem is replaced by a static optimization problem, which is
subsequently solved by a convex linearization approach combining linear and reciprocal
approximation functions.
The optimal layout of a deep beam subjected to transient loads is considered as a case
study to verify the effectiveness of the presented methodology. Results indicate that the
optimal layout is dependant of the loading interval.

This paper proposes an adaptation of the genetic algorithm heuristic for the resolution of the problem of assignment of cells to switches in personal communication networks. It discusses the combinatorial optimisation problem considering how difficult and from the necessary resolution the recourse to adaptive methods are not conducive to the optimal solutions, the objective is to more quickly reduce the convergence time towards a feasible solution. The preliminary results already obtained are encouraging and allow an insight into the efficiency of this method as regards the capacity to generate the quasi-optimal solutions for the problems of a certain cut

As 3G video services mature, the ability to deliver adequate perceptual quality to end users will become increasingly important. The paper identifies the factors that influence perceptual quality and quantifies them using subjective testing. A new objective quality metric for measuring 3G video services is introduced. The metric is shown to predict accurately the perceptual quality of 3G video services.

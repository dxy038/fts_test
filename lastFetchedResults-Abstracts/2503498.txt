Abstract 
Introduction: Dietary fat may affect lens cell membrane composition and function, which are related to senile cataract. Cataract is the first cause of blindness in the world and nutrition and lifestyle play an important role in its development. Recent studies have reported that dietary fat may affect lens cell membrane composition and function, which ultimately will result in senile cataract. 
Objective: To survey the association between dietary fatty acids and senile cataract
Materials and Methods: This study is a case-control investigation with a retrospective approach conducted on 350 patients approved by an eye specialist (175 patients suffering from senile cataract and 175 people in control group) via clinical examination and interview, who had been visited in the eye clinic of Amir Al Momenin hospital from March  2013 to March 2014. Data about intake of selected fatty acids were evaluated using a valid semi â€“quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) assessing a 168 item food index.
Results: There was a significant positive correlation between saturated fatty acids, oleic acid, linolenic acid and linoleic acid consumption and the senile cataract status in both groups. In addition, an inverse relationship between the status of senile cataract and a high intake of eicosapentaenoic acid and decosa hexaenoic acid was observed.
Conclusion: High intake of some fatty acids may increase the risk of age related nuclear opacity. However, more studies are needed to verify this association and clarify the relationship between intake fatty acids and senile cataract.

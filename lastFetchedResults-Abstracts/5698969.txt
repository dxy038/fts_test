Reverse engineering of behavior models has received a lot of attention over the last few years. However, no standard benchmark exists for the comparison and analysis of published miners. Evaluation is usually performed on few case studies, which fails to demonstrate effectiveness in a broad context. This paper proposes a general, approach-independent, platform for the intensive evaluation of behavior miners. Its goals are essentially: provide a benchmark mechanism for reverse engineering; allow analysis of miners w.r.t. a class of programs and/or behaviors; help users in choosing the best suited approach for their objective.

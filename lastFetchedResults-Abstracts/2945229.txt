This paper considers the synthesis of state feedback gains which provide robustness against perturbation in deadbeat regulation. It is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem. Through a posteriori perturbation analysis of the closed-loop eigenvalues, the justification of the use of a new objective function to measure the robustness of deadbeat systems is established. The objective function does not require the computation of eigenvectors and has simple analytical gradient and Hessian. A numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method

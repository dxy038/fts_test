It has been proven that students are able to learn and retain knowledge better by actively participating rather than learning passively. In line with this thrust, the objective is to address the problem of knowledge retention and reuse of implicit and explicit knowledge through use of an active learning system. In particular we aim to develop a learning module in a database course which would encompass lessons learnt from mistakes, tacit and explicit knowledge from both experts and students. In the process, it endeavors efficient use of students and teacherÂ´s time by maximum reuse of knowledge derived from experience and faster access to knowledge with the help of an active learning system.

This paper proposes a novel quality-oriented algorithm for multiple-source delivery of multimedia over heterogeneous wireless networks, which enables maintaining high levels of user-perceived quality. Unlike existing solutions, which perform delivery adaptation by adjusting the original multimedia quality to varying network conditions, this solution is based on dynamically balancing the multimedia content among multiple streams in order to achieve its goal. The proposed scheme and three other known approaches are compared in terms of estimated user-perceived quality. Simulation results show how this scheme outperforms the other solutions, including cases where the number of simultaneous receivers increases significantly. In addition, real environment tests show how the proposed scheme provides higher quality in terms of both objective and subjective metrics than competing approaches.

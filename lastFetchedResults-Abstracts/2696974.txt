In this study, the problem of optimal synthesis of pre-equalisation factors for a multi-carrier code division multiple-access wireless network is studied under different quality of service (QoS) restrictions and performance objectives. The downlink is particularly addressed, where the QoS is evaluated by the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) after signal detection by matched filtering. First, the minimum energy formulation under inequality QoS constraints is analysed, and it was concluded that the optimal performance is always achieved at the lower bounds. Next, the minimisation of the peak magnitude of the pre-equalisation factors was addressed by an optimal synthesis scheme through the infinity norm, where a linear programming strategy is proposed by using an upper bound. Finally, by combining the minimum energy and minimum peak strategies, the minimisation of an upper bound on the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) is suggested, which can be solved through quadratic programming by incorporating the QoS constraints. The new synthesis schemes take into account two important transmitter-based properties: peak magnitude and PAPR. These ideas were extensively validated in simulation, where the synthesis schemes were compared by Monte Carlo tests at different load and noise levels, and objective SINRs.

We present a suite of neurosurgery supporting tools developed around (i) the Virtual Workbench, a productive environment for the control of 3-D data, in which delicate work can be performed for hours on end without strain, and (ii) the Electronic Brain Atlas, integrating the major print brain atlases in day-to-day clinical use. We describe in detail the Brain Bench, a surgical planning system for stereotactic frame neurosurgery. Its objective is to prepare faster plans; have a better and more accurate choice of target points; improve the avoidance of sensitive structures; have fewer sub-optimal frame attachments and speedier, more effective planning and training. If validated by a clinical study now under way, this will improve medical efficacy and reduce costs.

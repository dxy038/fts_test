Objective: For immunotherapy of human papillomavirus (HPV) -16-associated cervical cancers the E7 protein is considered a prime candidate. However it is a poor inducer of cytotoxic T-cell response, when being used as a singular antigen in protein vaccination. Hence, in this study we focused on the utilization of a vaccine delivery system for prevention or treatment of cervical cancer.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we designed and evaluated a novel fusion protein comprising HPV16 E7 antigen fused to Shiga toxin B-subunit (STxB) as both an antigen vector and an adjuvant. Then we designed two preventive and therapeutic tumor models to investigate the prevention and inhibition of TC-1 cell growth in female C57BL/6 mice, respectively. In each model, mice were immunized with the recombinant protein of E7-STxB or E7 without any adjuvant.
Results: We demonstrated that prophylactic immunization of E7-STxB protected mice against TC-1 cells. Also in the therapeutic model, E7-STxB inhibited TC-1 tumor growth inlungs. The results were significant when compared with the immunization of E7 singularly.
Conclusion: We concluded that immunization with the E7-STxB protein without any adjuvant could generate anti-tumor effect in mice challenged with TC-1 cells.This research verifies the clinical applications and the future prospects of developing HPV16 E7 therapeutic vaccines fused to immunoadjuvants.

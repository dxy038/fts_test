This paper was extracted from an applied research project which was studied during the years between 2008 and 2010. The current strategic planning models and literature were explored to find a strategic planning model which is compatible with the structure and environment of Engineers Basij Organization. Analysis of different areas of the organization activities illustrated a wide variety of suitable substrates for benefiting from advantages and achievements of entrepreneurship. By changing the strategic planning of this organization, some of the problems and issues, which the organization has encountered, would be solved. As a result, Basij engineers and experts in a large number would easily participate in the process of development of the country. Therefore, the main objective of the research is to build a strategic planning model which can establish and support an entrepreneurial environment for the human resources of the organization. In order to achieve this objective and to answer the research questions, a contextual model was presented by reviewing the literature and by studying the Engineers Basij Organization. Then, the dimensions, components, and indicators of the model were examined and evaluated in two steps by analyzing the opinions of experts, specialists, and experienced individual in the field of strategic planning. In the result section, 9 main dimensions, 33 components, and 156 indicators with a slight different point out that the model is compatible with the characteristics of Engineers Basij Organization. In addition, the validity factor and stability factor of the model are 93% and 0.977 respectively and the model is suitable for adopting in the organization. Finally, some recommendations were mentioned in order to build the required infrastructures to execute the model in the organization.

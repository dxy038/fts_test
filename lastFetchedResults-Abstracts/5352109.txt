A simulator study was conducted to evaluate the conceptual design for a Wall Panel Information System (WPIS) intended to support individual and group situation awareness. The study used a rapid prototype of the WPIS presented on a large 100 inch wall panel display unit. Nine individuals with operations experience served as test participants. Two converging measures were used to evaluate the WPIS concept: (1) objective measures of how well the wall panel enabled individuals with operations experience to assess plant state when presented a series of static WPIS displays that represented different points in time in an evolving plant scenario; and (2) subjective evaluations of the test participants collected via a questionnaire and a final debrief session. The results of the test confirmed the basic assumptions and approach being taken in designing the WPIS and provided detailed input on ways to improve the design

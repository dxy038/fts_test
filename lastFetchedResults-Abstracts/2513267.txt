This paper investigates a supplier evaluation and selection model which considers features of leagile supply chain and allocates orders to the selected suppliers. In the proposed model, potential suppliers are evaluated by applying a multi-objective model with respect to the key features of leagile supply chain, including the ability to respond to demands, reducing delay time and costs (which are the winning factors for being the winner of market in this supply chain), as well as considering the capacities and limitations of organizations and suppliers. The proposed model allows buyer to select several suppliers. in addition, the model is multi-products and multi-periods. due to long time and inefficiency of exact methods for large-sized problems, in addition to lingo software, genetic algorithm is used to achieve the optimum solution.

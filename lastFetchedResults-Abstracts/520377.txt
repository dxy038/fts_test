Low quality flood irrigation are used on desert area of KaleShoor river of Sabzevar since 1992. The main objective of this research was to asses changes in soil salinity affected by low quality flood irrigation. To meet this, 51 soil samples were taken and tested in the laboratory for salinity and indicators require, soil samples taken from depth of 0-30cm, 30-60cm and 60-90cm at the beginning, middle and end of the cultivated rows of the land. Three soil samples were also prepared from the control area. The results showed that EC and PH values reduced in all samples, compared with control points. In addition, organic materials and sand particles which carried by flood water, improved the soil structure and texture of the study area. This study also showed that flood irrigation has been able to reduce gypsum from range of root zone and transported to lower layers.

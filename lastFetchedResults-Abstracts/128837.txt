Background : providing suitable contraceptives for Breast feeding mothers is an important concern of family planning programs, because the chosen method must have no adverse effects on milk components and volume, moreover it must be safe for the mother .
Objective : To survey the effects of progestogen-onlY contraceptives on breast milk components and infant growth.
Methods : This cohort study was implemented on 140 nursing mothers of whom 51 used progestogen- only methods and 89 used non- hormonal contraceptives (Varamin 1998-1999). Breast milk components at the 26th week and infant growth during the first six months of life were compared between those groups .
Findings: There were no statistically significant differences, in terms of protein, sodium, calcium, phosphorus and potassium concentration of milk and infant growth, but triglyceride in hormonal group and magnesium in non- hormonal group were higher than the other group (P<0.05).
Conclusion : It seems that progestogen - only methods do not have any negative effect on breast milk composition and infant growth.

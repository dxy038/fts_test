In this research, we propose an architectural solution to implement the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) via snort in campus network environment. Intrusion Detection System(IDS) via snort application has become a discussion issue for this time being. The objective of this implementation is to measure and detect the malware on snort application over local area network (LAN). Virtual private network (VPN)technology has become a discussion issue for this time being. Today, the deployment of this IDS technology on an organization truly can give a great privacy and security benefit over campus environment. This study focuses on installation,configuring and implementation of snort in University of Kuala Lumpur network environment.In addition, we emphasis on access to a MySQL database, WINCAP and Perl scripts (PHP). Based on the finding result, the IDS over snort application is able to analyze and detect malware activity in client server environment over LAN.

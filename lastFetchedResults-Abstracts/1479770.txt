Literary Structuralism seeks the most scientific basis for analyzing literary texts. Structuralism is the method of analyzing the text and understanding its system.
Greimas is one of the narratologists who proposes Action Theory for making the analysis and understanding of the narration easier.
He simplifies Propp’s model and also shows that all elements of the tale are analyzable and effective.
The actors may be things, concepts or personas. Greimas theory is flexible and has a high potential for analyzing the tale.
This paper tries to offer clear and objective instances of Sheikhe Sanan story based on Greimas’ Action Theory.
The story of Sheikhe Sanan is the longest and most famous story in Manteghol Tayr and it is always considered by researchers of Manteghol Tayr. 
This story has ups and downs which make possible a Greimasian analysis. Such analysis not only shows the integrity and coherence of the story but also shows the capacities of this model for analyzing the structure of Persian old tales.

One particular study received increasing emphasis in recent years is water flooding type-curves, which plays an essential role in evaluating oil reserves and predicting future production. The main objective of this paper is to propose a combined method that is based on water flooding type-curves and Weibull prediction model to analyze the reservoir production performance such as predicting reservoir performance in future and estimating reserve's water cut. The method is developed based on four types of water flooding type-curves and Weibull prediction model. The study shows that the method is able to successfully produce solutions for oil production and water cut. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the combined method using the actual data from oil fields. The outcome of the study shows that the production performance and water cut can be accurately estimated from the calculation of the combined method, which takes into account water flooding type-curves and Weibull prediction model. The calculated results have a good agreement with the data came from the oil fields.

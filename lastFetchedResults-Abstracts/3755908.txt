In this paper a method is developed for circuit minimization using the universal logic modules (ULMÂ´s) of Yau and Tang. This objective is obtained by using an extension of prime implicants termed ULM implicants. Each ULM implicant implies one possible saving of a module in the tree structure implementing a function. The method is developed for the ULM(l) and an extension to the higher order ULM(p) is discussed.

A new topology for bidirectional sinusoidal AC-AC power conversion is proposed in this paper. The power converter topology is derived from conventional three phase-three phase matrix converters. The approach uses polyphase balanced three phase AC voltage stiff sources interfaced to three phase current stiff loads using a switching matrix. Availability of isolated balanced three phase AC sources allows the use of reduced number of switches with two quadrant switches, thereby allowing a simple realization of the converter. A set of phase shifting transformers is used to generate polyphase voltages sets to drive the converter. An analysis of the semiconductor and transformer VA rating is presented. A switch modulation technique is developed using vector representation of the converter input-output properties. Experimental results from a laboratory prototype converter are presented to verify the operation of the converter.

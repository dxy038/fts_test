Introduction & Objective: C-reactive protein plays a special role in systemic inflammation of the body. Its predictive value in cardiac events is highlighted. In this study, the predictive value of CRP was studied in patients with unstable angina and its relation with MI, death, and intervention was assessed on admission and one month later. 
Materials & Methods: In a cohort study, 180 patients with unstable angina admitted in Hamadan Ekbatan Hospital were evaluated. The patients were divided into a group with high level of hs-CRP and a group with low level of hs-CRP as an exposure and control groups respective and were evaluated on admission and one month later according to MI, death and needs for intervention. The data was extracted with check list and analyzed with a chi square and t-test by SPSS software.
Results: We couldnâ€™t find any significant difference according to demographic data in both groups. There was no significant difference in MI, death, and intervention needs between two groups on admission (P > 0.05), but in one month follow up we found higher incidence of complications in the group with high level of hs-CRP (P=0.045). The incidence of complication was 19 and 10 patients in the exposure and control group respectively on admission and 29 and 19 patients in the exposure and control group respectively one month later.
Conclusion: We can conclude that the high level of hs-CRP can be predictive factor for cardiac complication one month after the admission.

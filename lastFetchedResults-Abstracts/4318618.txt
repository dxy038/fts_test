Power conversion modules in consumer products are optimised for cost and not for efficiency. On the other side, efficiency has a value when using renewable energies such as photovoltaic. A bidirectional active-clamped flyback converter has been investigated to identify its maximum possible conversion efficiency for the principal use as maximum power point converter. A power train efficiency has been measured from a 200 W prototype that is above 91 % between 10 % and 100 % of the rated power and reaches a peak value of 96 %.

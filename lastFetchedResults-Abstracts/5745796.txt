The concept Cloud computing has not only reshaped the field of distributed systems but also fundamentally changed how business potential extends today. In recent advancements, Cloud computing applications are provided as services to end-users. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, configuration, and deployment requirements How to use Cloud computing resources efficiently and gain the maximum profits with efficient utilization of resources is one of the Cloud computing service providers´ ultimate goals. Repetitive evaluation of the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in dynamic system are difficult to achieve and rather a time consuming and costly approach. To overcome this challenge, Cloud analyst simulator based on Cloud Sim has been proposed which enables the modeling and simulation in cloud´s ambience. The objective of this paper is to prove that the choice of VM Scheduling Policy in Cloud computing model significantly improves the application performance under resource and service demand variations. We will discuss different Virtual Machine (VM) Scheduling Policies implemented and their performance analysis in Virtual environment of cloud computing in order to achieve better Quality of Service (QoS).

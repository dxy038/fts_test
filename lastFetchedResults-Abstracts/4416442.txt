Wind wave-induced sediment transport is an important process affecting coastal seabed changes and coastline evolution. During this research a numerical system was developed to predict general morphodynamical conditions in the coastal zone of polish marine areas. Wind-wave fields were determined on the basis of a spectral models (WAM and SWAN models). Simulations were performed for 80 distinct wind cases. Subsequently for each individual case the regional longshore load of sediments was calculated using Engelund-Hansen and Meyer-Peter and Mu&#776;ller formule. As the result the values of sediment transport for main wind directions and velocities are presented. The objective of this paper is to present complex approach to the modeling of sediment transport in a coastal zone.

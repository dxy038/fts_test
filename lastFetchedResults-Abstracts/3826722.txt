The study is the first time a mathematical algorithm known as SPEA (strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm) has been used for the optimal ´multi-objective´ designing of hybrid electric energy generation systems. The algorithm provides an optimum range of solutions from which the designer can choose the most appropriate according to the relevant budgetary conditions, acceptable levels of pollutant emissions, and the amount of unprovided energy involved.

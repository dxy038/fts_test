In wireless multi-hop packet radio networks (MPRNs) that employ geographic transmissions, sleep schedules or node activation techniques may be used to power off some nodes to conserve energy. We consider the problem of selecting which nodes should power on to listen to a scheduled transmission when the channel suffers from random fading. We choose the objective of maximizing the expected value of the distance covered in a single transmission between a transmitter and the farthest receiver that successfully receives the packet, under a constraint on the expected number of receivers that turn on. Since there is a tradeoff between the distance of a node from the transmitter and the probability that the node receives the message correctly, we propose to use node-activation based on link-distance (NA-BOLD). We investigate optimal and sub-optimal NA-BOLD schemes and compare their performance with that of schemes that use a constant sleep schedule for every node within some radius of the transmitter. Our results show that the proposed NA-BOLD schemes achieve significantly larger transmission distances than conventional schemes.

This paper presents a Game Theoretic framework for the analysis of distributed spectrum sharing in a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). We consider competitive interactions among selfish secondary users (SUs) under realistic physical interference constraints. Subject to a per-user average power budget, SUs choose their transmission powers with the objective of satisfying minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the intended receivers. We investigate self-enforcing spectrum sharing strategies of the SUs which correspond to Nash Equilibria (NE) points in a single shot scenario. We carry out an equilibrium analysis by considering the mixed strategy space and provide closed form expressions of the equilibria points. Numerical examples are further presented for illustration.

This paper is a continuation of a basic three-dimensional reverberation chamber model we built using FDTD as described previously (1999). In this paper, the uniformity is studied in detail when the location of the paddle and the relative size of the paddle are varied. The objective of the study is to find the effects of the paddle geometry and location on the uniformity of a reverberation chamber. Simulation results show that the paddle located on the ceiling can achieve a better uniformity than when located at the side of the chamber. With a big paddle ratio (PR), there is an increase in the effectiveness of the paddle. The paddle size should be at least half of the chamber dimension to limit the spatial deviation of average field around 3dB in terms of amplitude and 3% in terms of angle

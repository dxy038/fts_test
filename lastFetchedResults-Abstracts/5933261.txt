A assembled method based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm combined with Bayesian networks (BN) is proposed to solve complex multi-objective nutritional diet decision making problem. To realize nutritional diet decision optimization for patients, BN model for dealing with associative relationship between diseases and diets is set up to compute and update the edibility of every food in database. QPSO algorithm is selected as the core optimization algorithm to avoid being trapped in a local optimum. Actual experimental results show that such combined method is a feasible and effective approach for actual nutritional diet decision making problem.

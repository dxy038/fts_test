Learning control is a concept for controlling dynamic system in an iterative manner. It arises from the recognition that industrial robotic manipulators are usually used to perform repetitive tasks. In this paper, a multiobjective learning controller is proposed for robotic manipulator. In contrast to most of the learning controller designs in the literature, whereby a single objective in terms of tracking a desired trajectory is specified, our approach allows the performance of the learning system to be specified by multiple objectives.

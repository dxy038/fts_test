Probability based searching of solutions with genetic algorithms is analogous to the solution searching of the group decision making processes in group decision support systems. So two dynamics modes: information exchange patterns and emergence of social hierarchy which have the key impact on the quality of solutions to the questions processed by the group decision making are analyzed using genetic algorithms in the context of the multi-objective model in this paper. Then through analyzing the relationship between activities of group problem-solving and problem solving mechanisms of multi-objective genetic algorithms, we conclude that the multi-objective genetic algorithms are able to model the dynamics in group decision support systems well and to assist the group decision making by expressing the realistic processes

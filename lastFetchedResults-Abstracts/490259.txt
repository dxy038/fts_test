Results: Rota, adeno and astrovirus antigens were detected in 61.1 %, 2.9% and 2.4% of patients. Infants between 6 and 12 months of age were most frequently affected with rotavirus (29.8%), (p<0.05). Rotavirus infection was significantly less frequent in summer and spring than winter and autumn (p<0.05). Fever and vomiting were present in 55.1% and 51.7% of children, respectively. There was not significant correlation between rotavirus infection and gender of patients.

In Battlefield Information Services (BISs) matching, the concept similarity computation plays an important role. Because the influence of semantic asymmetry has not been considered in current concept similarity computation, the computation result is not accurate. To enhance the accuracy of the concept similarity computation, the similarity computation was improved by adding the direction factor and regulatory factor on the basis of the current research. Finally, the feasibility of the improved concept similarity computation can reflect semantic relationship between concepts more truly and the computation result is more in line with the objective really.

The increase of output power of an electromagnetic device by the raise of flux density is limited by the nonlinear behaviour of the iron parts of the electromagnetic circuit. An improved power output can be achieved by optimizing the nonlinear magnetic circuit. A combination of evolution strategy and simulated annealing leads to a robust numerical optimization method. Evaluation of the objective function is done by a nonlinear flux tube model called magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC). Results from field calculations and optimizations will be presented for an example of automated optimal design of an electromagnetic device

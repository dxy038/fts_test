This paper proposes a multi-objective model for the economic-statistical design of
the variable sample size and sampling interval multivariate exponentially weighted
moving average control chart by using double warning lines. The Markov chain
approach is used to obtain the statistical properties. We extend the Lorenzen and
Vance cost function considering multiple assignable causes and multivariate Taguchi
loss approach to obtain the expected cost per time unit. The meta-heuristic nondominated
sorting genetic algorithm is used to search for the Pareto optimal
solutions. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the solution procedure.
Finally, sensitivity analyses for some parameters are given.

This paper presents an approach to measure the rail gauge and tilt angle of the railway track using non contact measurement techniques. The objective of this study is to improve the present manual measurement techniques and replace it with advanced digital techniques. In order to achieve non contact measurement of gauge low frequency ultrasonic distance measurement method is presented. In this study non contact measurement methods are presented because use of contact type sensors may increase the possibility of errors and frequent calibration is required. Since earlier times the conventional gauge level measurement tool is being used in Indian Railways, and the amount of work required to measure and rectify the rail tracks are very time consuming and tremendous man power is required. This project aims to improve the conventional measurement techniques in to digital methods which uses ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers to obtain the rail track parameters.

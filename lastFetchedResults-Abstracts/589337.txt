Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of symptoms of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in gifted students of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province. 
Method: The present study is a descriptive (epidemiology) research. 1800 students (800 girls & 1000 boys) were selected using multistage cluster sampling from among 34,529 students of state and private middle schools in the academic year 2010â€“2011. Finally, the participants we selected were 220 students (77 girls & 143 boys) with an IQ of 127 or more. The data were collected by diagnostic questionnaire of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, clinical interview with students and their mothers, and Raven Progressive Matrix. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistical method and Chi square test. 
Results: Generally, 8/2 percent of gifted students (%6/8 of whom were girls and %9 were boys) had ADHD symptoms. Thus, considering the standard error of estimate, the overall prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in gifted students was seen to be in the range of 4/7 to 11/7 percent. 
Conclusion: ADHD symptoms can affect the intelligence of students. Therefore, belated diagnosis of ADHD in gifted students might cause problems in their treatment and also their academic and social progress. 
Recommendations: The results of the present study can be applied in educational settings and show the necessity of providing psychological and counseling services for management and treatment of this disorder. Offering such services in schools for gifted students could prevent the negative consequences of this disorder in their educational and social life.

Context and objective: America and Russia have the greatest responsibility
to deal with “nuclear terrorism”, because the enormous amounts of material
and nuclear weapons in the world belong to them. This research deals with the
global innovation of America and Russia to prevent nuclear terrorism.
Methodology: This descriptive- analytic research is library- based.
Findings: America and Russia have the most fundamental capabilities
in terms of counter- terrorism response. There is not much difference for
segregating their policies against nuclear terrorism. Because in cases where
differences exist in assessing some aspects of nuclear development, the two
countries have pledged to limit their disputes to speed up and inject new
energy into their bilateral efforts presidents of America and Russia introduced
a new global innovation to combat nuclear terrorism on 15 July 2006. Hence,
agreed countries organized a meeting on 12 and 13 February 2007, in Turkey,
to consider a contribution to the development of methods and applications
and to discuss the issues extensively as a basis. At the end of the meeting a
statement was issued to inform the negotiations and work programs over the
coming years.
Results: Increasing willing ness of terrorist groups to use nuclear weapons
entails intensified control measures to prevent smuggling of nuclear materials
and technologies. The obligation of member states of the Non-proliferation
treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, based on the timeline, is an appropriate
strategy for reducing nuclear terrorism.

In this study two- and three-dimensional finite element welding simulations have been carried out. The welded component studied is a T-type fillet weld which is frequently used in the heavy vehicle machine industry with plate thicknesses of eight and 20 mm, respectively. The softwareâ€™s used for the welding simulations is MSC.Marc and ANSYS. The objective is to study the formation of the residual stresses due to 3D effect of the welding process. Moreover, welding simulations using solid models and contact models in the un-fused weld roots were carried out in order to investigate the possible effect with respect to the residual stresses. Residual stress measurements were carried out using X-ray diffraction technique on the manufactured T-welded structure. The 2D residual stress predictions shows good agreement with measurements, hence the 2D welding simulation procedure is suitable for residual stress predictions for incorporation in further fatigue crack growth analysis from weld defects emanating from the weld toe and the un-fused root.

In the long-term contract transaction of northeast regional power market (NRPM), the competing objective is not generating unit outputs at some time interval, but the amount of electrical energy during some period. In this paper, the basic principles of security checking are studied based on the transferred power in the interface of tie-lines, through which the security-constrained interfaces will be analyzed and simplified, and the function of security checking for the long-term contract transaction will be improved greatly. The feasibility and effectiveness have been proved by the practical application in NRPM.

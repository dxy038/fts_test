A simple, fundamental experimental study was conducted to further the understanding of acoustic wave propagation in fluid-filled pipes. Three experiments were conducted: the first with zero flow and a closed outlet end; the second with turbulent flow and an open outlet end; and the third with zero flow and an open outlet end. The intent was to obtain data at higher frequencies than those previously reported and which can be used to validate and verify numerical models. A further objective was to determine the effect of turbulent flow on the acoustic response of the system. Some new insights are obtained and presented.

This paper presents on-going research concerning the design of monitoring features for human-computer interfaces (HCI) for long distance training courses. The objective is to design visualization tools that facilitate the task of the on-line course teacher. The teacher needs to see the learning path and learners contributions in the Learning Management System (LMS). The paper successively presents the research issues related to computer design of such interfaces, a typology of different dimensions to be taken into account (scenario, participants, calendar) and a tool designed for on-line monitoring of individual paths inside a training course (CROISIE&#768;RES). Perspectives concern a methodological framework for HCI design and evaluation in the context of supervisory control in distance course.

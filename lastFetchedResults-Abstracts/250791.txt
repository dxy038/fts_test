A continuum-based shape and configuration design sensitivity analysis (DSA) method for a finite
deformation elastoplastic shell structure has been developed. Shell elastoplasticity is treated using the
projection method that performs the return mapping on the subspace defined by the zero-normal stress
condition. An incrementally objective integration scheme is used in the context of finite deformation
shell analysis, wherein the stress objectivity is preserved for finite rotation increments. The material
derivative concept is used to develop a continuum-based shape and configuration DSA method.
Significant computational efficiency is obtained by solving the design sensitivity equation without
iteration at each converged load step using the same consistent tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical
implementation of the proposed shape and configuration DSA is carried out using the meshfree
method. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated using numerical examples.

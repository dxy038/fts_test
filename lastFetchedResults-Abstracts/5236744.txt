A complete design is presented for an error detection or correction (EDOC) device based on 32-b data lines to be incorporated as a bidirectional buffer between a processor and the rest of the system. The device is internally fault-tolerant itself. The design includes scan-path capability so that the internal state of the chip can be determined during system testing and debugging. This design can correct single-nibble (4-b) errors or detect double-nibble (8-b) errors, but not both simultaneously. It is implemented in the desktop programmable gate array technology

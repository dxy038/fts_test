According to water resources limitation and the competition between several sectors in consumption and agricultural sections, management of irrigation networks seems necessary. Optimal water distribution is one of the basic subjects to increase water consumption efficiency in irrigation canals. In this research, ACS algorithm has been used for optimization of water distribution. Accordingly, water distribution schedule was prepared in three different options in MC Canal of Alborz irrigation network. In the first option, objective function is considered in the form of the decrease of required discharge network. In the second one, it is minimization of the required discharge network, volume difference of required and delivery water and the number of upstream gate regulations. The number of upstream gate regulation in the second option was replaced by over time decrement in the third option. In all three options, the maximum discharge network achieved was lower than existing MC canal capacity. Canal capacity in the first, second and third options are 17.44, 18.01 and 17.55 m3/s, respectively. Differences between computation results and existing canal capacities in first, second and third options are 5.79, 5.21 and 5.7 m3/s, respectively.

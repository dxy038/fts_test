The objective of the present work is to understand the effects of AC and DC energisation on the flow characteristics of paraffinic based transformer oil under some of the simulated practical conditions. The Couette device which simulates the duct flow condition in the transformer was employed. The variation of the charging current, voltage buildup and accumulated charge under energisation was evaluated. The results of the investigation reveal that the above parameters increase with flow velocity and energisation. However, it is observed that with DC energisation the polarity of the parameters evaluated depended on the polarity of the applied voltage

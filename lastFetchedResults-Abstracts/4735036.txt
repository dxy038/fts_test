In recent years, a variety of chaos-based image encryption algorithms have been presented with a permutation-diffusion structure. A novel chaos-based color image encryption scheme using coupled map lattices (CML) is proposed in this paper. The image bidirectional diffusion method is employed with variable CML parameters and iteration numbers, in which ordinary confusion operation is omitted and replaced by decompose-and-recompose bit-level image process. Experiments and security analysis has been performed to justify the high security performance of our proposed image encryption scheme.

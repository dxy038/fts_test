A 8000 element, 3 MHz 2-D transducer array with integrated transmitter and receiver electronics was proposed as the Audio-Visual Converter (AVC) in a acoustic lens focused, diver-held sonar system. The array consists of 8000, 1.0 mm diameter elements spaced 1.75 mm apart in a square grid. The objective of the AVC acoustic subsystem development program was to demonstrate experimentally that a 10&#215;10 element sub-section, or &#8220;tile&#8221;, of the AVC could be successfully manufactured and meet the design parameters contained in the initial study phase of the development program. The primary goals of this development was to demonstrate that composite tiles could be manufactured reliably and with 100% yield, that the transducer structure would be high bandwidth, high efficiency, uniform, and produce near ideal beam patterns, that suitable electrical interconnect could be provided to associated integrated companion circuits, and that the structure could be produced at a reasonable cost

The widespread use of artificial insemination (AI) in sheep is currently prevented due to the lack of a cost effective insemination technique utilising frozen-thawed semen. The objective of the present study was to determine if the deposition of frozen-thawed semen in the vaginal fornix would result in a pregnancy rate comparable to that achieved following cervical insemination. Multiparous ewes of various breeds were synchronised and inseminated into either the vaginal fornix (n = 78) or the cervix (n = 79), at 57 h post sponge removal, with frozen-thawed semen. Information on mucus secretion and the depth to which it was possible to penetrate the cervix at insemination (cervically inseminated ewes only) was recorded at the time of AI. Pregnancy rate was subsequently determined either by return to service (oestrus) or after slaughter 30 days post insemination. Insemination site did not significantly influence pregnancy rate using frozen-thawed semen (36.2% compared to 27.6% for cervical and vaginal fornix insemination, respectively; P = 0.26). Whilst depth of cervical penetration was positively associated with pregnancy rate (P &lt; 0.05), this association needs to be interpreted with caution as none of the ewes where the cervix could not be penetrated (score = 0) was pregnant. In conclusion, pregnancy rate following insemination of frozen-thawed semen into the vaginal fornix was within 10% points of that obtained following cervical AI of frozen-thawed semen. As insemination into the vaginal fornix is technically easier than cervical insemination, it may be more practical for use in large scale applications.

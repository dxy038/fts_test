The main objective of this paper is to present the application of the minimal controller synthesis algorithm on a satellite attitude control system. This algorithm is an extension to the model reference adaptive control algorithm. It has a simple structure with relatively few computational requirements per time step. The description of attitude kinematics of the rotational motion of rigid body satellite is considered based on two perpendicular rotations. The infrared astronomical satellite attitude control system was simulated using the minimal controller synthesis algorithm. The simulation results showed that the minimal controller synthesis controller is robust in the presence of unknown external disturbances and unmodelled dynamics in the plant.

In this paper, a novel discrete optimization approach is developed to optimally solve the optimization problem of power system shunt filter design based on discrete multi objective particle swarm optimization MOPSO technique to ensure harmonic current reduction and noise mitigation on electrical utility grid. In this novel optimization approach, multi objective particle swarm optimization MOPSO is implemented to tackle a number of conflicting goals that define the optimality problem. This paper deals with three conflicting objective functions. These conflicting functions are: 1. Minimum harmonic current penetration into the electric grid system, 2. Maximum harmonic current absorption by the harmonic power filter, 3. Minimum harmonic voltage distortion at the point of common coupling, Throughout the optimization process, all power filter parameters are being treated as either continuous or discrete variables. The shunt power filter design and optimization is performed over a specified set of discrete dominant offending harmonics.

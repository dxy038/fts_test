Laser triangulation systems (LTS) are one of the most popular non-contact inspection techniques. These systems are widely used in reverse engineering tasks as they allow for a fast acquisition of thousands of points that represent the geometry of the part in a virtual 3D model. The accuracy and repeatability of these systems are lower than the traditional contact inspection techniques, as they depend on the surface properties, the illumination conditions and the LTS configuration. Present work deals with the influence of surface material on the quality of the virtual model. The objective is to evaluate the behaviour of different materials and their suitability for being digitized.

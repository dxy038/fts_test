A test program was designed to study the joint effects of fog salinity and pre-deposit contamination on polymer insulators in a fog chamber. The objective of the test program was to analyze and record the visual appearance of the discharge activities along the insulators and to correlate the results with the leakage currents observed in the course of the tests. The test setup that allows the joint view of the leakage current waveshapes and visual appearance of the discharges is also discussed

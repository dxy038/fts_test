We present a novel scheme for all-optical nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) wavelength conversion with enhanced 2R regenerative characteristics. It employs a hybridly integrated semiconductor optical amplifier Mach-Zehnder interferometer using bidirectional data injection and an additional external continuous-wave signal for differentially biasing the interferometer arms, optimizing gain and phase conditions during the switching functionality. Experimental verification of its superior 2R regenerative capabilities are demonstrated for 10-Gb/s NRZ data signals.

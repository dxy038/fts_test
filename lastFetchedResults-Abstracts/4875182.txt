Aiming to resolve insufficiency of existing Energy-Saving (ES) methods in heterogeneous network, a novel self-organizing ES mechanism to improve energy efficiency suitable for heterogeneous networks is proposed. In the mechanism, we come up with the self-organizing procedures, the traffic model, and an optimizing objective model. The mechanism is then simulated under an urban LTE scenario with 7 macro BSs and 5 micro BSs. Results show that more than 18% of regional energy consumption can be saved. Still, when network is under ES status, network performance such as signal strength and interference can keep on acceptable levels.

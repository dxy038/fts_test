A dual infrared system to assist a driver in bad visibility conditions is studied. The problem of selecting the best multiresolution-based image fusion technique is addressed with reference to automotive scenarios. A new method for objective evaluation of multisensor image fusion strategies is presented for the optimal design of the fusion process. Multiresolution-based fusion methodologies are compared, and experimental results obtained from a prototype dual infrared camera system are shown and analyzed. Numerical results, in terms of the quality of the fused images and of the computational load, are presented and discussed. The effectiveness of the dual infrared system in urban and extraurban automotive scenarios is illustrated with a number of examples.

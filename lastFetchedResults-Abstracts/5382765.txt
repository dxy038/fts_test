Biomaterial scaffolds in tissue engineering are used to provide structural templates for cell seeding and extracellular matrix formation. Currently, rapid prototyping (RP) with fluid dispensing technique has been widely used in the process to fabricate the scaffolds. In such a process, the flow rate of dispensed bio-materials and the porosity of fabricated scaffolds are critical to the tissue engineering applications, and can be affected by various factors, such as the operating conditions in the process, the flow properties of the bio-material, and the structural parameters of the dispensing system. Taking these influences into account, this paper presents the model development for scaffold fabrication process, so as that the flow rate of dispensed bio-materials and the porosity of fabricated scaffolds can be represented. Based on the developed models, simulations are carried out, with the objective to identify the influences on the fabrication process of such parameters as the driving pressure used to dispense fluid, the flow behaviour of bio-materials, and the structural parameters of the dispensing system. Finally, the conclusions from the present study are presented, along with the future work suggested

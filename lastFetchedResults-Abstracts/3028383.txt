It is estimated that the Internet currently connects millions of hosts and users worldwide, and the number will continue to increase exponentially for years to come [1]. Such a huge popularity of the Internet has enabled the widespread use of IP networks everywhere. As real-time, multimedia applications as well as new emerging applications demanding stringent quality of service (QoS) becomes common in the Internet, a single best-effort service class is no longer adequate in delivering predictable and bounded QoS performance. This drives an urgent need to provide some kind of QoS in the IP network. In addition, as IP networks are rapidly attracting pervasive commercial uses from competitive business and cooperates who are willing to pay more substantially higher price to get the best possible service level, the framework for QoS guarantee and differentiation become increasingly more important than ever. We consider offline versions of path provisioning and path protection problems for MPLS networks. The objective is to split the traffic of a broken working path to multi back up protection paths. We consider label switch path (LSP)- based protection where, in case of a single LSP failure, all the traffic utilizing the failed link can be rerouted to a pre computed set of paths.

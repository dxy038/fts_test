The main objective of Global positioning system (GPS) is to determine our position on earth in three dimensions: east-west, north- south, and vertical in terms of longitude, latitude and altitude. The GPS navigation system presented in this paper provides very useful information about present geographical information which includes latitude, longitude, altitude, current velocity and Greenwich meridian time reference. It is capable of indicating active and inactive PRN number (pseudo random code) of satellites used for GPS tracking in terms of visual plane positioning indicator system. A study of comparison of present and previous geographical location is also available in this system. The system helps in determining signal to noise ratio in decibels of various PRN satellites which is used for determining signal strength of GPS signals for studying Ionospheric scintillation effects on GPS signals. It also gives visual representation of various National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) GPS strings which gives navigational, satellite orbital and clock information.

One of the most important consequences of the rapid growth of urbanization and physical development of the cities in the recent decades is the disintegration of distribution system of centers of  urban service which facilitates the social inequality of citizens for using such services. The main objective of this study is the review and analysis of population dispersion and services distribution in Ahvaz metropolitan. The recent study is of an applied one and from the method point of view is a combination of analytical- descriptive methods and library and documentary method has been used for gatherign data. The seventh Ahvaz districts have been selected as the geographical units in measuring the space justic and 14 determinant indices of public services for attainment of such objective. Then by using the views of professionals, the importance of the indicators have been determined in FUZZY environment (AHP FUZZY).for analysis and grading the urban districts from the view point of enjoing public services, some models including VIKOR, ELECTRE and FUZZY TOPSIS  have been used and for reaching to a unified result in data analysis of different models, the blended average of ranks has been used. Data analysis  of this study showed that districts No. 3 and 4 have the first rank,  districts No.1 and 2 the secend rank and districts  No. 6, 7 and 8 are at the last place among the other regions in terms of indicators of municipal services.Then for measuring the relation between population and enjoyment of urban services, Pearson correlation test has been used. The obained correlation coefficient (0.471) indicates this fact that there is a weak relation between the population dispersion and services distribution. while, the obtained correlation coefficient from Pearson test          (0.810) shows that distribution of services has a direct and strong relation with the area.

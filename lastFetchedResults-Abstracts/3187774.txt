A method for objective quality assessment of low bit rate audio is proposed in this paper. It can evaluate the quality of low bit rate audio based on PEAQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality) algorithm and get a good corresponding with the subjective assessments results. At first, we extract features directly from the reference audio and compressed audio as the inputs of our model. Then, using a linear algorithm, those extracted features and the corresponding subjective assessments are linked in our method in order to obtain the reliable objective assessment. The experimental results show that our metric can achieve a good performance for the low bit rate audio.

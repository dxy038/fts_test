Periprosthetic adaptive bone remodelling after total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been frequently simulated in computer models, combining bone remodelling theory with finite element analysis. Unfortunately, there still subsist a lack of clinical data, which are necessary for validation of these simulation results. Therefore, the objective of the current project is to collect prospective volumetric bone density data with a clinical computerized tomography study in seven patients after THA. A retrospective study 12 years after implantation in 11 patients was added. A data set of about 100 000 bone voxels for each femur was collected. In all prospective cases, the predominant change is seen during the first year. The average density reduction in the horizontal slices was between 50 and 150 Hounsfield units (HU) (approx. 10%; p<0.001) after 2 years. Loss of density is particularly strong distal of the minor trochanter and decreases from proximal to distal.
For the 12 years retrospective study, the contralateral femur provided the control. Similar trends comparable to the prospective 2-year follow-up CT density values were seen in most cases with density reductions of up to 400 HU (30%). However, in one of these cases there was no difference between the operated and the control density.
As far as we are aware, this is the first collection of fully prospective 3D validation data in vivo for periprosthetic adaptive bone remodelling theories. The data are also unique as they are suitable for direct patient-specific 3D finite element meshing and individual weight-related loading.

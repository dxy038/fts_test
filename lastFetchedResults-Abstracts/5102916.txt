Analysis of Location-aware data plays an important role in pervasive and mobile computing. In cellular systems (e.g., GSM) the serving cell is easily available as an indication of the user location, without any additional hardware or network services. With this location data and other context variables groups of mobile users who are advertised to the found together can be traced. The objective of this paper is to review the works carried out by different group of researchers using varied techniques in Discovering User context, Mobility Prediction of Mobile users, Discovering social groups, Fraud detection in mobile communications networks etc.

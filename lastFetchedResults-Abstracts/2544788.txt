Floodwater spreading (FWS) has an important role in floodwater control, groundwater recharge, restoration and enhancement of vegetation and desertification control. Since the flood causes the transporting of soil particles including organic materials, the floodwater spreading project can be a suitable place to sequestration of organic carbon in sediment yielded by flood. The knowledge of soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) changes affected by different process can be important in realizing of these process roles in world carbon cycle and consequently in greenhouse gases effects mitigation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate SOCS in floodwater spreading project in the Zahab Plain. In view of this, 9 FWS strips based on random block design divided into three higher, middle and lower strips as well as each strip divided into three initial middle and final sections and sling carried out in 0-20 cm depth. Soil organic carbon concentration and bulk density in 42 sles from FWS project and control areas were measured and SOCS were calculated. The results showed that SOCS in the three divided strips of floodwater spreading and control area as well as three sections of each strip with control area was significantly different. But the SOCS within divided strips and sections were not significantly different. The mean of SOCS in 0-20 cm depth in the three sections and control area were 1.29, 1.02, 1.53 and 4.61 Kg m- sup2 , respectively (P < 0.05) and  the mean SOCS in three sections of strips initial middle and final sections was 1.04, 1.16 and 1.64 Kg m- sup2  respectively (P > 0.05). Overall, transported sediment with low organic carbon concentration from upstream catchment or exporting of organic carbon as dissolved organic carbon have been caused to low increasing of SOCS in Zahab Plain floodwater spreading.

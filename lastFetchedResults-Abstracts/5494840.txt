The objective of this minitrack is to develop the architecture of knowledge management systems to support organizations facing changing environments. Individuals learn and share what they have learned with those "nearby" them, who in turn share knowledge with others. This enables organizations to react quickly to changing environments, a necessity for survival. Researchers and practitioners interested in submitting papers to this track are encouraged to explore knowledge management architecture-- particularly as related to organizational learning from a design science perspective. We welcome a wide range of approaches that focus on architectural design for learning organizations.

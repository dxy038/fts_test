Smart growth plays a significant role in solving a series of problems in rapidly urban development in China. Optimal allocation in land resource is the key for the realization of smart growth. In view of this, taking Yixing in Jiangsu Province, China for an example, this paper attempted to make a study on urban smart growth based on optimal allocation in land resource. The main objective of this study was to enrich, improve and even deepen certain theory of smart growth and its quantitative analysis method in practice from the perspective of land resource allocation. Based on urban smart growth theory of optimal allocation in land resource, the measurement system for smart growth degree in land use was firstly set up. Then, in order to optimize urban land use structure, grey multi-objective dynamic planning model was employed to get several optioned optimization schemes. Finally, the optimal scheme for land use structure was selected by using the combination method of grey correlation analysis and principal components projection.

Objective
Preeclampsia is associated with excessive inflammatory response compared with normal pregnancy. Calprotectin is an inflammation marker not previously explored in preeclampsia.
Study design
Calprotectin in maternal and fetal plasma and amniotic fluid was investigated at cesarean delivery in normal pregnancies and preeclampsia. C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type1 (PAI-1) were also analyzed.
Results
Maternal median calprotectin, CRP, and PAI-1 concentrations were elevated in preeclampsia (1081 μg/L, 4.8 mg/L, and 51.0 U/mL) compared with control levels (552 μg/L, 3.8 mg/L, and 36.5 U/mL). In the umbilical vein, there were no differences between preeclampsia and controls regarding calprotectin and CRP levels. Maternal calprotectin concentrations correlate with CRP and PAI-1 values for the total study group, but a statistical significant correlation was not found in the preeclamptic group.
Conclusion
Calprotectin is elevated in the maternal circulation in preeclamptic pregnancies. We found no evidence of inflammatory response in the fetal circulation in preeclampsia.

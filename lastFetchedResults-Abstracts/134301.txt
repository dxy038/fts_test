OBJECTIVE: The cervical vertebrae are the most mobile segments of the vertebral spine. Since there are few supportive structures in our bodies, this part is more susceptible to traumatic injury. One of the most common injuries is facet fracture and dislocation that may be uni/bilateral. Primary treatment is a closed reduction with skull traction. In some cases the facets are locked and it is impossible to treat even with maximal closed traction. Open reduction by surgical intervention is a suitable way for treatment.
METHODS: This retrospective study was done on patients with trauma of vertebral spine referred to emergency center during three years. This survey was done on 274 patients with trauma of cervical spine and 19 patients with locked facet syndrome.
FINDINGS: From 19 patients, 12 were male and 7 were female. Falling from a high place was the most common cause of injury. It happened more in second and third decade of their life. The most common manifestation was neck pain. 12 patients had no neurological deficit, 4 patients had incomplete neurological deficit and 3 had completed neurological deficit.
CONCLUSION: Different methods such as interspinous wiring, interfacet wiring and lateral mass plating were used for treatment .

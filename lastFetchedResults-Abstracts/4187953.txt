The objective of this paper is to propose a general approach to developing multi-input converters (MICs). The derived MICs can deliver power from all of the input sources to the load either individually or simultaneously, without using coupled transformers. By analyzing the topologies of the six basic pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters, the method for synthesizing an MIC is inspired by adding an extra pulsating voltage or current source to a PWM converter with appropriate connection. As a result, the pulsating voltage source cells (PVSCs) and the pulsating current source cells (PCSCs) are proposed for deriving MICs. According to the presented synthesizing rules, two families of MICs, including quasi-MICs and duplicated MICs, are generated by introducing the PVSCs and the PCSCs into the six basic PWM converters.

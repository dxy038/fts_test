Distributed video coding (DVC) is a new video compression technique based on Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv information theorems with the characteristics of simple encoding and complicated decoding. Side information is a major component of the DVC. It impacts the performance of decoding. In the paper, we propose an improved motion estimation scheme for the side information. The scheme integrates forward motion estimation and bidirectional motion estimation with Kalman filter in order to reduce the complexity in computing the motion vector. Experiments show that the quality of the side information can be enhanced by using the proposed scheme, comparing with the traditional motion estimation schemes.

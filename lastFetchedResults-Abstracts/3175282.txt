Taking three factors, say, minimizing rolling time difference between front car and the latter, height of hump and the number of retarders as objectives, considering engineering technology criterion that should be satisfied, a Multi-objective optimization model is established and NSGA-II multi-objective genetic algorithm is adopted to obtain Patero Set in this paper. The model and algorithm are shown by a cast and both of them are reasonable.

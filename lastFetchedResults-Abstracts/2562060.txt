<p><strong><em>Background:</em></strong> Here, we established the mouse models of chronic toxoplasmosis by <em>T. gondii</em> Tehran strain to provide a good understanding about defining the possible association between <em>T. gondii</em> exposure and learning and memory impairments. Moreover, as secondary objective of the present study, we hypothesized whether administration of an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor could reduce learning and memory impairments induced by <em>T. gondii</em> infection.</p><p><strong><em>Methods</em></strong>: Twenty-four male BALB/c mice were used to establishment of latent toxoplasmosis. The animal model of <em>Toxoplasma</em> infection was established by the intraperitoneal inoculation of 20-25 tissue cysts from Tehran strain of <em>T. gondii. </em>Donepezil (2 mg/kg) an AChE inhibitor to treat Alzheimer disease was injected intraperitoneally once a day for two weeks starting from post-infection day 90. Morris water maze (MWM) task was used to assay <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938414004715#NEU10977">spatial learning</a> and short term spatial memory in all groups. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to assess differences between experimental groups.  <em>P</em>&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p><strong><em>Results</em></strong>: <em>Toxoplasma </em>infection impaired spatial leaning and short term spatial memory of the infected BALB/c mice, whereas donepezil, an AChE inhibitor, improved impairments induced by <em>Toxoplasma</em> infection.</p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong>: <em>T. gondii</em> infection through increasing AChE reduces the level of Acetylcholine (Ach) and consequently affects learning and memory activity in infected hosts, whereas, donepezil as an AChE inhibitor improves these impairments by restoring ACh levels at synapses of neurons in brain.

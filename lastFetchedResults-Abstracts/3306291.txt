Our study is concerned with the development of an Emergency Medical Services ambulance location allocation model taking into account the randomness of the system related to service requests. Our objective is to satisfy rapidly all emergency calls while minimizing the overall costs. The model obtained, a discrete stochastic program, is approximated by the sample average function. The performance of the obtained sample average optimization problem is compared to a deterministic model.

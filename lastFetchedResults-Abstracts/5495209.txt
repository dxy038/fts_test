The demands for decreasing cost and increasing efficiency are popular for converter systems. In high voltage converter systems, such demands become more important and emergent since it is well-known that high voltage converter systems often consume greater cost and has lower efficiency compared with usual one. In this paper, a LCC resonant converter, which is comprised of full-bridge inverter, LCC tank, HV transformer and Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier, is adopted in very low frequency (VLF) high voltage (HV) generator. The resonant current amplitude and voltage drop in CW multiplier are selected as the objectives for multi-objective optimization. The research for an optimal design and multi-objective optimization are introduced, the results of the objectivesÂ´ trend lines regarding the decision variables and the Pareto front in given constraint are represented. Such research and optimization results can be utilized as a guideline for an optimal design and practical implementation of VLF HV generator.

A family of bidirectional DC/DC converters is proposed using the constant frequency zero-voltage switching (ZVS) multi-resonant topology. This family of converters provides ZVS operation of all semiconductor devices from no-load to full-load while achieving full DC conversion ratio range, and has inherent short-circuit protection capability. Analysis and design considerations of a buck/boost bidirectional converter are discussed along with experimental results supporting the proposed concept

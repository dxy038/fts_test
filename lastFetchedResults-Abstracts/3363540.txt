Computationally feasible and efficient simulation-driven optimisation of add-drop resonators for integrated photonic circuits is discussed. The approach exploits modelling of critical features of the otherwise highly non-linear responses, and almost linear dependence of these features on designable parameters. This, as well as a suitable formulation of the objective function and embedding the optimisation process in the trust-region framework, allows us to greatly reduce the computational effort in terms of the number of full-wave simulations of the photonic component of interest necessary to find its optimised design. Operation and efficiency of the proposed technique is demonstrated using the example of a 6-&#956;m high index contrast add-drop microring resonator.

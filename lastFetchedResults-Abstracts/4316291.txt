In next generation mobile satellite systems very high spectrum efficiency will be a primary objective. High spectrum efficiency is often related to a significant amount of co-channel and/or adjacent channel interference. Therefore, system design should in general include consideration of both interference and noise effects. Interference evaluation in a mobile satellite cellular system is different from the case of a terrestrial system due to the presence of the on-board antenna which acts as a spatial filter. The paper addresses the modeling of interference in single and multi-satellite cellular system and provides some results of the analysis

We provide some objective foundations for a belief revision process in a situation where (i) the decision-maker's initial probabilistic knowledge is imprecise and characterized by the core of a belief function, (ii) expected new data are themselves consistent with a belief function with known focal sets and (iii) the revision process is based on belief function combination. We study the properties of the information value for such a revising in the Gilboaâ€“Schmeidler multi-prior model.

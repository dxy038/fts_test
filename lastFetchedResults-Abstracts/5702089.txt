Objective: the objective of present paper was to study the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) in hypoxic ischemic (HI) animal models and to test the reliability of aEEG method when used to monitor cerebral injuries. Method: HI animal models were constructed and classified into mild, moderate and severe cerebral oxygen saturation groups according to regional oxygen saturation (rSO<inf>2</inf>) in brains. Then aEEG waveforms were obtained from raw EEG data using digital signal processing. Result: aEEG reflected cerebral functions consistently and accurately at different cerebral rSO<inf>2</inf> levels. aEEG waveforms rarely changed in the group of mild HI; they dropped but recovered in moderate HI group; and aEEG maintained very low after HI in the cases when severe HI happened. Conclusion: aEEG method could monitor cerebral functions directly, accurately and consistently. It is a reliable tool to continuously evaluate cerebral injuries.

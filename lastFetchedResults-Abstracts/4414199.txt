The article describes modern approaches to management of safety of activity of the person of systems on various objects. Actual problems of operation of similar complexes are formulated. A main objective of article is consideration of problems of collection of information about a condition of objects and creations of algorithms of identification of incidents in such systems. The technique of modeling of objects is as a result developed and approach to formation of criteria of identification of incidents is offered. The reached results allow to increase the accuracy of identification of failures and can be used for various sizes which change in time with a certain predicted recurrence.

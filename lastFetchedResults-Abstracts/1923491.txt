Debate surrounds the impact of renal function on the prognostic value of minor troponin T release in vascular surgery patients. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term prognostic value of minor degrees of troponin T release in patients who undergo major vascular surgery, especially those with concomitant renal dysfunction. Survivors of major noncardiac vascular surgery (n = 558) were preoperatively screened for cardiac risk factors and renal function. Serial troponin T was measured on days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery, using a threshold of 0.03 ng/ml. All-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were noted during follow-up (mean 3.5 ± 2.0 years). Minor (0.03 to 0.09 ng/ml) and major (≥0.1 ng/ml) release of troponin T was observed in 5% and 8%, respectively. During follow-up, 21% of the patients died and 15% experienced MACEs. After adjustment for the estimated glomerular filtration rate, patients with minor and major troponin T release were at comparable increased risk for late mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.79 to 6.58, and HR 3.72, 95% CI 2.37 to 5.85, respectively), and MACEs (HR 5.47, 95% CI 2.60 to 11.48, and HR 6.32, 95% CI 3.82 to 10.48, respectively) compared with patients with troponin T release &lt;0.03 ng/ml. Tests for heterogeneity revealed that minor and major troponin T release have prognostic value across the entire spectrum of renal function. In conclusion, marginal elevations of troponin T strongly predict late mortality and MACEs after major vascular surgery, irrespective of renal function. A currently underestimated high-risk subgroup of patients may be identified using a lower troponin T threshold.

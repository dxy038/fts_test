Abstract
Introduction: Soy products consumption may have favorable effects on cardiovascular diseases risk factors. These effects may be associated with the polymorphism in Apo E gene. 
Objective: To examine the effects of consumption of soy flour enriched bread on plasma lipids and its association with ApoE genotype in overweight and obese women.
Materials and Methods: In this randomized cross-sectional clinical trial, 30 overweight and obese women received a mild weight loss diet and then, randomly assigned to a regular diet and a soy bread diet, each for 6 weeks and a washout period for 20-d. In the soy bread diet group, 120 gr of soy flour enriched bread was replaced by equal amount of usual bread intake.   
Results: No significant effect of soy bread on lipid profile was observed when comparing the two groups (P  < 0.05). Evaluation of the effects of the two ApoE groups; E2 (? 2/ ?2) and E3 (?3/ ?3 or ?2/ ?3) showed a significant effect of soy bread on TG in E2 group, compared to E3 group (P=0.02). 
Conclusion: Soy bread consumption has favorable effects on serum TG of overweight and obese women with ?2 allele.

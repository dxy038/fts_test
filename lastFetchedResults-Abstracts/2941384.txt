In the frame of a spaceborn experiment based on low noise sensors with a 25 MHz spectrum, the drastic requirement to develop a power converter operating above 30 MHz has resulted. This paper describes a bidirectional buck PWM regulator calling for new technologies. Its power switches are RF MOSFETs and control is based on current mode state space variable feedback derived from the prediction of the conduction times of the power switches. The nonlinearity of such a controller is solved by using neural network techniques. Large signal simulations are presented to validate the concept

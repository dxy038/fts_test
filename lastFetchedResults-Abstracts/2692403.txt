The performance of a generic pedestrian detector may drop significantly when it is applied to a specific scene due to the mismatch between the source training set and samples from the target scene. We propose a new approach of automatically transferring a generic pedestrian detector to a scene-specific detector in static video surveillance without manually labeling samples from the target scene. The proposed transfer learning framework consists of four steps. 1) Through exploring the indegrees from target samples to source samples on a visual affinity graph, the source samples are weighted to match the distribution of target samples. 2) It explores a set of context cues to automatically select samples from the target scene, predicts their labels, and computes confidence scores to guide transfer learning. 3) The confidence scores propagate among target samples according to their underlying visual structures. 4) Target samples with higher confidence scores have larger influence on training scene-specific detectors. All these considerations are formulated under a single objective function called confidence-encoded SVM, which avoids hard thresholding on confidence scores. During test, only the appearance-based detector is used without context cues. The effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on two video surveillance data sets. Compared with a generic detector, it improves the detection rates by 48 and 36 percent at one false positive per image (FPPI) on the two data sets, respectively. The training process converges after one or two iterations on the data sets in experiments.

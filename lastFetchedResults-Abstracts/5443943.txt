Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been used as a fuel for internal combustion engines for decades. Developing single fuel CNG engine which has better economy and can meet more strict emission regulations becomes more and more important. The objective of the paper is to present the development of a new CNG engine electronic control system and some calibration tests results to the engine, including the engine description, the description of the engine control system, the design of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) hardware, the electronic control strategy of the engine based on the structure of the fuel system for the EQD180N-30 engine and the program for the ECU with C language corresponding to the ECUÂ´s hardware. The test results show that the engine can operate reliably with the new designed fuel system, engine performance like power, torque and fuel consumption can meet the design requirements; so the electronic system has been successfully developed.

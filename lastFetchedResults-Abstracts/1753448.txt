The present study was undertaken to find out the association of certain risk factors with the positive SCCIT (single comparative cervical intradermal tuberculin) test in water buffaloes at Faisalabad and Okara, Pakistan. Seventy-six herds (697 buffaloes) at Faisalabad and 56 (395 buffaloes) at Okara were included in the study. The buffaloes were screened through SCCIT Test. Positive reaction to SCCIT test was recorded in 14% of herds and in 3% of buffaloes. The herds positive for this test were 18% when herds with less than 10 animals were excluded from the analysis and these were 19% when herds with less than 10 buffaloes were excluded. The results of logistic analysis (crude and adjusted) revealed the association of lactating status of buffaloes (OR = 1.8) and the presence of cattle at the farm (OR = 2â€“4) with positive SCCIT test. After controlling for the farm, the risk of a positive skin test was 1.5 times higher if we change the location of the animal. Similarly, the controlled analysis (for the farm, breed and other variables) revealed an increased risk (OR = 1.1) of a positive skin test with the increase in cattle at the farm. The breed controlled stratified analysis showed the association of a number of cattle at the farm with a positive skin test. It can be concluded from the study that the prevalence of tuberculosis on the basis of a positive skin test is higher at herd level and lower at animal level. Further the risk of a positive skin test is higher when cattle are present at the farm.

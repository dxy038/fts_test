Small cell deployments have proven to be a cost-effective solution to meet the ever growing capacity and coverage requirements of mobile networks. While small cells are commonly deployed indoors, more recently outdoor roll-outs have garnered industry interest to complement existing macrocell infrastructure. However, the problem of where and when to deploy these small cells remains a challenge. In this paper, we investigate the small base station (SBS) placement problem in high demand outdoor environments. First, we propose a dynamic placement strategy (DPS) that optimizes SBS deployment for two different network objectives: minimizing data delivery cost, and minimizing macrocell utilization. We formulate each problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that determines the optimal set of deployment locations among the candidate hot-spots to meet each network objective. Then we develop two greedy algorithms, one for each objective, that achieve close to optimal MILP performance. Our simulation results demonstrate that significant delivery cost and MBS utilization reductions are possible by incorporating the proposed deployment strategies.

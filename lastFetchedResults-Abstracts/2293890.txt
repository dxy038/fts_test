Recent articles are indicating that polarimetric data provide significantly more information than conventional or multi-polarized images, particularly due to the additional phase information. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the multi-polarized and fully polarimetric L-band airborne SAR-R99B data, in terms of their capability to distinguish among different agricultural crops in the western part of Bahia State, Brazil. Emphasis was given to coffee, cotton and pasture crops which were at well developed growing stages. Discrimination among crops was carried out using graphical analysis of mean backscatter values. Crop classification was performed for single and multiple polarizations, and fully polarimetric images with a classifier that uses the contextual Iterated Conditional Modesâ€“ICM algorithm. The investigation confirmed the potential of L-band multi-polarized and polarimetric airborne SAR-R99B data to distinguish and classify agricultural crops in the tropical condition of the test-site. In addition, it clearly indicated the gradual and considerable improvement that was achieved going from single to three polarizations and from multi-polarized to fully polarimetric images.

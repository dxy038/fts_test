A novel and straight forward method is adopted to segregate the contribution of primary and secondary sources of formaldehyde based on the rates of its formation and removal at different times in the urban atmosphere of Kolkata. To achieve the above objective, the diurnal and seasonal mixing ratios of formaldehyde were measured during dry season at two busy roadside locations. The maximal secondary formation fluxes of formaldehyde during summer and winter were found to be 6.63 × 107 and 1.23 × 107 molecules cm− 3 s− 1, respectively. Apart from formaldehyde (C1), several other carbonyls were quantified in this study. An overall good correlation between acetaldehyde (C2) and propanal (C3) indicates the contribution of vehicular emission to the carbonyl budget. The secondary formaldehyde contributions in summer and winter were about 71% and 32%, respectively. The relative mean contributions of C1, C2 and ozone towards generation of OH fluxes in summer were found to be 1.56 × 107, 6.96 × 105, and 1.29 × 107 molecules cm− 3 s− 1, respectively, which were 3.2, 3.4 and 1.6 times higher than those in winter.

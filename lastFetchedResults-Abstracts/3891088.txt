This letter considers a low-complexity multiuser detection based on the closest lattice point search (CLPS) for high speed packet access (HSPA) system. Instead of attempting to solve the ML detection problem in the presence of intersymbol and inter-cell interference, we utilize interference cancelled chips obtained from a bidirectional decision feedback operation to detect symbols. As a result, the worst case complexity of the CLPS is bounded to a controllable level irrespective of multipath spans. From the simulation on single and multi cell downlink communications in HSPA systems, we show that the proposed method offers substantial performance gain over conventional RAKE and MMSE equalizer.

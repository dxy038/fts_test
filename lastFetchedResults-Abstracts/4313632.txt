An automated system has been implemented to develop and electronically distribute manufacturing process information. One component of this system focuses on replacing paper instructions and drawings in the hand assembly and manual inspection areas with a touchscreen-based graphical user interface (GUI). All information available in the system is automatically generated by process planners and maintained with minimum effort. On the production floor, the GUI uses a plantwide barcode system to provide automatic selection and display of assembly and inspection instructions. The GUI uses VGA graphics to display a board outline, color-coded text descriptions, and component outlines that distinguish between parts placed at the current workstation and all other parts on the assembly. The objective of the system is to provide accurate assembly information to the appropriate location in a timely manner. The overall, integrated system is expected to reduce process development time by 80%, improve hand assembly and manual inspection efficiency, and eliminate 90% of all assembly placement errors due to information problems

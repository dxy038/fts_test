
Aim and Background: The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of Bio fertilizer (Azosprillium spp bacteria) and salicylic acid on growth and development characteristics of Ocimum basilicum L. plant under water stress.

Materials and Methods: The experimental design was factorial which was arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications. Treatment were combination of 3 levels of water stress (100% FC as a control, 60% FC and 30% FC) and biofertilizer (inoculated and non-inoculated) and also salicylic acid (0 as control and 0.75 mM).

Results: Data variance analysis showed that morphological characteristics were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by drought levels, salicylic acid, biofertilizer and their interaction. The effects of various treatments on shoot and flower number, dry and fresh weight of root and shoot, Relative water content (RWC) and electron leakage were significant at 1%.

Conclusion: Application of salicylic acid and Azosprillium inoculation increased growth and development of basil under water stress.

Quantification of uncertainties in the source term estimations by a large
computer code, such as MELCOR and MAAP, is an essential process of the current
probabilistic safety analysis, The main objective of the present study is to investigate the
applicability of a combined procedure of the response surface method (RSM) based on
input determined from a statistical design and the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS)
technique for the uncertainty analysis of CsI release fractions under a hypothetical severe
accident sequence of a station blackout at Young-Gwang nuclear power plant using
MAAP3,OB code as a benchmark problem. On the basis of the results obtained in the
present work, the RSM is recommended to be used as a principal tool for an overall
uncertainty analysis in source term quantifications, while using the LHS in the calculations
of standardized regression coefficients (SRC) and standardized rank regression
coefficients (SRRC) to determine the subset of the most important input parameters in the
final screening step and to check the cumulative distribution functions obtained by RSM.
Verification of the response surface model for its sufficient accuracy is a prerequisite for
the reliability of the final results that can be obtained by the combined procedure proposed
in the present work.

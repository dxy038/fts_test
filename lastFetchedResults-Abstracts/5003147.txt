Accurate modeling of the effects of nutrient and activity variables on blood glucose can make a major impact in reducing the complications of diabetes for insulin dependent type 1 and 2 diabetics. These models can be used to design feedforward controllers that can revolutionize blood glucose control. However, to achieve this objective, there are several critical issues in measurement, data collection, and modeling that need to be resolved. This work discusses and presents solutions to resolving these issues.

In this paper, a new design approach of force rebalance loop is investigated for the vibratory rate sensor application. The proposed rebalance loop design takes advantages of a modified AGC loop configuration to simplify the system dynamics of oscillating characteristics. The proposed modification of AGC and rebalance strategy, which maintains controlled oscillation in the loop, acquires several advantages. First, it is possible to analyze and design the transient dynamics using a classical linear control theory. Also the control system to achieve the design objective is implemented using a relatively simple feedback loop. The practical application to vibratory gyroscope has shown that the force rebalance control with the proposed AGC configuration meets the design objective well from simulation results. Experiment is expected to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed control scheme.

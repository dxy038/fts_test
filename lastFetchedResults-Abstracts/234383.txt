Rainwater has been used in many countries as a way of minimising water availability problems. In Brazil, it has been reported that the potential for potable water savings by using rainwater may range from 48% to 100% depending on the geographic region. In southeastern Brazil, water availability is about 4500 m3 per capita per year, but it is predicted to be lower than 1000 m3 per capita per year from about 2100 onwards. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the potential for potable water savings by using rainwater in 195 cities located in southeastern Brazil. Rainwater tank sizes are also assessed for some cities in order to evaluate the ideal tank capacity as a function of potable water demand and rainwater demand. Results indicate that average potential for potable water savings range from 12% to 79% per year for the cities analysed. Ideal rainwater tank capacities for dwellings with low potable water demand range from about 2000 to 20,000 litres depending on rainwater demand. For dwellings with high potable water demand, ideal rainwater tank capacities range from about 3000 to 7000 litres. The main conclusion drawn from the research is that the average potential for potable water savings in southeastern Brazil is 41%. It was also concluded that rainwater tank capacity has to be determined for each location and dwelling as it depends strongly on potable water demand and rainwater demand.

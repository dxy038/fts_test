Finite element analysis of kink band formation in wood is carried out using an anisotropic failure criterion. The criterion is capable of describing the mixed mode I/mode II crack development observed in the kinked region. The evolution of cracking is simulated with the help of the so-called smeared crack approach. As for the finite rotation of the fibers in the kinked material, it is implemented in the finite element code through a hypo-elastic law characterized by an objective derivate using the rotation of the fibers. This formulation enables to follow strictly the matter under finite strain; which means that the evolution of the orthotropic directions is correctly described.

cal results, such as the predicted load carrying capacity of wood under compression and its post-cracking behavior, prove to have a good agreement with the experimental observations. Further, the applicability of softening orthotropic plasticity under finite strain conditions for simulating compressive failure modes in wood is established.

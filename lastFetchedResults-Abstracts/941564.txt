The First Nations communities of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemong (Ontario, Canada) have been impacted by mercury
pollution since the 1960s. This study was implemented with the objective of providing these communities with information on
current mercury concentrations in their catch, in order to make appropriate fish consumption choices. A total of 851 fish samples,
including Walleye, Northern Pike, Large-mouth Bass, and Whitefish, were collected from thirteen lakes and rivers. Total mercury
was measured and the relationship between fish length, mercury concentration, and lake of origin were assessed. It was found that
fish from most of the lakes exhibit a positive relationship between length and mercury accumulation. Mercury concentrations in
fish collected from Clay Lake, closest to the original source of contamination, are higher than those from other lakes. Mercury
concentrations have declined over the last 25 years but the gradient of contamination was still observed. Results were
communicated to the communities for public health purposes.

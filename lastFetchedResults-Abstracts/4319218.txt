Nowadays, there has been an explosive growth in the research devoted to the area of hierarchical architecture for its extraordinary performance on energy-saving and special applications. However, because the nature of security threats in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as well as the nature of WSN itself raises additional security challenges, new schemes and architectures are needed to prevent the network from these threatens. In this paper, we propose a secure architecture formation scheme which uses a bidirectional evaluation mechanism to securely form a hierarchical architecture for WSNs. Our experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves better performance than other hierarchical architecture formation schemes.

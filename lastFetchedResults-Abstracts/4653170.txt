It is well-known that the wider the range of extraction points a scalable bitstream supports, the lower the compression efficiency at these extraction points. Moreover, this compression efficiency generally varies according to what combination of scalability types are used to support this range of extraction points as specified by the encoding configuration. Hence, we propose some objective criteria as a measure of coverage, compression efficiency and rate-distortion performance of a configuration, and then present a multiple-objective optimization formulation to select the best encoding configuration for scalable video coding, given a range of bitstreams that must be supported. The method is demonstrated by experimental results.

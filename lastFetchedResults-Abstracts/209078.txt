As a first step towards mechanization related to any product, including date fruit, It IS
necessary to have comprehensive information about the product. Physical and mechanical
properties are needed for the design of post harvest machinery and equipment. The objective of
this study was to determine and compare somephysical properties such as dimension, mass and
volume, particulate density, pitted density, bulk density, porosity, projected areas, geometric
mean diameter, sphericity and surface area of Haj-Ghanbari and Shahani varieties of date fruit.
Also coefficient of static friction on three different surfaces including galvanized iron steel,
glassand plywood were determined and compared. Experiments for date while pitteddates were
carried out at 12.90% and 12.20% (w.b.) moisture content for Haj-Ghanbari and 30.55% and
29.42% (w.b.) for Shahani variety. Results indicated that mean mass and volume were 5.57 g
and 4.74 g/cm' for Haj-Ghanbari and 8.69 g and 8.67 g/cm' for Shahani variety. Size and
projected areas of Shahani variety were greater than those for Haj-Ghanbari. The average fruit
true density, pitted density and bulk density of Haj-Ghanbari variety were greaterthan those for
than Shahani variety while porosity was less than that for Shahani. The geometric mean
diameter, surface area and mean coefficient of static friction of Shahani date were more than
those for Haj-Ghanbari while sphericity wasequal for the two varieties with an average value of
0.58. Results are useful in design of post harvest equipments and machinery for date fruit.

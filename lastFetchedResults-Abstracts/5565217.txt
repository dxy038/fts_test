This paper aims to optimize the indoor planning of distributed antenna systems (DAS). The objective of the optimization is to find the number of deployed antennas, their optimal locations and the power transmitted from each antenna. The optimal configuration should minimize the deployment cost, maximize wireless coverage while minimizing power leakage outside a building. One of the main challenges in this problem is that in DAS all antennas are fed from the same base station. This means that the total power transmitted is constant and hence increasing the power assigned to one antenna would require decreasing the power on all other antennas. Similarly adding an antenna would require decreasing the power assigned to existing antennas. Previous approaches simplified the problem by assuming equal transmitted power from all antennas in the DAS, and they ignored the fact that the sum of these powers should remain constant. This paper provides a new multi-objective formulation for indoor DAS planning that considers a fixed total transmitted power constraint. The paper proposes a solution method that uses simulated annealing with smart neighborhood search steps to reach a near optimal solution. Results showed that the proposed formulation obtained better indoor DAS configuration and that including antenna power in the optimization provided a solution that contain less antennas and better average power compared to the equal power configuration.

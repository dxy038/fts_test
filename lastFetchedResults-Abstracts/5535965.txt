The main objective of this study is to develop an implemented system based on MapGIS for managing and visualizing urban geology information, such as borehole, remote sensing (RS) data, geophysical and geochemical data-in Shanghai City. More than 20,000 boreholes, 80G byte RS data and other geological data were managed with three levels in the system. For the convenience of sharing information and building 3D geological model, standard forms of borehole and other geological data, such as cross-sections, were proposed. The design of urban geological datacenter is to ensure the possibility of geology information share. With B/S (browse/server) and C/S (client/server) architectures, the software architecture of the system is composed by three sub-systems: (1) The data management subsystem supported by the data center; (2) The geological data analysis and appraisal subsystem running on the intranet with C/S architecture. Most functions of the developed system were integrated in this subsystem; (3) The urban geological data share and information issue subsystem running on the internet. It is built on the basis of Web GIS and provides functions, such as information search, statistical summaries and 3D geological model browsing, which are stored in the data center for the public. As a result, the system makes the efficient management for urban geology information possible and provides a 3D virtual visualization of underground geological environment with 3D geological modeling function.

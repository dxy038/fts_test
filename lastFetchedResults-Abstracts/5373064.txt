This paper presents the introduction of Problem-Based learning (PBL) in a power electronics subject at the University of Oviedo (SPAIN) by means of two practical projects: the design and construction of a Switching-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) prototype and the static study of a dc-dc converter topology. The objective of this change in the traditional methodology of the Power Electronics course is to foster the application of the knowledge acquired by students in theory classes. PBL is known to be a motivating, problem-centered teaching method that brings the real professional world closer to the student. For this reason, the lecturers considered PBL to be the most suitable methodology to obtain the desired results. The underlying methodology, task planning and assessment of these projects will be presented. Furthermore, the influence of the introduction of PBL in practical sessions versus the traditional teaching method will be discussed. Finally, the lecturersÂ´ reflections and conclusions regarding the application of PBL in this subject over the last two years will be presented.

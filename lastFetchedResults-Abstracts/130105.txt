The method introduced in the present paper is use of biplots obtained from principal component analysis for selecting and screening of genotypes in preliminary experiments considering several traits. Data used in this study were obtained from a preliminary experiment in which 121 sunflower genotypes were tested and 10 superior hybrids were selected. The experiment was carried out for selecting high potential snflower three way cross hybrids in Khoy Aricultural Research Station in 2001. The main objective of this study was to determine if there is any conformity between conventional and PCA method for preliminary selection of genotypes. In the presented method, Based on values of two components that contained high percent of total variance of data and had high correlation with seed yield, oil yield, growth period, seed number per head, seed weight and oil content, each genotype located in a biplot in which two components were considered as X and Y axes. Considering position of genotypes in the diagram, it was found that selected hybrids mainly located at the left half of diagram nearby vectors of seed yield, oil yield, seed number per head and inverse direction of growth period. Logical orientation of genotypes under impression of agronome traits could be used as effective tool for rapid selection of high yielding and early maturing hybrids. Because of considerable conformity with conventional method and by presentation bright view of genotype's potential, PCA method contributed for selection of 10 superior hybrids and could be used in cultivar development programs.

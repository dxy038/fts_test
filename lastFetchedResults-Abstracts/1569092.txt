In this paper, the sound behavior of a double walled composite with an intermediate porous layer has been conducted using the classical laminated plate theory (CLPT). The main objective of the paper is devoted to considering the analytical study of various boundaries on porous layers as well as parameter study on power transmission through the structure. Thus, viscous and inertia coupling in a dynamic equation, as well as stress transfer, thermal and elastic coupling of porous material are considered based on Biot theory. In addition, the equation of wave propagation are extracted according to vibration equation of composite layers. Then, with applying the various boundaries on the structures along with solving these equations simultaneously, the Transmission Loss (TL) is calculated. The analytical results are compared with both numerical ones obtained from Statistical energy Analysis (SEA) as well as empirical results and an excellent agreement is observed. The parametric studies are presented to investigate the effects of boundary conditions on TL. The results indicate that the interface of porous-composite layers as well as stacking sequences of the composite layers would play an important role in reduction of power transmission through the structure.

The paper presents an approach to safe controller design for intelligent cruise control applications using differential game theory. The design problem is formulated as a zerosum differential game, where the objective of the lead vehicle is to provoke a collision and the objective of the following vehicle is to prevent a collision from happening regardless of the motion of the leader. A control strategy is safe if it can guarantee that no collision will occur between vehicles. The approach is applicable to Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative ACC systems.

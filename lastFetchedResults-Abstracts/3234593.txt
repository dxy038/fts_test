This paper presents a preliminary analysis of a class of non-linear filters for enhancement of mammogram lesions. A non-linear filtering approach employing polynomial model of non-linearity is designed by second order truncation of Volterra series expansion. The proposed filter response is a linear combination of Type-0 and Type-II Volterra filters. Type-0 filter provides contrast enhancement, suppressing the ill-effects of background noise. On the other hand, Type-II filter employs edge enhancement. The objective analysis of the proposed filter is carried out by estimating values of quality parameters like CEM and PSNR on mammograms from MIAS and DDSM databases.

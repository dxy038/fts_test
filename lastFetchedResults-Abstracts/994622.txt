Validation of analytical methods is a widely used and regulated step for each analytical method. However, the classical approaches to demonstrate the ability to quantify of a method do not necessarily fulfill this objective. For this reason an innovative methodology was recently introduced by using the tolerance interval and accuracy profile, which guarantee that a pre-defined proportion of future measurements obtained with the method will be included within the acceptance limits. Accuracy profile is an effective decision tool to assess the validity of analytical methods. The methodology to build such a profile is detailed here. However, as for any visual tool it has a part of subjectivity. It was then necessary to make the decision process objective in order to quantify the degree of adequacy of an accuracy profile and to allow a thorough comparison between such profiles. To achieve this, we developed a global desirability index based on the three most important validation criteria: the trueness, the precision and the range. The global index allows the classification of the different accuracy profiles obtained according to their respective response functions. A diacetyl-monoxime colorimetric assay for the determination of urea in transdermal iontophoretic extracts was used to illustrate these improvements.

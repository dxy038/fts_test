This paper discusses model predictive control, a scheme in which an open-loop performance objective is optimized over a finite moving time horizon. Model predictive control is shown to provide superior control for nonminimum phase systems and systems with input constraints when future setpoints are known. Stabilizing unstable linear plants and controlling nonlinear plants with multiple steady states are also discussed.

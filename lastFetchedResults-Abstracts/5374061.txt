The objective of this paper is to generate an Application-Oriented Test Procedure to be used by a FPGA user in a given application. General definitions concerning the specific problem of testing RAM-based FPGAs are first given such as the important concept of `AC-non-redundant fault.&#8221; Then, it is commented that a classical test pattern generation performed on the circuit netlist gives a low AC-non-redundant fault coverage and it is pointed out that test pattern generation performed on a FPGA representation is required. It is also commented that test pattern generation performed on the FPGA representation can be significantly accelerated by different techniques. A procedure called TOF is described to validate the proposed approach on benchmark circuits

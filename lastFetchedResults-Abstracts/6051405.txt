In this work we construct a graph model for a dense wireless sensor Network (WSN) in an industrial facility and investigate energy efficient routing path for network communication. The main objective is to conserve the overall energy of network so that it can last longer. We used connected dominating set (CDS) because it provides smaller network backbone compared to minimum spanning tree (MST). We designed a distributed CDS construction algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm creates more efficient CDS as compared to the traditional CDS generating algorithm such as BFS.

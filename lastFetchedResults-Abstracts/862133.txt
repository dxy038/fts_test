Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease also known as histiocytic necrotizing
lymphadenitis is a benign disorder characterized histologically by
necrotic foci surrounded by histiocytic aggregates, and with the absence
of neutrophils. The patient was a 21-year-old man with chills, fever
and cervical lymphadenopathy. He had swelling and tenderness of
cervical area. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were palpable. Cervical
lymph node excisional biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination
showed reactive follicular hyperplasia with vast areas of necrosis without
neutrophilic infiltration. No sign of malignancy was seen. Final diagnosis
was Kikuchi-Fujimoto necrotizing lymphadenitis. Kikuchi-Fujimoto
disease should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in
patients with prolonged fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. It should
be differentiated from tuberculous lymphadenitis in regions where
tuberculosis is prevalent.

This paper considers energy and information cooperation between a single-antenna primary user (PU) pair and a multiple-antennae secondary user (SU) pair in a cognitive radio system. The secondary transmitter (ST) harvests energy from the primary signal and gains opportunity to transmit its own signal in return for helping relay the primary transmitterÂ´s (PT) traffic. A time-divided power splitting scheme is proposed to enable the energy and information cooperation with the objective of maximizing the throughput of the SU pair under the energy constraint of the ST and the received signal-to-inference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraint of the primary receiver (PR). Simulation results demonstrate the influence of the time division proportion and the power splitting parameter on the throughput of the SU pair and the PU pair.

Purpose Rape is an established risk factor for mental
health disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), major depressive episodes (MDE), and substance
use disorders. The majority of studies have not differentiated
substance-involved rape or examined comorbid diagnoses
among victims. Therefore, the aim of the present
study was to estimate the prevalence of common traumarelated
psychiatric disorders (and their comorbidity) in a
national sample of women, with an emphasis on distinguishing
between rape tactics. A secondary objective was
to estimate the risk for psychiatric disorders among victims
of variant rape tactics, in comparison to non-victims.
Methods A nationally representative population-based
sample of 3,001 non-institutionalized, civilian, English or
Spanish speaking women (aged 18â€“86 years) participated
in a structured telephone interview assessing rape history
and DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, MDE, alcohol abuse (AA),
and drug abuse (DA). Descriptive statistics and multivariate
logistic regression analyses were employed.
Results Women with rape histories involving both substance
facilitation and forcible tactics reported the highest
current prevalence of PTSD (36%), MDE (36%), and AA
(20%). Multivariate models demonstrated that this victim
group was also at highest risk for psychiatric disorders,
after controlling for demographics and childhood and
multiple victimization history. Women with substancefacilitated
rapes reported higher prevalence of substance
abuse in comparison to women with forcible rape histories.
Comorbidity between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders
was higher among rape victims in comparison to nonrape
victims.
Conclusions Researchers and clinicians should assess
substance-facilitated rape tactics and attend to comorbidity
among rape victims. Empirically supported treatments are
needed to address the complex presentations observed
among women with variant rape histories.

A dynamic scratch pad memory (SPM) management scheme for program stack data with the objective of processor power reduction is presented. Basic technique does not need the SPM size at compile time, does not mandate any hardware changes, does not need profile information, and seamlessly integrates support for recursive functions. Stack frames are managed using a software SPM manager, integrated into the application binary, and shows average energy savings of 32% along with a performance improvement of 13%, on benchmarks from MiBench. SPM management can be further optimized and made pointer safe, by knowing the SPM size.

Objectives
Dentin bonds made with one-bottle etch-and-rinse and self-etch adhesives are affected by the formation of interfacial blisters, porosities and deterioration. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the fluid flow through resin–dentin interfaces created by self-etching adhesives applied to deep dentin using a replica technique and by directly measuring dentin permeability (P). The second objective was to examine the effect of intrapulpal pressure on the microtensile bond strength of these adhesives.
Methods

A fluid-transport model was used to measure the fluid permeability (%P) through different adhesives. Impressions of bonded dentin were taken with a polyvinylsiloxane impression material to monitor fluid transudation from the surface of the adhesive. Positive replicas were fabricated for SEM examination. Two groups of resin-bonded specimens (pulpal pressure versus no pulpal pressure) were created for microtensile bond strength evaluation. Adhesive application was performed under 0 cm H2O. Pulpal pressure group was submitted to 20 cm H2O of pulpal pressure during build-up procedures.
Results

Clearfil Protect Bond exhibited the lowest permeability and fewest numbers of fluid droplets over the surface of the bonded dentin. G-Bond and Clearfil-S3 Bond were more permeable than Clearfil Protect Bond. One Up Bond F was the most permeable adhesive. A highly significant correlation was observed between the relative permeability of these adhesives (%P) and the number of fluid droplets on the adhesive surfaces. The application of pulpal pressure significantly reduced bond strength.
Significance

Resin–dentin bonds created by contemporary self-etch adhesives are susceptible to fluid permeation induced by pulpal pressure. HEMA-based adhesives showed the largest reductions in bond strengths after pulpal pressure application.

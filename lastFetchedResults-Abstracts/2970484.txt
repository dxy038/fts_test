The modified bark spectral distortion (MBSD), used for an objective speech quality measure, estimates speech distortion in the loudness domain taking into account the noise masking threshold in order to include only audible distortions in the calculation of the distortion measure. Preliminary simulation results have shown improvement of the MBSD over the conventional BSD. In this paper, the performance of the MBSD is improved by scaling the noise masking threshold. Finally, this new MBSD (MBSD II) measure is compared with the ITU-T Recommendation P.861 objective speech quality measure for telephone-band speech

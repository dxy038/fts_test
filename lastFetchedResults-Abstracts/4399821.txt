Subcontractor selection plays a key role for the main contractor of a complex construction project. In this paper, we identify the higher partial semi-variance (HSV) of processing times to express the risk of tardiness, and propose a Mean-HSV model to provide a formal description for the subcontractor selection problem. The objective is to select the optimal combination of subcontractors to minimize the total cost of the project within due date. The uncertainty theory is used to deal with parameters with human subjective estimation. Finally, the 99 method was used to solve the model.

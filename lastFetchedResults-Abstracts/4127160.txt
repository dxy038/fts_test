The authors report simulation results and prototype control protocols for a digital subscriber loop transmission system, which will find and operate at the highest common bidirectional transmission rate that is viable on a given loop while preserving a specified noise margin. A prototype implements the rate-adaptation and transmission protocols over a captive multigauge cable facility. Simulation results predict the accompanying symbol rate versus reach characteristics for a transceiver with the same structure as basic rate access (BRA) systems under RA-DSL control. Results show that 1.5 Mb/s could be delivered to loops of up to 2 km while subscribers out to 10 km could receive 80 kb/s. For a number of specialized or short-notice situations, RA-DSL could be the basis for a fast and flexible response vehicle. If RA-DSL cannot serve an individual combination of distance and capacity, existing methods remain. However, a statistical assessment with metro population data shows the potential for RA-DSL to satisfy 4-6 times more <e1>n</e1>&#215;DS-0 access requests than BRA on existing copper, without carrier serving area constraints

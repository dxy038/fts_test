A mathematical model is presented for the problem of jointly assigning routes to the communicating pairs of nodes and capacities to the links in a packet-switched network. It is assumed that several classes of flow are using the network, different service requirements and message characteristics being associated with each class. An algorithm that generates good feasible solutions to the model, together with tight lower bounds on the value of the objective function, is presented. Results of numerical experiments using several network topologies are reported

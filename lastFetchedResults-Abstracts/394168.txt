Objective: To promote greater compliance in using prescribed infant apnea monitors among families with a medically at-risk infant. Eight consecutively referred non-compliant families were treated by a medical social worker who provided educational, behavioral prompting, and case management services. In six families results were evaluated with A–B single case research designs, and in two families A–B–A designs were used. Enhanced compliance followed intervention with all eight families. Clinically satisfactory compliance permitting the pediatrician to safely discontinue monitor use occurred in five of the eight families. Simple behavioral and case management interventions show great promise in promoting caregiver compliance with using home-based infant apnea monitors.

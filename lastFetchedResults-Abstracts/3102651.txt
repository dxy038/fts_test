An optimizing mathematical model with the objective function of minimizing the total number of resource links is established. Improved table dispatching method and continuous adjustment method in closed circuit are proposed to solve the model, by which the optimal solution can be gotten. Critical sequences in the project scheduling can be identified by the float computing like CPM model on the basis of the optimal solution.

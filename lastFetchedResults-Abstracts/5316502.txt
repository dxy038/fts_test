Thanks to the success of the 2D scattering fields databases that we have measured in the anechoic chamber of the Institut Fresnel and proposed to the inverse problem community, we are now extending these studies to 3D configurations. This introduces new challenges due to the low level of signal as well as its sensitiveness to small disturbances. A careful characterization of the experimental errors is therefore necessary and we focus therein on drift errors, as they are mainly responsible for the scattered field variations. The objective is double: improve scattered field measurement accuracy and reduce acquisition time as it can take several hours for one incident illumination for 3D inverse scattering applications. To compensate for this drift error, we propose a fast correction based on a limited spectral bandwidth criteria, with the benefit of no loss of information and no need of a priori knowledge on the scatterer. After introducing the measurement setup and describing this correction protocol, we highlight its influence on the acquisition process

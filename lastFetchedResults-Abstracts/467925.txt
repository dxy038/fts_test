OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explain the effect of the nonspecific angiotensin II antagonist saralasin and the specific angiotensin II type-2 receptor antagonist PD123319 on ovulation.
STUDY DESIGN: Saralasin, 1 μmol/L (n = 5), and PD123319 10 μmol/L (n = 6), were administered to in vitro perfused rat ovary. Prostaglandin (prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α), hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid), estradiol, and progesterone levels in the perfusate and the ovulation rate were compared (Mann-Whitney U test) with controls.
RESULTS: Saralasin significantly (P< .01) inhibited the ovulation rate (3.0 ± 1.4) versus control (13.1 ± 1.0) and reduced prostaglandin E2 (at 3 hours P< .01 and 20 hours P< .05) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α (at 20 hours P< .05) levels. Saralasin did not alter prostaglandin F2α, hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids, or steroid levels. PD123319 decreased 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid levels at 3 hours (P< .05) but had no effects on other eicosanoids, steroid levels, or the ovulation rate.
CONCLUSION: Angiotensin II plays an important role in ovulation in the rat and is associated with ovarian prostaglandin synthesis. This effect is not selectively regulated via the angiotensin II type-2 receptor. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:35-40.)

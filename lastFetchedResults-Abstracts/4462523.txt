As hundreds of enterprises strive to connect their businesses with mobile applications, there is a remarkable trend towards the integration of antennas into devices once tethered to networks. Several wireless communication standards, for example Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11b, operate in the 2.4 GHz Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) unlicensed band. The inverted-F (INF) antennaÂ´s simple design, ease of integration, low cost and overall reliable performance makes it one of the most viable candidates for device integration in the ISM space. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of antenna placement on the impedance and radiation characteristics of a given INF antenna for laptop applications.

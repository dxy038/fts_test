Technical writing tries to be &#8220;objective&#8221; and &#8220;audience-oriented&#8221;, but it neglects an element of persuasion known in ancient rhetoric as &#8220;ethos&#8221;. This concept translates from the Greek as &#8220;character&#8221;, but that English word does not convey the conceptÂ´s richness; nor does the Latin &#8220;persona&#8221;, a term sometimes used to describe the narrative voice in technical prose. &#8220;Ethos&#8221; is the root of &#8220;ethics&#8221;, which tends to objectify values and choices, alienating them from the people making them. In this paper, I suggest that an understanding of &#8220;ethos&#8221; in all its richness can help writers of technical prose to produce work that, in relation to traditionally &#8220;objective&#8221; prose, is both more readable and more ethical

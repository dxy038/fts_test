We designed and built a 3D ultrasound computer tomography (USCT) device with a nearly isotropic and spatially invariant 3D point spread function, to be tested in a clinical study. The objective of this work was to image two healthy volunteers and to evaluate the USCT volumes in comparison to corresponding Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The here presented volumes are reflectivity images generated with 3D synthetic aperture focusing technique. The volunteers were imaged with different parameterizations of the data acquisition. The data acquisition time was between four and twelve minutes. For both volunteers we found that the breast surface and inner structures are clearly shown in the USCT volume and fit the structures given by the MRI.

Researchers usually focus on developing and designing power amplifiers with high efficiency but ignore to keep the balance between input and output of circuit parameters which can be serious in fabrication process as small error in large elements can consume very small corresponding elements. The objective of this research is to design a power amplifier with balanced input and output. The designed power amplifier with balanced parameters is operated at 2.4 GHz band. This circuit consists of input part, output part, and bias circuit (Vgs at -3.8 V, Vdd at 12V). The result of PAE was 45.408 %, S-parameter S1, 1 = -20.648 dBm, S2, 2 = -18.993 dBm while maintaining difference between elements maximally four times.

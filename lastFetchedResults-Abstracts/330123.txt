Objectives. Electronic databases provide strong support for research and education literature searches. However, there is still some lag in time between publication and updates of the database. The objective of this summary was to identify and categorize the 1994 dental materials scientific literature that dealth with restorative dentistry. Methods. Seventeen primary journals were manually searched via the Tables of Contents and 88 secondary journals were manually or electronically searched. Dental materials citations were categorized into 15 major sections and several subsections, excluding case reports and literature primarily related to dental implants or biomedical materials outside of dentistry. Results. Nearly twelve hundred citations were identified, the largest number being associated with composites and glass ionomers. Significance. This list provides a comprehensive source for review by academicians and researchers to bridge the gap between initial publication and electronic citation.

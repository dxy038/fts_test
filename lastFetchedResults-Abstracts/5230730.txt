The objective of the paper is to suggest an improvement of the most commonly used corporate environmental management tool-the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and itÂ´s application in ship industry. The current study includes two stages. Firstly, more phases are added to the life cycle and some criteria that measure the investment in environmental protection are introduced. Secondly, ship industry, as an example, is considered in the assessment of environmental performance to extend the LAC further.

The intelligent optimization algorithm PBIL is applied to VRP. Faced to the concrete problem that the objective function is to minimize the cost and meet the time restriction. And the probability statistics for the road traffic status distributed in working hours is considered to decide the routing. The probability matrix of PBIL algorithm is modified with the quick velocity update strategy of particle swarm optimization algorithm. The modified PBIL algorithm is tested in a Beijing Stone Logistics Company. The good adaptability, validity and stability performance are fully shown by the results.

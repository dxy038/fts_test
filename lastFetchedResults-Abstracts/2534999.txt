In order to defend the abode of Islam (world of Islam), Imam Khomeini in his defense discourse, used the method of imaging and representation of other as enemy or alien. In this method, Imam Khomeini by otherization of the arrogance, connected the national level of security and the level of security and defense of the world of Islam to its transnational and international levels. The defense of the abode of Islam in Imam Khomeini’s defense discourse did not merely include the territory, but also protection of the dignity and field of Islam, protection of the Muslims under attack, defense against any attack and defense of the oppressed people who are under attack. The main objective of the present paper is to semantological study of elements, metaphors and components of representation and otherization of arrogance in Imam Khomeini’s defense discourse (with regard to Iran and the world of Islam) in three fields: political, economic and cultural. The main question of the present paper is: How is arrogance as other represented in Imam Khomeini’s discourse? In order to answer the above question, discourse analysis has been used and the data have been garnered from Imam Khomeini’s works. Attempts have been made to analyze Imam Khomeini’s representation of arrogance in his defense discourse within the framework of the representation of other in accordance with the notion of Stewart Hall.

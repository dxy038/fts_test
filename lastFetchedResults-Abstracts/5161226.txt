This paper sets forth and demonstrates an approach to the design of power electronics based power systems using evolutionary computing techniques. Key features of the paper are the use of evolutionary computing in the context of conventional control design and the use of multi-objective evolutionary computing in the selection of control parameters based on system performance versus control effort. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a power electronics based power distribution system similar to those being designed for next generation warships.

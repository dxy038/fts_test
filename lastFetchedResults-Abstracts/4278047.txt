In this paper, we consider single-machine rescheduling problem with position-dependent learning effect under disruption, which learning effect means that the processing time of a job reflects a decreasing as a function of the number of repetitions. The objective is to minimize makepan, the total completion time and maximum lateness under a limit of the disruption from the original scheduling, and to minimize the total of the cost with original cost measure and disruption, respectively. We show that the considered problem can be solved in polynomial time.

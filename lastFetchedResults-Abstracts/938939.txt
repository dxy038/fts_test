Due to a variety of past and present land-usages on the aquifer ground surface, appropriate groundwater management should consider anthropogenic activities on the ground surface and the potential of unsaturated zone media to convey water and pollutants to the aquifer. The objective of this paper is to present an approach which generates guidelines and recommendations which can lead to sustainable development. This method assesses the lithological characteristics of the aquifer's vadose zone, indicating potential rechargeability, while weighting factors leading to potential groundwater pollution resulting from some land-use. Recommendations regarding land-use planning and aquifer recharge can then provide a qualitative ecological tool towards sustainable groundwater management. Owing to its location, its critical significance to the country's fresh water supply, and its available field data, Israel's Coastal aquifer is employed here as the study area for implementation of this approach.

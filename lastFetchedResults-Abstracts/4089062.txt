An evaluation of reconstruction quality in image vector quantisation (VQ) is introduced. Several existing objective measures were examined, and several measures were developed that take into account specific distortions accompanying the VQ process. Analysis of the combination of the existing and proposed measures has led to the design of a simple objective measure with an ability to subjectively judge the image quality more accurately than when using the PSNR criterion

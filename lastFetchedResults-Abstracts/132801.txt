BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blindness arising from ischemic optic neuropathy is a rare cause of massive exsanguinating hemorrhage. It can be occurred as a transient or permanent, unilateral or bilateral complication. Its occurrence is rare in obstetric hemorrhage. In this case study, we present a case of blindness after hemorrhage from uterine rupture.
CASE: A 30-year old primigravida woman was brought to the hospital with signs of hypovolemic shock after a precipitated delivery. Based on the clinical diagnosis of uterine rupture hysterectomy was performed for the patient. In addition to acute tubular necrosis the patient developed blindness on 6th day of admission. Clinical diagnosis of ischemic optic neuropathy was done. Three days later she recovered spontaneously and left the hospital.
CONCLUSION: Although loss of vision rarely occurs after obstetric hemorrhage, regarding their tragic consequences particularly in permanent cases, it is wise to prevent these complications by correction of anemia before delivery and immediate transfusion after hemorrhage.

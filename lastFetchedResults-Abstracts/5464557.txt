Combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) involves the simultaneous optimization of fuel cost and emission objectives which are conflicting ones. The bi-objective CEED problem is converted into a single optimization problem by introducing price penalty factor (PPF). A new approach to the reserve constrained CEED based on shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) is proposed. The algorithm approaches and methods for solving the reserve constrained CEED problem are given. A 15-unit system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The test results show that the proposed method is effective and has a certain practicality.

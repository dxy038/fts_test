Objective: To determine the role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in finding the causes of menorrhagia in patients with no obvious pathology on bimanual examination.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in the department of Obstetric and Gynaecology ("A" Unit), Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar over a period of one year from 01.11.2003 to 31.10 2004. Married women having menorrhagia with no pelvic mass on bimanual examination underwent TVS in private setup.

After taking detailed history they were thoroughly examined and investigated.Results: Total of 65 cases underwent TVS for menorrhagia. The most common age group was 36-50 year. The commonest cause of menorrhagia on TVS was submucus fibroid of uterus in 38.5% cases (n=25), followed by adenomyosis in 27.9% (n=18) cases, endometrial hyperplasia in 23.07% (n=15), endometrial polyp in 9.23% (6 cases) and forgotten IUCD in 1.53%, (n=1).Conclusion: TVS is an effective diagnostic tool for finding a cause for abnormal uterine bleeding before proceeding for any operative procedure.

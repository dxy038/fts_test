This study presents various configurations, control schemes and design of single-phase power factor controller (PFC) topologies for permanent magnet brushless DC motor (PMBLDCM) drives and provides a basis for selection of a suitable PFC topology for a specific application. Several AC-DC converter (buck, boost, buck-boost, C-uk, SEPIC, Zeta, push-pull, half bridge, full bridge) based PFC topologies are designed, modelled and applied to a 1.5-kW PMBLDCM drive for comparison of performance. Some of bidirectional bridge converter and unipolar inverter topologies are also evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison of the PFC topologies for PMBLDCM drives. The proposed PFC converter topologies show conformity to international power quality standards with improved performance of PMBLDCM drive, such as reduction of AC mains current harmonics, near unity power factor and reduction of speed and torque ripples. A classified list of more than 200 research publications on the state of art of various PFC topologies and PMBLDCM drives is also given for a quick reference.

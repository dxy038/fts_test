The objective of the research presented in this paper is to investigate the application of a new metaheuristic algorithm called ant colony algorithm to petroleum engineering problems. This algorithm is usually used for discrete domains, but with some modifications, has been applied to continuous optimization. In this paper, three examples with continuous and discrete parameters as well as known solutions and varying degrees of complexities are presented as an illustration for solving a large class of process optimization problems in petroleum engineering. Results of case studies show the ability of ant colony algorithm to provide fast and accurate solutions.

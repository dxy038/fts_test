Background: Inflammation plays a critical role in atherogenesis. The initial step in atherosclerosis is the adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells mediated by ICAM-1, an inflammatory protein. Several polymorphisms for Intracellular adhesion molecule -1(ICAM-) gene have been described. Objective: To determine the possible role of G241R and K469E polymorphisms in development of coronary artery disease and MI. Methods: G241R polymorphism was investigated in 303 patients with angiographi-cally documented CAD, including 151 patients with acute or chronic myocardial infarc-tion (MI), and a control group consisting of 141 healthy subjects with normal coronary angiogram. K469E polymorphism was investigated in 309 patients with CHD, includ-ing155 patients with MI, and compared with 150 healthy subjects without CHD as the control group. Finally, G241R and K469R polymorphisms were assessed concurrently in 300 patients with CHD including 152 patients with MI and 140 healthy normal subjects without coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: Although the frequency of GR and RR genotypes were higher in the control group compared to the CHD patients, the difference was not statistically significant (7.09% vs. 5.6% and 1.4% vs. 0%, p=0.27and p=0.24, re-spectively). Despite the higher frequency of KK genotype in the CHD group, the differ-ence was not significant (29.1% vs. 24.6%, p=0.62). KKGG genotype was more frequent in the CHD group, however the difference was not significant (31.1% vs. 27.3%, p=0.66). Conclusion: No strong relation was found between G241R and K469E polymorphisms and occurrence of CHD and MI in the studied population from Fars province, Iran.

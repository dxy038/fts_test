This paper presents a survey of existing techniques for traffic characterization in telecommunication networks with the objective of providing a framework for further research. Traffic characterization is an important aspect that has to be considered for efficient network management and control. This is specially important for the emerging B-ISDN, because the variety of sources and the nature of the multimedia information that these networks carry complicate the resource allocation problem. This paper provides a brief discussion and a list of traffic characterization references

Objective
jective of this study was to use the newly synthesized poly(quaternary ammonium salt) (PQAS)-containing polyacid to formulate the light-curable glass-ionomer cements and study the effect of the PQAS on the compressive strength and antibacterial activity of the formed cements.
als and methods
nctional QAS and their constructed PQAS were synthesized, characterized and formulated into the experimental high-strength cements. Compressive strength (CS) and Streptococcus mutans viability were used to evaluate the mechanical strength and antibacterial activity of the cements. Fuji II LC cement was used as control. The specimens were conditioned in distilled water at 37 Â°C for 24 h prior to testing. The effects of the substitute chain length, loading as well as grafting ratio of the QAS and aging on CS and S. mutans viability were investigated.
s
e PQAS-containing cements showed a significant antibacterial activity, accompanying with an initial CS reduction. The effects of the chain length, loading and grafting ratio of the QAS were significant. Increasing chain length, loading, grafting ratio significantly enhanced antibacterial activity but reduced the initial CS. Under the same substitute chain length, the cements containing QAS bromide were found to be more antibacterial than those containing QAS chloride although the CS values of the cements were not statistically different from each other, suggesting that we can use QAS bromide directly without converting bromide to chloride. The experimental cement showed less CS reduction and higher antibacterial activity than Fuji II LC. The long-term aging study suggests that the cements may have a long-lasting antibacterial function.
sions
tudy developed a novel antibacterial glass-ionomer cement. Within the limitations of this study, it appears that the experimental cement is a clinically attractive dental restorative due to its high mechanical strength and antibacterial function.

Abstract
Objective: The goal of this study is to compare the effects of the modified dynamic and conventional static splints on pain and functional abilities of hand in women with De Quervain syndrome 
Material and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was performed on 24 women (age between 35-55) with De‌‌ Quervain syndrome in orthotics and Prosthetics department of Tehran university of medical sciences, during 2012-2013. Patients assigned randomly in two groups using static and dynamic thumb spica splints for two weeks.. Persian  version  of  DASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand)  questionnaire was  used  to  assess  the  pain and functional abilities of hand and VAS(visual analogue scale) was used to assess patient’s satisfaction of splint.  Data were analyzed using SPSS-17 by independent and paired t-test.
Result: In both groups, an improvement in pain level and performance capabilities was observed after using the splints. In comparison of pain level and performance capability, there is no significant difference between two groups after using splints (p>0.05).. On the other side, it was determined that the satisfaction level of the patients who had used dynamic splint was higher. 
Conclusion: Inserting a joint to the static thumb spica leads to patient's satisfaction and relief and also there is no significant difference  between two groups in pain recovery and abilities improvement.

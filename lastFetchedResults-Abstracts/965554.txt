Background and Objective: Currently, as an important trace element, is increasingly used in drug delivery, hyperthermia and diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The main objective of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity effects of nanostructure iron oxide and to implement the findings for its safe applications.
Materials and Methods: Urea coated iron oxide nanorods were modified with fetal bovine serum. Toxicity at doses of 100 and 400?g/ml in modified nanorods vs. non-modified nanorods was tested via (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Toxicity of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated iron oxide nanorods with identical doses were compared with Urea coated iron oxide nanorods by MTT assay. All the procedures were carried out on L929 cell lines for periods of 24 and 48 h.
Results: Cells on exposure to modified nanorods had more viability than non-modified ones at all doses and all the time points. PEG coated in comparison to urea coated nanorods exhibiteda higher cell death at all doses and all time points.
Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, unmodified nanorods in comparison to modified ones demonstrated more toxicity which appears to stem from formation of a protein ring called Hard Corona around these nanorods in a protein contained media. Protein rings are not formed in the modified nanorods. Meanwhile, the reduction of apoptosis in urea coated nanorods as compared with PEG, verifies that the type of coating depending on size is effective on cellular toxicity.

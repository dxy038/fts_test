Objective: Spasticity and contracture in the flexor muscles of the wrist may occur after stroke, especially in which early recovery did not appear. Splints are prescribed to reduce spasticity and to prevent contracture after stroke. Although there is a few research in this field. The aim of our study is to examine the impact of the Extension splint on function of upper extremity in chronic stroke patients. 
Material & Methods: Fourteen patients with chronic cerebrovascular accident participated in the study according to inclusion criteria, and after initial assessments they were given splints. Goniometry was the method of assessing range of motion, and Fugl-Meyer assessment was used to examine the function of upper extremity, and spasticity of upper limb was evaluated by Modified Ashworth Scale. Patients were instructed to wear the extension splints for 1 month and 2 hours a day and all night (6 to 8 hours). Assessments were repeated at the end of the first, third and fourth weeks. 
Results: The difference of wrist`s spasticity level and passive range of motion of wrist were significant before and after 1 month (P < 0.001, P=0.01). And other items did not significantly improve (P > 0.05). Also a result indicates that there are improvements in all outcomes to some extent and these results were not significantly different in the outcomes.
Conclusion: The results show that 1-month using of this splint with 30-degrees of wrist extension reduces spasticity and improves passive wrist range of motion. But changes in other outcomes were not significant.

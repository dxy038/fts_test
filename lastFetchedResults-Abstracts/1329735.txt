Background and Objective: Co-authorship on writing articles is one of the indicators of reliability in scientific articles. Due to the lack of information regarding to the rate of participation of the authors of articles in the "Iranian Journal of Pathology" this research with the aim of the survey of collaborative coefficients of article authors in this Journal from 2006 to 2012 was performed.
Materials and Methods: A cross sectional research was performed. The study population consisted of all articles published in the years studied. Totally 288 printed articles in terms of number and sexes of authors were recognized and collaborative coefficient between the authors was calculated. The data were collected by referring to the original articles and Excel software was used for data entry. Data analysis with using descriptive statistics and collaborative coefficient formula was worked out.
Results: Altogether 288 articles had 1078 authors. Average number of authors was 3.75 Â± 1.65 and the maximum number of articles was written by three authors. Collaborative coefficient in 2008 was seen as higher ratio of collaboration between article authors. Average collaborative coefficient of authors in research years was 0.69 which demonstrated willingness to cooperate between authors of this journal.
Conclusion: It seems that the collaboration between article authors of pathology is high. However considering that participation lead to increase the quality of research activities, encourage researchers to collaborate in scientific research can enhance the quality of articles.

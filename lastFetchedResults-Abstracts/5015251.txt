The objective of this work is to develop a platform supporting the secure and quick deployment of distributed medical applications creating an environment and associated tools for the usage of medical personnel in their interaction with patients. We adopted the electronic health record (EHR) architecture blueprint as developed by Canada Health Infoway, which proposes Web service technology as an integration platform. We developed this environment for distributed and collaborative use by selected medical personnel using the combination of communication networks such as the Ca*net 4, ORION, NETERAnet and NCIT*net. This intelligent platform will enable the mining, retrieval, modification, management, and synchronization of various databases used by doctors in handling data in regards to patients and their illnesses, and last but not least, will examine and provide the security requirements associated with Web services in the context of e-Health applications.

A new subjective and objective integrated approach is put forward that may be used to determine attribute weights in fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (FMADM) problems in this paper. This approach of determining weights retains the merits of both subjective and objective approaches. It can determine integrated weights of attribute by solving fuzzy entropy mathematical models automatically, and at the same time this approach take into consideration the decision makerÂ´s subjective preferences by using fuzzy AHP method. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

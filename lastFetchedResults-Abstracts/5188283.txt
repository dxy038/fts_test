The ESF CoRe is a conceptual reference model for industrial software production. By focusing on the communication requirements of large-scale software facilities, the ESF CoRe provides an objective and systematic way to describe existing systems and processes, and to compare and evaluate proposed enhancements and alternatives. The ESF CoRe consists of a consistent conceptual basis for examining all aspects of software factory life and a practical method for profiling factory elements and operations. The CoRe vocabulary supports communication among managers and engineers, product vendors and researchers. The ESF CoRe model integrates technical and organizational issues, and places project management concerns in the context of long-term capital planning. The CoRe proposes software factory communication layers, out of which three factory communication protocols, two interfaces, and a classification scheme for software factory elements are defined

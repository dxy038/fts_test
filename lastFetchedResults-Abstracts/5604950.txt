In this paper, a multi-objective units start-up optimization strategy is proposed. In the proposed model, the economic factors during generator start-up are introduced into the conventional units start-up objective function. Furthermore, the system frequency characteristics as well as generator ramp constraints are considered during analysis. The greedy algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. Finally, the case studies are carried out based on the IEEE 30-bus test system as benchmark to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model and method.

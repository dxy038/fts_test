The objective of this study was to improve measurement methods and detection sensitivity in partial discharges. Using a capacitive foil sensor to detect abnormal signals is normally applied to diagnose partial discharges in ultra high voltage sites. This study applied an FSA (Foil Sensor Array) method that improved the structural characteristics of a conventional foil sensor. Furthermore, this study verified detection characteristics in partial discharges by comparing the proposed FSA method and the conventional foil sensor applied method then performed a test to establish a measurement standard not established at present. The test was applied to the middle of a junction box with the same conditions in actual sites in which detection sensitivity was compared using an oscilloscope (TDS3014B, Tektronix) and spectrum analyzer (PPD-01, Furukawa). According to the results of the test, the proposed FSA method represented better detection sensitivities than the conventional foil sensor applied method in which signal detection sensitivity increased with the number of arrayed sensors, simultaneously. Finally, assembly and disassembly of sensors was simple.

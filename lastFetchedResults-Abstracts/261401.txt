The cycling representer algorithm of Xu and Daley (2000) is a weak constraint four-dimensional
variational data assimilation algorithm. It was successfully applied to a one-dimensional transport
problem and was able to successfully extract the signal from noisy and sparse observations.
The algorithm, however, has not previously been applied to a multivariate, multidimensional
system with dynamic instability. The algorithm is also very computationally demanding and
awaits considerable enhancement in computer power before being practical for operational
forecast models.We have two objectives in this paper. The first is to apply the cycling representer
algorithm to a two-dimensional, multivariate barotropically unstable linear shallow water
system. The second objective is to formulate and test an accelerated representer algorithm that
is much more computationally tractable than the cycling representer algorithm itself. A linear
shallow water system with a barotropically unstable basic state was used as a test bed to
conduct data assimilation experiments. The evolution of a ‘neutral’ eastward-propagating singular
vector was selected as the ‘truth’, against which all data assimilation experiments were to
be evaluated. The results indicated that the cycling representer algorithm was capable of providing
satisfying state estimates for a multivariate, multidimensional system. The results from the
accelerated representer algorithm were very encouraging because it is sufficiently computationally
tractable to be used on present day multi-processor machines for operational
applications.

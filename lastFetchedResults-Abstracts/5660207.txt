Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) developed by Cable Labs has been adopted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as a draft Recommendation in ITU-T and ITU-R. Nortel Networks has been spearheading the BWA standards efforts in ITU-R, ITU-T and in IEEE 802.16, that uses the cable modem specifications as a basis for wireless access systems in order to achieve economies of scale. The cable modem technical parameters for physical and media access control layers have been adapted to the wireless environment to support a bidirectional wireless access system for interactive services. This paper presents the BWA (broadband wireless acceas) physical and media access control (MAC) standardization efforts that are in progress in IEEE 802.16 in the 10-40 GHz band, with a focus on the LMDS (local multipoint distribution service) band in the U.S. Nortel Networks is leading the effort to standardize the DOCSIS based parameters for PHY/MAC standardization in IEEE 802.16. The services that will be supported by BWA systems include fast Internet access (supporting both IP and ATM traffic), video and interactive television. The key features of this BWA system are multiple quality of service (QoS) support, dynamic service management, support of real-time services along with cryptographic authentication of the users for protection against theft of service.

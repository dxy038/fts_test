Method: Aqueous extracts with or without polysaccharide and polysaccharide extract were prepared from Artemisia argyi. The anti-hepatoma activity of them at different concentrations was evaluated in vitro with an inverted microscope for observing live cells and with MTT test. Results: After 24h~48h treatment of HepG2 cells, the aqueous extracts with/without polysaccharide led to the morphological change of the cell, the significant decrease of OD values, compared with control group (P&lt;;0.01), and ultimately the death of the cell. Polysaccharide extract at the concentrations of 17.5 mg(Artemisia argyi)/mL and 35 mg(Artemisia argyi)/mL lead to no morphological change, while the slight decrease of OD values, compared with control group (P&gt;;0.05), and at the concentrations of 70 mg(Artemisia argyi)/mL lead to cell contractility, and decrease of OD values, compared with control group (P&lt;;0.05). Cone I us ion : The aqueous extracts with/without polysaccharide could lead to the shrinkage of hepatocellular carcinoma cell, block cell proliferation and induce cell death. The polysaccharide extract had weaker anti-hepatoma activity and could inhibit cell proliferation. Screening the components or leading compounds with anti-cancer activity from the aqueous extract without polysaccharide of Artemisia argyi is under the way.

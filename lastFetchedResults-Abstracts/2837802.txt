The most important control objective in a control system analysis is to design an optimal controller for the known process model. In the present analysis, various PID controllers based on different tuning methods have been designed for a selected Second Order plus Dead Time model. Also different algorithms of PID controllers such as parallel, parallel with derivative filter, series, series with derivative filter and cascade form are implemented. The steady state and dynamic characteristics of closed loop responses for the designed controllers are compared and analyzed.

Background and objective Hydrogen peroxide solution with stabilized formulation with oligodynamic amounts of silver ion (trade mark: Nanosil) recently became a popular disinfectant for fruits vegetables surfaces medical instruments and so on. Methods This study was based on determining efficiency of hydrogen peroxide-silver ion complex in six different concentrations measured through removal of total coli forms from samples taken from Qom wastewater. All six different concentrations of disinfectant were incubated separately with wastewater for one hour. Sample size was 12 and sampling was done weekly. Results In the concentration of 80 and 480 mg/l logarithmic removal value of total coli forms was 1.9 and 4.5 respectively. In CT value 8600(mg/l).min and more the total coli forms effluent standard for surface water discharge and agriculture irrigation was achieved (Iranian environmental protection agency act). Conclusion Use of hydrogen peroxide-silver ion complex as a water and wastewater disinfectant has some benefits such as elimination of hazardous by products measurable residual amount and so on. However its application in wastewater effluent is more costly than other usual disinfectants so it is not economically advisable.

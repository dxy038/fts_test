In conventional DC-DC converters, to realize a larger range of voltage conversion, an extreme duty cycle is needed, this will results in a higher voltage/current stress of the switches and lowering the switching frequency. Though the isolated converter can solve the above problems, its size and cost are improved due to the high-frequency transformer. Then the converter with an Active Floating Charge Landing (AFCL) was proposed to eliminate the drawbacks, and AFCL has been used in Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost converters successfully. In this paper, all the converters with AFCL were analyzed in detail including their principle and characteristics; a bidirectional DC-DC converter with AFCL was proposed and analyzed. Finally, simulation has been done to illustrate the good performance of the proposed topology. The converters with AFCL have a good application prospect in many fields, such as new energy access to power electronic transformer (PET), energy storage system and so on.

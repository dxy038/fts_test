By using the method of Lyapunov function and analysis technique, a model for bidirectional associative memory with impulsive is studied. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and uniformly stability of a unique equilibrium solution . We can see that impulses do contribute to systempsilas uniformly stability. This stability property is independent of the stability of continuous-time BAM model.

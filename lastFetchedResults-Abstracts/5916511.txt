This paper analyzes the different types of test escape with the final objective to propose a solution to minimize some of the test escapes. Using a simple example of short defect in the context of Boolean testing, it is first demonstrated that the defect behavior depends on unpredictable parameters. It is shown that a defect may be detectable with a vector but for a given domain of the unpredictable parameter called the Detection Domain. Using the concept of Detection Domain, 3 different types of test escape are identified. It is then demonstrated that one type of test escape can be minimized using `Improved fault modelsÂ´

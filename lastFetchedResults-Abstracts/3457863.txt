A time-honored method of judging the quality of track structure is known popularly as "seat-of-the-pants" judgment. While this method is both frequently and skillfully practiced, it is not wholly satisfactory in that evaluation is based on subjective response. Consequently, determination of what must be done to improve the quality of the ride is not entirely an objective process. Track measuring cars provide a much clearer indication of what is off-standard in a section of track but give little indication of which variables are the most crucial to the production of a good ride. An approach which is being employed in an attempt to bridge the gap between the track geometry and the quality of ride obtained on a given track section is described. Some preliminary results and conclusions are presented.

Limited data exist about the production of extruded linseed as a feed ingredient in farm animal nutrition. The objective of this study was to produce and evaluate extruded linseed mixed with alfalfa hay, pistachio byproducts, and sugar beet pulp or corn grain in different proportions of linseed: alfalfa hay: pistachio byproducts at ratios of 70:15:15, 70:20:10, 70:10:20, and 80:10:10 for quality parameters and in situ rumen Dry Matter (DM) degradability. Using a completely randomized design, the treatment containing alfalfa hay had higher Extrusion Effectiveness (EE), Water Holding Capacity (WHC), and Angle of Repose (AR), but lower Oil Loss (OL) and Bulk Density (BD) than other treatments (Plt  0.05). There were no differences among extruded linseed products with different ratios of linseed: alfalfa: pistachio byproducts for EE, WHC, and AR (Pgt  0.05). The treatment with an 80:10:10 ratio had the highest OL among all treatments and the treatment with a 70:15:15 ratio had lower BD than the others (Plt  0.05). The DM degradability parameters of extruded products was affected by the absorbents and the treatment containing alfalfa hay had higher potential DM degradability than other treatments (Plt  0.05). In conclusion, extruded treatment with alfalfa hay had the highest EE, oil retention capacity and potential rumen DM degradability compared to other treatments. In addition, extruded linseed product with an 80:10:10 ratio of linseed: alfalfa hay: pistachio byproducts had higher OL than the other ratios.

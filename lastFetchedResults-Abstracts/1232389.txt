The composite under investigation consists of an elastoplastic matrix reinforced by elastic particles or weakened by pores. The material forming the matrix is pressure-sensitive. The Drucker–Prager yield criterion and a one-parameter non-associated flow rule are employed to formulate the yield behavior of the matrix. The objective of this work is to estimate the effective elastoplastic behavior of the composite under isotropic tensile and compressive loadings. To achieve this objective, the composite sphere assemblage model of Hashin [Z. Hashin, The elastic moduli of heterogeneous materials, ASME J. Appl. Mech. 29 (1962) 143–150] is used. Exact solutions are thus derived as estimations for the effective secant and tangent bulk moduli of the composite. The effects of the loading modes and phase properties on the effective elastoplastic behavior of the composite are analytically and numerically evaluated.

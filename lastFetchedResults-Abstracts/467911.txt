OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and feasibility of sequential polar body removal and analysis for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of mendelian disorders. STUDY DESIGN: Three couples with risk factors for cystic fibrosis had preimplantation genetic diagnosis with the use of sequential polar body analysis. After stimulation, oocytes were harvested and the first polar bodies were removed and analyzed on the day of aspiration. The following day, after fertilization, the second polar bodies were aspirated. Only embryos known to have inherited the normal maternal allele were transferred. RESULTS: All three couples had successful pregnancies resulting in the births of unaffected infants. CONCLUSIONS: Preimplantation diagnosis with the use of sequential polar body removal is feasible and can prevent the establishment of genetically abnormal pregnancies for couples at risk.

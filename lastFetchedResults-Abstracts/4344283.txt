We present the concept, fabrication, simulation, and experimental result of a field emission RF MEMS device based on SOI technology. The objective of this project is to enable RF filtering by means of a mechanical resonator. Current results include: (1) successful demonstration of the field emission effect on a reference device between silicon tips at &#8764;5 &#956;m gap distance below 2&#215;10<sup>-8</sup> torr high vacuum environment; and (2) sacrificial release of the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation device with integrated micro-oscillator.

Background/Aims: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) may be active against hepatitis B virus (HBV). The objective of the study was to assess the tolerability, activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of three dose levels (0.03 μg/kg b.w., n=15; 0.25 μg/kg b.w., n=15; 0.50 μg/kg b.w., n=16) of recombinant human (rHu) IL-12 given s.c. once a week for 12 consecutive weeks.
Methods: Forty-six patients with chronic hepatitis B, HBV DNA positivity and aminotransferase elevation were included in a multicenter prospective randomized phase I/II study.
Results: Compared with the baseline, HBV DNA levels had decreased significantly at the end of rHuIL-12 treatment and after the 12-week follow-up period (p<0.001). The response to rHuIL-12 treatment was dose-dependent: at the end of the study HBV DNA clearance was greater in patients treated with 0.50 μg/kg b.w. (25%) or with 0.25 μg/kg b.w. (13%) compared with those given 0.03 μg/kg b.w. (7%). Moreover, HBeAg became undetectable at the end of follow-up in five of the patients given the 0.25 μg/kg (2/15) or the 0.50 μg/kg (3/16) dose. The drug pharmacology showed that IL-12 had an estimated half-life of 30 h with levels remaining detectable for more than 48 h after rHuIL-12 administration. The serum levels of IL-12, interferon-γ, IL-10, neopterin and β2-microglobulin as well as the area under the curve (AUC) were rHuIL-12 dose-related. Side effects were observed more frequently with higher doses, including moderate decreases in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts; three patients withdrew prematurely from treatment. The local reaction observed at the injection site was unrelated to the drug dose. Only one patient showed detectable antibody levels to rHuIL-12 without clinical impact.
Conclusions: Treatment with rHuIL-12 at the doses investigated is safe and tolerable, and appears to be active against HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

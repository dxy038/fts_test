Objective: To validate the ethnotherapeutic claim of the traditionally used plant Jasminum auriculatum (J. auriculatum) in skin diseases, by evaluating its wound healing potential along with its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties  so as to understand their role in wound healing. Materials and Methods: Excision and incision wound models were used to evaluate the wound healing activity on albino rats. The wound healing potential was assessed by measuring rate of wound contraction, epithelialization period, hydroxyproline content, skin breaking strength and histopathological  parameters. Reference standard drug was Nitrofurazone ointment. The antioxidant activity was determined using 2, 2diphenyl1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. The antimicrobial activity was determined by agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration by serial dilution method. Results: Higher rate of wound contraction (83.66±0.50% on 15th day), decrease in the period of epithelialization (17.83±1.6days), higher skin breaking strength (170.71±1.52g), higher collagen content and favourable histopathological changes revealed that topical application of ointment containing successive ethanolic extract (S.E.E) of J. auriculatum leaves has the most potent wound healing ability compared to control group in both  the models studied.  The DPPH radical scavenging activity of successive ethanolic extract was found to be 33.39µg/ml. Successive ethanolic extract was found to be most effective against Pseudomonas auregenosa having a zone of inhibition 16.65±0.6mm and the minimum inhibitory concentration was 0.78mg/ml. Conclusion: The data of this study indicate that successive ethanolic extract of the leaves exhibit potent wound healing, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. This justifies the ethnomedicinal use of plant for the treatment of wound and microbial infections.

In this paper an innovative two-dimensional to three-dimensional mapping of the Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images is proposed. This mapping allows to drastically reduce the time required by doctor to analyze the acquired data, and consequently permits to overcome one of the most serious limitation of the WCE procedure. This can be done by exploiting the intrinsic redundancy that is produced by the mechanism of image capturing along a line, where, the captured images share a portion of overlapped information that can be exploited to enhance and augment the final resolution. This final objective is not achieved by using higher resolution video sensor, which would require more sophisticated hardware, but by post-processing the already captured images. Thus allowing to improve the WCE performance while satisfying the strict constraints on the WCE hardware. Finally, it is worth reporting that this technique can be adopted in variety of applications that require information extraction from a series of images captured along a line.

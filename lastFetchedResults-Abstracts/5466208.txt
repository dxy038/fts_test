Responding to the Green Transportation requirement for urbanization nowadays, a new set of 3E criteria, which takes into account efficiency, economy and environment effects, to evaluate intersections operational traffic status is proposed first in this paper. Then, we establish an AHP-based evaluation architecture for intersections with multi-level and multi-objective functions, on the basis of the classification of traffic status. Using a typical control model and traffic data of an real intersection in Beijing, we validate above architecture on Paramics simulation platform.

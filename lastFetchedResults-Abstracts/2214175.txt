The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of continuous extrusion forming (Conform process) of AZ31 magnesium alloy. The results indicate that continuous extrusion forming can refine the structure, improve the degree of the structure homogeneity and change the crystal orientation of basal plane and hence enhance the ductility but decrease tensile strength at room temperature. The fracture mechanisms of the material prepared by Conform process change from the mixture of ductile and brittle to the full dimpled rupture compared with the conventional extrudate.

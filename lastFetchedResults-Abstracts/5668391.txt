A ranging algorithm to the underwater target signal is introduced based on the waveguide invariant with a single-element hydrophone. The method can obtain the object source range by the location of the guide source and the hidden periodicity of the frequencies getting from the signal processing to the guide source acoustic field and the objective source signal acoustic field using a hydrophone. The method neednÂ´t know the ocean environment and acoustic field mode. The simulation results show that it can get the accurate ranging for the broad band source, and have the higher positioning accuracy and the strong adaptability.

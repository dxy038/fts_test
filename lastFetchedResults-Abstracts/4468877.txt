An approximate model matching problem is presented in which the objective is to achieve, via dynamic state feedback, a nonlinear closed-loop system possessing a family of linearizations about constant operating points that matches a prescribed family of linear models from a transfer function viewpoint. A necessary and sufficient solvability condition is derived and an algebraic feedback law construction is provided using an extension of SilvermanÂ´s structure algorithm to the case of parametrized families of linear systems

This paper aims at non contact measurement of liquid density using ultrasonic transducers. The approach is based on the travel time of ultrasonic wave through medium from transmitter to receiver. Lab VIEW platform is used to calculate the travel time of ultrasonic wave between the transmitters to receiver. N1 Elvis is used for real time implementation. Results show that the proposed system has fulfilled its objective.

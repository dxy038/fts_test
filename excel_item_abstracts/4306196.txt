In this paper, we investigate a combined source-channel diversity scheme for image transmission through wireless channels with flat fading and noise. The proposed scheme combines the multiple descriptor coding (MDC) and space-time block coding (STBC) techniques to achieve diversity at both source and channel. In the proposed scheme, the input image is coded using multiple descriptor transform coding (MDTC) approach and transmitted using multiple transmit and receive antennas (two transmit antennas and one receive antenna). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared to the single descriptor scheme. Experimental results indicate that there is an overall improvement in the end-to-end system performance.

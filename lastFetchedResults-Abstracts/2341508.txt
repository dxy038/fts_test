Objective
Friedreichâ€™s ataxia is the most common form of hereditary ataxia with autosomal
recessive pattern. More than 96% of patients are homozygous for GAA repeat
extension on both alleles in the first intron of FXN gene and the remaining
patients have been shown to be heterozygous for a GAA extension in one allele
and point mutation in other allele.
Materials & Methods
In this study, exons of 1, 2, 3, and 5 of frataxin gene were searched by single
strand conformation polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSCP) in
5 patients with GAA extension in one allele. For detection of exact mutation,
samples with band shifts were sent for DNA sequencing.
Results
Three novel point mutations were found in patients heterozygous for the GAA
repeat expansion, p.S81A, p.Y123D, and p.S192C.
Conclusion
Our results showed that these point mutations in one allele with GAA extension
in another allele are associated with FRDA signs. Thus, these results emphasize
the importance of performing molecular genetic analysis for point mutations in
FRDA patients.

Sliding probe methods are designed for the in situ electrical property characterization of individual one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures by eliminating the contact resistance between the fixed-end support and the specimen. The key to achieve a high resolution is to keep a constant resistance between the other end of the specimen contacting to the sliding probe. To achieve this objective, we have developed several important techniques including multipoint continuous sliding, flexible probes, and specimen-shape adapting based on nanorobotic manipulation inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). With a copper-nanowire-tipped probe, we have shown that a flexible probe facilitates the contact force control. The adapting of the shape of a probe tip is significant for keeping a constant contact area between the probe and the specimen. This can be implemented by using a soft probe or a tip with a shape resembling the profile of the specimen. Here we show that by flowing copper from a nanotube probe against the specimen, it is possible to make a well adapted shape of the tip to the specimen after the copper cooled down. By avoiding stick-slip motion and controlling the contact force and area, it will be possible to keep a constant contact resistance between the sliding probe and the specimen, hence significantly improve the measurement resolution. Sliding probe methods are an in situ technique characterized by higher resolution and simplicity in setup as compared with conventional two- and four-terminal methods, respectively. Furthermore, it is superior for local property characterization, which is of particular interest for hetero-structured nanomaterials and defect detection.

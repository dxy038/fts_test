Beginning in 1974, a program of structured experimental and theoretical research has led to a compact, physics-based description of the GaAs FET which forms the nucleus of a collection of CAD tools for MMIC (monolithic microwave IC) design. The objective of physics-based CAD is to allow circuit designers and foundry operators to account properly for the likely effects of process variations in advance of MMIC fabrication, and to offer a diagnostic capability to help detect the origin of failures when chips are out-of-specification.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

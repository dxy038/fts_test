An optimal conductor gradation procedure for radial distribution feeders is proposed in this paper. Models to represent feeder cost, energy loss cost and voltage regulation as a function of conductor cross-section and an objective function for optimizing the conductor cross-section have been formulated. The problem has been posed as a multistage decision dynamic programming problem, and the optimal conductor cross- sections for the fender segments are obtained by solving the same. The proposed method takes into account the non-uniform distribution of loads along the length of the feeders and also the maximum permissible voltage drop along a feeder. Further, the method takes into account the load growth in future years of the plan period. The results of the design of a typical radial feeder using thp proposed method are presented and discussed.

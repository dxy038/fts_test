In this paper, we consider three types of computer-based systems that are employed individually and in pairs to achieve learning objectives: computer-supported learning systems, collaborative systems, and immersive presence systems. When these systems are integrated together, higher-order learning objectives that have typically required co-located interactions can be supported in a distributed fashion. The objective of this work is to report on educational uses of the intersection of these three different types of systems in the combination space we refer to as computer supported collaborative learning requiring immersive presence (CSCLIP). Educational uses of CSCLIP technology and their features are identified. We then provide a discussion and comparison of the features common to CSCLIP systems. Within this discussion, we develop the criteria necessary for comparison of current CSCLIPs and some key requirements of implementation of future CSCLIPs.

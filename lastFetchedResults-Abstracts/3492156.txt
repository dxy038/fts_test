A Gaussian approximation (GA) is commonly used to predict the performance of optical receivers. This is invariably the case if these incorporate superlattice avalanche photodiodes (SAPDs) since a complete statistical description of the avalanche process associated with these advanced detectors has not been reported when residual hole ionisation is present. The authorsÂ´ objective is to present a more rigorous methodology for assessing the performance of these receivers thereby enabling a realistic assessment of the usefulness of the GA to be obtained. A numerical technique based on a discrete ionisation model is used to evaluate the gain moment generating function (MGF) for SAPDs taking into account the influence of both electron and hole ionisation. The MGF of the effective gain associated with detector dark current, generated in the various stages, is also determined using the same approach

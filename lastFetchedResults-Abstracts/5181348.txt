This paper describes the assessment and evaluation of experiments with active learning techniques performed in upper division computer science classes at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). In spite of the traditional views of computer science as an individualistic subject matter that attracts introverted, nonsocial students, the authors used active learning techniques in their classrooms for several semesters with encouraging results. In addition to an improved attitude and stated increased satisfaction, studentsÂ´ test results seemed to show increased comprehension and improved critical reasoning abilities. However, the authors felt the need to further evaluate their experiments for a more objective assessment. As an initial step, the authors conducted a survey of CSUN graduates, now working professionals. The goal of the survey was to determine how well the active learning experiments met the objectives of improved critical analysis abilities that were needed on their jobs, as well as improved communication and collaboration skills.

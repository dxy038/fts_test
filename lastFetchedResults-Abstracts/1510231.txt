Nearly 40 herbicides, commonly used for barley, were selected for analysis in soils of this crop. The primary objective was to develop a multiresidue method taking into account that herbicides belonged to different chemical families. Some preliminary experiments with different solvents in combination with water, acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide, were developed in order to design the predefined region covered by the orthogonal array design used for optimization. Final extracts were splitted in two aliquots, one of them was directly analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and the other one was derivatized before the acidic analyte analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data generated in the preliminary experiments, in order to clarify the relationships among the different variables studied. According to the obtained results, the following variables were selected: solvent type and ratio, amount of acetic acid and extraction time. The statistical analysis revealed that all the factors were significant being the most important, the type and ratio of solvent for basic and neutral herbicides and the acetic acid percentage for acid herbicides. The final optimized method consisted of shaking previously wet soil samples for 30 min with 30 ml of acetone acidified with 1% acetic acid. Method validation was evaluated following the EU guidelines.

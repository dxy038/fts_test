This article presents recent achievements and trends in high-speed indoor visible light communication (VLC) research. We address potential applications and future visions for the VLC technology, where transport of information is &#8220;piggybacked&#8221; on the original lighting function of LED-based lamps. To mature this technology and transfer it into practice, our recent research is focused on real-time implementation and trials. For the first time, a bidirectional real-time VLC prototype achieving data rates of up to 500 Mb/s is presented. This system paves the way for future real world applications. Finally, we discuss the remaining technical challenges as well as the research outlook in the field of high-speed VLC systems.

Wireless sensor network coverage to a large extent depends on the deployment of wireless sensor networks. We propose in this work an approach based on an optimized artificial fish-swarm algorithm for wireless sensor networks deployment optimization scheme in a wireless sensor network which is composed of fixed sensor nodes and some mobile sensor nodes. The OAFSA (Optimized Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm) inherits the foraging and rear behavior of artificial fish in AFSA (Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm), and optimizes the capacity of finding maximal objective function value. The simulation results show that our approach works better than the AFSA does in wireless sensor network coverage, which improves the network performance.

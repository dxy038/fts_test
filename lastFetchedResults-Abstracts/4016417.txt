The active power line conditioner (APLC) is considered to be a very efficient type of active power filter that compensates the voltage waveform distortion caused by nonlinear loads in power systems. A new approach is based on a previously presented two-level algorithm, the three-phase optimal harmonic power flow (TOHPF), to investigate the determination of locations and sizes of three-phase (3&#966;) APLCs. The objective is to minimise the new APLC investment cost, the 3&#966; voltage distortion, and the system 3&#966; MW losses while satisfying the 3&#966; power flow equations, 3&#966; harmonic power flow equations, 3&#966; security constraints, and the harmonic standard. The master level of TOHPF determines the compensator/tap settings and the new APLC locations/sizes; the slave level of TOHPF includes subproblems which involve cases of fundamental and harmonic frequencies separately. Test results for an 18-bus distribution system show the applicability of the proposed method

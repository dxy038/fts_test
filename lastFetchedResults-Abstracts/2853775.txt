A Sybil attack can inject many forged identities (called Sybils) to subvert a target system. Because of the severe damage that Sybil attacks can cause to a wide range of networking applications, there has been a proliferation of Sybil defense schemes. Of particular attention are those that explore the online social networks (OSNs) of users in a victim system in different ways. Unfortunately, while effective Sybil defense solutions are urgently needed, it is unclear how effective these OSN-based solutions are under different contexts. For example, all current approaches have focused on a common, classical scenario where it is difficult for an attacker to link Sybils with honest users and create attack edges; however, researchers have found recently that a modern scenario also becomes typical where an attacker can employ simple strategies to obtain many attack edges. In this work we analyze the state of OSN-based Sybil defenses. Our objective is not to design yet another solution, but rather to thoroughly analyze, measure, and compare how well or inadequate the well-known existing OSN-based approaches perform under both the classical scenario and the modern scenario. Although these approaches mostly perform well under the classical scenario, we find that under the modern scenario they are vulnerable to Sybil attacks. As shown in our quantitative analysis, very often a Sybil only needs a handful of attack edges to disguise itself as a benign node, and there is only a limited success in tolerating Sybils. Our study further points to capabilities a new solution must possess; in particular, in defense against Sybils under the modern scenario, we anticipate a new approach that enriches the structure of a social graph with more information about the relations between its users can work more effectively.

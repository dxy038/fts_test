Introduction & Objective: Active lifestyle and regular physical activity have a great impact on improving the health and metabolic control in diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting physical activity and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic women referred to the Diabetes Research Center of Hamadan based on Trans-Theoretical Model (TTM). 
Material & Methods: 114 women with type 2 diabetes participated in this cross- sectional study. Data were collected from International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the TTM Questionnaire, using interviews with patients. The data was analyzed by ANOVA test. 
Results: The findings showed that Glycosilated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) mean in patients was 7.74Â±1.75. According to IPAQ results, 64.9% of participants had low, 29.8 % moderate, and 5.3% high intensity physical activity. Stages of change constructs were significantly associated with cognitive and behavioral processes of change and self- efficacy (P < 0.05). Also decisional balance construct was found to be significantly associated with behavioral change and self-efficacy (P < 0.05) but not to be associated with cognitive processes (P > 0.05). Self-efficacy associated with cognitive, behavioral processes of change and decisional balance (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Results showed that the use of Trans-Theoretical Model can predict physical activity behavior and metabolic control in diabetic patients.

Water pollution caused by chemical materials in different forms such as chemical bombs, terrorist attacks, and reluctant events is one of the main concerns of human societies. Chemical pollutions can permeate into surface waters because of the release of pollutions on the ground or rainfall in the time of air pollution. The main objective of this study is to model the surface water pollution reaching its maximum level after entering the chemical pollution. In this study, diffusion of chemical pollution caused by phosgene oxime (blister agent) in all areas alongside to Kan River and the reverse flood area of the west of Tehran is modeled using ArcGIS and SWMM softwares. Based on the results, the maximum density of pollution depends on the return period of rainfall, the pollution density, and type and slope of the ground. Also, the time to reach the maximum pollution is almost constant between 3 to 4 hours.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess whether legislative action influenced the role of obstetrician-gynecologists as primary care physicians. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study was performed on the basis of a questionnaire sent to 410 obstetrician-gynecologists and 27 medical directors of managed-care organizations. RESULTS: Of 67% of obstetrician-gynecologists and 96% of medical directors who responded, there was agreement as to the content of primary care, but a minority (38%) of obstetrician-gynecologists identified themselves as primary care providers. A minority of medical directors (35%) felt that obstetrician-gynecologists should serve in that role. Both obstetrician-gynecologists and medical directors felt that legislation had little impact. CONCLUSION: The reticence of obstetrician-gynecologists to assume a major role in primary care appears to be the result of an uneasiness with accepting a more comprehensive role in patient management and gatekeeping. They appear comfortable with the more traditional roles but feel that training and experience has not prepared them well for the management of more complex medical problems.

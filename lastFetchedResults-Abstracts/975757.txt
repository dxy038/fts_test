Double-I built-up sections have been used extensively in Iran, according to
previous versions of Iranian building codes. Despite recent developments in steel moment
connections, based on studies for I-beam to H-shaped column connections, there are
few documents available for I-beam to double-I built-up column connections. Recent
studies have revealed that connections with double-I built-up columns exhibit dierent
behavior compared to connections with H-shaped columns. Due to excessive out-of-plane
deformations of the cover plate in non-retrotted moment connections, they have semi-rigid
behavior. The objective of this study is to build on previous studies and to investigate strain
distribution patterns and load transfer mechanisms in the retrotted I-beam to double-I
built-up column connections using plates and T-stieners. In this paper, both horizontal
and vertical elements of the T-stieners were modied and studied. Analytical models
were designed and analyzed under cyclic and monotonic loadings. Three dierent indices
were computed in the connection region in order to assess the local failure potential and the
moment-rotation hysteretic curves were employed to evaluate the seismic performance of the
connections. With the proposed congurations, strain is uniformly distributed within the
critical elements. Moreover, excessive deformation of the column cover plate is eliminated

This paper is an application of the constructal method to the discovery of the optimal distribution of discrete heat sources cooled by laminar natural convection. The global objective is to maximize the global conductance between the wall and the fluid, or to minimize the hot-spot temperatures when the total heat generation rate and global system dimensions are specified. Two scenarios are investigated: (i) a large number of small heat sources mounted on a vertical wall facing a fluid reservoir, and (ii) a small number of finite-size heat sources mounted on the inside of the side wall of a two-dimensional enclosure. It is shown that the optimal distribution is not uniform (the sources are not equidistant), and that as the Rayleigh number increases the heat sources placed near the tip of a boundary layer should have zero spacings. In both (i) and (ii), the optimal configuration of the wall with discrete sources is generated by the pursuit of maximal global performance subject to global constraints.

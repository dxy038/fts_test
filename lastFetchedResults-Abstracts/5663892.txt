Research into the Transform Domain Communication System (TDCS) has been conducted for over a decade. The objective of the TDCS is to provide a secure digital communications architecture that can adaptively avoid interference in the frequency spectrum and transmit signals with a low probability of detection or intercept. Because of the adaptive, coexistent nature of TDCS signaling, the TDCS waveform is a candidate for use in cognitive radio-based software defined radios, and is within the framework for spectrally modulated, spectrally encoded signaling. A realization of TDCS in hardware now provides the means by which experimental bit error performance results can be compared with previously published simulation results. An acoustic channel that is laden with narrowband interference has been considered. The bit error performance of this design has been compared with previously published simulated performance results, and found to be comparable.

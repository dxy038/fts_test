A novel four-quadrant AC-DC reduced matrix converter with high frequency isolation is proposed and analyzed in this paper. This power converter is intended to feed the low-energy correction magnet of a particle accelerator. The selected topology consists of a bidirectional three-phase to one-phase cycloconverter and a bidirectional active rectifier. Main features of this power converter are the ability to regenerate energy back to the utility, unity power factor at the mains and high-frequency isolation. The size and weight of the converter is reduced since there are no large reactive components for energy storage and because isolation is achieved through a high-frequency transformer. Experimental and simulated results of a 1.5 kW, 20 kHz prototype proof the performance of the proposed topology.

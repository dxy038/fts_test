Presence of distributed generations (DGs) in the distribution systems have altered the operation of these networks. In this context, distribution network operator (DNO) needs to minimize the operational costs of the network while considering the DGs effect on the other technical parameters of the distribution system such as active and reactive power losses and voltage profile. One means of dealing with such complexity is through the use of a multiobjective operational framework. This paper introduces a novel multiobjective paradigm for operating the distribution networks with distributed generation which includes a wide range of operational issues. This model considers the demand sensitivity with respect to the network price and incorporation of interruptible loads to examine how operational decisions are affected by load elasticity effects. It is also shown that one of the useful features of this model is its objective function sensitivity factors that through the use of them, the location of the prospective distributed generation units can be obtained. The proposed methodology is tested on a 33-bus distribution network.

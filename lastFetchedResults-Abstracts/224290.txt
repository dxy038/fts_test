Comprehensive acoustic measurements on bouncing particles
in a GIS have been carried out. The objective is to find parameters
that both are available from external acoustic measurements
and usable for assessing whether a particle has the potential
to cause an insulation breakdown. The elapsed time between subsequent
particle impacts is a measure of how far into the high-field
region the particle can move, and thus also a measure on criticality.
Secondly, the amplitude of the acoustic signal generated as a
particle impacts the enclosure increases with increasing particle
length and thus also with increasing criticality. Moreover, plotting
these two parameters against each other (‘particle flight the’ vs.
‘signal amplitude at impact’) for a significant number of impacts
(e.g. 1,000) always yields a very characteristic pattern, which in
itselfis a strong indication that the recorded signals are generated
by one, moving particle.

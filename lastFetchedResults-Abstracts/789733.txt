This paper deals with the use of Kriging metamodels in multi-objective engineering design optimization. The metamodel management issue to find the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency is addressed. A comparative analysis of different strategies is conducted for a case study devoted to the design of a component of the injection system for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) engines. The computational results are reported and analyzed for a performance assessment conducted with a data envelopment analysis approach.

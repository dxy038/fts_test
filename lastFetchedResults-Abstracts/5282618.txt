From innovation triggered by user virtual communities to remote surgery and new financial instruments, the creative power of individuals is being fostered at proportions previously unseen. The main driver enabling such a pace of innovation, scientific progress, and user adoption is the Digital Revolution. One consequence is that interrelationships between science, technology and society are increasing in complexity and harder to understand. COST Foresight 2030 is an initiative encompassing a set of events designed to explore a multi-disciplinary vision for a future permeated and shaped by the digital revolution. The first of such events is a brain-storming workshop on Computer and Communication Sciences and Technologies, whose objective is to identify key technologies available by year 2030 and the corresponding benefits for Individuals, Society, and the World, in terms of Devices, Systems, and Services. The outcomes of this workshop will serve as the basis for experts in other scientific areas to envision how challenges in their respective disciplines will be tackled when such technologies are available. Such outcomes will be presented at the IEEE VITAE conference.

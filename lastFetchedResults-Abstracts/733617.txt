Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of a special program for training pediatric residents to address tobacco.
Methods

In a study conducted at the New Jersey Medical School, sixteen pediatric residency training programs in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area were assigned randomly to either special or standard training conditions. All of the residents were invited to take part in the training. Only second- and third-year residents participated in data collection activities (baseline and follow-up tobacco surveys and objective structured clinical examinations [OSCEs]). Baseline data were collected in the spring of 2001, and follow-up data were collected annually through the spring of 2005. Special training consisted of a hybrid website/CD-ROM training program on tobacco, a seminar series, companion intervention material, and clinic mobilization. Standard training residents participated in the seminar series and utilized standard educational and self-help material.
Results

The percent of residents in special training, but not of those in standard training, who provided assistance for modifying environmental tobacco smoke, preventing use, and helping patients and parents stop smoking increased significantly from baseline to year 4 of training, as did the percent who felt prepared to address tobacco. Performance on the OSCEs was consistent with survey outcomes as special training residents revealed mastery of key interviewing and intervention skills.
Conclusion

The special training program, with Solutions for Smoking as its centerpiece, was found to be effective for training pediatric residents to address tobacco, and it may serve as a model for pediatric residency training programs. Ways of improving the program are discussed.

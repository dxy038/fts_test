Coordination control of multiple rigid bodies attracts much attention of researchers due to its wide applications. This paper presents the pose synchronization problem of the moving rigid bodies whose dynamics is described by the group SE(3). The case of bidirectional neighbor graphs with switching interconnection topologies is considered. We design a distributed control law based on relative rotation matrices and relative positions between the neighboring rigid bodies, and show that the SE(3) reaches pose synchronization if and only if the neighbor graphs are infinitely jointly connected, which relaxes the theoretical results in the existing literature.

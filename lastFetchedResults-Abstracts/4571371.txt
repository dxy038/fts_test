In this paper a switching force/position control system of robot manipulator by using fuzzy logic is proposed. This system contains a fuzzy control system. The first aim of this paper is achievement of a good end-effector trajectory tracking performance when the manipulator moves in free space. The second is considering the system behavior when contact forces arise. The objective is to control the contact force and enable the robot actively accommodate the reactive force of environment instead of rejecting it. Performance of the force control schemes for different values of compliant environment are considered and analyzed.

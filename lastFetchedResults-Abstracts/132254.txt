Introduction: The effect of washing the irradiated skin during radiation therapy for breast cancer is uncertain. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of washing with water and mild soap on the breast cancer patients' skin.
Materials and Methods: 108 patients under treatment for breast cancer were randomized, prior to receiving chest radiation therapy, into two groups: (I) no wash group during radiation therapy (54 patients); and (2) washing group with water and soap during radiation therapy (54 patients). Acute skin toxicity grade was recorded according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) for each patient every week during radiation therapy and 1 month after the end of radiation therapy. Symptoms related to skin toxicity (itching, burning, pain) were recorded as none, mild, moderate and severe according to the patient complaint.
Results: In the non- washing group, the following maximum acute toxicity scores were observed: grade 0=0%, grade 1-33%, grade 2=61%, grade 3=5% and grade 4=0%. For the washing group, the scores were: grade 0=3.7%, grade 1=64%, grade 2=24%, grade 3=5%, grade 4=1.8%. Moist desquamation was seen in 38.8% of non-washing and 25.9% of washing group, the median score of itching, burning, pain was lower in washing group and was statistically significant. No washing, dose of radiation and weight were associated with acute skin toxicity that were statistically significant.
Conclusion: Washing the irradiated skin during the course of radiation therapy for breast cancer doesn't trigger increased skin toxicity; on the contrary, it decreases the skin toxicity and should not be avoided.

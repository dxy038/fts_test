In the gesture interface, the technology for detecting positions and the number of nails from the hand image will become an important factor. The intention of this research by our research group is to distinguish between nails and regions that have similar colors to nails, by extracting regions with a color hue similar to nails first and then identifying the nails. However, no features for a distinction between nails and non-nail regions have been reported. The objective of this research is to verify that the main feature is the distribution density of the pixels that present the strong nail color.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that occurs in humans and several animal species, including cattle, pigs, and horses, and it has a worldwide distribution. In equids, leptospirosis manifests through recurrent uveitis and abortion and other reproductive disorders. The objective of the present study was to investigate the epidemiological situation of Leptospira spp. infection in equids from the Brejo Paraibano microregion in the northeast of Brazil, that is, to assess the prevalence of and identify the major risk factors for infection. For this purpose, blood samples were taken from 257 equids (204 horses, 46 mules, and 7 donkeys), and a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used as serological analysis, with 24 serovars of Leptospira spp. as antigens. Antibodies were observed in 16.2% of horses, 13.0% of mules, and 28.6% of donkeys. Animals between the ages of 2.5 and 11 years had a risk of infection 0.4 times lower than those younger than 2.5 years old (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.90). Further studies are needed to identify potential wild reservoirs and the main routes of infections.

Quality of Experience (QoE) has taken a center stage in the performance evaluation of multimedia delivery technologies. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) system is the latest generation of wireless cellular technology expected to deliver higher data rates and meet the burgeoning data demand. With the projected dominant share of video services in mobile traffic, providing satisfactory QoE to video users is a key objective for LTE system design. In this paper, we present a QoE-based evaluation methodology to assess the LTE system video capacity in terms of the number of unicast video consumers that can be simultaneously supported for a given target QoE. We define and use the notion of rebuffering outage capacity to quantify the video service capacity. Our evaluation further incorporates adaptive streaming, a promising technology for video delivery over wireless, and presents its consequent QoE-capacity tradeoff. The impact of QoE-based outage criteria is also investigated on the downlink video capacity. Finally, we propose a QoE-aware radio resource management (RRM) framework which allows the network operator to further enhance the video capacity. Our results demonstrate that there is a significant potential to optimize video capacity through QoE awareness both at the application level and radio access network (RAN) level.

The main objective of this paper is to detail the development of a computer assisted virtual laboratory which has been put in place to teach the theoretical and practical aspects of electromagnetics, without physically using the necessary instruments and doing measurements. The virtual laboratory has allowed us to teach electromagnetics in a new and effective way, helping our students master this difficult subject. In particular, virtual experiments have been designed which the students perform before attempting to do the corresponding real experiments. These virtual experiments help the students to appreciate the essential features of an experiment without being confused or distracted by the complications of the real experimental procedures. We believe excellence in teaching can be achieved by developing this innovative way of teaching the laboratory material through a computer based flexible and interactive environment of virtual experiments

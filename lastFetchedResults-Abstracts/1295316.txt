This paper develops a multi-objective optimization model for project portfolio selection taking employee competencies and their evolution into account. The objectives can include economic gains as well as gains expressed in terms of aggregated competence increments according to pre-defined profiles. In order to determine Pareto-optimal solutions, the overall problem is decomposed into a master problem addressing the portfolio selection itself, and a slave problem dealing with a suitable assignment of personnel to the work packages of the selected projects over time. We provide an asymptotic approximation of the problem by a linearized formulation, which allows an efficient and exact solution of the slave problem. For the solution of the master problem, we compare the multi-objective metaheuristics NSGA-II and P-ACO. Experimental results both for synthetically generated test instances and for real-world test instances, based on an application case from the E-Commerce Competence Center Austria, are presented.

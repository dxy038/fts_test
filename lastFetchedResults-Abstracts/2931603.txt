The aim of this work is to introduce an approach to solve linear multicommodity transportation problem with fuzzy objective function, fuzzy constraints and fuzzy coefficients. By combining methods of Zimmermann and Delgado, and Verdegay and Vila, a new model is derived for this class of problem. The fuzzy linear multicommodity transportation model can also be reduced to conventional linear programming problems which can be easily solved by standard algorithms. In addition, an actual example concerning a part of the State of Sao Paulo railway system is presented to show the usefulness of the approach proposed

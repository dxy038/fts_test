The objective of this paper is to introduce further development of a data mining tool, MUSASHI (Mining Utilities and System Architecture for Scalable processing of HIstorical data), for service computing. Recent advances in information systems have allowed us to gather enormous amounts of data on marketing. However, these gathered data have been individually stored at each company, and have never been integrated because of a lack of techniques to analyze the data in an integrated way and to handle the large amount of data efficiently. To address this issue, we are currently investigating a way to provide a data mining platform as a service so that users can apply various data mining techniques to their marketing data with ease and at a low cost. For this purpose, we have developed an ASP platform leveraging distributed computing technology represented by Cloud computing. This paper describes the ASP platform for data mining services and introduces an empirical application of data mining using our platform.

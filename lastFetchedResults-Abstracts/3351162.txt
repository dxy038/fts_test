This paper discusses a number of key issues related to teaching Design for All to undergraduate students and presents an assessment report requested by the Initiative for Design for All in Spain, in collaboration with the Institute for the Elderly and Social Services (IMSERSO), and the ONCE Foundation for the Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities. The objective was to study, discuss and propose the inclusion of Design for All methods and practices in the curricula of undergraduate degrees related to Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, in order to train future professionals able to apply Universal Accessibility principles in their practice of the profession. The flexible and modular structure of the proposed curriculum is described, including the included mandatory and optional modules. The resulting report was presented to the Spanish University Quality Assessment Agency, involved in the updating of the Bachelor degrees in Spain. These recommendations were adopted by several Spanish Universities for their renewed Computer and Telecommunication engineering degrees.

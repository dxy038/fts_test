Objective: The objectives of the management of nasal polyposis are to eliminate or reduce the size of polyps, reestablish nasal breathing, reduce symptoms of rhinitis, restore the sense of smell, and prevent the recurrence of nasal polyps. Local or systemic steroids have been used in the treatment of nasal polyps, but efficacy of combined (local and systemic) steroids in nasal polyposis has been little investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of combined steroid therapy on the symptoms and extent of the disease in patients with nasal polyposis. Methods: Seventeen patients with nasal polyps were treated with combined steroids. Before and after the therapy, polyp size, nasal symptoms, sense of smell, and headache or facial pain were assessed by an established scoring system. Results: After the therapy, symptom scores of all the patients improved. Of the patients, 12% showed a polyp-free nasal cavity, 76% a clear involution of polyps, and 12% no response to the therapy. There were statistically significant differences (P<0.001) for symptom scores and polyp size. Medical ablation of polyps using steroids was not achieved in 88% patients. Conclusion: Steroids can reduce polyp sizes and improve the symptoms, but are inadequate to eradicate the polyps. Surgery still plays a major part in the treatment of the nasal polyposis, but steroids can delay the necessity for surgical intervention.

Objective
To determine if endotracheal tubes (ETTs) that are opened, prepared, and stored in an ED airway cart are prone to bacterial contamination.
Methods
A prospective study conducted in the ED of a level 1 trauma center. A study group of 50 endotracheal tubes were opened, preloaded with a stylet, the cuff checked for integrity by air inflation, and then stored in an ED airway cart. The study group was subdivided into 5 groups of 10 ETTs each, cultured at different time intervals. The ETTs were cultured at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours for the presence of bacterial contamination. The control group consisted of 10 ETTs that were left in their sterile packing in the ED airway cart and then removed at 48 hours and cultured.
Results
In the study group, 7 (14%) ETTs resulted in a positive culture; 43 ETTs cultured negative for bacteria. In the control group, 2 (20%) ETTs cultured positive, the remainder was all negative. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .63). If only clinically significant bacteria are considered, defined as a culture with 5 or more colony-forming units, 3 ETTs in the study group cultured positive; there were no clinically significant bacteria cultured in the control group. Once again, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups, with a P value of .57.
Conclusion
It appears that opening, preparing, and storing ETTs in an ED airway cart for up to 48 hours does not increase the risk of bacterial contamination of the ETTs.

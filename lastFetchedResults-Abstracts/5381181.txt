In this paper, the topology optimization model for the continuum structure was constructed. The model had the minimized weight as the objective function subjected to the buckling constraints and displacement constraints. Based on the Taylor expansion and the filtering function, the objective function and the constraints were approximately expressed as an explicit function. The optimization model was translated into a dual programming and solved by the sequence second-order programming. All the corresponding numerical procedures are developed by the PCL toolkit in the MSC. Patran/Nastran software platform. Numerical examples show that this method can solve the topology optimization problem of continuum structures with the buckling and displacement constraints efficiently and give more reasonable structural topologies.

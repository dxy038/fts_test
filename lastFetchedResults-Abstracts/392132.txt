Objective: We compared the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) of healthy volunteers and of two groups (group A, conservatively treated; and group B, with gentamicin or surgically treated) of Meniere's disease (MD) patients to determine whether the head autorotation test (HART) can reveal abnormality of the VOR and whether the HART can be applied in evaluation of MD. Methods: The gain, phase, asymmetry, and the highest frequency band reached was evaluated with the HART in the frequency range of 1â€“5 Hz. The caloric responses and posturography results were also determined. Results: The mean gain was lower for the both groups of MD patients than for the controls. In the MD patients the phase difference was shorter and the asymmetry was greater than in the controls. Only 58% (group A) and 36% (group B) of the MD patients reached the frequency band of 4 Hz, and 33% (group A) and 19% (group B) reached 5 Hz. The respective percentages for the controls were 97 and 77%. Of the 25 MD patients (group B) 72% had abnormal HART results. Among the group A of MD patients the HART (50%) was more sensitive to VOR abnormality than the caloric test (10%) was. For aggressively treated MD patients a decrease in gain at 2 and 3 Hz in the HART correlated with abnormal caloric test results. Increased body sway in posturography correlated with the pathological results in the HART. Conclusion: The HART is a complementary method for evaluating the natural frequency range of the VOR, and evaluation of MD patients may benefit from combined results of the caloric test and HART.

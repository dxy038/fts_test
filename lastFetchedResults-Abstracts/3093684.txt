Biomedical protocols based on thermal infrared images often require effective image registration. Algorithms specifically designed for registration of thermal images are hardly available and use of algorithms designed for other imaging techniques may result poorly reliable. In fact, registration algorithms developed for other biomedical images often require rigid-body assumption or limited range for intensity values. Such assumption may not be applicable for human body thermal images. Therefore, we present here an adaptation of a field-warp based method as a possible solution for thermal image registration. The method was applied for registering images taken from an experimental protocol aimed at comparing total body skin temperature distribution in natural or altered posture. The method appears to be effective into providing a reliable tool for objective intra and inter individual skin temperature distribution comparisons

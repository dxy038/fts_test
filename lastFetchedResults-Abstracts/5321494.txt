When there is limited objective failure data, a method for developing the possibility distribution by subjective assignment strategies is put forward, which is illustrated by the lifetime data from fatigue reliability tests. Based on a limited fatigue life data, a study on reliability analysis of 40 axle-steel is presented, by constructing the possibility distribution function of the locomotive axle steel fatigue life as well as calculating the possibility reliability of fatigue strength at any one time of the axle under a certain stress level.

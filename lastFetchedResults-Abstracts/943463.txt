Abstract 
Introduction:Ventricular dyssynchrony is frequently encountered in heart failure patients, especially in those with wide QRS intervals. Some surveys have shown thatCardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) could be a promising technique with benefits.
Objective: Comparison of left ventricular function before and after CRT implantation inheart failure patients.
Materials and methods: In a cross-sectional survey, 65consecutive heart failure patients, who were candidates for cardiac resynchronization were enrolled and evaluated for Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume (LVESV), Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume (LVEDV) and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) before CRT. Echocardiographic evaluations were done3-6 months after CRT. The response to CRT was defined as the decrease of LVESV ? 15%.
Results: The study group included 27 women (41.5%) and 38 men (58.5%), with a mean (± SD) age of 62 ±12 years. Totally, 46 (70.8%) responded to CRT and 19 (29.2%) were nonresponsive, so that the mean LVEF (%) significantly increased and LVESV and LVEDV decreased significantly after CRT in responsive ones (P=0.0001, P=0.001 and p=0.0001, respectively).
Conclusion:The present survey showed the improvement of echocardiographic findingin heart failurepatients with wide QRS after CRT.

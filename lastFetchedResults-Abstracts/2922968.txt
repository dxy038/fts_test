A general approach is proposed to the problem of realizing a recursive digital display network capable of simulating in real time the perceptively relevant characteristics of the reverberation decay in a room. The analysis/synthesis method presented makes it possible to imitate the late reverberation of a given room by optimizing some of the reverberant filterÂ´s parameters. The analysis phase is based on a time-frequency representation of the energy decay, computed from an impulse response measured in the room. The energy decay relief is proposed as a spectral development of the integrated energy decay curve introduced by Schroeder. Its three-dimensional representation allows perceptively relevant visual comparison of two room responses (measured or artificial) and accurate calculation of some widely used objective criteria of room acoustic quality

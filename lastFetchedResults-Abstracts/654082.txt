The environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are fascinating areas of scientific research. Our objective in this paper is to provide a brief, focussed overview of what constitutes a POP, highlight the harmful effects they may have on biota, make some comments on their environmental sources and analysis, their environmental trends and processes, their movement through foodchains and highlight some important regional-and global-scale environmental transport issues. Finally, we offer some personal thoughts on some current and future areas of scientific enquiry on POPs.

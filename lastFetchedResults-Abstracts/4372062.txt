Following the works of J.O. Raiman and M. Shirley (1991), J. Lang (1996), and S. McIlraith and R. Reiter (1992), the paper propose a novel approach of "test" and "test plan" concepts for hypothesis discrimination generated during the abductive step of the diagnosis reasoning process. The originality of the presented approach consists of the fact that we discuss the test concept and test properties for a relational diagnosis problem and in particular for the possibilistic context. Our objective is constructing an "optimal" test plan to discriminate the hypothesis space

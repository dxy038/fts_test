To reroute the broken-down path in the event of transmission-line failure, it is necessary to construct a spare path network. This paper proposes an algorithm for the design of efficient spare path networks. This algorithm is a heuristic algorithm used to achieve near-optimization by repeating the movement to objective-function-value constant orientation and the value decrease orientation. Performance evaluation results show that the solution obtained with the proposed method is very close to the LP (linear programming) solution

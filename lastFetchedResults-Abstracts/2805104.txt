This paper presents an innovative electronic-magnetic gearing motor. The motor is designed and tested. This electronic-magnetic gearing (EMG) assembles parallel, serial or hybrid connections of stator windings into gears to accommodate the different speed and torque demands in the drive cycle. The objective of EMG is to increase the maximum speed and maximum torque range of the motor. A 1.5kw prototype EMG motor was built up and test on a test rig. The test result proves the theory of EMG is correct and it has a large potential on the energy efficiency improvement of electric vehicles (EVs).

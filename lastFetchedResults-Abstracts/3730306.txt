A yield maximization methodology, called the linearized performance penalty (LPP) method, that uses a penalty function as its objective is introduced. The penalty function formulation allows the integration of the goals of circuit performance improvement and yield maximization. It is computationally efficient since the objective function can be evaluated with the computational effort of about one circuit simulation. Also, a simple, yet effective, method to account for operating point variations is introduced. The effectiveness of the LPP method is illustrated through several circuit examples

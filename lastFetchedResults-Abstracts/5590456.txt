Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 is one of the common diseases and found worldwide. The cause of this abnormality is due to lack of insulin production. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), product of the glucagon gene is one of the prime components which stimulates the &#946; cell proliferation and inhibits &#946; cell death. DiPeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP IV) acts as protease degrading incretins which stimulates the secretion of insulin for normalizing sugar level. Therefore, inhibiting DPP IV would decrease incertins degradation and in turn will stimulate the insulin secretion. The objective of this study was to search for an inhibitor with minimum or no harmful effects. The sequence coding for DPP IV was retrieved and remodeled insilico and DOCKING studies found that methyl amine is one of potential inhibitors of DPP IV. The insilico study for activity and drug likeness of the ligand molecule found it to be non mutagenic, non irritant, non tumerogenic and have no effect on fertility.

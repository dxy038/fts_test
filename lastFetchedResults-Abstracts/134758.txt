Objective: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy of the women and causes death in many patients every year. About 70% of breast surgeries and biopsy taking are not necessary because they yield benign diagnosis. For diagnosing breast masses accurately and specially differentiating benign from malignant tumors without surgery, Triple Test has been introduced.
This project tried to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology of the breast as the most significant element of this test.
Materials and Methods: During a 3 years period, 120 females with the chief complaint of a breast mass being admitted in Mashhad Imam Reza Hospital were subjected to all components of the triple test followed by confirmatory open biopsy. In 100 patients all paraclinical procedures were obtained and the results were available.
Results: FNA cytologic results were classified in three groups as benign, malignant and suspicious for malignancy. Fifty-five patients had benign and 40 had malignant cytology which were confirmed by routine histopathology. From 5 patients with suspicious cytology, 2 yielded malignancy and 3 benignancy by tissue confirmation.
Conclusion: FNA cytology of the breast is a well tolerated, simple, safe, accurate, cost effective, noninvasive, less complicated procedure and operable in office practice for diagnosing breast lesions, with an accuracy of about 100%, specially when it is employed in association with physical exam and mammography in the triple test.
Based on these results we strongly recommend application of this method as an ideal procedure for breast diagnosis and elimination of open biopsy in our country, which certainly will result in expenses reduction.

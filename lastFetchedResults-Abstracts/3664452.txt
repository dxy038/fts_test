Dispatching decisions concerned with transmission system security can be improved by the use of objective functions. The method is based on combining a simplified form of the real power flow equations with linear objective functions to answer questions related to system security. Linear programming is used to consecutively solve two linearized flow models, one conservative and one lossy, where the solution of the first serves as input to the second. The accuracy and practicality of the method are illustrated in actual case studies.

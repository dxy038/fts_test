In this paper, a high-conversion-ratio bidirectional dc-dc converter with coupled inductor is proposed. In the boost mode, two capacitors are parallel charged and series discharged by the coupled inductor. Thus, high step-up voltage gain can be achieved with an appropriate duty ratio. The voltage stress on the main switch is reduced by a passive clamp circuit. Therefore, the low resistance RDS(ON) of the main switch can be adopted to reduce conduction loss. In the buck mode, two capacitors are series charged and parallel discharged by the coupled inductor. The bidirectional converter can have high step-down gain. Aside from that, all of the switches achieve zero voltage-switching turn-on, and the switching loss can be improved. Due to two active clamp circuits, the energy of the leakage inductor of the coupled inductor is recycled. The efficiency can be further improved. The operating principle and the steady-state analyses of the voltage gain are discussed. Finally, a 24-V-input-voltage, 400-V-output-voltage, and 200-W-output-power prototype circuit is implemented in the laboratory to verify the performance.

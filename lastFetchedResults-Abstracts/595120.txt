Objective: The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of granisetron versus ondansetron and Propofol for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patient undergoing day case gynaecological laproscopy under general anaesthesia.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in Alquwayiyah General Hospital and Riyadh Medical Complex. K.S.A, over and period of six months, from January 2004 to June 2004 (both Months inclusive). 120 adult non pregnant female patients (18-40 yrs of age) of ASA I-II scheduled for diagnostic gynaecological laproscopy were included in this study. Patients with severe systemic or endocrine disease who had predisposing factors for delayed gastric emptying, such as diabetes, cholecystitis or neuromuscular disorders were excluded.Results: This study was conducted in 120 patients classified into six groups (20 patients each). The first group received granisetron, the second group ondansetron, the third, fourth and fifth group received propofol in different does. The last group received normal saline as placebo ( control group). Treatment with either granisetron (group-I) and ondansetron (group-II) resulted in significant lower incidence of nausea and vomiting over 12 hours observation postoperatively compared with other group. However granisetron resulted in significant in lower incidence than ondansteron.Conclusion: It is concluded that preoperative prophylactic administration of intravenous granisetron 40 ug/kg is effective and superior to ondansetron and propofol in preventing nausea and vomiting after gynaecological laproscopic surgical procedures.

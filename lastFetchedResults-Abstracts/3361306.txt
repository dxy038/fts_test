To form a beam toward the direction of a desired signal against steering vector mismatch, proposed is a robust beamformer based on magnitude response constraint and steering vector correction. First, the direction of the desired signal is restricted in a possible angular sector. An initial antenna array weight is obtained by adding a magnitude response constraint. Then, the presumed steering vector can be corrected iteratively based on a new objective function and constraint condition. Finally, an optimal weight and corrected steering vector can be obtained at the same time when the iterative process is accomplished. It is shown that both the mean square error of the corrected steering vector and the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the proposed method outperform traditional beamformers.

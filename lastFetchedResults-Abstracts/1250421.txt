In this work, a multiple grid algorithm is coupled to an explicit finite difference scheme for solving the two-dimensional open channel flow equations. The objective is to show that this formulation can be used to partly alleviate the primary limitation of using an explicit scheme, in which the choice of time step is limited by the CFL stability condition. In a multiple grid approach, for a fixed time level the equations are solved for at nodes across different spatial domains. This ensures maximum propagation of the disturbance with minimum computational effort. Focus in this work is laid equally both on its formulation and its reliability for simulating two-dimensional transient open channel flows.

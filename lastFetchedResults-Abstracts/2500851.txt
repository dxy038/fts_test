<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this study was to provide norms of Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) for undergraduate women in Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> ‎Undergraduate women (N = 516) completed the EDE-Q, CIA, and the Binge Eating Scale (BES).<br /><strong>Results</strong>: Average score, standard deviation, and percentile rank of EDE-Q and its subscale as well ‎as CIA were reported. In addition, the frequency of key eating disordered behaviors was ‎presented. Both EDE-Q and CIA demonstrated strong internal consistency. In addition to the ‎significant correlation between the EDE-Q and CIA (0.59), they both showed a moderate to ‎strong correlation with the BES (r = 0.33 to 0.61). The EDE-Q and CIA successfully ‎differentiated underweight, normal weight, and overweight women. Moreover, women who ‎reported higher level of restraint or regular binge eating episodes obtained higher score on the ‎CIA than women who did not have such behaviors across the same period.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This study provided ‎preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the Persian version of the EDE-Q and CIA. ‎The obtained norms for the EDE-Q and the CIA are helpful in clinical practice and intercultural ‎studies of eating disorders.‎</p>

The FDTD method and the ray-tracing method are combined to study the characteristic of the wireless link of railway communication system in 900 MHz band. FDTD method is used for computing field in near region where a more realistic high-speed railway environment including the locomotive, antennas, steel rails, earth plane and the conducting wire for power supply, is modeled in detail. The ray-tracing method is used for transformation field from far region to near region. The variations of the output voltage and current of the monopole antenna mounted on locomotive with the train location on railway are given. The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between the incident wave and the output voltage and current with the influence of the complicated high-speed railway environment considered.

The need to use the remote methods of atmosphere sounding to research the features of radiowaves propagation at near-Earth tracks has been formulated in our researches in early 70s. Such conclusion was based on results of experimental research of radiowaves refraction in the atmospheric boundary layer and also on the results of the theoretical development of the radio-meteorological model to calculate the radiowave refraction index in the atmosphere. For using the model it is required to measure the height profiles of temperature and wind speed, and also data on the characteristics of atmospheric turbulence inhomogeneities. In our radiophysical research we have begun to develop methods of remote sounding using acoustic echo-sounders (sodar) and radioacoustic sounding systems (RASS) with the objective of estimating the thermodynamical conditions and turbulence status in the radiowave propagation layer. Some results are considered for utilizing sodar and RASS for the analysis of radar angel-echo in stable state conditions of the atmospheric boundary layer

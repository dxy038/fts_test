Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most important cause of death around the world. C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the indicators of systemic inflammation and is an effective factor in the development of inflammatory response in acute coronary syndrome. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association of quantitative CRP with acute myocardial infarction.
Methods: This case-control study was carried out on 90 patients with diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction as case group and 90 healthy subjects as control group in Birjand Valiasr hospital during 2013. Highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) level was measured. The association of hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk factors was assessed. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test.
Findings: The mean age was 58.6±13.9 and 57.4±15.4 years in the case and control groups, respectively. 70% of the case group and 66.7% of the control group were male. 76 patients (84.4%) in the case group and 56 subjects (62.2%) in the control group had high hs-CRP and the difference was statistically significant. The association of hs-CRP with gender and age was not statistically significant in two groups.  
Conclusion: With regards to the results, there is a relationship between increase in hs-CRP and acute myocardial infarction.

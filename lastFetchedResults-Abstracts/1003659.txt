The curing of net-shaped fiber/resin layups is the common and critical step in the fabrication processes for thermosetting-matrix composite products. Significant improvements in the processing cycle time and cure uniformity may be realized through the use of embedded conductive elements generating internal resistive heating during the process. This paper presents a detailed numerical investigation of the cure process in the presence of embedded resistive heating sources supplementing a conventional external heating schedule. A numerical model, validated with experimental data, is utilized to explore the process over a wide range of resistive heating configurations, and dimensionless groups encompassing process and material parameters. Based on a systematic parametric analysis, feasible operating regimes and optimal embedded heating configurations are identified with the objective of minimizing the fabrication time subject to constraints.

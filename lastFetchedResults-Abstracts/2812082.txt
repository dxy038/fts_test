Increasing growing of electricity demand and environmental issues bring huge incentives to electric vehicles (EVs) market. High penetration of these vehicles leads to some challenges for the future power system. Specifically, utilizing them in an unscheduled manner will result in distribution network technical issues such as reliability issues, congestion and loss enhancement. In this paper, firstly, a probabilistic modeling of EVs´ behavior is achieved. Secondly, reliability-constraint optimum allocation of EVs´ parking lots is proposed. To achieve this purpose, a composite objective function is defined. This function contains three significant distribution network reliability indices and used to allocate parking lots by means of enhancing reliability. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on a standard distribution system for RBTS bus 2.

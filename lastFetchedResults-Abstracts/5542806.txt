Evaluating video Quality of Experience (QoE) on a mobile phone has not yet been studied much. It is common that the data collected through user studies in mobile platform involves high fluctuation of user ratings without obvious reasons related to variation in network level. User disparity, userÂ´s various intermediate or previous experiences, video bitrate, and the objective measure of criticality are a few of the reasons that need to be identified with a well-designed user experiment. We present an experiment procedure to understand better the perceived quality of video in mobile platform. First, we investigate the reliability of the data, and identify unreliable users. Then, we investigate the psychological influence factors of previous experiences on the recent perceived quality known as the memory effect, and the influence of the bitrate on the time it takes for users to react and evaluate the video quality, i.e., user response time.

In this paper we present the results of the project SATIN. SATIN is a co-operative project between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. Its objective is to define and implement a prototype of a service platform that on the one hand is still based on current intelligent network (IN) architectures, while on the other hand it realizes concepts of TINA, thereby making use of modern software technologies. Consequently, the SATIN environment consists of traditional IN components, i.e., IN switches which are connected via a so-called adaptation unit to the TINA-based components realizing the service applications. In addition, motivated by problems of current IN systems, such as those encountered when trying to combine IN components of different vendors or to allow for an interworking between two different IN systems, SATIN aims at developing a service platform that supports interoperability. In the SATIN environment two service platforms are implemented, one at Deutsche Telekom´s side and one at France Telecom´s side. Service applications can be realized in a distributed way as the underlying platforms can interoperate

Now a days, management and control of perishable inventories is important in many units and industrial enterprises. Basically perishable inventory management and control is more complex and challenging than inventories with unlimited lifetime. Hence determining the optimal inventory policies for these products is very important.Â  In this paper, the optimal inventory policy for perishable items given to the a single acceptance sampling plan with destructive testing and inspection errors is adopted .After developing a model for the problem and obtaining the objective function, first an exact solution and a simple and efficient algorithm to find the optimal values is proposed. Then, the model will be validated with a numerical example and senility analysis.

Objective
Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a serious nutritional problem that causes immune dysfunction in elderly people. Probiotic lactic acid bacteria may potentially modify immunity; however, there is little evidence to elucidate the influence of these bacteria on PEM in the elderly.
Methods

The immune modulation effects of lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (La1) were examined in aged mice and aged mice with PEM. Twenty-month-old male 57BL6/n mice (n = 28) were divided into four groups and received the following diet for 14 d: a complete diet (20% protein) without Lal (control) or with Lal or a low-protein diet (5% protein) to induce PEM, with or without La1. All mice were immunized with diphtheria toxin (DT) with alfacalciferol at 7 d and sacrificed 14 d after starting the experimental diets.
Results

Serum albumin concentrations and body weight, both of which were reduced by the low-protein diet, were ameliorated by La1 intake and were the same as in mice receiving the control diet. Anti-DT immunoglobulin (Ig) A in fecal extract was increased by La1 intake in mice receiving the complete and low-protein diets. Serum anti-DT IgA, IgG, splenocyte proliferation, and CD8+ T cells were reduced by the low-protein diet and restored by La1 intake.
Conclusion

La1 enhances intestinal IgA production and helps recover nutritional status and systemic immune responses in aged mice with PEM. It is possible that La1 may contribute to immune system recovery in immunocompromised hosts such as elderly humans with PEM.

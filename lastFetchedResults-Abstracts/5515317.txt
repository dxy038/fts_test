In this work, we derive a blind equalizer that pursues the maximization of an objective function, consisting of the ratio between the square of the mean signal power and the variance of the signal power. The performance of the addressed equalizers is then investigated by focusing on DS/CDMA communication environments in a downlink scenario. In particular, we have evidenced the effectiveness of the presented equalizer in the numerical examples, in terms of robustness against the effect of interference, as well as in terms of convergence rate, in spite of a small amount of extra processing.

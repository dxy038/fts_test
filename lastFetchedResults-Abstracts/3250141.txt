In recent years we have been facing substantial decrease in the number of young people who are interested in study at technical universities, including the branches of electrical and information engineering. One of the promising ways is establishing of close contacts with secondary schools, or even directly with their students. Our objective is to win their interest and motivate them, so that they decide to study technical disciplines. The paper uses an example of a case study to describe possible ways for increasing of secondary studentsÂ´ interest in studying at technical universities and provides some interesting results of their pilot testing.

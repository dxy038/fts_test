The paper presents a novel application of the Particle Swarm Optimization PSO technique to control a low cost dynamic filter/capacitive compensation DFC scheme using real time dynamic error tracking to stabilize an isolated stand alone Wind Energy Conversion Scheme (WECS). The novel Dynamic Filter Capacitor Compensation scheme (DFC) serves as dynamic voltage stabilization regulator for wind energy utilization enhancement. The objective is to track and extract all available power from the wind energy system (WES) and transfer this power to the local isolated electric load. Full power factor correction, maximum utilization and power quality enhancement are validated under different conditions, including load switching, wind velocity excursions and faults.

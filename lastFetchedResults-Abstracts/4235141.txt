And research on the input-output efficiency of E-government is not only responsible for taxpayers, but important to measure the role of E-government in promoting social development. In the analysis of E-government Cost of inputs, it is not comprehensive only to see the explicit cost. We should consider the hidden costs when implementing E-government, including costs of impersonal communication costs, loss of information, the network paralysis and network attacks, which are not only the challenge of E-government, but the challenges of the information age. Similarly, when analysis the output of E-government, not just think the improving administrative efficiency, but take account of the impact of the intangible sense of democracy training for citizens, re-shaping the structure of government, the convenience of administrative supervision, impetus to information industry and so on. On this basis, the paper constructs index system of E-government input-output efficiency to understand the entire effect of E-government development, also builds function to compute the efficiency. In the end the paper puts forward conclusions: it is biased to analyze the benefits of E-government neglecting the specific economic and social environment. We need to focus on the increase of impersonal costs and communication costs by E-government, also new injustice caused by the technical barriers. And the future development tr- nd of E-government is a low-input and high efficiency.

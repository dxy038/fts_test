Tucurui´s hydroelectric power plant, the second largest Brazilian electric plant, is one proper site to deal with bad damping electromechanical oscillations problem, because of its interconnection with two others large electrical systems (CHESF and FURNAS). The most usual way to minimize this problem, increasing power system dynamic stability margins, is to apply power system stabilizers, which are responsible for creating an additional damping signal in the generator excitation system. Tucurui´s power system stabilizers, although fixed-parameter controllers, must be tuned properly to have good performance in any system operating condition. This work objective is to obtain updated linear system models from local signals measured in Tucurui´s generators. System identification techniques, recursive and nonrecursive, have been used to obtain these linear models, that will be used later in fixed-parameter or even adaptive power system stabilizers design.

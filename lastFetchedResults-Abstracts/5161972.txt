This paper presents a supply chain (SC) model at the operational level based on first order hybrid Petri nets (PNs), i.e., PNs that make use of first order fluid approximation. The model addresses the issue of the management strategies that control the material flow and the inventory stocks in the SC. In particular, we apply the standard make-to-stock and make-to-order policies to a SC case study. Suitable inventory control rules manage the logistics, while optimal production rates are chosen according to a given objective function.

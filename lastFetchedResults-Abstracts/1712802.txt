By introducing a cathode lens below or inside the objective lens of a scanning electron microscope, many experiments similar to those typical of the LEEM method can be performed. The conditions for the diffraction of slow electrons are modified by the convergence of the primary beam, and challenges include the necessity of managing the signal species propagating along the optical axis in a direction opposite to that of the primary beam. However, even a simple implementation, providing the integral dark-field signal only, has not only delivered plenty of results in the very low energy range below 50 eV, but the performance in the range of hundreds of eV and units of keV has also been substantially improved. The scanning LEEM method is illustrated using experimental results acquired by additionally employing multichannel detection and detection of transmitted electrons.

In order to fundamentally improve the reconfiguration ability of spacecrafts, reconfigurability should be considered in design stage, and the reconfigurability design method must be involved to guide the system design. The objective of this paper is to construct a reconfigurability design method. First, some basic definitions relating to spacecraft reconfigurability are given. Then, on the basis of function tree, a reconfigurability modeling method is established to describe systemÂ´s configuration characteristics. Quantitative reconfigurability indexes are further presented and a weak link analysis approach is proposed via the model. In addition, considering reliability constraints, an optimal design method of system configuration is given based on the minimal path set of the reconfigurability model. Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated and verified in practical analyzing for spacecraft control system. Results show that the method can realize the system configuration design by synthetically considering components, configuration and reconfiguration strategies, and is suitable for the complex system such as spacecrafts.

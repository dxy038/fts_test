This paper presents an explicit model predictive control approach for a forward dc-dc converter. The objective of the proposed control algorithm is to regulate the output voltage in the case of load variations. We first develop a signal averaged model for the forward dc-dc converter, and then extend it to a hybrid model. The related optimal control problem is presolved offline to construct a lookup table, and the controller searches for the control law online, thus avoiding any online optimization. An additional control loop is proposed to deal with the problem of load and source voltage variations.

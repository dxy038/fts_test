The objective of this research is to develop a methodology which allows the user to validate the decisions of the man in the loop dynamically in real time by reducing type II errors. Case-based reasoning provides a modeling paradigm for designing a system which can aid in the validation process. This paradigm provides for a mechanism to capture cases that can be used in the validation process. A proof of principle demonstration is being developed that operationally validates the decisions made by a military commander in a high resolution simulation. This demonstration will establish the ability of an expert system to operate in real time and assist in the validation process

Background: Precarious employment is a major social determinant of health and health
inequalities with effects beyond the health of workers.
Objective: To investigate the association between precarious employment and sickness absence
in 4 Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
Methods: Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each country on data
from 4186 respondents aged 15–65 years in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden derived
from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey. Sickness absence was based on selfreports
and defined as absence of seven or more day per year. Precarious employment was
operationalized as a multidimensional construct of indicators. Analyses were also conducted
separately for men and women.
Results: The prevalence of sickness absence was lowest in Sweden (18%), and highest in
Finland (28%). 3 precarious employment indicators were positively associated with sickness
absence; the pattern being largely similar in the total sample. In the sex-disaggregated
sample, 5 precarious employment indicators increased the likelihood of sickness absence; the
pattern was heterogeneous, with women generally having significantly higher odds of sickness
absence than men. “Low household income” and “sickness presenteeism” were strong
predictors of sickness absence among both sexes in most of the 4 studied countries. Sickness
absence varied between the Nordic countries in the sex-disaggregated analyses.
Conclusion: Precarious employment indicators predicted sickness absence in the Nordic
countries. Findings emphasize the need to prioritize informed and monitored collective bargaining
for all workers, increase working time flexibility, and improving work conditions.

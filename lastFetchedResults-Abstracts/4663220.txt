Across Europe the opportunity to generate `green energy´ and benefit from Feed In Tariffs (FIT) is creating an environment in which Distributed Generation (DG) is becoming more and more attractive and installation rates in domestic properties is increasing. This paper presents a model that has been developed to investigate the impact on network infrastructures and operation that an increase of DG will have. The HESA (Hybrid Energy System Analysis) simulation tool has been developed to model multiple energy carriers and their networks simultaneously and allows for a `whole system´ examination. This paper will explore possible future socio-technical scenarios that have been developed - transitions pathways. Results show the impact of future programmes on the various distribution level networks´ infrastructures (electricity and gas) when examined under different objective criteria - carbon caps, cost, etc.

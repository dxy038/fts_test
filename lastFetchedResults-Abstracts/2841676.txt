This paper presents the modelling and control of the new step up converter derived from TAB converter. The proposed converter (here named DAB + DAB) has twice the gain of the conventional DAB converter, 4 bidirectional ports, can operate as a high-gain DAB or as an interface between monopolar and bipolar DC grids. Have easy making and operation. Has the potential to be used in microgrids or electric vehicles.

Objective.  (1) Determine the effect of a compressive force on the stability of trochanteric slide osteotomies repaired with a cable repair system or a suturing technique. (2) Develop an approach to surgical decision making for trochanteric repair.

Design. Muscle forces acting on the greater trochanter were experimentally modeled by the application of shear and compressive loads to osteotomized greater trochanters. A repeated measures design was used to compare suture and cable fixation.

Background. The use of cables and wires for trochanteric repair has been associated with a high incidence of acetabular loosening and trochanteric bursitis. With trochanteric slide osteotomies, the vastus lateralis remains attached to the trochanter, which results in a compressive force being generated across the osteotomy and relatively small shear forces. The use of less rigid fixation techniques for trochanteric repair, such as sutures, may reduce the complications of cables and wires.

Methods. Seven cadaveric femora with trochanteric osteotomies were tested sequentially after repair with a cable system and with a suturing technique. A cyclic shear load of constant amplitude was applied while a compressive load was decreased in a stepwise fashion. Migration and cyclic motion of the trochanter were measured, and the coefficient of friction was also determined.

Results. Cyclic motions of the trochanter in both superior and anterior directions were generally less than 0.5 mm and were not significantly different between the cables and sutures at high compressive loads. At low compressive loads, cyclic motion was significantly lower with the cable system.

Conclusions. Compression across the trochanteric slide osteotomy has a significant effect on stability. Cyclic motion of the trochanter is similar for both suture or cable repair of a trochanteric slide with good preservation of soft tissue attachments.

In this paper, an optimal approach to design wideband Tapped-Delay Line(TDL) array antenna is proposed. This approach lets us control the array angular and frequency response over a wide frequency band. To this end, some design restrictions are defined and a multi-objective optimization problem is constructed by putting the individual restrictions together. The optimal weights of the TDL processor are determined through solving this multi-objective problem. A design example is presented to show performance of the proposed method and compare the array response with those previously published in the literature.

This paper presents a multimicroprocessor-based structure for controlling the manipulator motion in Cartesian space. The objective is to investigate the feasibility of implementing hand-based control laws using present day microprocessors. Computational complexity analysis indicates that the control schemes involving full inverse-kinematics and inverse-dynamics computations can be realized using the proposed control structure.

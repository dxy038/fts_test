This paper examines the incorporation of a damage prediction model into the control systems synthesis of an aircraft gas turbine engine, with the objective of extending the life of critical engine components while maintaining the required level of system performance. Turbine blades are used as an example, with the primary modes of damage being high-cycle fatigue and low-cycle thermomechanical fatigue

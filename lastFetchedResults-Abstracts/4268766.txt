In this paper we evaluate the phase stability of an externally modulated 8.8 km analog wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) fiber optic frequency distribution link. The analysis of additive radio frequency (RF) phase noise with and without erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) in the fiber optic link is the main objective of this work. RF phase noise is mainly investigated with power amplifier configuration for 1540, 1545, 1550, 1555, and 1560 nm wavelengths and for different gains of EDFA.

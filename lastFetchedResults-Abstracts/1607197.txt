The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of static magnetic field (0, 25 and 50 mT) and the exposure time (0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes) in Nigella sativa L. seeds germination. The results showed that magnetic field application enhanced seed performance under laboratory germination tests. In these magnetic fields, treatment of N. sativa L. seeds increased significantly the germination, speed of germination, root length, seedling length, seedling fresh and dry weight and vigor index I and II compared to control. Among the various combinations of field strength and duration, 25 mT for 60 minute showed the best results. In germinating seeds, enzyme activities of ?-amylase, dehydrogenase and protease were significantly higher in treated seeds to compared to the controls. The higher enzyme activity in magnetic-field-treated N. sativa seeds could trigger the fast germination and early vigor of seedlings.

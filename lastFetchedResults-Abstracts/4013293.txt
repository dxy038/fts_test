The sensitivity concept is used to quantify the effectiveness of a voltage regulating transformer or regulator used in an AC circuit where the objective is to raise the voltage across a load connected to a source with high source impedance. The sensitivity concept describes the effectiveness of the regulator under a set of conditions and confirms that the device is completely ineffective when the value of the source reactance equals the value of the load resistance

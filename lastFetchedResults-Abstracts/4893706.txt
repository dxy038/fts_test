4D ultrasound has the potential to provide complex temporal information needed for the proper diagnosis of cardiac pathologies. The objective of this study is to demonstrate a potential pipeline for the clinical evaluation of 4D cardiac strain using only 4D (RT3D) ultrasound data. First, 4D cardiac ultrasound data is collected using a Siemens SC2000 Ultrasound machine. Then, the raw Rho-Theta data is down-sampled into Cartesian space, and de-noised using an anisotropic diffusion filter. A mask of the myocardium is semi-automatically segmented, based on which a motion field is extracted using an optical flow algorithm. Finally, the computed strain measurements are overlaid on the original images and the myocardium mask.

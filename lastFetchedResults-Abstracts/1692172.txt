The objective of the present paper is to study the influence of different microstructures on mechanical behavior at the intragranular and macroscopic scales. A new methodology that simulates a realistic 2D microstructure from statistical 2D experimental characterization (grain size distribution, grain shape, texture distribution) is presented and compared with the Voronoi simulation and the experimental microstructure. Finite element simulations using phenomenological constitutive law that takes into account crystallographic microstructure data and grain size effect are presented and results from both microstructure types are compared with the experimental macroscopic response, as well as the in-plane intragranular strain field and its distribution.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the behavior of [0/±45/90]s woven FRP composites under tension, bending, and combined bending/tension loading conditions. First, the mechanical properties of the composite were determined experimentally using the ASTM testing standards. Bending properties were determined using 3-point and 4-point bending tests. The results showed that the woven composites performed better under bending loading than under tension loading. Finally, special test fixtures were designed to facilitate the study of the effect of the combined bending/tension loading. The bending moments were applied using offset shims of various thicknesses placed between the plane of the specimen and the loading axis. At the beginning, the load–strain diagrams at the specimen center showed the domination of bending strains, tension on one surface and compression on the other. With the advance of the loading process, the tension strain dominated and the strain on both sides were almost equal. The failure under combined bending/tension loading was due to the high stresses near the fixture. However, in pure bending, the material failed at the center because of the excessive delamination on the compressive side.

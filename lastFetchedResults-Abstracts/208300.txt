Introduction & Objective: Meningogenic hearing loss remains the most common cause of
acquired postnatal childhood sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss occurs in 6-37% after
meningitis. The object of this study was evaluation of frequency of post meningitic hearing
loss in the patients who hospitalized in the hospitals of Hamadan during 1996-2006. Also we
attended to conclude that routine screening of these patients and detection the cases that need
to early treatment was advocated.
Materials & Metbods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 65 children. All
of them with diagnosis of bacterial meningitis were hospitalized during 1996-2006. They
were tested by P.T.A. and then data were analyzed with spss/l o" version.
Results: Prevalence of hearing loss in meningitic patients was 53.8% that did not show
meaningful statistical difference in aspect of age & sex. Hearing loss in all of the cases were
sensorineural, that 82.8% were bilateral and 17.2% were unilateral. About 76.1% of hearing
loss cases were in frequencies of 4000, 6000, 8000 HZ and 74.6% of hearing loss cases had
hearing threshold between 20-50 db.
Couclusion: Analysis of our data showed that meningitis lead to bilateral sensorineural hearing
loss, often with hearing threshold about 20-50 db and in high frequencies. Routine screening
of postrneningitic children for sensorineural hearing loss is advocated.

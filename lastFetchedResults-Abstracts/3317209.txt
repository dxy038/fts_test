A class of control problems for discrete-event systems is proposed, inspired by applications in the domain of high-tech systems. The control problem asks for controllers which generate control inputs based on the outputs. We formalize the above control problem, whereby the plant behavior is modeled as an input-output relation recognizable by a rational transducer, and the controller is modeled as a sequential map realizable by a Moore-automaton. The control objective is formalized as a language over the alphabet of internal (unobservable) events. We propose a solution to the control problem above by reducing it to a Ramadge-Wonham control problem with partial observations.

This paper discusses the enhancement of a laboratory voltage sag station built specifically to test the response of loads when subjected to voltage sags. The voltage sags generated by this station resemble voltage sags that occur due to transmission system faults on a utility power system. The long term objective of the station is to observe the response of various loads and conclude the appropriate models to represent them during transient conditions. This paper explains the hardware and software used in the voltage sag station and gives examples of diverse load response waveforms.

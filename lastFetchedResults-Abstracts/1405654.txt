Research Objective: This research aims to investigating the factors that influence consumer’s
emotional attachment to the brands and results of this relationship for the companies.
Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based survey was used to test the hypotheses based
on the proposed theoretical model. This paper is based on confirmatory studies that provide a model
that explains the relationship between consumer's emotional attachment, prerequisites and outcomes.
A Structural equation modeling is used to assess the hypothetical links.
Findings: The findings of the structural model confirm the majority of the hypothesized
Relationships. It is found that consumer’s emotional attachment affected by brand experience and
brand attitudes. In contrast, consumer’s satisfaction and brand knowledge have no significant impact
on emotional attachment to the brands. Also, emotional attachment to the Brand is considered as an
important input to brand loyalty, W.O.M and willing to pay extra prices for brand.
Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study include use of a student sample. Student
subjects constitute the sample and the findings are cautiously generalizable to adult populations.
Findings of this study will be useful for senior managers of brands operating in competitive and
complex business-to-business networks. It is recommended that practitioners use brand relationship
measures and develop strategic and tactical initiatives that ensure that consumers are satisfied with the
brand, trust it and feel attached to it.

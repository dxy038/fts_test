A multiobjective optimization technique was proposed for designing combinational logic circuits with 100% functionality and minimized number of gates. The main idea is to consider each output variant as an objective function, which is assigned to an individual. At first, it evolves each individual to satisfy the matches between the outputs produced by corresponding output variant of an encoded circuit and the values specified by the truth table. If an individual meets the above matches, it is further evolved to finish matches of the rest of the output variants. Once an individual is feasible, it is optimized in terms of the number of gates. Experiments are carried to assess the performance of multiobjective simulated annealing (MSA) against some intelligent algorithms and human designs. Results illustrate MSA can design combinational logic circuits efficiently

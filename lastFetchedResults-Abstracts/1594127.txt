There is wide variation in endemic tuberculosis (TB) levels between countries and we seek to identify possible causes of these differences. In this study we present an epidemiological model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to investigate the effects of host genetics and demographic factors on epidemic TB. We discuss the general framework for this approach and present analytical results to identify important parameters affecting steady-state prevalence and incidence rates of TB disease. We then use numerical simulations of our model to observe the effects of a genetically susceptible subpopulation on TB disease dynamics at the population level. Finally, we simulate infection within a genetically heterogeneous population in two demographic settings: India (a typical population with high TB prevalence) and the USA (a typical population with low TB prevalence). Results show that changes in transmission parameters, the fraction of the population genetically susceptible to infection, and demographic factors strongly affect TB prevalence and incidence rates.

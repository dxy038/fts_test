This paper presents a novel method for
damping of low frequency oscillations (LFO) based on
design of a state feedback controller for synchronous
series compensator (SSSC) in a power system. The
design problem of state feedback damping controller is
formulated as an optimization problem to minimize a
time domain based objective function by improved
chaotic–harmony search (IC-HS) technique. Some
modifications in harmony search algorithm are made for
improvement of algorithm convergence. In fact, this
paper focuses on coordinating of SSSC‘s inputs with
together and coordination of power system stabilizer
(PSS) with SSSC‘s inputs to find the best dynamic
response. Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system
has been considered to examine the operation of proposed
controllers. Change of the input power of generator
abruptly, is considered as a disturbance. The effectiveness
of the proposed state feedback controller has been
demonstrated by nonlinear time domain simulation
studies. The results analysis show that the proposed
controller can provide the excellent capability in fast
damping of power system oscillations and improve
greatly the dynamic stability of power system. In
addition, the system performance analysis and surveys
under various operating conditions demonstrate that the
simultaneously coordination of SSSC‘s input controllers
are superior to the PSS based damping controller.

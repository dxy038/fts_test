Emerging high-volume low-power variable speed AC motor drives have the stringent requirements of low cost and compactness. Most low-power, low-performance applications use two-phase induction motors. A new control scheme is proposed for a two-phase inverter to control a two-phase induction motor in this paper. The proposed scheme is simple, cost-effective and reduces inverter switching losses significantly as four out of six switches operate on fundamental frequency. The objective of the work is to provide cost effective inverter which can induce a change from constant speed to variable speed operation in the low-power range.

This paper addresses the problem of mobility in large scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Our objective is to propose an improved routing algorithm based on LEACH protocol when the nodes are mobile. We, firstly, redefine the analytical energy model when nodes are mobile. According to this model, we calculate the corresponding nodesÂ´ energies and the round time length for both mobile single-hop and multi-hop LEACH. Based on these new metrics, our algorithm is not only appropriate but also energy-efficient for mobile WSNs. Simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm improve mobile LEACH and mobile multi-hop LEACH in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption and data throughput.

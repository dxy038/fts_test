A control strategy for a low resonance frequency LCL filter used in the input stage of dc-dc bidirectional boost converters is proposed. The controller consists of a simple PI controller plus a linear filter added in series with the PI integrator term. The modified PI controller achieves the active damping of the LCL filter and allows to arbitrarily place the system closed-loop poles. The proposed strategy only requires the measurement of the source current. This current is the variable to be controlled.

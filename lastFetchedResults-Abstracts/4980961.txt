This paper considers the problems of machining tasks involving removal of material by manufacturing. In such tasks, the tool position and the interaction forces between this tool and the environment, have to be simultaneously controlled. To solve this problem, one needs to have the knowledge of the tool and environment model, beyond the contact characteristics. In this context, it is presented here a simple description of the interaction forces in machining tasks involving removal of material by manufacturing, as well as the parameters of relevance to compute them. The main objective is to develop a novel mathematical model, representative of the interaction forces that arise between the tool and the environment surface. To develop this model a milling task that uses an end mill as tool is considered. Intending to validate this model, experimental results obtained on a milling machine are presented, which shows the expected magnitudes and directions of the interaction forces reached at a specific milling task. These experimental results, in turn, are compared to simulation results of the developed model.

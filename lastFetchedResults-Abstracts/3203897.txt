How to predict icing situation and optimize de-icing decision-making for overhead transmission lines are important and necessary research areas in low latitude and high altitude regions. In this paper, after analyzing and summarizing online monitoring models, process prediction models considering meteorology factors and de-icing decision-making methods for line icing, those problems induced by complexity of icing process are presented such as uncertainty, multi-granular for prediction icing process, and multi-objective, multi-restriction and online decision-making for de-icing. The method based on data-driven are discussed elementarily for assessing icing situation and alarming, de-icing decision-making, and serving for against icing disaster, which can take advantages of mechanism model, mass static history data and dynamic online data.

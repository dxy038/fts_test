Objective: Cerebral palsy is a non progressive disorder in body
posture and movement, due to different etiologies. Different medical
and rehabilitation interventions include massage have been used in these
children. This study has been done to determine the effect of adding
massage to occupational therapy on muscle tone of children with spastic
cerebral palsy.
Materials & Methods: This study was a double blind clinical trial. The
children were recruited from clinics of University of Welfare & Rehabilitation
Sciences. The individuals were divided to intervention and control groups.
The routine rehabilitation techniques were done in 3 months in both groups.
The intervention group received massage for 30 minutes before
rehabilitation. Muscle tonicity was evaluated at the beginning of the study
and 3 months later by Ashworth test. The data analysis was done by parametric
(t test. paired t test) and nonpararnetric (Mann Whitney, Wilcoxon) tests.
Results: Thirteen subjects of case (intervention) group and 14 subjects of
control group were studied. The average age in ca se group and control group
was 49 .5, and 42 .1 months respectively.
There were no statistically significant differences in Tonicity of upper and lower
limbs, trunk and neck between intervention group and control group (bOlOS) .
Conclusion: III general based on the results of this study, adding massage to
occupational therapy had no effect on tonicity of sp astic cerebral palsied
children . Regarding to some effects of massage mentioned in different articles
on physical abilities of children with c.P. as well as executive limitations in this
research, it is not possible to reject the effects of homeopathy on physical
abilities of children with C.P.

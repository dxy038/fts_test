Based on the experience from two predecessor projects, a novel architecture for the detection of vulnerable road users (VRU) is developed. It combines communication and localization, following the function principle of a secondary surveillance radar. Challenges are in the accuracy, the scalability, the bandwidth availability and the limited cost and complexity of the devices. This paper describes the objective of the overall project, the architectural approach of the wireless protocol and the design flow, which has been chosen for the development and is still in progress.

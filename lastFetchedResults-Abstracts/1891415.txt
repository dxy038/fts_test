In this paper student views on reflective groups, set up as an important element of the new Project 2000 course in a Scottish College of Nursing, are reported. A random sample of 19 students were interviewed. While the reflective groups were very popular with students because they provided support, there was little evidence of a linkage between theory and practice. It was clear that the ambitious objective of stimulating reflection-on-action was not attained. Practice certainly was discussed, but it tended to be dominated by dramatic and emotionally charged aspects of care rather than the more frequent routine concerns. There were, however, indications that the original aim of the reflective groups could be achieved if tutors could establish a common understanding of the purpose of the groups and of reflection, and if the practices on which students reflected consisted less of single day visits where the students saw themselves as non-participant outsiders.

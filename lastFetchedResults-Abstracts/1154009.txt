Viscosity is an important characteristic of flow property's and process ability for polymeric materials. A flat die was developed by Maillefer-extrusion, to make rheological characterisations. In this paper, the rheological parameters of the melt are identified through optimisation by a response surface method. The objective is to minimize the differences between the measured pressure obtained in flat die and the pressures computed by one-dimensional finite difference code programme. An objective function is defined as the global relative error obtained through the differences between measured and computed pressures. This objective function is minimised by varying the rheological parameters. For this minimisation, two methods are used, i.e. the local response surface and the global response surface. The rheological parameters permit to calculate the viscosity. Then, we compare this calculated viscosity with an experimental viscosity measured on a capillary rheometer to validate our method.

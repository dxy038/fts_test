Wind and solar energy are highly dynamic, vulnerable and expensive. Thus introduction of controllable loads and an intelligent optimization are necessary for a smart micro-grid (SMG) implementation. Considering reliability of a SMG, an over (under) estimation of resources is not feasible (acceptable). SMG is a multi-objective complex problem considering minimization of capital cost and operation cost as objectives, subject to large number of constraints including net zero emission. Historical wind speed, solar radiation and load profiles over a long period of time are used as inputs of the model and an intelligent energy management system for dispatch of the resources is carried out.

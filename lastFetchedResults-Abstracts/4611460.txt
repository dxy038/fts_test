To further enhance the quality of service (QoS), this paper proposes a novel multi-objective relay-jammer pair selection scheme in wireless cooperative networks where the wireless channels are modeled as first-order finite-state Markov channels (FSMCs). The FSMC model is used to approximate the time variations of the average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), channel power gain, and remaining power of nodes. In addition, the candidate cooperative nodes can be selected as relay and jammer, respectively, to assist the transmission or disturb the eavesdropper. Thus, we can formulate a restless bandit problem to model and analyze how to select the optimal relay-jammer pair according to the desired QoS optimization goals, in terms of energy balance, mitigating error propagation and increasing secrecy capacity (SC). The obtained simulation results show that our proposed schemes outperform the other existing schemes.

A phenomenological model of muscle energy expenditure developed in part I of the paper, is utilized as a physiological cost function to estimate the muscle forces during normal locomotion. The model takes into account muscular behaviors typically observed during human gait, such as submaximal activation, variable muscular contraction conditions and muscular fiber type. The solution of the indeterminate biomechanical problem is obtained by integrating multibody dynamics and the global static optimization technique that considers the whole motion. The results for an application case indicate the important role of muscle groups in coordinating multijoint motion with the objective of minimizing metabolic costs of transport during locomotion.

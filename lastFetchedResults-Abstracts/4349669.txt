In order to search more conveniently, fast and effective methods of experimental analysis for wheat variety regional test is conducted using four different analysis method such as variance analysis, grey multidimensional integrated evaluation, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and similarity-difference analysis method for Henan province regional wheat variety trial results in 2008-2009. Results showed that these four analysis methods have its own merits: the theory of analysis of variance is more mature, but it could only analyze single character, and integrated functions is worse; the remaining three analysis methods are stronger in integrated functions, and more objective and comprehensive to varieties evaluation. Among them, the grey multidimensional integrated evaluation and similarity-difference analysis method are better in differentiability, and more conductive to identify advantages and disadvantages of varieties. In particular with the similarity-difference analysis methods it can process simple and convenient test information, and carry on the comprehensive test of significance of difference for multiple characters. The proposed method provides good tools and means of developing breeding work to help the breeding work.

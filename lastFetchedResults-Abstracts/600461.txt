Objective: In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of pelvic support osteotomy treatment in hip instabilities due to various etiologies. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 21 hips of 20 patients that underwent pelvic support osteotomy between 2005 and 2007. Hip instability was caused by a neglected congenital disloÂ¬cation of the hip in 12 of the patients (13 hips), by septic arthritis in 7 and by an unsuccessful total hip arthroplasty due to infection in the last patient. The mean age of the patients was 22.6 (range: 12 to 34) years. Osteotomy sites were fixed using monolateral external fixators in 11 patients, Ilizarov circular fixators in 8, and locking plates for both hips of the remaining patient. The mean follow-up period was 33.45 (range: 16 to 45) months. Results: The mean Harris score increased from 48.3 preoperatively to 80.1 postoperatively. Preoperative mean limb length discrepancy was 53.3 mm and mean proximal migration was 42.9 mm. Residual limb length discrepancy was reduced to 16 mm after an average lengthening of 63.3. The preoperative Trendelenburg gait disappeared completely in 13 of 21 hips and was improved in 8 hips. Sixteen of the 20 patients (17 hips) expressed satisfaction with the operation. Conclusion: Pelvic support osteotomy is a good treatment option to overcome hip instability as it improves pain and equalizes limb length.

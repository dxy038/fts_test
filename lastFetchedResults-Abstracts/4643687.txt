We consider resource allocation algorithms for distributed cloud systems, which deploy cloud-computing resources that are geographically distributed over a large number of locations in a wide-area network. This distribution of cloud-computing resources over many locations in the network may be done for several reasons, such as to locate resources closer to users, to reduce bandwidth costs, to increase availability, etc. To get the maximum benefit from a distributed cloud system, we need efficient algorithms for resource allocation which minimize communication costs and latency. In this paper, we develop efficient resource allocation algorithms for use in distributed clouds. Our contributions are as follows: Assuming that users specify their resource needs, such as the number of virtual machines needed for a large computational task, we develop an efficient 2-approximation algorithm for the optimal selection of data centers in the distributed cloud. Our objective is to minimize the maximum distance, or latency, between the selected data centers. Next, we consider use of a similar algorithm to select, within each data center, the racks and servers where the requested virtual machines for the task will be located. Since the network inside a data center is structured and typically a tree, we make use of this structure to develop an optimal algorithm for rack and server selection. Finally, we develop a heuristic for partitioning the requested resources for the task amongst the chosen data centers and racks. We use simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms over example distributed cloud systems and find that our algorithms provide significant gains over other simpler allocation algorithms.

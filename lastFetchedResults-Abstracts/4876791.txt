This paper proposes the network structure and service model to deliver new traffic and travel information (TTI) services over terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB) and a bidirectional network. We have newly specified a POI (point-of-interest) and a NWS (news information) application services which are perfectly compatible with TPEG (transport protocol expert group) protocols, and implemented T-DMB based TTI systems including TPEG encoder/decoder and a return-channel server system through CDMA as a bidirectional network. In the real-field environment as verifying the proposed services and systems above, we showed their stability and effectiveness by the excellent results in this paper.

Background: Currently , the standard method in diagnosis of cervix and endometrial disorders, is the use of fractional curettage.
Objective: This study was directed to determine the accuracy of both endocervical brushing and pipelle biopsy with standard fractional D & C.
Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on 45 patients coming for fractional curettage to Qazvin Kosar Hospital during years 2002-2003 . For all the patients in addition to the current fractional curettage method, the endocervical cytobrush specimen and endometrial biopsy by pipelle were also accomplished . Obtained specimens were assessed in single blind method by pathologist.
Findings: Results indicated that endocervical brushing method in compare with standard endocervical curettage had 92.3% sensitivity, 94.7% specificity and 96% positive predictive value. Also obtained specimen of endometrium by pipelle in compare with standard endometrial curettage had 94% sensitivity , 92% specificity and 94% positive predictive value. Conclusion:Endocervical and pipelle biopsy are acceptable substitudes for standard fractional curettage.

This paper describes a new method for scanning the conductivity of a tissue or an organ using a multielectrode impedance probe placed at the center of the region of interest. The long-term objective of the study is the evaluation, using an urethral impedance probe, of the lesion produced by ultrasound ablathermy of localized prostate cancer. The probe consists of electrodes placed at the surface of an insulating cylinder. The injected current passes around the cylinder and spreads in the medium surrounding the probe. This paper presents the theoretical bases of this method, the calculated sensitivity distributions of electrode configurations involving a pair of diametrically opposed electrodes and an application in vitro. The experimental set-up consisted of a water tank and a 16-electrode prototype probe 50 mm in diameter. Data sets were collected in the presence of conductivity perturbations produced by small size insulators or conductors and a 7.5% constant perturbation model. The presented images, although reconstructed using a simple retro-projection algorithm, demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Improvements in data collection and image reconstruction are possible.

In this work, we propose a new approach to improve the performance of speech enhancement technique based on partial differential equations. As we know, the real-world noise is highly random in nature. So we try for reduction of white Gaussian noise. The proposed method was evaluated on several speakers. The subjective and objective results show that the new method highly improves speech enhancement. Comparisons of several methods are reported

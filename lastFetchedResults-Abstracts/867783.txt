Renewable energy continues to be a hot topic in the United States affecting security and sustainability. A
model to create renewable energy portfolio is established using guidelines drawn by Oregonâ€™s Renewable
Portfolio Standard (RPS) legislation with the objective of responding to a 25% of the state electricity
demand by renewable resources in 2025. The fuzzy goal programming model is adaptable to accommodate
changes in energy costs and future advances in technology maturity. It can also take into consideration
the preferences of policy-makers and stakeholders. This model can help to reveal the costs and
benefits of complex decisions regarding renewable energy.

Objective This study examined longitudinal associations
between direct and relational peer victimization (DV/RV)
and self-reported social phobia (SP) among adolescents
from 15 to 17 years of age, controlling for depression and
family socioeconomic covariates.
Methods A total of 3,278 Finnish adolescents with a
mean age of 15.5 years were surveyed at baseline (T1), and
followed up 2 years afterwards (T2) their mean age being
17.6 years. In all, 2,070 adolescents were reached for the
follow-up. Both types of victimization were assessed with
structured questions, SP with the Social Phobia Inventory,
and depression with the 13-item Beck Depression
Inventory. Socioeconomic covariates were assessed with
items from the Life Events Checklist. Frequency of victimization
and SP were assessed at T1 and T2, and incidence
and persistence from T1 to T2. Longitudinal
associations between victimization and SP were examined
with three logistic regression analyses with depression and
socioeconomic covariates controlled for, with SP, DV, and
RV in turn as the dependent endpoint (T2) variables.
Results Among boys a bidirectional association between
DV and SP was found with DV both predicting SP [Odds
Ratio (OR) 2.6] and being predicted by SP (OR 3.9).
Among girls RV predicted SP (OR 2.8), but not vice versa,
while depression in turn predicted DV (OR 4.3).
Conclusions Direct victimization and SP have a bidirectional
association among boys, while among girls RV
increases the risk of subsequent SP.

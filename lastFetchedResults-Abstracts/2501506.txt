Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) refers to making
decision in the presence of multiple and conflicting criteria. Multiobjective
programming method such as multiple objective linear programming
(MOLP) are techniques used to solve such multiple criteria decision
making (MCDM) problems. One of the first interactive procedures
to solve MOLP is step method (STEM).
In this paper we try to improve STEMmethod by introducing the weight
vector of objectives which emphasize that more important objectives be
more closer to ideal one. Therefore the presented method try to increase
the rate of satisfactoriness of the obtained solution. Finally, a numerical
example for illustration of the new method is given to clarify the main
results developed in this paper.

Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) are graph-based modeling tools. FCM can to be used for structuring and supporting decisional processes. Also, FCM allow developing what-if analysis, through the definition of scenarios. It is possible to choose among four activation functions: (1) sigmoid function, (2) hyperbolic tangent function, (3) step function and (4) threshold linear function. The use of each function can provide different alternatives. In this context, the main objective of the present study is to develop a benchmarking analysis among the mentioned functions using a same decisional model. Findings show how the sigmoid function offers significantly greater advantages than the other functions.

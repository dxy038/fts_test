The paper examines how a public wastewater treatment plant balances objectives of cost minimization and pollution prevention. The parameters of the objective function and state equation in an optimal control model are estimated using maximum entropy and time series observations of water quality and expenditures for wastewater treatment. The estimation method does not require restrictions needed by other techniques used to estimate nonlinear, ill-posed problems. The parameter estimates indicate that the treatment plant emphasizes water quality enhancement over cost minimization. Results from the sensitivity analysis show that the plant favors conventional treatment over pollution prevention.

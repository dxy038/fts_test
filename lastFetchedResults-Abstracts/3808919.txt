A beam antenna called the corner, V, or sphenoidal reflector type is described. This antenna consists essentially of a driven radiator or dipole and a reflector constructed of two flat, conducting sheets, or their electrical equivalent, which meet at an angle forming a corner. The radiator is usually located in the plane bisecting the corner angle. The performance of the antenna is analyzed mathematically. Gain curves are presented, showing the effect of antenna-to-corner spacing, corner angle, and losses. Computed and measured directional patterns are in good agreement. Dimensions and design data for practical corner antennas using grid-type reflectors are included. The corner reflector is particularly suitable for use on the ultra-high frequencies and microwaves where structures 1 or 2 wavelengths in maximum over-all dimensions are practical. It is simple in construction and can be readily built to fold into a compact portable unit. Multiunit corner reflectors for higher gain and a bidirectional type for broadcast use are mentioned. The application of a single corner reflector with two off-center radiators to a radio range beacon or an airport runway localizer is discussed.

Recently image fusion has prominent and applicable roles in medical image processing. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) image is applied to display map of blood vessels. In this paper, a new fusion algorithm for DSA serial images based on discrete wavelet transform coefficients is proposed. Our algorithm will be compared for different wavelet transforms and activity criteria for high frequency coefficients. The comparisons are based on the objective evaluation criteria which show measure of noise existence, sharpness and correlation between the fusion result and reference image. Finally, we specify which type of wavelet transform and activity criterion results more informative brain blood vessel map.

The present paper shows the preliminary results of a project that looks for a high power, high efficiency bidirectional step-up converter which could be used as a battery discharge/charge regulator. High efficiency and low mass are the main goals, no galvanic isolation is required and MTBF should be as large as possible. Taking into account all these parameters our proposed solution has been a new topology based on a boost converter with output filter and that couples input and output inductor. The use of a bidirectional converter reduces the mass of the overall charge/discharge subsystem and lowers cost and component count. Stability has been studied theoretically and verified experimentally

Prototyping is the key step in the manufacturing industry to save time and effort. Successful prototyping needs efficient processes and systems that integrate all necessary development steps. dSPACE offers an efficient rapid control prototyping process for any industry dealing with feedback control. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a well-documented procedure of rapid control prototyping of a permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor drive for speed control using dSPACE and Mathworks Simulink. The combined tools of Simulink and dSPACE provide the means for modeling the controller in software and applying it to the actual hardware via a digital signal processing board. This paper presents a comparison and analysis between the simulation results and dSPACE/ actual hardware results, which agreed with each other except for some minor differences.

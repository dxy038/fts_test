A simple adaptive control scheme using neural networks is applied to DC drives through simulation and real-time experimental studies. The primary objective of the paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this control scheme for different operating conditions. The adaptive neural control scheme consists of two parts. One is a neural estimator which is used to estimate the dynamics of the drive system under control. The other is a neural controller which is used to generate a control signal so that a pre-defined system output is regulated to a desired value. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural adaptive control scheme

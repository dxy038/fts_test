The next generation Long Term Evolution (LTE) &amp; LTE-Advanced cellular networks will be equipped with numerous Self-Organizing (SO) functions. These SO functions are being envisioned to be inevitable for technical as well as commercial viability of LTE/LTE-Advanced networks. Therefore, a lot of research effort is currently being channeled to the design of various SO functions. However, given the convoluted and complex interrelationships among cellular system design and operational parameters, a large number of these SO functions are highly susceptible to parametric or logical inter-dependencies. These inter-dependencies can induce various types of conflicts among them, thereby undermining the smooth and optimal network operation. Therefore, an implicit or explicit self-coordination framework is essential, not only to avoid potential objective or parametric conflicts among SO functions, but also to ensure the stable operation of wireless networks. In this paper we present such a self-coordination framework. Our framework builds on the comprehensive identification and classification of potential conflicts that are possible among the major SO functions envisioned by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) so far. This classification is achieved by analyzing network topology mutation, temporal and spatial scopes, parametric dependencies, and logical relations that can affect the operation of SO functions in reality. We also outline a solution approach for a conflict-free implementation of multiple SO functions in LTE/LTE-Advanced networks. Moreover, as an example, we highlight future research challenges for optimum design of Mobility Load Balancing (MLB) and Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO).

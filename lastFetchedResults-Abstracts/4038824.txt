Four control topologies for single-phase uninterruptible power system (UPS) inverters are presented and compared, with the common objective of providing a dynamically stiff, low total harmonic distortion (THD), sinusoidal output voltage. Full-state feedback, full-state command controllers are shown, utilizing both filter inductor current and filter capacitor current feedback to augment output voltage control. All controllers presented include output voltage decoupling in a manner analogous to &#8220;back EMF&#8221; decoupling in DC motor drives. Disturbance input decoupling of the load current and its derivative is presented. An observer-based controller is additionally considered and is shown to be a technically viable, economically attractive option. The accuracy transfer function of the observer estimate is used to evaluate its measurement performance. Comparative disturbance rejection is evaluated by overlaying the dynamic stiffness (inverse of output impedance) frequency response of each controller on a single plot. Experimental results for one controller are presented

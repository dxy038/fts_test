A new conception of flexible calculation that allows us to adjust a sum depending on the available time computation is presented. More specifically, the objective is to obtain a calculation model that makes the processing time/precision more flexible. The addition method is based on carry-select scheme adder and the proposed design uses precalculated data stored in look-up tables, which provide, above all, quality results and systematization in the implementation of low level primitives that set parameters for the processing time. We report an evaluation of the architecture in area, delay and computation error, as well as a suitable implementation in FPGA to validate the design.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Basal FSH levels reflect ovarian response and more formed embryos. We investigated a reliable FSH range to retrieve more oocytes and embryos. <br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> Two hundred patients in ART cycles underwent this study from Apr 2007 to Sep 2008. Patients were divided in three groups based on value of FSH: group A≤8 IU/ml, 8 IU/ml &lt; group B≤10 IU/ml, group C&gt;10 IU/ml and results of ART cycles were compared with each other.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Retrieved and fertilized oocytes and transferred embryos in group A differed significantly in comparison with group B and C (p&lt;0.05), but pregnancy rates in three groups were comparable. <br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In our study the reliable range of FSH level to predict more retrieved oocytes and embryos was ≤8 IU/ml.</p>

Recently, many researchers have considered biomass utilization due to reduction of greenhouse gas effects and environmental impact.  Achieving a system with the best performance for the application of this type of fuel with low calorific value has become a topic of interest to researchers.  This study focuses on precise modeling of biomass gasification and designs a trigeneration system to produce cooling, heating and electricity using this clean source of energy. The capacity of system under study in the base case is 2.18 MW electrical power, 223.4 kW cooling and 1060 kW hot water. In the process modeling of biomass gasification a realistic model including tar content in syngas is developed. A parametric study of trigeneration system to find the objective functionâ€™s trend and to achieve the best performance parameter is carried out. Results show that two objective functions in the reasonable range conflict, which indicate the multi-objective optimization. In addition, results indicate that for the studied system in the reasonable range of decision variables, the exergy efficiency can improve between 10 % and 20%.  Furthermore, by drawing Pareto front curve, a suitable relation to estimate the trend of objective function is derived.

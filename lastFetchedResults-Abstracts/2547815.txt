The main objective of this article is to present the practical application of the learning curve for new products in Iran. In this context, we use the data of three new product of Sanaatdarane Eftekhari Shiraz as a case study. Data have been collected from the 2011 and 2012 related to three new products, these products were estimated learning curve and using the regression, the effect of the acquisition of goods and acquisition rate was calculated. 
The results show learning effect in this three product, and this effect reduce time of production and packing. So that the average time the product 1200 sales, from 26.21 to 14.72 minutes after learning was completed. In product 1100 sales, average production was 18.52 minutes and after learning was completed this time was 8.95minutes.This time for third product time change from 33.28 to 16.42 minutes. The analysis in two ways: "cumulative quantity of production "and" cumulative time of production " is done. Learning rate based on cumulative quantity of production for product 1200 sales,1100 sales and Chakh Chinak  were 86, 84 and 93 percent respectively. The rates were based on the cumulative time of production 84, 85 and 94 percent. In addition, due to the simple assembly process, as well as mass production learning process is completed in a short time.

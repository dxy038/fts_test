The main objective of this research is to find a suitable alternate solution based seed layer for the standard RABiTS three-layer architecture of physical vapor deposited CeO<sub>2</sub> cap/YSZ barrier/Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> seed on Ni-5%W metal tape. In the present work, we have identified CeO<sub>2</sub> buffer layer as a potential replacement for Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> seeds. Using a metal-organic deposition (MOD) process, we have grown smooth, crack-free, epitaxial thin films of CeO<sub>2</sub> (pure and Zr, Cu and Gd-doped) directly on biaxially textured Ni-5W substrates in short lengths. Detailed XRD studies indicate that a single epitaxial CeO<sub>2</sub> phase with slightly improved out-of-plane texture compared to the texture of the underlying Ni-W substrates can be achieved in pure, undoped CeO<sub>2</sub> samples. We have also demonstrated the growth of YSZ barrier layers on pure CeO<sub>2</sub> seeds using sputtering. Both sputtered CeO<sub>2</sub> cap layers and MOD-YBCO films were grown epitaxially on these YSZ-buffered MOD-CeO<sub>2</sub>/Ni-5W substrates. High critical currents per unit width, I<sub>c</sub> of 264 A/cm (critical current density, J<sub>c</sub> of 3.3 MA/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 77 K and 0.01 T was achieved for 0.8 &#956;m thick MOD-YBCO films grown on MOD-CeO<sub>2</sub> seeds. These results indicate that CeO<sub>2</sub> films can be grown directly on Ni-5W substrates and still support high performance YBCO coated conductors. This work holds promise for a route for producing low-cost buffer architecture for RABiTS based YBCO coated conductors.

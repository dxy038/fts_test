This paper presents a modular, scalable approach to assembling hierarchically structured neuromorphic Address Event Representation (AER) systems. The method consists of arranging modules in a 2D mesh, each communicating bidirectionally with all four neighbors. Address events include a module label. Each module includes an AER router which decides how to route address events. Two routing approaches have been proposed, analyzed and tested, using either destination or source module labels. Our analyses reveal that depending on traffic conditions and network topologies either one or the other approach may result in better performance. Experimental results are given after testing the approach using high-end Virtex-6 FPGAs. The approach is proposed for both single and multiple FPGAs, in which case a special bidirectional parallel-serial AER link with flow control is exploited, using the FPGA Rocket-I/O interfaces. Extensive test results are provided exploiting convolution modules of 64 &#215; 64 pixels with kernels with sizes up to 11 &#215; 11, which process real sensory data from a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) retina. One single Virtex-6 FPGA can hold up to 64 of these convolution modules, which is equivalent to a neural network with 262 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> neurons and almost 32 million synapses.

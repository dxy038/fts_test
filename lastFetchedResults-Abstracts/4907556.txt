This paper deals with a multi-objective behavior coordinate for a mobile robot using fuzzy control and neural network. A task given to a mobile robot includes various objectives such as collision avoiding, target tracing, and wall following. We apply fuzzy control for describing each behavior of the robot. However, a behavior might share some fuzzy rules with other behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a reconfiguring method for a set of fuzzy rules. The combination of fuzzy rules is updated dynamically by a neural network according to the perceptual information. Furthermore, this paper describes a learning method of the neural network and fuzzy rules based on error functions. Simulation results show that the robot can take multi-objective behavior by the proposed method

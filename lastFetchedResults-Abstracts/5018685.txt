Yield enhancement may well be regarded as the quintessential objective in microelectronic manufacturing. With diminishing feature size and increasing die area the amount of functional silicon on a die is too expensive to discard in the event of short-circuit and open-circuit faults. Designing chips with high tolerance against faults, therefore, holds a great promise for profitable manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. In this paper we propose a post-processing defect-tolerant routing algorithm that reduces or eliminates short-circuit sensitive area, and minimizes vias in a two-layer channel routing solution. The algorithm is built to be sensitive to manufacturerÂ´s defect pareto figures. This feature gives the designer the flexibility of customizing the routing algorithm to the desired defect-tolerant features without increasing the die area or interconnect length

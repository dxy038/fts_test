Introduction & Objective: 40% lymphomas are extranodal and gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most common site. Gastrointestinal lymphomas by definition have not liver, spleen, lymph node and bone marrow involvement. The most common gastrointestinal lymphomas are MALTOMA, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL), burkitt, follicular and T cell lym-phoma. The most common patients are old men. The aim of this study was determination of immunophenotypes of gastrointestinal lymphoma and relationship between the site, age and immunophenotype with two years survival. 
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional descriptive study 53 primary gastrointestinal lym-phoma were studied in admitted patients of Hamadan hospitals. Age, sex, and tumor immuno phenotypes (using with CD3, CD5, CD20, CD10, CD15, bcl2, ?, k light chains) and two years survival were recorded. Results were analyzed using SPSS 16 and chi-square test. 
Results: The most common age was 50-60 years and mild male preferential was seen. 60% were MALTOMA and 24.5% were diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 47.2% were in stomach and 30.2% were in small bowel. Total two years survival was 64.2% and in MALTOMA was 81.2% and in DLBL was 38.2% (P= 0.005). In relationship between patient age and tumor site with two years survival there was no mean able relationship (P. value in first was 0.938 and in the latter was 0.308).
Conclusion: The most common lymphoma was MALTOMA and DLBL. Two years survival in MALTOMA was better but age and tumor site have not relationship with two years sur-vival.

Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the physico-chemical properties, size distribution and shape of the falling mineral dusts over Masjed Soleyman and to identify their origins. Also, seasonal and annual variations of climatic parameters and their relation with dust storm occurrence were investigated.

Materials and Methods: The collected samples were as result of dry deposition process during warm season in 2013. Particle size distribution was determined by laser size diffraction. Chemical and mineralogical compositions were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Crustal and non-crustal origins for elements in the dust samples were determined using enrichment factor (EF). In addition, dust storm sources were identified using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT.4).

Results: The study of the annual and seasonal changes in meteorological parameters associated with the occurrence of dust storms indicated an agreement between the occurrence of dusty days, temperature and rainfall in summer. The chemical and mineralogical analysis of dust particles demonstrated that the likely origin of these particles is of neighboring countries in the South West of Iran. Also, some of the detected trace elements had non-crustal sources.

Conclusion: Using HYSPLIT.4 results, it was concluded that the main origin of dust storms are North West of Iraq and East of Syria in Masjed Soleyman.

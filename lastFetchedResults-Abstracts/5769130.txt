Security of supply in electricity has received widespread attention in light of the liberalization of electricity markets. Kosovo has been experiencing electricity reduction since 1998Â´s, since there is insufficient generation of electricity. The major source of electricity generations are old lignite fired power plants. Security of electricity supply is a broad concept that comprises different activities and time frames and whose ultimate objective is to provide electricity to the end consumers within prescribed quality standards. This paper will identify the current stage of development in Kosovo energy sector; it will analyze the reform processes in the sector for creation a competitive electricity market with main focus to security of electricity supply and will present a methodology for deriving options for generation adequacy in the Kosovo. Closing of the old lignite power plant in 2017 will create additional supply constrains for Kosovo. Cut of load is usual way to ensure the secure functioning of the power system and energy shortage in Kosovo will be present also in coming years.

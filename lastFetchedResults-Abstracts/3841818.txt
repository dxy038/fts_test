Four classifications of artificial intelligence search techniques are discussed: unidirectional uniprocessor, bidirectional uniprocessor, unidirectional multiprocessor, and bidirectional multiprocessor search techniques. Wave-shaping PBA* (WS-PBA*) and search-space-clustering PBA*, (SSC-PBA*), two bidirectional AI search techniques, are compared. It is concluded that by maintaining a small number of formed clusters SSC-PBA* will be significantly faster than major wave-shaping bidirectional search algorithms.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

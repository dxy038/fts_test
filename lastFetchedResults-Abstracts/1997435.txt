The objective of this study was to determine the influence of lamb age and high-oxygen modified atmosphere (HiOx-MAP) on tenderness of loins during display. Loins from 36 carcasses of two different age groups [4-month-old (New season; NS) and 11-month-old lambs (Old season; OS)] were vacuum-packaged and stored for 8 weeks at −1.5 °C. After storage, the loins were cut into 6-cm thick chops, assigned to either HiOx-MAP or oxygen-permeable overwrap-PVC, and then displayed for 8 days at 3 °C. Initially, packaging methods did not influence shear force (P &gt; 0.05). However, at the end of display, a significant increase in shear force and lipid oxidation was found in OS loins under HiOx-MAP. SDS–PAGE and Western blot results found a greater extent of cross-linked myosin products from OS loins in HiOx-MAP compared to NS loins. These results suggest that HiOx-MAP can adversely influence meat quality of fully-tenderized loins, and meat from older lamb may be more susceptible to an oxidizing environment of HiOx-MAP.

The objective of this paper is to design robust nonlinear excitation controllers for synchronous generators. This controller takes into account the stochastic nature of disturbances acting on the system and the uncertainties in the interconnection variables, the machine currents. The controller is designed using the concept of exact stochastic feedback linearization and robust control theory

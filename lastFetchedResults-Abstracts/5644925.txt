In the group decision making, different expert often gives difference preference information for the same multi-objective decision making question. In this paper, an analytic method is proposed to solve the problem for ranking of experts based on difference preference information. First, several concept and characters of utility values, preference ordering of alternatives, reciprocal judgement matrices and complementary judgement matrices are introduced. Then, through defining transforming formula between difference preference information, translates the three types preference information (utility values, preference ordering of alternatives and complementary judgement matrices) into the forms of reciprocal judgement matrices. Then the weighted geometric mean priority method of group reciprocal judgement matrices is utilized to order alternatives. Finally, the validity of this method is verified by an example.

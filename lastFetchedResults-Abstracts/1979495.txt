Previous research identifies two types of advertising comprehension—objective comprehension and subjective comprehension—with the former message-based and the latter receiver-based. This study examines the effects of body-copy type size on readers' subjective and objective comprehension of the message in a typical print ad. The study finds that type size has a significant positive effect on subjective comprehension of the ad, but not on objective comprehension. Subjective comprehension mediates the positive effect of type size on attitude toward the advertised product. The main implication of the study is that advertisers should use as large a type size as possible for the copy in all ads that contain text.

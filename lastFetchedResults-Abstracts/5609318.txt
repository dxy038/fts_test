Given a slowly fading channel, the performance of multi-layer coding is studied for single-user scenarios. Both the source and destination are equipped with multiple antennas. The channel state information is perfectly known at the destination but not at the source. The objective is to maximize the average data rate received at the destination when the destination is able to perform successive decoding. This paper, first, proposes a design rule for constructing an infinite-layer code for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels. Furthermore, we present a procedure describing how the introduced design rule is applied to optimally determine the multi-layer code parameters. The achievable rate of the multi-layer coding and successive decoding for the Rayleigh fading 2&#195;&#151;2 MIMO channel is also evaluated.

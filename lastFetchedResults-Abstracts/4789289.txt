A new design method for 2-D nonseparable hexagonal quadrature mirror filter banks is proposed. The new method involves minimizing an objective function containing two error terms, one dealing with the perfect reconstruction condition and the other with intra-band aliasing. The method makes full use of the symmetry of hexagonal FIR filters, which leads to a considerable reduction in the amount of computation required by the optimization. This method is compared with one proposed by Simoncelli and Adelson (1990) and is shown to yield superior results

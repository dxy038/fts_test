The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of fermented oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreats) by-production
(FOMP) supplementation on the growth performance, blood parameters, carcass traits and meat quality in finishing Berkshire pigs.
FOMP was made by mixing oyster mushroom by-production with rice bran and barley bran and this mixture was fermented for 60
days. The experimental diets were 0, 3, 5 and 7% of FOMP added to C, T1, T2 and T3 in the basis diet for 7 weeks. Average daily
gain (kg/day) was higher in C and T1 than in T2 and T3 ( P , 0.05). Average daily feed intake (kg/day) and feed conversion
increased by the addition of FOMP ( P , 0.05). Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were higher in T3 than
other treatments ( P , 0.05). Carcass weight (kg) was higher in C and T1 than in T2 and T3 ( P , 0.05). Dressing (%) was higher
in C than in T3 ( P , 0.05). Crude protein was lower in T3 than in other treatments ( P , 0.05). Crude fat was higher in T2 and
T3 than in C ( P , 0.05). pH24 was higher in C than in other treatments ( P , 0.05). Cooking loss (%) was higher in T1 than T2
( P , 0.05). Water-holding capacity (%) was higher in C than in T1 ( P , 0.05). In meat colour, CIE a* was lower by the addition
of FOMP ( P , 0.05). CIE b* was higher in C than in other treatments ( P , 0.05). In backfat colour, CIE L* was lower in T3 than
other treatments ( P , 0.05). CIE b* was lower by addition of FOMP ( P , 0.05). Palmitoleic and oleic acid were higher in T3
than in other treatments ( P , 0.05). Linoleic and arachidonic acids were higher in T2 than in other treatments ( P , 0.05). The
results indicate that 3% of FOMP affected the growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality and fatty acid in contrast to
addition of 5% of FOMP for Berkshire pigs during the finishing period

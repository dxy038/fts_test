Between 1993 and 2002, the number of human and canine rabies cases in the Americas Region fell by approximately 80%. There were 39 human cases in 2002, 63% of them transmitted by dogs. Furthermore, human rabies transmitted by wildlife, mostly by bats is a risk to inhabitants in many countries in the Region.
The objective of this study is to describe this epidemiological situation based in the information received from the countries of the Americas Region in Regional Rabies Surveillance System in the Americas (SIRVERA) administrated by the Pan American Health Organization. This sharp reduction is attributable mainly to the control measures implemented by the countries of the Region, such as the mass vaccination of dogs and prophylactic treatment for people who have been exposed.

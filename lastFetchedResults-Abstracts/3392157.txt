The paper considers a paging problem in the optical feeder microcellular system where group simulcasting and dynamic channel allocation technologies are incorporated. The objective is to propose an effective paging procedure whose performance is measured in terms of paging load, average paging delay, and paging success probability. In the paging procedure, paging signals are transmitted via group simulcasting, for which the control channel is allocated dynamically. The performance of the procedure is analyzed in an approximate queueing network model. The proposed procedure is then compared in performance with a simulation approach, from which the procedure is found to outperform any previous methods in the literature.

The objective of this work is to explore how implications for educational practice are represented in the scholarly literature of engineering education. This work is motivated by the increasing urgency to understand how research can be used to transform educational practice. Because scholarly writing (such as conference papers and journal articles) represents one place where researchers articulate ideas about how their research can be used (i.e., educational implications), an analysis of how such implications are represented can provide insight into ideas about the uses we imagine for our research. Once we have characterized the vision of use, we can step back and think about whether the collective vision we present may provide clues to the more general issue of transforming education.

The occurrence of an unusual class of low amplitude anisotropic wave trains in the cosmic ray neutron intensity, which is distinctly different from the average diurnal variation as well as from other recognized types of low amplitude anisotropic wave trains are noted and the directional distribution in the interplanetary space determined. The major objective of this paper is to study the first three harmonics of low amplitude anisotropic wave trains of cosmic ray intensity over the period 1991â€“1994 for Deep River neutron monitoring station. The significant characteristic of these events is that the low amplitude wave trains shows a maximum intensity of diurnal component in a direction earlier than 1800 h/co-rotational direction. It is noticed that these events are not caused either by the high-speed solar wind streams or by the sources on the Sun responsible for producing these streams such as polar coronal holes. The direction of the tri-diurnal anisotropy shows a good negative correlation with Bz component of interplanetary magnetic field. The occurrence of low amplitude events is dominant for positive polarity of Bz. The Disturbance Storm Time index i.e., Dst, remains consistently negative only throughout all the low amplitude wave train events, which is never been reported earlier.

In this article an approach to QoE modeling and QoE assurance is presented. Employing objective end-to-end QoE modeling, a QoE estimation algorithm is proposed and applied to a service enabler of an NGN SDE to provide a QoE assurance service. The proposed QoE model is context-aware and comprises a comprehensive set of quality-related parameters available throughout various information factories of the NGN, accessible by employing standardized procedures within the NGN SDE. Design principles, methodology, as well as simulation results and comparative analyses are given. A QoE assurance service solution is presented as a use case proposal that operates as a proactive in-service QoE controller, followed by results of a real-world laboratory implementation.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel power conversion circuit for cost-effective battery-fuel cell hybrid systems. First of all, the various reduced parts power conversion systems (PCS) are overviewed and an advanced dc–dc boost converter and a bidirectional dc–dc converter are proposed. Theoretical explanation and informative simulation and experimental results are provided, along with the evaluation of the developed topologies in performance points of view.

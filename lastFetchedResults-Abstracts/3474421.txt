This paper presents an investigation about false operation of vector surge relays due to adjacent feeder faults. The objective was to explore the scenarios that led to a higher risk of false operation. Simulation results have shown that the main factors affecting false operation are system and generator loading, generator inertia constant, amount of power exported by the generator, short-circuit level, feeder X/R ratio, fault clearance time, and electrical distance between the generator and the fault.

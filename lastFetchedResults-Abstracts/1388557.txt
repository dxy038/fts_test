The objective of this study was to determine the tissue density, in vitro expansion and differentiation of canine adipose tissue-derived (ASC) and bone marrow-derived (BMSC) stromal cells. Primary (P0) and cell passages 1–6 (P1–6) cell doubling numbers (CD) and doubling times (DT) were determined in fresh cells. The P0, P3, and P6 adipogenic (CFU-Ad), osteogenic (CFU-Ob), and fibroblastic (CFU-F) colony forming unit frequencies, lineage specific mRNA levels in differentiated P3 cells and composition of P3 and P6 chondrogenic pellets were assessed in cryogenically preserved cells.

ields from bone marrow were significantly higher than adipose tissue. Overall ASC and BMSC CDs and DTs and P3 and P6 CFU-F, CFU-Ad, and CFU-Ob were comparable. The P0 BMSC CFU-Ob was significantly higher than ASC. Lineage specific mRNA levels were higher in differentiated versus control cells, but similar between cell types. Protein was significantly greater in P3 versus P6 ASC chondrogenic pellets. Based on these findings, fresh and revitalized canine ASCs are viable alternatives to BMSCs for stromal cell applications.

Wireless communication is the fastest growing field and with the emergence of IEEE 802.11 based devices, wireless access is becoming more popular. Many multimedia applications for IP networks have been developed and thus the demand for quality of service (QoS) has increased. In this paper our primary objective is to evaluate 802.11e EDCF framework for video, voice and background traffic all at the same time. Our assessment is based on an error model called E-model, MOS for VoIP and PSNR for video. We also studied the effects of random uniform error model on various types of traffic. As expected, wireless networks are more prone to errors than wired networks

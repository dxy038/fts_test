The objective of this study is to suggest a design guideline to build a personality for an entertainment robot, ROLLY based on basic factors of motions and their interrelations. Independent variables were the direction at two levels, the speed, the volume, and repetition at three levels as the basic factors of a motion. Dependent variables were dominance and friendliness as personality factors. Eighteen motion samples were designed with two or three levels of independent variables through the use of the orthogonal array of Taguchi. Participants watched eighteen motion samples in a random order and evaluated the personality factors (dominance and friendliness) based on each motion sample on a seven-point Likert scale. The results of the evaluation yielded basic guidelines to express robot personalities using motions while controlling the direction, speed, volume, and rate of repetition.

The onboard electrical propulsion system (OEPS) in a hybrid electric vehicle can be used to eliminate the need for a standalone charger for providing plug-in battery charging, vehicle-to-grid, and mobile power generation capabilities. This paper discusses several possible configurations for using OEPSs as bidirectional battery chargers. Pulse width modulation control methods uniquely afforded by some of the configurations, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency of the resultant chargers, are also discussed. Test results on an OEPS consisting of a dual inverter/motor drive prototype configured as a bidirectional battery charger and mobile power generator are included.

Objective
dy the effects of green tea extract administration on age-related cognition in young and old male Wistar rats.
s
and old rats were orally administered 0.5% green tea extract for a period of eight weeks and were evaluated by passive avoidance, elevated maze plus paradigm and changes in acetylcholinesterase activity.
s
ent of young and old rats with the extract resulted in no significant difference in performance on the rota rod treadmill test/righting reflex time. Green tea extract significantly improved learning and memory in older rats, with increased retention latency to enter difference in passive avoidance test. In the elevated maze test, green tea treatment resulted in significantly more number of entries in the enclosed arm by the young and old rats. Decline in acetylcholinesterase activity was observed in the cerebrum of green tea treated old rats in comparison to the green tea treated young rats.
sion
tea extract administration is effective in enhancing learning and memory in aged rats, and hence, may serve useful in reversing age-related deficits.

Introduction & Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder that almost 10 percent of women of childbearing age are affected. This syndrome, are the cause of infer-tility in women and increasing risk of serious metabolic disorder that causes morbidity. Weight loss leads to return of the cycle of ovulation and achieving pregnancy in many of these patients. Based on these, researchers intend to study the effects of green tea on weight, and hormonal parameters in polycystic ovary syndrome.
Materials & Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 60 women with PCOS and overweight or obesity were randomly divided into two groups. Our study populations were patients with PCOS referred to Alzahra university hospital in Isfahan city aged between 20 and 40 years. The intervention group received tea tablets and the control group placebo. Free testosterone and serum insulin concentrations were measured after twelve weeks in the two groups. Weight was measured in the both groups before and after the intervention. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software.
Results: The mean free testosterone level was significantly different between the two groups after the intervention (P < 0.001). Also the mean fasting insulin (P < 0.001) and the mean weight was significantly different between the two groups after the intervention (P = 0.031).
Conclusion: Green tea intake in overweight and obese women with polycystic syndrome cause weight loss, reduced fasting insulin and lower levels of free testosterone.

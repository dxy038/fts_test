This paper presents a coordinated and automated approach to determine the system adjustment strategy for Shipboard Power Systems (SPS) to improve the transient performance and prevent potential voltage instability following a system contingency. In contrast with the conventional design schemes that heavily rely on the human operators and pre-specified rules/set points, this paper focuses on the development of the capability to automatically and efficiently detect and react to system state changes caused by disturbances and damages by incooperating different system components and component-level controllers to formulate an overall system-level solution. To achieve this objective, in this paper we proposed a performance-oriented, model-based predictive framework that can be applied to a variety of SPS applications to meet the stringent performance requirements under different operating conditions. Simulation results have proven the capability of the proposed framework to effectively and efficiently improve the dynamic system performance during the transient period with little or none human interventions.

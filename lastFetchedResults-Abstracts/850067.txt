This study conducted to estimates health related quality of life of diabetic patients based on their place of living. 
Methods: This study was a secondary data analysis. We used data from a national cross sectional study conducted in 2006 using random cluster sampling. Data were collected by face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. We analyzed s data on health related quality of life (HRQoL) by gender and patientâ€™s residency. Mean values of HRQoL were calculated for each province and then compared with other provinces by statistical tests including ANOVA and distance based classifying methods.
Results: Comparison of mean values showed that HRQoL were highest in the Qom, Semnan and Gilan, and were lowest in Kerman, Yazd and Ardabil, respectively. HRQoL was significantly differed between provinces at 0.05 levels.
Conclusion: The findings confirm the meaningful differences in HRQoL among diabetic patients living in different provinces. It remains to investigate about such observations. This might help to implement a better care for this population living in different places.

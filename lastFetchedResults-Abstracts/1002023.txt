The objective of this study was to analyze University Entrance Exam (UEE) items, in terms of Bloom’s revised taxonomy, to find out which levels of this taxonomy were more reflected in these items. To this end, UEE items in three years, 1380, 1385, and 1390, in three fields, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Humanities, and in two Universities, State, and Azad, were codified based on the coding scheme designed by Razmjoo and Kazempourfard (2012). The frequencies and percentages of the data were calculated and since the data appeared in frequencies, Chi-Square was used to estimate the significance of differences between the frequencies of different levels of thinking .The results indicated that Lower Order Thinking Skills (LOTS) were more considered in UEE items. Also the results showed the complete absence of “Creating” which is the highest level of thinking in the mentioned taxonomy. Accordingly, UEE in Iran cannot make learners critical thinkers.

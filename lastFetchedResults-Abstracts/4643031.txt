Here we presented a noble passive optical network based on Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) on fiber "COF" and demonstrated over 100km bidirectional 4-channels CWDM transmission without optical amplifier. We outline COF-PON architecture, key merits it offer, such as coding gain to improve the receiver sensitivity, bidirectional transmission (on same wavelength), colorless operation and experimental results. We believe our newly propose ultra long reach COF-PON will help drastically reduce the CapEx and OpEx cost by consolidating metro and access networks into simple one network.

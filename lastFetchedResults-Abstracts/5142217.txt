A unidirectional multi-wire-saw is used for the slicing of LST-cut in lumbered Z-bars. The free abrasive grains cohere like a triangular strain circle when there is a speed difference in the flow of the slurry. When the wire runs, a triangular strain circle that consists of the abrasive grains does a rotary motion. The protruding portion of a triangular strain circle that rotates grinds the quartz ingot. A triangular strain circle infers that it is an analytical model of the optimum slicing. On the other hand, the running wire of the bidirectional multi-wire-saw repeats a cycle of an acceleration, a deceleration, and a stop movement. A new optimization system can solve the basic operating problems of the bidirectional multi-wire-saw. The Miller index (023~) of the BT-cut is used for the azimuth measurement of the LST-cut cutting angle. Because the orientation angle is away from the standard, the error margin of the measurement is large. The measurement of the orientation of the Bragg angle in the Z-plane uses a new Miller index (015~) as the Bragg angle. Cut angle measurement of the highly precise LST-cut then becomes possible.

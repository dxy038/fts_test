An iterative algorithm for the design of FIR partial filter banks (PFBs) is described. The design problem is formulated as a 4th-order nonlinear optimization problem in which the objective function is a weighted sum of a reconstruction-error term and an aliasing-error term. The optimization problem is solved by iteratively minimizing a pair of quadratic functions. Explicit formulas for evaluating the minimums of these quadratic functions are derived, which lead to an efficient and fast algorithm. Two design examples are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm. The PFBs obtained are then used to compress bathymetric signals and electrocardiograms

The short message service (SMS), a bidirectional service for short alphanumeric (up to 160 bytes) messages, is a unique feature of GSM, not found in older analog systems. We propose a multicast short message service architecture over a backbone network. We demonstrate some approaches to maintain the location information of the short message service center consistent to the home location register and illustrate our scheme for mobile-terminated short message transfer. Finally, we simulate and evaluate this architecture. Our simulation indicates that the proposed strong consistency approach has optimal efficiency by adjusting parameters. Also, the proposed architecture efficiently provides a self-routing capability and multicast functionality in the cellular backbone network. This study also provides a further insight on the issues of a multicast wireless cellular backbone network and demonstrates a referable methodology to propose and analyze a multicast cellular backbone network, which can promote the technology of personal communication networks

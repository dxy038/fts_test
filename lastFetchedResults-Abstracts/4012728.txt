The authors propose and demonstrate an eight-channel reconfigurable bidirectional wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) add-drop multiplexer in which all channels can be added/dropped independently in either direction. The performance of the bidirectional WDM add/drop multiplexer is experimentally studied for a data rate of 10 Gbit/s per channel, providing an overall capacity of 80 Gbit/s. It is found that the performance of the add/drop multiplexer is not degraded by a backward propagating signal

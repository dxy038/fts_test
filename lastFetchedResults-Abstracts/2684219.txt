A hierarchical and decentralized model predictive control scheme is proposed for the fast tracking of active and reactive power references of HVDC systems. The objective is to exploit optimally the system actuation and dynamics to improve power quality, provide voltage support and stabilize the grid. The system constraints are incorporated into the formulation to keep the system within its admissible operating range during all transients. At the high level, two HVDC line model predictive controllers deal with the dc system objectives by manipulating the power references that are given to two low-level ac current model predictive controllers that manipulate the voltage-source-inverter duty cycles. The proposed formulation is suitable for fast implementation and its performance is verified in simulation.

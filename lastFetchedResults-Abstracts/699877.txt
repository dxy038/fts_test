Wood pulping and paper production generate a considerable amount of wastewater, containing many pollutants among them resin and fatty acids. Resin acids contribute substantially to effluent toxicity and were identified to be detrimental to microorganisms of activated sludge and in particular to bacteria in anaerobic wastewater treatment system and other forms of aquatic life.
The objective of the present study was to check the applicability of the ozone and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to eliminate resin acids from aqueous solutions and to determine the ozone dose required. Furthermore, an investigation of the influence of the oxidation methods on subsequent biological destruction of the byproducts was performed.
Aqueous solution of the resin acids: abietic, dehydroabietic and isopimaric acids with different initial composition were subjected to ozonation or AOP processes at different ozone doses. After ozonation or advanced oxidation pretreatment the model solutions were biodegraded in aerated vessels containing activated sludge.
During ozonation of the resin acids aqueous solutions the resin acids were almost eliminated, however the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was rather low. The ozone dose required to obtain reduction of resin acids >90% was in the range of 0.1–0.7 mgO3/mgCOD, depending on the composition and concentration of model solutions.
The toxicity of ozonated resin acids solutions decreased with increasing applied ozone dose up to about 0.3–0.5 mgO3/mgCOD, thereafter increased.
Ozonation and other AOP processes did not increase the rate of biodegradation of resin acids model solutions in aerated activated sludge systems compared to not pretreated solutions.

In this paper we address the problem of traffic grooming in WDM rings with all-to-all and its generalization to many-to-many service by using network coding. We consider minimizing the number of Line Terminating Equipment (LTE) on two types of unidirectional rings, namely, single-hub and un-hubbed rings, as our objective. In single-hub rings, we investigate the minimum cost provisioning of uniform all-to-all traffic in two cases: where network coding is used to linearly combine data, and where it is not used and data is transmitted without coding. We generalize the service mode to many-to-many and evaluate the cost of provisioning. In un-hubbed ring, we propose a multi-hub approach to obtain the minimum cost provisioning in the case of all-to-all and many-to-many traffic. From our numerical results, we find that under many to many traffic, network coding can reduce the network cost by 10-20% in single-hub rings and 1-5% in un-hubbed rings.

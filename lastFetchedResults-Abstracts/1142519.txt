The main objective of this study was to compare the spouted bed and microwave assisted spouted bed drying on affecting physical properties of parboiled wheat and bulgur. Drying was performed at different temperatures (50 °C, 70 °C, 90 °C) and microwave powers (288 W, 624 W). Bulk and apparent density, bulk and apparent porosity, sphericity, color, microstructure and pore size distribution of parboiled wheat were investigated after drying. Yield and water absorption capacity were determined in bulgur samples. The effect of air temperature on physical properties of product except color was not significant in spouted bed drying. More porous structure was observed in wheat samples dried in microwave assisted spouted bed compared to air dried ones. Sphericity and bulk density were higher when high temperature was combined with high microwave power. In microwave assisted spouted bed drying, similar yield value but lower water absorption capacity of bulgur were observed as compared to spouted bed drying.

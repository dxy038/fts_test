A wavelet neural network (WNN) is introduced to realize the system identification with nonlinear auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) model. The method takes both advantages of the wavelet network and NARMAX model, and the multi-objective optimization method is used to real-time estimate the network coefficient. The wavelet-network-based NARMAX identification model is used as online system identifier, and the experimental result of ship course control proves the efficiency of the proposed neural identification model.

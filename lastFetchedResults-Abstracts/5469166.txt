Map-matching is a key component of ITS (Intelligent Transport System). Traditional map-matching algorithms based on geometry technology always cannot reach a good accuracy. Some other algorithms which use probabilistic theory, fuzzy logic, and belief theory usually are too complex to be applied to the practice for real-timeness. In this paper, we build a bidirectional node-link road network model at first, then divide the whole algorithm into three states and use different methods respectively to get candidate roads. Meanwhile, according to the match degree for each candidate road calculated from the weighted recursive algorithm, the optimum matched road can be determined. The projection on the optimum matched road is considered as the final matched position. The test result based on real GPS data in Jinan city shows that this algorithm can achieve the accuracy of around 98% and meet the practice demand of real-timeness.

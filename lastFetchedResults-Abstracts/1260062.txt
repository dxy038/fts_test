 Vocal cord medialization through Isshiki type I thyroplasty is part of the standard approach for patients with unilateral vocal cord immobility secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. However, several other modalities have been used to treat the symptomatic â€œtwistedâ€‌ larynx caused by unilateral superior laryngeal nerve weakness. The Isshiki type IV thyroplasty (cricothyroid approximation) specifically addresses cricothyroid muscle weakness, but, canine studies at the Mayo Clinic demonstrated a trend toward decreased acoustic power and sound intensity with simulated cricothyroid activity. Thus it is reasoned that addition of an ipsilateral type I thyroplasty should help compensate for this power loss. Using videostroboscopic and acoustic analysis, 9 patients with unilateral superor laryngeal nerve weakness were treated with combination type IV and type I thyroplasty. Subjective dysphonia and objective visual and acoustic measurements revealed postoperative improvement in most patients. The combination type IV and type I thyroplasty is recommended for surgical treatment of patients with superior laryngeal nerve weakness, because it addresses cricothyroid muscle weakness without compromising vocal power.

This paper presents a three-phase cascaded H-Bridge MLI as Shunt Active Filter intended for installation on industrial and utility of power distribution system is widely accepted and implemented as a solution to the power quality problems in utility, industry and commercial applications. This paper proposes the design of a shunt active power filter under the condition of voltage sag, unbalanced loads. The active power filter, which can be used under the condition of voltage sag, unbalanced or distorted source voltages, can be applicable to compensate the harmonics, reactive and negative sequence currents. The main objective of this paper is to regulate the voltage in distribution systems against any power quality issues like voltage sag, unbalancing and to reduce the harmonics using cascaded multilevel inverter as Shunt active filter.

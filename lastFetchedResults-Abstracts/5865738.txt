The objective of this paper is to build several models considering hybrid uncertain environment. First, fuzzy random variable is explained to deal with the models in hybrid uncertain environment. Second, using fuzzy random variables, linear regression model (FRRM) is formulated. Third, multi-attribute decision model (MADM) is built based on linear regression model. Finally, to study facility location problems in presence of a hybrid uncertain environment involving both randomness and fuzziness. A two-stage fuzzy random facility location model with recourse (FLMR) is developed in which both the demands and costs are assumed to be fuzzy random variables.

A beam splitter based on the concept of a reflectarray is designed for polarization-dependent bidirectional deflection at 1 THz. A unit cell is composed of two sets of orthogonally oriented dipole resonators arranged in an interlaced triangular lattice. A subarray is constructed from multiple unit cells to create two independent progressive phase distributions to respond to the TE and TM polarized incident waves. Numerical results for the near- and far-field distributions of the reflectarray demonstrate that the proposed structure can separate the polarization components of an incident beam by deflecting them into two different directions, i.e. -48.6&#176; and 30&#176;, in plane.

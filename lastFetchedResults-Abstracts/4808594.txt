This paper focuses on the novel controller design and analysis for a fuel cell vehicle energy storage system energy management system, based on a hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) bidirectional DC/DC converter topology. The novel control strategy enables simpler dynamics compared to a standard buck converter with input filter, which is essential for fuel cell based energy storage systems. Moreover, the controller enables good regulation capability, low EMI, lower source current ripple, ease of control, and continuous input current waveform in both modes of operation (buck as well as boost modes).

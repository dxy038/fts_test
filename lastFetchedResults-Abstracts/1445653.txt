This paper brings forward the notion of “ H ∞  almost output synchronization” for heterogeneous multi-agent systems under directed interconnection structures. Agents are assumed to be linear, right-invertible and introspective (i.e. agents have partial knowledge of their own states). The objective is to suppress the impact of disturbances on the synchronization error dynamics in terms of the H ∞  norm of the corresponding closed-loop transfer function. In addition, the problem of regulating the consensus trajectories to a reference signal is addressed. The application of the proposed method to the problem of formation is furthermore elucidated. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the method.

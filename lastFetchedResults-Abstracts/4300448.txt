Artificial neural networks for solving different variants of linear programming problems are proposed and analyzed by the Lyapunov direct method. An energy function with an exact penalty term is associated with each variant and leads to a discontinuous dynamic gradient system model of an artificial neural network. The objective is to derive conditions that the network gains must satisfy in order to ensure convergence to the solution set of the linear programming problems. This objective is attained by representing the neural networks in a Persidskii-type form (S.K. Persidskii, 1969) and using an associated diagonal-type Lyapunov function

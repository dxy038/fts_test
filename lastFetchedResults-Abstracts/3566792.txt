Among the tools currently used by management to appraise its employees is the ``Merit Review System.´´ The majority of companies in industry make an attempt to ``rate´´ each employee objectively, using a standardized rating form, and adjust salary accordingly. It is this writer´s opinion that a true appraisal of an employee is a very subjective matter that takes into account many elements not found on most rating forms. Employee reviewing is a continuing process, not a matter that should be considered by a supervisor twice a year. This paper highlights some of the disadvantages of the present objective systems, and offers instead a system whereby a supervisor is given great latitude in reviewing his subordinates. It is further suggested that a merit review should be considered separately from a salary adjustment so that the employee´s review will not reflect a budgetary allowance given to a supervisor for raises.

Objective: Renal failure and diabetic retinopathy are two main complications of chronic diabetes. Fluroscien angiography is one of the most important and commonly employed diagnostic methods for evaluation of retinopathy. In this investigation we tried to evaluate the effects of fluroscien on renal function of diabetic patients. Subjects and Methods: This prospective clinical investigation included 44 diabetic patients (22 males and 22 females) referred to the to the Imam Khomaini hospital in 2006 for diagnostic retinal angiography by fluroscien. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured before and subsequently on the second and the third day after angiography, The data were analyzed by SPSS soft ware.(by t-test and chi- squire).

Results: Seventeen (38.6 %) (11 males and 7 female) had increased creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dl and in 9 (20 %) (7 males and 2 females, P<0.05 ) patients this increase was equal to or more than 0.5 mg/dl. Changes in BUN in these patients were not prominent and no significant differences between the group who experienced an increased in serum creatinine level and those who did not. The most common complications after fluroscien angiography were nausea and vomiting which occurred in 7 patients (15.9%).

Conclusion: Despite it is widely believe that fluroscien has no adverse effects on both renal function or serum creatinine, in this study we showed that it can increase serum creatitne in a significant portion, prominently male, diabetic patients.

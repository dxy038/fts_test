A digital signal processing method to simulate the behavior of a conventional two wire lossy transmission line is presented. The method is based on the digital simulation of a cascaded connection of RLC circuits using wave digital filter concepts modified to allow the bidirectional transmission of signals. The simulation methods were used to implement on a digital signal processor a fully programmable line simulator that accepts as input the line length and the elementary electrical line parameters. The system does the exact simulation of the input impedances at both line terminations and the bidirectional voltage transfer ratios. The experimental results presented indicate a very good performance for the two wire line simulator in a frequency band covering from DC to 12 kHz

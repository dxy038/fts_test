This paper introduces an approach to dynamic vehicle routing problems with time windows (VRPTW) and discusses the real world variation of vehicles routing problem, which involves scheduling the transport of containers for collection, delivery and positioning. The variation of VRPTW studied is a containers transport problem with triangulation (TP) where multi-objective optimization and rescheduling need to be taken into account. The importance of efficient multi-objective optimization and rescheduling are illustrated and possible metrics to support scheduling and the advantages of suing a Pareto optimization approach are explained. A hybrid CSP/GA framework including local search and Pareto optimization is introduced as the optimization algorithm.

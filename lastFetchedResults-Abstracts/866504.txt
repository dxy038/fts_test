The objective of this paper is to present an integrated approach of two models: simulation and optimization. This approach is used to determine the design parameters of stochastically constrained systems where the measure of performance is available only via simulation. The optimization model is solved using simulated annealing (SA) for parameter selection followed by the use of Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the measure of performance. Based on the expected simulation output, the parameter set is either accepted or rejected. A modified rejection/acceptance criterion is presented for the proposed SA algorithm taking into consideration the stochastic system constraints. Moreover, a control variate is employed as a variance reduction technique in order to obtain an efficient estimate of performance measure. The proposed approach is tested using three real cases of the multi-echelon repairable item inventory systems (MERIIS). The results show that the proposed method is efficient in determining an optimal choice of spares and repair channels in these systems.

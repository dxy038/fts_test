In this paper, we present a Distributed Geography-based Fault Tolerant topology control algorithm (DGFT) for static large-scale wireless sensor networks. We introduce the scale-free characteristic of complex networks into the topology of large- scale wireless sensor networks to obtain robustness and time efficiency. DGFT enables wireless nodes to define the topology by neighbor relationship, based on certain initialized weights whose distribution follows a negative power law. We prove that the topology constructed under DGFT is strongly connected and bidirectional. Simulation studies show that the resulting topology has good network performance in terms of transmission delay and robustness.

This paper presents a motion compensated frame rate up-conversion algorithm that uses the expanded range of the motion trajectory to enhance the accuracy of motion estimation. In the proposed algorithm, an adaptive motion vector refinement is also proposed to correct false motion vectors. In addition, a recursive motion vector smoothing is proposed to smooth motion vectors considering true neighboring motion vectors only. Finally, we propose the weighted index-based bidirectional motion compensated interpolation to reduce artifacts. In the experiments using benchmark test sequences, the proposed algorithm improves the average PSNR of interpolated frames by up to 4.84 dB, when compared to the conventional algorithm.

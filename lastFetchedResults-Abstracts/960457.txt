An advanced understanding of phase transformation mechanisms and of microstructure/properties relationships in steels requires to investigate
the distribution of carbon. The improvement of mechanical properties of these materials led to develop finer microstructures. Thus, the mean size of
the constituents (austenite/austenite islands and bainite laths) of the high strength steels is under the micron. The small size combined in some case
with low concentration of carbon renders the analysis of these materials difficult.
The NanoSIMS 50, which associates high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, seems to be a tool of choice to answer to this new analytical
challenge. In this objective, we have explored the potentialities of such an instrument for the qualitative and quantitative study of carbon in multiphase
steels. In particular, a calibration curve was established from reference samples containing martensite and ferrite with a known carbon
content.

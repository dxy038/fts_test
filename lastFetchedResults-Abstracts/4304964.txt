This paper presents an approach to the reconfiguration of radial distribution networks, for both loss reduction and service restoration, using the same meta-heuristic tool: the simulated annealing algorithm. Besides the main objective of each problem (minimizing losses or load not supplied) minimization of the total number of switching device operations is also included as a possible criterion. Due to these conflicting goals, the network reconfiguration is a multi-objective optimization problem. The paper shows how to generate efficient solutions for the problem and discusses the associated decision issues. A 52-bus distribution network is used to illustrate the methodology.

In this paper, our main work is to study and solve the constrained global optimization problem with fractional and trigonal deviation integral and penalty technique. Furthermore we examine the penalty optimality condition and fractional and trigonal penalty deviation integral algorithm for constrained global optimization problem. Combining the Monte-Carlo technique, we analyse specific examples for discontinuous objective function with n = 100 variables. Numerical tests show that the algorithm is effective.

For fluctuations of the DC bus voltage in dual PWM motor drive system, which is caused by the frequent changes in motor running, the generation mechanism is analyzed. A new control strategy for dual PWM system is proposed, which is based on EL model and the load power feed forward. By using DC steady state voltage compensation and the Power load forecasting, the stable DC voltage and the unity power factor is obtained based on a small DC capacitor. Besides, the bidirectional energy flow is achieved. The simulative result verified this method.

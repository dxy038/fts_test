Both geophysical and geospatial data provide important information in the establishment of the optimal telecommunication systems especially in the mobile telecommunication environment. The objective of this study is to utilize geophysical properties and geospatial information in the analysis of the telecommunication environment through point-to-point wave propagation modeling. Geophysical properties associated with wave propagation parameters of the Earth surface were analyzed based on land classification using fused imagery of Landsat ETM+ and Ikonos images. Three-dimensional geospatial information was obtained by processing stereo aerial images. The results show that the accurate geospatial information and geophysical property of the surface improve the prediction of receiving power of the receivers located near corners of the buildings where diffractions occur. The wave propagation model developed from accurate telecommunication environment could be applied to cell planning

The present paper aims to refine the conditions of authority of ‘religionist conduct’ and its position among Imamī evidences of inference. The study seeks to eliminate the shortcomings existing in former principle sources through collecting and disciplining relevant fragmented discussions. The first discussion explains the conditions of authority of religionist conduct based on a comparative approach. Here, the relationship between ‘religionist conduct’ and ‘rationalist conduct’ is measured in terms of their 
 reasoning. The second discussion, however, tends to establish the position of ‘religionist conduct’ among other types of reasoning. Here, the authors discuss the relationship between ‘religionist conduct’ and similar established threads such as ‘tradition’, ‘consensus’ and ‘subjective speculation’ (irtikāz), and examine its reasoning position. Among the achievements of this research the following can be listed: the stipulation of the legislator’s agreeing position in terms of the authority of ‘religionist conduct’ and its consideration under narrative and practical tradition (of the Infallibles), the reasoning priority of ‘religionist conduct’ as compared with ‘consensus’, the objective analysis of ‘religionist subjective speculation’ based on ‘religionist conduct’ and its superiority in terms of authority.

The testing activities of the Software Verification and Validation (SV&amp;V) team at Research In Motion (RIM) are requirements-based, which is commonly known as requirements-based testing (RBT). This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the current RBT process at RIM, by utilizing historical testing data from previous releases, static analysis of the modified source code, and real-time execution data. The main focus is on the test case generation phase and the objective is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of test cases in such a way that overall testing is improved. The enhanced process not only automatically generates effective test cases but also seeks to achieve high test coverage and low defect escape rate.

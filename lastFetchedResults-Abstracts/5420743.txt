Existing Web services composition technology, lack of services selecting. A particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the multi-objective optimization strategies was provided to address quality of services to choose the issue of global optimization. It is to transform Web services select the overall optimization problem with QoS into a multi-objective constrained optimization problem based on Qos, using multi-objective PSO intelligent theory, by a number of Qos parameters optimized at the same time, and ultimately produce a set of constraints to meet the Pareto optimal solution. The experimental results show the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm.

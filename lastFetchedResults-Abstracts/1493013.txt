This paper has two main objectives. Firstly, to review the feasibility and validity of the various methods that have been used to measure puberty. With an appreciation of these measurement issues, the second objective is to summarize the evidence-base as to whether the age at menarche and the age at onset of puberty has decreased in recent years. In consideration of these methodologies, all of which report different levels of reliability and validity, it is only possible at present to draw inferences about possible changes in pubertal age and onset. Moreover, the wide variations in sample size, selection of participants (usually non-random), and study design reported in the reviewed studies have compounded this situation further. The paper closes by providing a summary of the findings which will be of relevance to those intending to critically review the current evidence surrounding age of puberty, as well as those set on carrying out future research into this area.

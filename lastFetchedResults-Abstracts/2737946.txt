This paper presents a modular push-pull PWM converter (MPC) for a battery energy storage system, which is intended for grid connections to medium- or high-voltage power systems. The converter per phase consists of a center-tapped transformer and two arms based on a cascade connection of multiple bidirectional PWM chopper-cells with floating dc capacitors. This paper discusses the operating performance and control method of the MPC, focusing on voltage balancing of all the floating dc capacitors. Moreover, a comparison is made between the MPC and a modular multilevel converter (MMC), under an assumption that both are used as the same battery energy storage system. The validity of the operating performance and control method is confirmed by both computer simulation using the &#8220;PSCAD/EMTDC&#8221; software package and experiment using a three-phase, 200-V, 5-kW downscaled model.

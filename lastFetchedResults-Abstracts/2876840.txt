Currently, the file has been used as a link from the website as being transferred to the system. It is always to select the file you want to transfer the target folder. This standard behavior is to create an Internet shortcut file if you drop the file into your computer. But if I want to get the file into the folder from website it is different behavior. The main objective of this paper is to develop an algorithm that will use drag and drop to transfer files to any computer. Therefore, it will save time when compared to uploading and downloading. The basic idea of this paper is to classify the software reusable components using uploading and downloading. In this paper we used file tree structure for classifying the components.

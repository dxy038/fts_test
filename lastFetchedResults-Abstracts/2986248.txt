Summary form only given. The Open Microprocessor Systems Initiative, which was started in 1989, was a novel concept of integrating a large scale horizontal activity into an existing vertically structured R&amp;D program. It arose out of the necessity to strengthen EuropeÂ´s position in the microprocessor systems industry, build up new technical competence, and enlarge the industrial application base. One of biggest challenges was the alignment and consensus building between the different communities from industry, academia and the European Commission itself. This could only be achieved by tight management, negotiation skills and persistence. Since the Initiative could not be based on an established model, the key elements and mechanisms had to be designed from scratch. A clear common objective and strategy, (driven by industry needs), a supporting and co-ordinating management infrastructure, and a continuous dissemination action were identified as key elements. Since the start of the first OMI projects in 1991 almost 400 industrial, scientific and research organizations took part in more than 150 projects focusing on hardware, software, tools and applications for embedded systems and applying the principles of open systems, portable design and reusable blocks

This paper presents an IMC-based method for synthesizing the feedback block of an ISA-PID regulator. Its key features are basically two: all the parameters of the PID are considered and tuned, and objective criteria are given for selecting the single design variable of the method on the basis of the nominal process model employed and of an overestimate of the correspondingly introduced process/model mismatch.

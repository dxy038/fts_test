Objective (s): The role of patients in the definition of service quality can be considered as key competitive criteria. As a result, service providers are trying to apply quality assessment tools that significantly emphasis on customer orientation. In this regard, we aimed to report on validity and reliability of the Persian version of SERVUSE questionnaire.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted to verify the validity and reliability of SERVUSE questionnaire. A sample of 80 patients of the cardiac surgery in two teaching hospitals affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences were selected randomly and were evaluated in two stages. The first step before admission, the patient's expectations of quality of care and the second stage before discharge, their perception of quality of care were received.
Results: The Cronbachâ€™s alpha in both instances was satisfactory (0.74 and 0.91 respectively). To determine the validity, questionnaire was distributed to experts who had experience in the quality of care. After their comments the validity of the questionnaire were assessed by content validity. The results showed that the translated version of the questionnaire has relatively acceptable validity. 
Conclusion: The Persian version of the SERVUSE questionnaire can be used for evaluating the quality of health care services in Iran.

Over the last decade, an extensive research has been carried out in the areas of fuzzy logic and neural networks. Fuzzy logic has emerged as a mathematical tool to deal with the uncertainties in human perception and reasoning. It also provides a framework for an inference mechanism that allows for approximate human reasoning capabilities to be applied to knowledge-based systems. On the other hand, artificial neural networks have emerged as fast computation tools with learning and adaptivity capabilities. Recently, these two fields have been integrated into a new emerging technology called fuzzy neural networks which combines the benefits of each field. The objective of the paper is to establish the similarities and differences between fuzzy systems and neural networks and to discuss possible models for fuzzy neural networks which can be applied to system modeling and control

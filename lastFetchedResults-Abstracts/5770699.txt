Experimental life sciences research in space in Europe commenced with the first Biostack experiment flown onboard Apollo 16 in 1972. The objective of this experiment was to study the biological effects of single heavy ions of the cosmic radiation, to study the influence of additional factors of the space flight environment, and to get information on the spectrum of charge and energy of the cosmic radiation, in order to estimate the radiation hazard of this radiation for man in space. The experiment was performed in an international cooperation. This report gives a summary of the dosimetric and biological data accumulated in this and the follow-on experiments of the Biostack program

Objective:
We conducted this study to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of chemoradiation therapy using UFT and low-dose cisplatin in 37 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Patients and methods:
Between March 1999 and December 2001, 37 patients with newly diagnosed and histologically proven nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated in Department of Radiation Oncology, Asan Medical Center were enrolled in this protocol. Cisplatin was administered weekly, starting on day 1 of radiation therapy, as an intravenous infusion at 20 mg/m2 of body-surface area. Oral UFT was administered daily, at a dose of 300 mg in three divided doses. Radiation therapy was given in doses of 1.8–2.0 Gy, 5 days per week, with 4–15 MV photons. The dose of elective nodal area was 60 Gy, and primary tumors and enlarged lymph nodes were boosted with intracavitary brachytherapy or 3D conformal therapy.
Results:
All patients received the planned doses of radiation. Cisplatin was administered for a median of 6 cycles, and 81% of patients received UFT for more than 5 weeks. The complete response rate was 95% for all patients, and the overall response rate was 100%. No patient experienced hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher. Five patients experienced grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity but recovered with conservative management. There was no treatment-related hospitalization or death.
Conclusion:
These findings suggest that UFT and low-dose cisplatin is a safe and effective regimen of concurrent chemoradiation therapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

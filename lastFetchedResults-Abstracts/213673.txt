Background and Objective: Hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy are common and from one ofthe deadly triad, along with hemorrhage and infection that contribute greatly to prenatal
and maternal morbidity and mortality in the developing countries. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between maternal hypothyroidism and pre-eclampsia.
Materials and Methods: In a prospective case-control study, maternal thyroid hormonal status was evaluated in 132 pregnant women with gestational hypertension and compared to controls.
Results: It was found out that 23 women (7.3%) had pregnancy-induced hypertension (PI H), 45 women (l4.3%) had mild pre-eclampsia, 62 women (19.7%) had severe pre-eclampsia and 2 (0.6%)
had eclampsia. Mean of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels was not significantly higher in pre-eclamptic group as compared to controls (p>0.05).
Conclusion: Maternal hypothyroidism might not be associated with pre-eclampsia.

The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to solving a multi-objective optimization problem of a six-bar mechanism that is used in a kind of presses, providing an approach to this problem. Mathematical model of the mechanism is set according to 4 objectives and 11 constraints, and the NS GA-II is flexibly used to deal with relationships between variables. Motion simulation is done to check the result showing that this trial is positive to this kind of problems.

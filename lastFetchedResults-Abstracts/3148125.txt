Reasonable effort should be made to remove all past references to this paper.<br/><br/>The presenting author of this paper has the option to appeal this decision by contacting TPII@ieee.org.<br/><br/>Aiming at the shortcoming of paying attention only to the combat performance and life cycle cost(LCC)during evaluating development plan of weapon systems, this paper establishes evaluation indicators of general performance of weapon systems, and uses grey interrelated analysis method to evaluate and optimize. This paper also brings forward a new weight determination method based on Euclidean Distance to improve it on the basis of analyzing the defects of classic grey interrelated analysis method, which avoids Subjective factors and makes the evaluation results more objective and accurate. Finally through an example in the practice of development project of defense equipment, the method´s specific applications are introduced and the feasibility and effectiveness of this method verified.

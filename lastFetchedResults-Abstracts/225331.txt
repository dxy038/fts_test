This paper presents a novel approach to fault detection,
faulted phase selection, and direction estimation based on
artificial neural networks (ANNs). The suggested approach uses
the finite impulse response artificial neural network (FIRANN)
with the same structure and parameters in each relaying location.
Our main objective in this work is to find a fast relay design with
a detection time not dependent on fault conditions (i.e., current
transformer saturation, dynamic arcing faults, short-circuit level,
and system topology) and that uses only unfiltered voltage and
current samples at 2 kHz. The suggested relay, which we have
named FIRANN-DSDST, is composed of a FIRANN together with
post-processing elements. The FIRANN is trained globally using
training patterns from more than one relaying position in order
to be as general as possible. The FIRANN is trained using an
improved training algorithm, which depends on a new synaptic
weights updating method, which we have named the mixed
updating technique. The proposed relay is trained using training
patterns created by simulating a real 400-kV network from the
Spanish transmission network (R.E.E.). Finally, the proposed
relay is tested using simulated and real fault data. The results
encourage the use of this technology in a protective relaying field.

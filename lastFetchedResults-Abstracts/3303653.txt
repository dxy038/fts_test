The paper focuses on treating and characterizing variations that occur in measurements or that are intrinsic in electronic systems. Methods illustrating basic principles of Design of Experiments such as replication and blocking are implemented and used so that valid and objective conclusions are drawn. Replication is used for three purposes: verifying the metamodel adequacy, defining the confidence interval of the measured mean value of the system´s response and determining the minimum number of replications that are needed in order to measure the system´s response with a given accuracy. Blocking helps with eliminating the systematic error that appears due to the measuring conditions and was used in the screening process. The methods were applied on a lighting control system used in automotive applications.

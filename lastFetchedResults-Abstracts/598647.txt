Problem statement: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of low back pain and the associated risk factors among primary school teachers in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Approach: A cross sectional study was conducted in nine primary schools in the Klang Valley. The schools were selected randomly from a list obtained from the Ministry of Education. Two hundred and seventy two respondents who fulfilled the study criteria volunteered to participate in the study. A questionnaire was used to determine the demographic and occupational information. Information on low back pain was assessed using a Nordic Questionnaire, while the General Health Questionnaire was used to determine the mental health status. Results: The prevalence of low back pain was 40.4% among respondents. Lifting load (28.0%) was ranked as the main factor which contributed to low back pain, followed by prolonged sitting (25.2%). Poor mental health (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.15) was the risk factor to low back pain. Conclusion: The prevalence of low back pain was 40.4% among primary school teachers in Klang Valley. Teachers with poor mental health status had higher risk of developing low back pain.

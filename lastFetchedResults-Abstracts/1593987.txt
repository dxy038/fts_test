Soil surfaces in arid and semi-arid lands often lack photoautotrophic life but are covered by communities of soil
surface covering organisms able to tolerate dehydration, and thus adapted to aridity. One important objective of
multi-spectral remote sensing instruments is the detection of the optical characteristics of the Earthâ€™s surface using
high spectral resolution bands. In this study ASTER imagery and reflected radiation in VNIR bands were used to
investigate biological Soil Crusts (BSCs) in the field. By applying IARR (Internal Average Relative Reflectance),
FCC (False Color Composite), MNF (Minimum Noise Fraction Transform), and MEM (Mathematical Evaluation
Method) techniques, BSCs are successfully detected in the Chadormalu desert area of central Iran. This study
clearly shows the capability of ASTER data (VNIR bands) to detect BSC or cyanobacteria soil crusts. The
proposed MEM method, despite being approximative is suitable for detecting microorganisms in inaccessible
areas such as other planet surfaces or remote areas on earth.

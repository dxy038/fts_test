The objective of this work is to present an experimental procedure for the determination of temperature coefficients and correction parameters as indicated in the international standard IEC-60891. These coefficients and parameters can be indoor determined by measurements in a class AAA solar simulator at irradiances from 700 to 1100 W/m<sup>2</sup> and temperatures from 20 to 50&#176;C.

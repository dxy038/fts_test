Deploying Picocell Base Station (PBS) throughout a Macrocell is a promising solution for capacity improvement in the next generation wireless networks. However, the strong received power from Macrocell Base Station (MBS) makes the areas of Picocell narrow and limits the gain of cell splitting. In this paper, we firstly propose a Dynamic Cell Range Expansion (DCRE) strategy. By expanding the coverage of the cell, we aim to balance the network load between MBS and PBS. Then, we present a cooperative Resource block and Power Allocation Scheme (coRPAS) based on DCRE. The objective of coRPAS is to decrease interference caused by MBS and Macrocell User Equipments, by which we can expand regions of Picocell User Equipments. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our method through comparing with other existing methods.

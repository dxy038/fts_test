Broken bars and eccentricity are common faults in induction motors. These two faults usually occur simultaneously, since most installed induction motors have a small inherent eccentricity. In this paper a detailed investigation of the possibilities for induction motor fault diagnosis based on wavelet analysis of the current space vector is provided. The main objective is to formulate a method for enhanced diagnosis of broken rotor bars in induction motors by applying wavelet analysis to the motor current space vector. To this purpose, a detailed wavelet analysis of stator current space vector is implemented. The analysis is at first performed through simulation of a faulty asynchronous machine in Matlab-Simulink. Subsequent to the simulation results analysis, experimental tests were conducted. Characteristic results are presented and briefly discussed

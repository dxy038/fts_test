For many evaluation indexes and without the indexÂ´s weight, The method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on rough set is put forward. The original evaluation indexes are treated by using the rough set theory and the concept of information entropy to filter the original indexes. The attribute significance of rough set is applied to allocate weight coefficient for the reduced factor indexes with more objective way, which overcomes the subjective factor of the traditional method of determining the weight. Finally, fuzzy comprehensive assessment method is used to get the last result and the accuracy of the assessment results is improved.

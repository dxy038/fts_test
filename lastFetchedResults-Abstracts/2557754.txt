Objective(s): Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of spinal cord is leading to the paraplegia observed. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of the saffron extract on spinal cord I/R injury. Materials and Methods: Thirty five male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups: intact, sham surgery, normal saline (NS), low dose saffron aqua extract, high dose saffron aqua extract. Results: The mean motor deficit index (MDI) scores were significantly lower in the saffron extract groups than in the NS group at 48 hr after spinal cord ischemia (P<0.001). Saffron extract groups significantly decreased plasma level of malondialdehyde than in the NS Group (P<0.05). The number of motor normal neurons was significantly greater in the high saffron extract group than in the NS and low saffron group (P<0.05). Conclusion: These data suggest that a saffron extract may protect spinal cord neurons from I/R injury.

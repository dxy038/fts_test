Forest planning goals are becoming increasingly complex, as both spatial and temporal characteristics of desired future conditions are becoming important measures of forest plan success to decision makers. The objective of this research was to develop a process where the amount of habitat for northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) could be maintained within a certain radius of an owl nest location, while using thinnings and group selection harvests to assist in the development of mid- to late-successional forest conditions. A heuristic technique, threshold accepting, was used to facilitate the development of this spatial forest plan. Three policy objectives were modeled: maintaining a minimum level of 0, 40, and 80% nesting, roosting, and foraging (NRF) habitat levels within 2.4 km of a known owl location. For a 1910 ha managed forest in the Pacific Northwest USA, when NRF habitat levels were constrained to a minimum level of 40%, net present value (NPV) declined by almost 24%, while average NRF value (over a 100-year time horizon) increased 11%. When NRF habitat levels were constrained to a minimum level of 80%, NPV declined almost 70%, while average NRF increased 29%. This heuristic spatial forest planning process allows forest managers to examine a number of management options, from both economic and ecological perspectives, prior to selecting a preferred alternative.

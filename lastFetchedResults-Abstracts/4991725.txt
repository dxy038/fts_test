Dynamic load balancing schemes are essentially significant for efficiently executing non-uniform problems in highly parallel multicomputer systems. Their objective is to minimize the total execution time of single applications. This paper proposes adaptive receiver initiated diffusion (ARID) strategy for distributed dynamic load balancing. Its principle and control protocol are described. The communication overhead and the effect on system stability and performance efficiency are analyzed. Finally simulation experiments are carried out to compare the adaptive strategy with other dynamic load balancing scheme

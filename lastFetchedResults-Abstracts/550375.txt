This article investigates the economic advantages of using coal as an alternative type of fuel over other types of fossil fuels such as natural gas at the power plant in Iran. Use of coal to produce electricity at the power plant in Iran will provide an opportunity for the country to invest and develop its other types of energy such as nuclear energy and new energy. Use of coal to produce electricity at the power plants across the country will make it possible to prolong the life of our oil and natural gas resources and convert those resources to petroleum products which carry added value. Use of coal instead of other types of fuel will make it possible to fill part of electricity shortage in the country and create jobs and economic prosperity at the places such as Tabas, with abundant reserves of coal mines. This research intends to evaluate the economic impacts of using coal, as an alternative type of fuel, to produce electricity, at the power plants across the country to compensate electricity shortage with minimum environmental effects. Other objective of this research is to prove that use of coal to produce electricity is economical by comparing finished price of produced electricity by coal and other types of fuel such as natural gas, steam or combined cycle. Methodology is to use method of Levelized Cost of Electricity which is customary to use for calculating finished price of electricity in Iran. Consequently, the price for each KWH (Kilowatt hour) or MWH (Megawatt hour) electricity produced by coal is compared to the one produced by natural gas, steam or combined types of fuel.

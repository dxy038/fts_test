Structural redundancies in mathematical programming models are nothing uncommon and nonlinear programming problems are no exception. Over the past few decades numerous papers have been written on redundancy. Redundancy in constraints and variables are usually studied in a class of mathematical programming problems. However, main emphasis has so far been given only to linear programming problems. In this paper, an algorithm that identifies redundant objective function(s) and redundant constraint(s) simultaneously in multi-objective nonlinear stochastic fractional programming problems is provided. A solution procedure is also illustrated with numerical examples. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of nonlinear fractional objective functions and constraints in cases where redundancy exists.

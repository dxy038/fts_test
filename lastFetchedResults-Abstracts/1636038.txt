The basic and commonly used four types of thin-layer facade plasters on cement and silicate binders were subjected to 400 cycles of accelerated ageing in the simulate chamber. The main attention was focused on the character of pore structure evolution during of ageing process. To reach this objective, examinations of the microstructure by the mercury intrusion method and total porosity by the densitometry method were carried out in time per 100 cycles. During the study, the main emphasis was put on the open porosity and changes of dimensional groups of pores. On the ground of the hysteresis of the mercury pressure by mercury intrusion porosimetry testing, the presence of pores with capillary entrance was suggested. In view of this, the cylindrical and spherical model of porous structure has been defined. The contribution of capillary and spherical pores vary in time together with properties such as: average pore radius, length of cylindrical pores and their tortuosity. The changes of these values confirm that atmospherical ageing influences plasters’ binders in two zones. It appears on the one hand by the decrease of total porosity, length and diameter of capillaries but on the other hand by the increase of open porosity and the decrease of pores’ tortuosity. It indicates the tightening character of the inside pore structure of the examined plasters and at the same time it gives diverse effect in its external zone.

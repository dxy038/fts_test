The infrastructure of hydrogen presents many challenges and defies that need to be overcome for a successful transition to a future hydrogen economy. These challenges are mainly due to the existence of many technological options for the production, storage, transportation and end users. Given this main reason, it is essential to understand and analyze the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) in advance, in order to detect the important factors that may play increasing role in obtaining the optimal configuration. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of the available approaches for the planning and modeling of the hydrogen infrastructure. The decision support systems for the HSC may vary from paper to paper. In this paper, a classification of models and approaches has been done, and which includes mathematical optimization methods, decision support system based on geographic information system (GIS) and assessment plans to a better transition to HSC. The paper also highlights future challenges for the introduction of hydrogen. Overcoming these challenges may solve problems related to the transition to the future hydrogen economy.

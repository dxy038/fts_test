For a given network physical topology and traffic pattern, our objective is to design the logical topology and the routing algorithm on that topology so as to minimize the Congestion. The virtual topology design problem is a mixed integer linear formulation. Heuristic algorithms for this problem where suggested to relax MILP problem such as Heuristic Topology Design Algorithm (HLDA), the minimum-delay logical topology algorithm (MLDA) heuristic, Random logical design algorithm (RLDA) and traffic independent logical design algorithm (TILDA). In this paper, we compare the performance of several heuristic topology design algorithms using large networks such as 14 NSFNET. The results shows that MLDA and TILDA tend to design logical topologies using a smaller number of wavelengths than HLDA while RLDA gave a vibrating results in which we cannot depend on to get an accurate performance.

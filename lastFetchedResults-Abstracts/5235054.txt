A description is presented of Inspire, a shell for easy development of planning systems that make plans in cooperation with planners. In Inspire, a problem of deciding methods for revising plans is formulated as a problem of deciding constraint propagation paths. Constraints are basically classified into equality constraints and inequality constraints. The former are defined as relations. To satisfy them, a bidirectional update propagation mechanism is provided. It automatically calculates propagation paths and changes variables on the paths. Inequality constraints are defined as rules. To satisfy them, a production system is used

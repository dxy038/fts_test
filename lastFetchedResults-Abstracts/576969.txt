Background: Numerous studies have shown that abuse is prevalent among married couples, while the number of studies conducted on this issue among the college students who are involved in personal relationships, is low. Furthermore, the majority of these studies have paid little attention to the personality characteristics of victims.
Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the personality correlates of emotionally abused students.
Methods: This was a correlational study conducted in 2010. Participants were 424 students of Islamic Azad university of Abhar selected randomly. Data were collected using Neo personality test and Ginny NiCarty questionnaire of emotional abuse. Statistical tests including multivariate regression and Anova were used for analysis of data.
Findings: Of 424 participants, 189 were females and 235 males with a mean age of 23.7Â±5 years. Abusive relationship was observed in 42% of cases. Extroversion was a stronger variable in prediction of being abused (r=0.78 , P < 0.0001), openness to experience, neuroticism, and agreeableness were in the next ranks, respectively. Results of 2 way Anova (F=50.80 , P < 0.000) indicated that the independent effects of sex and violence were significant although the interaction between these factors found to be insignificant.
Conclusion: Based on our data, the extrovert students experienced more abusive relationships while the individuals with more agreeableness reported less abuse.

Objective
ndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is one of the most common birth defects all over the world. Both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to NSCLP. Recent studies have demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway is required for lip and palate formation. WNT family may play an important role in the development of NSCLP. This study aimed to evaluate the association between Wnt3A gene polymorphisms and NSCLP in Chinese population from Northwest China.

tients with NSCLP and 233 normal controls were genotyped for two SNPs of Wnt3A by PCR-RFLP. Both SNPs genotype frequencies were analysed between cases group and controls group.
s
equencies of rs752107 TT and rs3121310 AA were significantly higher in NSCLP cases group (7.4%, 15.3%) than that in controls group (2.1%, 9.5%) with p-value = 0.013, 0.014, corrected p value (p-corr) &lt;0.05 and with odds ratio (OR) = 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.244–9.79, OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.17–4.38, respectively; the frequency of rs3121310 GA was also higher in NSCLP cases group (57.4%) than in controls group (52.0%) with p-value = 0.042 and OR = 1.56 (95% CI: 1.02–2.39). And the frequency of rs752107 TT of Wnt3A showed higher risk in female patients, while the frequency of A allele of rs3121310 showed stronger association in male patients.
sions
s the first report that two SNPs of Wnt3A (rs752107 and rs3121310) are significantly associated with NSCLP in Chinese population. These findings provide a context for understanding the genetic aetiology of NSCLP.

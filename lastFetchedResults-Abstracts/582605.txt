Taxable capacity is an economic capacity of a given country, the extent to which taxpayers can tolerate the burden of all types of taxes (i.e. the degree to which taxes could be paid). Taxable capacity is difficult to estimate. The related important issue is to review how tax revenue as a part of state revenue is increased. To achieve this objective, a precise estimation and recognition of current resources are necessary. Appropriate criteria for calculating taxable capacity is the tax bases of  the different economic sectors, so value added of sectors is also calculated. In this study, modelling of neural network is applied in which independent variables enters neural network learning system as an input layer. The input variables of the  model  including inflation rate, Gini coefficient, the ratio of the urban population to the total population, the degree of  economic openness and value added share of  agriculture and industry  sectors as a percent of GDP , these are dependent variables  of the model and taxable capacity is dependent variable which is regarded as output layer in neural network. Neural network is appropriately selected according to the trial and error method for the hidden layers and each layer's nodes. In this learning model, intra network method( batch) and multi perceptron layer approach( MPL) have been used as progressive  and feedback.

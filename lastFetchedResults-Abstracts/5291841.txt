Remote sensing can provide very detail information for a given house because of digital maps at a scale of 1:1000. There are more than 6,500 house holds and about 121,000 hectares have been investigated and created as house databases in 2006. The house databases are very useful in agricultural mapping and monitoring for a county government. Blended remote sensing tools were developed to make the house databases more useful in agricultural management. The objective of this paper was to implement blended remote sensing tools for house management at an agriculture bureau of a county government such that interagency or inter-department collaboration can be promoted. The house databases can be extracted based on house address. Visual Basic.NET and visual C#.NET were used to make application modules. The developed blended remote sensing tools consist of a wide range of software packages which can be integrated as an information system using Visual Basic.NET to solve problems encountered in a department. Field operations can use software ArcPAD to work with PDA and GPS devices. The application modules can work alone or side by side with ArcGIS or ArcIMS. Farm house reconstruction fund, farmer health insurance, farm land changing code, ranch registration, illegal land use enforcement at slope land, tree planting at farm land, and conservation of old trees are agricultural problems now can be solved with house management using blended remote sensing tools. Inter-department collaboration at the agriculture bureau can be promoted based on the same house information extracted by the blended remote sensing tools.

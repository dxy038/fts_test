Study Objective: The study sought to assess knowledge of, attitude toward, and practices of vaginal douching among adolescent females attending a public family planning clinic, in order to better understand racial influences on douching.
Design, Setting, Participants: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, a one-page questionnaire was administered to all adolescent females (≤19 years) presenting to a public family planning clinic in a small southern city between March 1 and May 31, 1999.
Results: Of the 169 participants, the mean age was 17.0 years (±1.5 years), 53% were Caucasian, and 47% were African-American. Sixty-nine percent of participants reported vaginal douching, mostly for hygienic reasons (68%). Those reporting vaginal douching were more likely to have a history of sexual intercourse (P< 0.01) and a history of one or more sexually transmitted diseases (P< 0.05). Age of first douche correlated positively with age of first sexual intercourse (r = 0.34, P< 0.001). African-Americans did not douche to a greater degree than Caucasians. However, racial differences were noted in knowledge of and attitude toward vaginal douching.
Conclusions: Vaginal douching was a common practice among adolescent females attending a public family planning clinic in a small southern city. Culturally appropriate educational strategies for African-American and Caucasian adolescent females should improve awareness of adverse events associated with vaginal douching, despite family and personal beliefs about this practice.

The US Army Research Laboratory is currently studying the application of matrix converters to supply battlefield loads using variable speed diesel generators by utilizing a matrix converter to provide a bidirectional, three-phase to three-phase, direct AC to AC link between a diesel generator and load. This allows more efficient and economical operation of the diesel generators. A very brief overview of the matrix converter and standard protection strategies is presented, followed by new output protection strategies. The new output protection strategies account for the presence of the third harmonic component in the matrix converter output. Simulations are then presented to prove that the added output protection is capable of protecting a matrix converter and load when used in battlefield applications while adding increased selectivity and diagnostic capabilities.

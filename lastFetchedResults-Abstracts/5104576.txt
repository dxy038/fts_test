Now more and more demands to spatio-temporal data and the spatio-temporal data model is key issue of describing and managing the spatio-temporal data. The spatio-temporal data model integrates time and space so it can truly describe the reality. But the objective world still has another characteristic--uncertainty. Only including uncertainty the spatio-temporal data model can completely and truly reflect the world. Based on the feature based spatio-temporal data model and starting with the feature uncertainty, the article gives a logical model of the spatio-temporal data model including uncertainty and provides a logical method to implement the model. This article is an attempt to build a perfect spatio-temporal data model and provides a new idea to research the spatio-temporal data.

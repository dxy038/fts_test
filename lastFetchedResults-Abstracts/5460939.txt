Abstract - Under the background of China, the civil servant competency is characteristic and itÂ´s hard to be quantified. For this situation, this paper gives the corresponding analysis based on improved Grey Relational Model with harmony factor. This model provides an objective basis for the selection, assessment and training of civil servants in government-related bodies. Finally the paper verifies the evaluation algorithm by means of empirical analysis.

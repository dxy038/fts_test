The interaction of congestion control with the partitioning of source information into components of varying importance for variable-bit-rate packet voice and packet video is investigated. High-priority transport for the more important signal components results in substantially increased objective service quality. Using a Markov chain voice source model with simple PCM speech encoding and a priority queue, simulation results show a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 45 dB with two priorities over an unprioritized system. Performance is sensitive to the fraction of traffic placed in each priority, and the optimal partition depends on network loss conditions. When this partition is optimized dynamically, quality degrades gracefully over a wide range of load values. Results with DCT encoded speech and video samples show similar behavior. Variations are investigated such as further partition of low-priority information into multiple priorities. A simulation with delay added to represent other network nodes shows general insensitivity to delay of network feedback information. A comparison is made between dropping packets on buffer overflow and timeout based on service requirements

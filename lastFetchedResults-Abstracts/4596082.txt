A modular arithmetic circuit using a radix-4 minimum-redundant signed-digit number system is proposed. Any arithmetic circuit can be constructed using a single kind of module with a high degree of parallelism. This modularity is very useful for realizing high-performance semicustom VLSI such as a data-driven arithmetic circuit. The module is composed of an adder, a partial product generator, and a quotient digit generator, which are mainly implemented by multiple-valued bidirectional current-mode circuits. It is easy to design any complex arithmetic circuit using the modules. A performance estimation using SPICE simulation shows that the speed of the proposed arithmetic circuits is comparable to that of the fastest binary circuits

This paper studies Multidisciplinary Hierarchic Compatibility Design Optimization (MHCDO) method for design of hierarchic system which is one of complex system. Complex system mostly contains many subsystems which have particular function. Systems and subsystems as well as subsystems have complex coupled relations. Optimization design of complex systems integrates a number of disciplinary. Various disciplinary interact each other, and impact the performance of the system as a whole. The traditional multi-objective optimization canÂ´t consider these relationships, and have been difficult to adapt to the optimization of complex systems design. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is for complex systems optimization, and its range of applications is wide. The MHCDO is one of method of MDO. Basing sensitivity derivative analysis which can reflect the effect of the change of sharing design variables and state variables to objective function in every optimization, the MHCDO can obtain the most adaptive solutions of hierarchic system.

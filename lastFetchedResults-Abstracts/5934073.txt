Transmission Control protocol has been essentially designed for wired networks, and its performance is not good for wireless networks. The objective of the present work is therefore to study a fuzzy based inference system based on the factors of expected throughput and actual throughput to dynamically adjust the congestion window size to improve the performance of TCP in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). Our scheme does not rely on any explicit feedback from the network and requires only sender side modifications. In our simulation study we examine the throughput and packet delay as performance metrics of the ad hoc network with regard to equal sharing of network bandwidth among multiple TCP flows. Through extensive simulations we show that the number of concurrent flows significantly affects the TCP performance metrics and our proposed scheme achieves the desired goals of performance improvement compared to other TCP variants.

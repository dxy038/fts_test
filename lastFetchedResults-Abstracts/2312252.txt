The objective of the study was to measure annual carbon sequestration rate of mixed deciduous forest by measuring that of seven young broadleaved tree species (6 years age) as well as selection of better carbon sequestered plant species for future plantation. The diurnal net assimilation rate of Carbon dioxide (CO2) at leaf level was measured with LI-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System at daytime on seasonal basis in a man-made forest at Budge Budge (N 22°28′ E 88°08′) of South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, INDIA. Net assimilation rate of carbon at canopy level was calculated by measuring Leaf Area Index with LAI-2200 and using analytical model with non-rectangular hyperbolic light response curve. The average net assimilation rate of CO2 at leaf level was found maximum in Albizzia lebbek (8.13 μmol m−2 s−1) and that of canopy level in Eucalyptus spp. (4.851 g h−1). The minimum was found for Swietenia mahagoni (1.058 g h−1). The annual carbon sequestration rate of the mixed forest in natural condition was estimated 6.01 t ha−1 year−1 by consolidating the potential of all seven species.

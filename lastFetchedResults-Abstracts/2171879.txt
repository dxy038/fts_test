Routine identification of fungi based on phenotypic and genotypic methods can be fastidious and time-consuming. In this context, there is a constant need for new approaches allowing the rapid identification of molds. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy appears as such an indicated method. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of FTIR spectroscopy for an early differentiation and identification of filamentous fungi. One hundred and thirty-one strains identified using DNA sequencing, were analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy of the mycelia obtained after a reduced culture time of 48 h compared to current conventional methods. Partial least square discriminant analysis was used as a chemometric method to analyze the spectral data and for identification of the fungal strains from the phylum to the species level. Calibration models were constructed using 106 strains pertaining to 14 different genera and 32 species and were used to identify 25 fungal strains in a blind manner. Identification levels of 98.97% and 98.77% achieved were correctly assigned to the genus and species levels respectively. FTIR spectroscopy with its high discriminating power and rapidity therefore shows strong promise for routine fungal identification. Upgrading of our database is ongoing to test the technique's robustness.

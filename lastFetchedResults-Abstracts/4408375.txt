We study and analyze coverage region for MIMO amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network. We consider the network geometry in which L relays are placed uniformly around the source, and assume that there is no direct link between source and destination. We analyze desired transmission rate with the purpose of maximizing coverage region. Using Monte Carlo simulations the impact of number of transceiver antennas and relay amplification factor on the coverage region is studied. Assuming that there is spatial correlation between transmit antennas and receive antennas we compare coverage region for two fading channels, i.i.d fading channel and spatially correlated fading channel. Assuming that channel state information is available at receivers (CSIR), we consider the objective of maximizing coverage region for a given rate and show numerically that spatial correlation decreases the coverage region.

In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme for video streaming services in a high data rate (HDR) downlink. It is applicable to CDMA2000 one-carrier evolution data only (1&#215;EV-DO) based on HDR technology, and can be adopted in high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) for UMTS. We consider the problem of improving the performance of existing real-time data channel-adaptive scheduling schemes. The modified-largest-weighted-delay-first (M-LWDF) and exponential (EXP) rules were shown to achieve good results in in terms of head-of-line (HOL) packet delays not exceeding given thresholds. To adapt the rules we suggest modifying them by taking into account the impact of the video playout buffer. The objective of our scheduling scheme is to reduce the percentage of video frames which do not meet their playback deadlines and to provide fairness among the users. To take into account the specific nature of video streaming applications, we applied the 2nd-order autoregressive process model for the MPEG video stream. The simulation results suggest that the modified M-LWDF and EXP rules surpass the conventional ones.

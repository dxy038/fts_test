In this paper, we consider the problem of interference suppression by performing a joint iterative beamforming [1] and channel allocation (JIBCA) strategy for wireless nodes under contracted quality-of-service (QoS) constraints in an ad hoc network. The objective is to maximize the signal to interference plus noise ratios (SINRs) between two communicating nodes under constant transmit power considering the interference from other nodes in the network. For this purpose, the interference impaired network is modeled as a noncooperative joint beamforming and channel allocation game, in which the payoff includes the maximization of the target SINR and the limiting factor is related to the interference caused by other nodes. The proposed JIBCA algorithm is shown to give better SINR efficiency both with the assumptions of perfect and imperfect channel information availability at the transmit/receive units over the network. It is also shown through simulation results that the JIBCA algorithm converges to Nash equilibriums (NE) and results in SINR efficiency improvement.

In this paper, we develop an inventory model with price dependant demand rate, under time value of money and inflation, finite time horizon, exponential backlogging rate and exponential deterioration rate with the objective of maximizing the present worth of the total system profit. Using a dynamic programming based solution algorithm, we are able to find the optimal sequence of the cycles and also to obtain different optimal selling prices and optimal order quantities for the cycles with unequal lengths, which have never been done before for our model. We also use a proper numerical example to show accuracy of the solution procedure.

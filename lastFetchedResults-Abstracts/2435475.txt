The main objective of projection algorithms is to improve the performance of cyber situational awareness. This improvement could be performed by removing the existing gap between intrusion-detection systems and cyber defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a system that could be able to project the cyberspace future state, improve the cyber situational awareness and finally execute the prevention action against the potential threats.  The proposed system is based on high level information fusion. Projecting attack tracks without any requirement to prior knowledge about network architecture or static attack guidance templates is another considerable capability of this system. The system consists of two separate parts: information fusion and cyber-attack projection.  In second part of the system, a new method for projecting multi-stage attacks have been  proposed that enable the cyberspace analysts to prioritize attacks and perform appropriate actions against future attack steps. Finally, the system performance is evaluated by different criteria such as accuracy.

This is a somewhat discursive but informative article on the hybrid Apollo docking simulation. The authors do not identify their objective in writing the paper until the very last sentence of the concluding section, where they state: "It is hoped that some part of the description of the problems, solutions, and experiences will be useful to others who are now involved, or who may become involved, in simulations similar to the one described." With that as an objective,much of the detailed material on problem characteristics and specifications of the docking test device could have been condensed into an introductory or parenthetical paragraph. The discussion of why a hybrid computer was selected in preference to an all-analog or all-digital system, and of the way the problem was distributed between the analog and digital portions of the hybrid system, also adds little to the paper or to previously published material on these subjects.

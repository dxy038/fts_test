Demonstrates a bidirectional lightwave distribution system that uses subcarrier multiplexing to transmit data to eight nodes from a single head-end laser. Data for each node (180 Mbit/s) and return date (45 Mbit/s digital video) are transmitted as FSK subcarrier, between 2.5 and 5.0 GHz. Penalties from laser nonlinearities, interchannel interference or bidirectional transmission are negligible

Cooperative spectrum sensing is attracting more attention in cognitive radio networks. This paper proposes a fully distributed consensus-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme to cope with both fixed and random bidirectional connections among secondary users. In the proposed scheme, secondary users can maintain coordination based on only local interactions without a centralized common receiver. Moreover, we prove that even inter-connected with unreliable bidirectional communication links, secondary users can still make an average consensus. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can have significantly lower missing detection probability and false alarm probability.

This paper presents a two-stage hybrid optimization algorithm based on a modified genetic algorithm. In the first stage, a global search is carried out over the design search space using a modified GA. The proposed modifications on the basic GA includes dynamically changing the population size throughout the GA process and the use of different forms of the penalty function in constraint handling. In the second stage, a local search based on the genetic algorithm solution is executed using a discretized form of Hooke and Jeeves method.

The hybrid algorithm and the modifications to the basic genetic algorithm are examined on the design optimization of reinforced concrete flat slab buildings. The objective function is the total cost of the structure including the cost of concrete, formwork, reinforcement and foundation excavation. The constraints are defined according to the British Standard BS8110 for reinforced concrete structures. Comparative studies are presented to study the effect of different parameters of handling genetic algorithm on the optimized flat slab building. It has been shown that the proposed hybrid algorithm can improve genetic algorithm solutions at the expense of more function evaluations.

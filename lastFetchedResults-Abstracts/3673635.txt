Perceptual errors introduced by current virtual view creation approaches for free viewpoint video often result in severe distortions in synthesised images. A novel virtual view synthesis algorithm is proposed based on corrected region based surface mapping and an image fusion method to reduce perceptual errors. The results over multi-view image sets imply that the proposed method improves the objective and subjective performance simultaneously, compared with previous dominant multiple image view synthesis approaches.

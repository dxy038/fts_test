Background and Objective: Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by an increase in serum uric acid levels and Reactive Oxigen Species production, and considered as a risk factor for gout and oxidative stress- induced diseases. The antioxidant effect of dietary polyphenols in control and decreasing of oxidative damage have been confirmed previously, therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of red onion intake on serum uric acid levels, lipid profile and paraxonase activity in hyperuricemic rats.

Subjects and Methods: In this experimental- interventional study, 24 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, hyperuricemic, normal and hyperuricemic rats receiving onion. Hyperuricemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 250mg/kg potassium oxonate. Onion was administrated by oral gavage at dose 5g/kg. The intervention took 2 weeks. At the end of study, serum uric acid levels, Lipid profile and paraxonase activity were determined and data was statistically analyzed.

Results: In healthy rats, effect of onion intake on serum uric acid levels and lipid profile were not statistically significant, but paraxonase activity was increased significant in comparison to healthy control group. The intervention in hyperuricemic rats caused to a significant decrease in uric acid levels and significant increase in paraxonase activity in comparison to hyperuri- cemic control rats. There was a significant positive correlation between paraxonase activity and HDL-C, and significant reverse correlation between paraxonase activity and uric acid concentrations (p<0.05).

Conclusion: Onion intake by decreasing of uric acid levels and increasing of paraxonase activity could be effective in control of hyperuricemia and improvement of antioxidant capacity in hyperuricemic rats. Sci Med J 2011; 10(1): 89-96

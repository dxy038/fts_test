The major objective of this paper is to phenomenally report the stress-dependence and time-dependence of fatigue damage to C/SiC composites, and to tentatively discuss the effects of the fatigue stress levels and the fatigue cycles on the post-fatigue tensile behavior. Results show that compared with the virgin strength of the as-received C/SiC specimens, the tensile strengths of the as-fatigued specimens after 86,400 cycles were increased by 8.47% at the stresses of 90 ± 30 MPa, 23.47% at 120 ± 40 MPa, and 9.8% at 160 ± 53 MPa. As cycles continued, however, the post-fatigue strength of the composites gradually decreased after the peak of 23.47%, at which the optimal strength enhancement was obtained because the mean fatigue stress of 120 MPa was the closest to thermal residual stress (TRS), and caused TRS relieve largely during the fatigue. Most interestingly, there was a general inflexion appeared on the post-fatigue tensile stress–strain curves, which was just equal to the historic maximum fatigue stress acted upon the as-fatigued specimens. Below this inflexion stress the tensile curves revealed the apparent linear behavior with little AE response, and above that nonlinearity with new damage immediately emitted highly increase rate of AE activities. This ‘stress memory’ characteristic was strongly relevant to damaged microstructures of the as-fatigued composites in the form of the coating/matrix cracks, interface debonding/wear, and fiber breaking, which resulted undoubtedly in reduction of modulus but in proper increase of strength via TRS relief.

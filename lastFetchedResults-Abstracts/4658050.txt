Hasta Mudra - a Sanskrit word resembles as a hand gestures which are practiced individually or as a series of gestures flowing one into the next. This paper gives glimpse of Indian Sign Language, its dialects and varieties and recent efforts in the direction of its standardization. Also a proposed methodology is discussed to recognize static single hand gestures of a subset of Indian sign language. The present achievements provide the basis for future applications with the objective of supporting the integration of deaf people into the hearing society. The proposed recognition system aims for signer-independent operation and utilizes a single web camera for data acquisition to ensure user-friendliness. The goal is to create a system which can identify gestures of human hand and use them to convey information without the use of interpreter. This paper has summarized the study of Indian sign language and its varieties. Also a simple recognition system is proposed.

The map matching problem is, given a spatial road network and a sequence of locations of an object moving on the network, to identify the path in the network that the moving object passed through. In this paper, an integer programming formulation for the offline map matching problem is presented. This is the first approach that gives the optimal solution with respect to a widely used objective function for map matching.

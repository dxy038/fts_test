Background and Aim: Motion sickness (MS) is usually generated when there is a mismatch between the senses which serve balance. One of these senses is related to vestibular system, so it is highly possible that MS reflects in vestibular test results. But there are some conflicts in correlation between vestibular findings and MS. Thus, the objective of this study was to provide an overview of vestibular tests findings in individuals with MS.
Recent Findings: It has been demonstrated that susceptible subjects to different types of MS have more pathologic results in vestibular tests, such as eye movement recordings and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) results, asymmetry ratios and posturography results in particular.
Conclusion: Based on abnormalities in various vestibular tests related to MS, possible contribution of signals from any part of the vestibular organ is likely in sensory conflict and triggering MS. Vestibular test results apparently can separate subjects with different susceptibilities to MS, but it seems difficult to differentiate susceptibilities to various types of MS.

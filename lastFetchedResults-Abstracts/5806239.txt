Image Fusion and Mosaic is one of important technologies for image processing. Its objective is to mix many of images with overlapping each other into one image. In this paper, Image Fusion and Mosaic is applied to handle many moon landform image from Chang´E-1 satallite data. An moon landform image fusion and mosaic method base SIFT is proposed. Firstly, moon image information from Chang´E-1 Satelliate data is introduced. And then, features of SIFT is analysised, which contains generation of scale-space, space extreme detection and key point location and processing, images matches and fusion. Finally, four moon image from CE-1 data is mosaic using the proposed mothed, and Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed image fusion and mosaic method.

Quantum cryptography is one of the most promising technologies for guaranteeing the absolute security in communications over various advanced networks, including fiber networks and wireless networks. In particular, quantum key distribution is an efficient encryption scheme on implementing secure satellite communications between satellites and ground stations. However, it faces many new challenges such as high attenuation and low polarization-preserving capability or extreme sensitivity to the environment. In order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) provisioning of quantum communications over 3D satellite networks, we need to focus on the security problem and throughput efficiency through correcting the errors resulted from the objective and adversary influences. To overcome these problems, we model the noisy quantum channel and implement an efficient quantum error correction scheme to ensure the security and increase the quantum throughput efficiency in QKD-based satellite networks. The simulation results obtained show that our proposed efficient QEC scheme for QoS guarantee outperforms the other existing quantum error correction schemes in terms of security and the quantum throughput efficiency.

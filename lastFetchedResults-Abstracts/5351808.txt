This paper describes a novel methodology for regulating electricity demand peaks for home appliances. To achieve this objective, we will make use of the reversible fair scheduling algorithm originally developed for telecommunication networks. The main concept behind this approach is the aggregation of home appliances into priority classes and the definition of a maximum power consumption threshold which is not allowed to be exceeded during peak hours. According to the bandwidth demand and priority of each class, the reversible fair scheduling algorithm delays some of the appliances and prolongs their operation. In this way, it is guaranteed that the power consumption is maintained below the maximum allowed limit. The latter can become beneficial for both energy companies and users. Energy companies will be capable of regulating power generation during peak demand, which has always been a major task. Moreover, users will be granted lower electricity bill rates for accepting prolonging the operation of some of their home appliances.

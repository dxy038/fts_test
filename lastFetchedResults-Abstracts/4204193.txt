A Cross-layer Bandwidth Request Algorithm Based on Chaotic Prediction Model (CBRA-CPM) is proposed in this paper. CBRA-CPM deals with the problem of the design of a bandwidth request algorithm for a satellite access network using a chaotic prediction model. Moreover, cross-layer architecture is designed. CBRA-CPM can perceive the channel state. That is, it can change the quantity of resources requested from the Network Control Center (NCC) according to the weather conditions. The objective is to guarantee a target Quality of Service (QoS) to internet traffic. OPNET software is used to build a simulation system. The performance of CBRA-CPM is compared with Demand Assignment Multiple Access Algorithm based on Chaotic Prediction Model (DAMA-CPM). Simulation results show that CBRA-CPM outperforms DAMA-CPM in packet delivery ratio and the end-to-end delay of the network. Compared with DAMA-CPM, the packet delivery ratio is 7.2% higher and the end-to-end delay is 22.3% lower when CBPA-CPM is utilized.

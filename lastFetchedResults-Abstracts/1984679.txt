The objective of the work presented was to provide a paint production company with a tool for strategic decisions in product development that could combine environmental and economic indicators with REACH information. The tool was to be in a form that would provide visual representation of several factors that are important for the company's product development, in a form that could be incorporated into current product development processes. The paper describes the indicators used, shows visual results from the trial of the strategy matrix tool, and outlines and discusses potential limitations.

fshore coatings products analysed were within the VOC (volatile organic compounds) concentration proposed by the European Directive limiting the VOC content in products (Ökopol, 2009). The products that have the lowest VOC concentrations score the highest (worst) on Total REACH Score. The trial has led to the tool being incorporated at specific “gates” (or milestones) in the company's product development process. The paper shows that close collaborative effort yielded a practically useful tool for strategic decision-making.

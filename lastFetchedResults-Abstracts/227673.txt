A technique to achieve an efficient and low cost unity power factor for a three-phase
controlled rectifier is described. The proposed technique can be used to retrofit a variety of thyristor
converters for various applications. It consists of a thyristor bridge, three bidirectional switches,
and a current shaping network. The bidirectional switches are turned on at double the line
frequency of 50Hz. Its current shaping network is very simple and consists of only two capacitors
and three resistors. The scheme provides a simple, light, fast and economical upgrading to the
existing controlled rectifier-based DC drives. In general, it is also suitable for medium to high
power ACâ€“DC converters used in UPS, HVDC, etc.

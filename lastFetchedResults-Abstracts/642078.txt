Objective
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of grape seed extract (GSE) on the fat-metabolizing enzymes pancreatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and hormone-sensitive lipase in vitro and evaluate its potential application as a treatment for obesity.
Methods
Crushed grape seeds were extracted in ethanol, and the extract was assayed for the measurement of inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase activities and on lipolysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Results
The GSE rich in bioactive phytochemicals showed inhibitory activity on the fat-metabolizing enzymes pancreatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase, thus suggesting that GSE might be useful as a treatment to limit dietary fat absorption and the accumulation of fat in adipose tissue. The observed reduction in intracellular lipolytic activity of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes may reduce the levels of circulating free fatty acids that have been linked to insulin resistance in obese patients.
Conclusion
The GSE rich in compounds that inhibit lipases may provide a safe, natural, and cost-effective weight control treatment.

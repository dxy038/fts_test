Hydroforming is relatively a new technology to manufacture ball valve shell, and the process parameters in hydroforming have the critical effects on the final part quality. In this paper, a novel method of optimization for the process parameters is developed. On basis of the quality demand of parts, the objective function is defined. Using the stress ratios as the optimization variables, the genetic algorithm in combination with FE codes is applied to search the optimal process parameters. According to the optimal process parameters, the verified experiment is carried out. The results show that genetic algorithm is a feasible optimization method for obtaining the optimal process parameters in hydroforming.

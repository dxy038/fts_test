Operating room (OR) is the most resource-intensive place in a hospital as well as the bottlenecks of resource and patient flow during treatment process. A reasonable operating room scheduling plan can help to develop the utilization of operating room and increase patients&#194;&#191; satisfaction. But most of the domestic hospitals haven&#194;&#191;t inducted scientific administration methods to build their operating room schedules in real-life applications. In this paper, we develop a fuzzy multi-objective programming model to optimize the OR scheduling, so as to gain the optimal results in mathematics. And we also provide a numerical example to test the model.

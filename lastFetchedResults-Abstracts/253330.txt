Three greenhouses and the Central Garden of The
Botanical Garden of Pavia were monitored for 1 year
with the objective of investigating the occurrence of
both airborne fungal spores and phylloplane fungi. By
using an SAS air sampler, the higher fungal spore concentrations
were detected in tropical and Mediterranean
greenhouses. A total of 72 species belonging to
42 genera, some of which are related to the presence
of plants ex situ, were isolated from Petri plates after
exposure. Some airborne fungi, such as Aspergillus
spp., Penicillium spp. and Conidiobolus spp., which are
responsible for human allergies and respiratory problems,
were also detected. Forty-four genera of phylloplane
fungi were identified from leaves randomly
collected from greenhouse plants. Most of the aerial
fungal taxa isolated were also detected from the phylloplane.
Some phytopathogenic taxa, as exemplified by
Gliocladium vermoeseni, Graphium sp., Peronospora sp.,
and Zygosporium oscheoides, were isolated only from
the phylloplane. The information obtained from qualitative
and quantitative analysis of fungi can be a useful
tool in the control of indoor air quality, thereby
guaranteeing ex situ plant conservation and occupational
health safety

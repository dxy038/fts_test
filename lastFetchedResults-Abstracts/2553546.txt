Background and Objective: Wound healing is influenced by many internal (pathophysiological) and external (microorganisms and drugs) factors. The purpose of this study is the histological comparison of the effect of using edible honey and phenytoin in healing the hard palate wounds in rats through a pilot study.
Materials and Methods: A total of 45 Wistar rats with an approximate weight of 200± 10 were randomly divided into three groups. The surface of the hard palate was cut transversely with dimensions 6 × 4 mm under general anesthesia. Treatment was started the day after surgery, so that the first group received oral phenytoin and the second one honey and the third group was considered as control. For histopathological studies on days three, seven, and 14 after surgery, 3 groups out of 3 categories were killed and biopsied and then slides were prepared from the wound site. Then, the size and persistence of newly formed epithelium, number of newly formed vessels, lymphocytes, neutrophils and collagen levels were investigated.
Results: The maximum amount of neutrophil (acute inflammation) on the third day in edible honey group had statistically significant difference compared to the seventh day (P = 0.010). Also, the maximum level of lymphocytes (chronic inflammation) on the third day had statistically significant difference compared to fourteenth day (p = 0.005). The highest rate of collagen was on day 14 in edible honey group. The maximum vascularization had been on the seventh day in phenytoin group, but this process was declining from the7th to 14th day, but the difference was not statistically significant. Quantities and qualitative data were analyzed by ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis, respectively.
Conclusion: The oral honey can be effective in wound healing by reducing inflammation, increasing the tissue collagen and increasing re-epithelialization. However, it seems that the use of oral phenytoin has no significant impact.

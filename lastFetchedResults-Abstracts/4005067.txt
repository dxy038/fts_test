A structured genetic algorithm (SGA) approach is developed for robust controller design based on the concept of an H<sup>&#8734;</sup> loop-shaping technique and the method of inequalities. Such an SGA is capable of simultaneously searching the orders and coefficients of the precompensator and postcompensator for the weighted plant. It is, therefore, not necessary to predefine the order of compensators as in usual practice. A multiple objective ranking approach is also incorporated so that the design criteria of extreme plants can be easily achieved. The effectiveness of such a technique is illustrated by a high-purity distillation column design example

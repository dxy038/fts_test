Model Driven Architecture (MDA) defines a software building process based on the production and transformation of models. In this context, QVT-Relations is a declarative language designed to permit both unidirectional and bidirectional model transformations. QVT Relations is a standard defined by the Object Management Group(OMG). On the other hand, the code optimization is the process of modifying a system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. Refactoring code define the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. In this work, we propose a technique based on MDA. This technique implements a set of refactoring rules in QVT-Relations.

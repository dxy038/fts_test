This paper presents a simulation-optimization model integrating MODSIM river basin model and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for basin-scale optimal water allocation considering system's performance and equity indexes. The proposed model considers reliability, resilience, vulnerability and equity indexes in water supply and allocation directly in its objective function through which the trade-off between different indexes and their influence on water allocation results can be assessed. The model has been applied in Atrak River Basin water allocation problem as a real case study, where there are serious competition and conflicts between upstream and downstream provinces in using the basin water resources. The model has been capable of presenting good solutions in terms of all objectives compared to the best possible values obtained for each objective when ignoring other objectives.

This paper presents an approach for optimal placement of capacitor banks in a real power network for the purpose of economic minimization of loss and enhancement of voltage. The objective function includes the cost of power losses and capacitors. Constraint includes voltage limit. The optimization problem is solved by the use of MATLAB and Digsilent in conjunction and by Genetic Algorithm. As a result the size and the place of capacitors are determined. By applying the proposed method, the economic costs and power losses are reduced to a considerable degree while enhancing the voltage profile. Simulation results are investigated on ZanjanÂ´s power network.

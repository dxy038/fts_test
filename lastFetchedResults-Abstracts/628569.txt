Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an account of the development and
implementation of social accounting at the UK fair trade organisation Traidcraft plc.
Design/methodology/approach – Using an ethnographic approach, the paper critically reflects on
the role of this emerging form of accounting in an ongoing intra-organisational struggle for meaning
within Traidcraft over the management of its “fair-trade” business.
Findings – The paper argues that the implementation of a formal system of “social bookkeeping”
largely failed to achieve its intended objective to further augment the organisation’s accountability
relationships with its key stakeholders. However, in the context of organisational change, the
accounting intervention was nevertheless significant, in a quite unexpected (and possibly undesirable)
way. Along with a number of other intra-organisational factors, the intervention produced a decisive,
management-led change within the organisation towards a more commercial interpretation of its
religious principles, which the organisation termed “New Traidcraft”.
Originality/value – The paper contributes to the change/appropriation debate surrounding
corporate social reporting by providing insights into the complex range of political, functional and
social factors that may influence the outcome of social accounting interventions. The paper also
provides evidence to support the argument that social and environmental accounting interventions
can be influential (if not necessarily desirable) when they are aligned with substantive changes in the
organisation itself.

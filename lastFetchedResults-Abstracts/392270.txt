Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser vaporization for turbinate has rapidly gained acceptance in Japan for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of laser output, patient age, and the presence of a deviated nasal septum on treatment outcome in patients with intractable allergic rhinitis. Methods: The inferior turbinates were irradiated at an output of 3 or 5 W for 0.1 s. Results: Of 67 patients, 43 (64.2%) were judged to have symptoms which improved markedly or moderately after a single treatment. Treatment was more effective with a laser output of 5 W than with an output of 3 W. However, treatment was judged less effective in patients aged 15 years or less than in older patients. The presence of a slightly deviated nasal septum had no effect on treatment outcome. Conclusion: Although assessing outcome on the basis of symptoms is difficult, we believe that these findings will suggest the optimal conditions and indications for laser surgery for allergic rhinitis.

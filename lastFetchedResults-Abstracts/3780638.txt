With the increasing demand of users in the broadcasting and communication services, coverage and interference prediction techniques need to be more accurate and applicable under different conditions. No single propagation model satisfies all the variations observed by the signal. Tuning of the existing models and development of new models are continuing and ongoing processes. With this objective in the present study path loss exponents have been deduced from various VHF/UHF measurements conducted over different regions of Indian subcontinent. These have been compared with the model of Perez-Vega and Zamanillo. The suitability of the model and the deviations has been presented in the paper

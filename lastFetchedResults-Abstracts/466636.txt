Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the Centers for Disease Control recommendations for the treatment of gonococcal infection in pregnancy. Study Design: One hundred sixty-one women who were referred with probable endocervical gonorrhea underwent pretreatment endocervical, anal, and oral cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The women were randomly assigned to receive ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly or cefixime 400 mg orally. Treatment was open and in a 1:1 distribution. There were 95 evaluable patients. The tests of cure cultures were performed 4 to 10 days after treatment. Results: Eighty-six women (91%) had endocervical infection; 39 women (41%) had anal infection, and 11 women (12%) had pharyngeal infection. Fifty of 95 women (53%) had concomitant endocervical chlamydial infection. The overall efficacy was 91 of 95 subjects (95.8%; 95% CI, 89.6%-98.8%). Ceftriaxone was effective in 41 of 43 cases (95%; 95% CI, 84.2%-99.4%), and cefixime was effective in 50 of 52 cases (96%; 95% CI, 86.8%-99.5%). No significant difference was noted in the overall efficacy or by site of infection. Three of the 4 women who experienced treatment failures admitted to unprotected intercourse before their test of cure culture. Conclusion: Both intramuscular ceftriaxone 125 mg and oral cefixime 400 mg appear to be effective for the treatment of gonococcal infection in pregnancy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:629-32.)

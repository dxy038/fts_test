Constrained optimization problem (COP) is skillfully converted into dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization problem (DCMOP) in this paper. Then dynamic constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DCMOEAs) can be used to solve the COP problem by solving the DCMOP problem. Seemingly, a complex DCMOEA algorithm is used to solve a relatively simple COP problem. However, the DCMOEA algorithm can adopt Pareto domination to achieve a good trade off between fast converging and global searching, and therefore a DCMOEA algorithm can effectively solve a COP problem by solving the DCMOP problem. An instance of DCMOEA was used to to solve 13 widely used constraint benchmark problems, The experimental results suggest it outperforms or performs similarly to other state-of-the-art algorithms referred to in this paper. The efficient performance of the DCMOEA algorithm shows, to some extend, the DCMOP model works well.

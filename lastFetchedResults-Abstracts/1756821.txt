Introduction & Objective: Capoeta capoeta gracilic is one of the native and valuable species in basin from the south of Caspian Sea. The hematological indexes in fish physiology are influential, so the accurate understanding of blood situation of this fish can be useful to protect of these valuable stocks
Material and Methods: In the present survey, in order to investigate the effect of age on some biochemical parameters related to blood serum of Capoeta Capoeta gracilic, two stations in intermediate area of Siyahroud River, Mazandaran were selected and in each station, 25 samples were catched. The sampling operation was carried out during the reproduction season and the fish were in four age classes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Blood obtaining was based on caudal peduncle incision in smaller fish and caudal peduncle vein and heart ponxion in larger fish, then non-electrolyte experiments of blood serum including Glucose, Cholesterol, Triglycerides Total protein, Albumin, Globulin, Blood urea, Creatinine, AST, ALT,ALP as well non-electrolyte such as Calcium, Sodium, and Potassium were done based on standard and experimental method. 
Results: According to obtained results, it was observed that the biochemical factors of blood serum of this species from Siyahroud in several ages, have different fluctuations, but statistically, There were significant difference in Calcium, Cholesterol and Sodium rate but in the other parameters there weren't any significant difference. According to the present results, the studied factors can somewhat be influenced by physiological factors such as age.

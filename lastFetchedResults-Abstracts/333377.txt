Objective: Evaluation of the studies for the use of uterine artery embolization in various conditions in both obstetrics and gynecology. Design: Literature review. Results: Uterine artery embolization was successful in controlling postpartum hemorrhage in 94.9% of the cases. It was effective in controlling the bleeding in 96% of cases with uterine arteriovenous malformations and in 100% of the cases with abdominal and cervical pregnancies. Recently, it has been introduced as a line of treatment for uterine fibroids. It controlled bleeding in 82–92% of cases, and lead to 20–64% reduction in size of fibroids. Conclusions: Uterine artery embolization is of significant value in treating certain hemorrhagic conditions in obstetrics and gynecology including postpartum hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and arteriovenous malformations. Its use in treatment of uterine fibroids is new and needs more collaborative studies by gynecologists and intervention radiologists to evaluate issues related to necrosis of the tumor, sepsis, and the long-term effect on size and recurrence rate.

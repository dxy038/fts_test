Objective
Lower urinary tract symptoms are common among older women. The Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (BFLUTS) questionnaire was designed to assess a wide range of symptoms, including incontinence, and impact on sexual function and quality of life. This paper describes development and validation of a scored form BFLUTS questionnaire.
Study design
Baseline and 6-month follow-up data from a randomized trial compared tension-free vaginal tape with colposuspension for 344 women with urodynamically proven stress incontinence. Problematic and responsive items were identified and subjected to factor analysis to develop a scoring system.
Results
Three domains were identified to assess symptoms: incontinence (5 items); voiding (3 items); and filling (4 items); with additional subscales for sexual function (2 items) and quality of life (5 items). All scales have simple additive scores.
Conclusion
A scored form of the BFLUTS questionnaire is now available and should be useful in research and clinical practice in urology and gynecology.

This paper proposes an optimal congestion management approach in a deregulated electricity market using Particle swarm optimization (PSO) under Combined Economic and Emission dispatch (CEED) environment. CEED problem has been formulated as a multi-objective problem by considering both economy and emission simultaneously. This bi-objective CEED problem is converted into single objective function using price penalty factor approach. The aim of the proposed work is to minimize deviations from preferred transaction schedules and hence the congestion cost. Generator reactive power support is considered to lower the congestion cost. The values of Transmission Congestion Distribution factors (TCDFs) are used to select redispatch of generators. Numerical results on test systems namely IEEE 30 Bus and IEEE 118 bus systems are presented for illustration purpose and the results are compared with Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) and Economic Emission Dispatch (EED). The comprehensive experimental results prove that the PSO is one among the challenging optimization methods which is indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions for the proposed problem.

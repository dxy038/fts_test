The new field of location proteomics seeks to provide
a comprehensive, objective characterization of the subcellular
locations of all proteins expressed in a given cell type. Previous
work has demonstrated that automated classifiers can recognize
the patterns of all major subcellular organelles and structures
in fluorescence microscope images with high accuracy. However,
since some proteins may be present in more than one organelle,
this paper addresses a more difficult task: recognizing a pattern
that is a mixture of two or more fundamental patterns. The approach
utilizes an object-based image model, in which each image
of a location pattern is represented by a set of objects of distinct,
learned types. Using a two-stage approach in which object types
are learned and then cell-level features are calculated based on
the object types, the basic location patterns were well recognized.
Given the object types, a multinomial mixture model was built
to recognize mixture patterns. Under appropriate conditions,
synthetic mixture patterns can be decomposed with over 80%
accuracy, which, for the first time, shows that the problem of computationally
decomposing subcellular patterns into fundamental
organelle patterns can be solved.

This paper enlightens the control and modeling of modular multilevel converter (MMC) with LCL filter. The P-Resonant (P-Res) controller with current control approach is analyzed. The main objective in this approach is to improve the effect of the resonance peak of LCL filter. The P- Res controller is intended with an analytical methodology for better frequency response and reduced harmonic content. The unregulated supply from renewable energy source is also controlled by DC link controller for the proper functioning of the system. The system is simulated using MatLab and the results are presented. The effectiveness of the controller is verified experimentally.

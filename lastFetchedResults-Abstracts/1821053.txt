Objective
rpose of the present study was to investigate the electrolyte alterations of submandibular/sublingual saliva in submandibular sialolithiasis patients compared with saliva from healthy controls.

dibular/sublingual saliva was collected from 10 submandibular sialolithiasis patients and from 10 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Ion chromatography was performed to determine the concentrations of inorganic cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sodium), inorganic anions (chloride, phosphate, nitrate, and sulphate) and organic anions (thiocyanate, lactate, acetate, and citrate).
s
lcium concentration was significantly higher in sialolithiasis patients than in controls (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the levels of magnesium and citrate in the saliva of sialolithiasis patients were significantly reduced compared to the values obtained in controls (P &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were detected among other ions.
sions
ndings indicate that saliva electrolyte composition of sialolithiasis patients is substantially altered with respect to crystallisation mechanisms. Increased calcium ion as a crystallisation substance and decreased magnesium and citrate ions as crystallisation inhibitors may be involved in the etiopathology of calculi formation.

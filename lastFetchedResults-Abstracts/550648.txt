In Eastern Christianity, prayer, especially Jesus prayer, is of high importance. In this kind of religion, prayer has been at first addressing God (Father), but later on through the formation of Jesus prayer, the addressing was toward Jesus substituting other kinds of prayer. Being a means rather than an objective, prayer is primarily verbal, and then it should be established into one's heart (the existence center for mankind). The purpose of heartfelt prayer is to keep away from any kind of mental illusions (Hesuchia) and to unite with the trinity of God during the time when the Holy Spirit will be activated in the prayer's heart. Later on to achieve Hesuchia there were some helpful methods of praying such as invocation, clerical father(Guru) and recording the breath was proposed.
Key words:
Prayer; verbal, logical, and heartfelt prayer; Jesus prayer; Hesuchia; Clerical father.

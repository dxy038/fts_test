In this paper, we analyze the properties of the vector fields associated with all possible configurations of a single-phase DC/AC inverter with the objective of designing a hybrid controller for the generation of an approximation of a sinusoidal reference signal. Using forward invariance tools for general hybrid systems, a hybrid controller is designed for the switched differential equations capturing the dynamics of the DC/AC inverter. Then, global asymptotic stability of a set of points nearby the reference trajectory, called the tracking band, is established. This property is found to be robust to small perturbations, and variation of the input voltage. Simulations illustrating the major results are included.

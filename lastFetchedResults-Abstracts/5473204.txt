This paper presents a RF behavioral library. The objective of this library is to validate the future RF transceiver system, for example for BER specifications. The library includes key RF blocks such as Low Noise Amplifier, Channel, Mixers, Power Amplifier, Filters, used in RF transceivers. The model is based on block diagram and behavioral descriptions. The models present two aspects, the first is based on the development of RTL code. The second uses the advantages of block diagram simulator as phase noise and noise figure generation to reduce drawbacks of behavioral limitations and the complete library is available in a unified simulation RF environment to simplify the simulation setup overhead, hence reducing simulation time while still obtaining acceptable accuracy versus Spice level simulation.

Interference alignment (IA) is a multi-user wireless communication strategy that enables several transmitters simultaneous communicate with their paired receivers without interfering each other. IA is a multiplexing gain optimal strategy at the expense of requiring the global channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters. Most previous works assume the availability of perfect CSI which is not possible in practice. The performance of IA algorithms based on perfect CSI drop dramatically in circumstance where CSI errors exist. In this paper we propose a robust minimum mean square error (MMSE) IA algorithm with imperfect CSI. Based on a Gaussian statistic channel error model, we give the mean square error objective function with per transmitter power constraint. The objective function is not joint convex in precoders and decoders, but convex in precoders with fixed decoders and vice versa. We convert the problem to two convex sub problems and iteratively find the solutions. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm when CSI errors exist.

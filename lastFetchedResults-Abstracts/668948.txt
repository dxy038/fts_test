An approach based on the characterisation of individual operations by water demands and sources has been utilised to study an operating integrated pulp and paper mill. The search for novel whitewater network configurations as a function of specified process constraints and objective functions was done by means of a genetic algorithm coupled with linear programming. Potential solutions are derived from an initial superstructure representation which embodies all possible source and demand connections by an evolutive process akin to natural selection and adaptation. Various objective functions were investigated. Innovative strategies have been identified and are being considered for implementation.

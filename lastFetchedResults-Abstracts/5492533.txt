This paper presents simulation results using the wavelet transform (WT) to implement the CIS (continuous interleaved sampling) speech signal processing strategy for cochlear implants. The objective of this paper is to provide a fast and efficient algorithm for multi-channel speech signal analysis in cochlear implants. Results show that the Mallat algorithm for WT is capable of realizing fast calculations in a CIS processor. The final results are consistent with that based on a band-pass filter bank

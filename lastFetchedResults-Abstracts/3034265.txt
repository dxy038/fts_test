Land degradation involves conditions of reduced net primary production (NPP). Our objective was to develop and evaluate a land degradation monitoring approach that is based on NPP. NPP was modeled using the Global Production Efficiency Model (GLO-PEM) and 1km AVHRR data. Degraded areas in the Northern Province of South Africa were successfully detected using NPP, Rain Use Efficiency (RUE) and Local NPP Scaling (LNS) as measures of land condition.

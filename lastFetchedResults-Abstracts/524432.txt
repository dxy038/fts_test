Background – HIV infection is found worldwide and the number of cases is increasing rapidly, particularly in developing countries. In recent years, the rate of HIV infection seems to be increasing in Iran, particularly due to the increased number of intravenous (IV) drug abusers who are infected in prisons and rehabilitation centers. Methods – From September 1998 to April 2000, we reviewed 44 HIV-positive patients who presented to Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Epidemiological factors, immunological status, associated infections and complications were evaluated. Results – Of 44 patients, 4 (10%) were females and 40 (90%) were males. The mean age was 38 years. The most frequent route of infection was IV drug abuse (75%), followed by heterosexual activity (16%) and blood transfusion (9%). Flow cytometric tests in 39 patients revealed that 16 had lymphocyte CD4+ counts less than 500 cells/ìL. The purified protein derivative test was positive in 10 of 30 cases (33%). Eight of 39 (21%) patients had hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 17 of 39 (44%) had hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb); none of these patients had been vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Twenty-nine of 39 (81%) cases were positive for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Five patients had clinical tuberculosis. Four (9%) patients died. Conclusion – Our results help to set priorities and to rationalize the availability of prevention and treatment programs in our country, particularly, among IV drug abusers. Multidisciplinary and multilevel approaches, both by government and private health care providers, will have a positive impact on HIV status in Iran.

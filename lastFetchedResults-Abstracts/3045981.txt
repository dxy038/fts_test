The paper discusses a bidirectional DC/DC converter for interfacing an energy storage device in an autonomous power system, which consists of wind turbines and diesel generation units. The operation condition variations, such as switching load, could cause significant dynamics in an autonomous system. An energy storage device can effectively increase the utilization of the renewable energy and improve the capability of dealing with dynamics. This paper studies a two-bridge type of power electronic system for interfacing an energy storage system that can provide the short-term power balance and smoothes the power variation. A control strategy is presented. The simulation results have demonstrated that the system can provide fast response to secure the system reliability and power quality

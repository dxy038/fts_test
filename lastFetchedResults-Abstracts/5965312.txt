METHODS Blood sample of 137 male workers occupationally exposed to lead and 140 male worker without exposure history were collected, of which the concentrations of blood lead (PbB) were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, and concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (&#915;SH), triiodothyronine(T3), thyroxine (T4), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (&#915;) were measured using radioimmunity method. RESULTS The results showed that concentration of PbB were significantly higher (P&lt;;0.01) compared with non-exposured group when the concentration ofT3 (1.26&#177;0.24)ng/ml,T4(75.22&#177;17.17)ng/ml, T(3.98&#177;1.37)ng/ml, LH(3.17&#177;1.21)mIU/ml in exposure group were significantly lower compared with T3(1.47&#177;0.32)ng/ml, T4(89.92&#177;21.32)ng/ml, T(5.29&#177;1.84)ng/ml, LH(10.18&#177;1.63)mIU/ml (P&lt;;0.05) in non-exposured group. In contrast, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration were significantly increased (P&lt;;0.05) than control group. The differences between the FSH was not significantly different from that in non-exposured group. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the lead exposure may not only harm the function of thyroid, which might injure endocrine function, also interfere with the secretion of sex hormone.

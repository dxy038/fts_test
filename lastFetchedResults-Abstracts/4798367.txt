The development of rapid turnaround capabilities to support mission critical Embedded Computer Systems (ECS) is necessary to ensure the most accurate and cost-effective tools are used to enhance the ECS software. Rapid Turnaround (RT) is defined as correcting a system deficiency in a timely manner through some combination of software, firmware, and/or hardware modifications. In order to effectively achieve rapid turnaround of ECS software, the data processed during a mission anomaly must be provided to the radar analyst for mission recreation to ensure appropriate changes are made to the Operational Flight Program (OFF). Anomalous behavior is defined as unexpected avionics system performance. This data requirement has determined the need for an instrumentation system hosted on-board a tactical aircraft to collect and record avionics data. The development of the Data Integration and Collection Environment (DICE) System by the United States Air Force and TRW is a program designed to address this need. The objective of the DICE effort is to develop a low-cost on-board airborne data collection system utilizing the F-15 APG-63 radar as a proof-of-concept. This collected data will aid system engineers in the analysis of an avionics systemÂ´s performance and operation by providing a re-creation of the anomaly occurring in an operational environment. As a result, DICE will enhance the rapid reprogramming process of embedded computer systems software. This paper presents the advantages of an operational avionics instrumentation system, the impacts for deploying such a system field-wide, the potential dual-use of the technology and introduces an operational instrumentation technology development program, DICE

In order to achieve on-line monitoring and condition evaluation t of the main electrical equipment, improving the self-healing ability of network, a model aiming at insulation condition classification evaluation of electrical equipment for running based on matter-element theory was established. The Characteristic parameters affecting the insulation condition of running main electrical equipment was analyzed. Through building hierarchical status of evaluation indices system and applying Euclid approach degree evaluation function, the classification evaluation of main electrical equipment was achieved. Instance of the application in power system, the result of the classification evaluation of the electrical equipment based on matter-element theory has proved, which is objective and more practical for maintenance work.

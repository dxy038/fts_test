The aim of this study is to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Astara border area and to present the development strategies based on the capacities and potentials in the region and also to investigate the strategic importance of the region for future development using SWOT strategic model. The research method, based on its objective, is of an applied research type and based on the nature it is of a descriptive-analytical research type accompanying with field studies. In this way, after the library findings and the field observations of internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats) were listed and weighted score was given to each of them. The factors that had the highest weighting score were considered to have more effective role in the development of this region. Finally, by the given weight to each factor it was found that the total scores of the aggressive strategy (SO) was higher than other strategies. The Analyses of the model suggests that a proper strategy for sustainable development of the Astara city is an aggressive strategy in which the strengths should be preserved and strengthened and available opportunities should be used to achieve optimal sustainable development. We also need to avoid expert-driven and elitist look and to attach a bottom-up participation into it to achieve a real development in the region.

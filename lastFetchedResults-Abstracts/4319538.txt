In case of large generators, air-cooling system restricts itself up to 60 MW generation capacities whereas, hydrogen-cooling system (HCS) is necessary beyond capacity of 120-130 MW unit(s) and above. It is essential to incorporate supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based HCS for the effective cooling of large generators, and taking proactive actions as and when required. A `Seven Stage Warm Redundant StructuredÂ´ (SeSWRS) HCS is proposed for the dedicated cooling of n&#215;500 MW size generators of a fossil-fueled power plant. Objective of this paper is to analyze the system reliability of the plant processes. It also analyses the chance of system failure of the proposed HCS than that of the existing systems using fault tree parameters (FTPs), typically known as fault tree analysis (FTA). System reliability of the proposed SeSWRS has evaluated using MATLAB as per specifications guided by IEEE 1413-2010. The entire process control and instrumentation of the proposed system has designed and simulated on RSView Studio, a Rockwell Automation.

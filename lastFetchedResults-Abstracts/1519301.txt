Objective: Hospital performance in the utilization of resources can be assessed using the specified criteria. The Pabon-Lasso provides a realistic assessment of the current situation and gives a strategy for a more efficient use of health care services. The present study aimed to evaluate the performance of teaching hospitals affiliated to TUMS using the Pabon-Lasso Model.
Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional and retrospective study; and eight general hospitals of TUMS were evaluated in year 2012. We used three indicators (bed occupancy rate, average length of stay, and bed turnover rate), which are gained from statistical database of TUMS. The data were analyzed by excel software and Pabon-Lasso graph.
Result: There were 4 (50 percent) hospitals in quadrant 4, one (12/5 percent) hospital in quadrant 3, three (37/5 percent) hospitals in quadrant 2 and there was no any hospital in quadrant 1.
Conclusion: Pobon-Lasso chart help us to compare the three key indicators of hospital performance simultaneity in addition to assessment of centers performance in respect of governance.

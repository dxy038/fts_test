Background: Oral health in Down syndrome (DS) children has some peculiar aspects that must
be considered in the follow-up of these patients. The objective of the present study was to assess
the prevalence of dental caries and treatment needs among children with DS in Yemen and also to
investigate the association between these outcomes with various socio-demographic and clinical
variables.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 96 children with DS aged between 6
and 15 years. Data were gathered through the use of a questionnaire and clinical observation. The
dentition status and the treatment needs were recorded according to World Health Organization
recommendations. ANOVA, Chi-square test, t-test and multiple regression analyses were applied
using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) version 20.0 software,
with P  <  0.05 considered as signifi cant.
Results: The results showed that 93.8% of the subjects had dental caries; overall, decayed missing
fi lled surfaces (dmfs), decayed missing fi lled teeth (dmft), DMFS, DMFT were 10.35, 4.44, 4.32 and
2.45, respectively. Stepwise linear regression analysis has revealed that age was the most important
predictor for DMFT and DMFS, while early age and less frequent teeth brushing were the most
predictors for dmft and dmfs. Restorative care and extractions were the most needed specifi c
treatments.
Conclusion: The fi ndings of this study demonstrate that children with DS in Yemen have a high
prevalence of dental caries and extensive unmet needs of dental treatment. They would benefi t
from frequent oral health assessment.

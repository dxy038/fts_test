The objective of this paper is to design a controller for servo motor in discrete-time systems. The effect of sampling time on the proposed design will further discussed. Real-time data gained from the experimental is used to obtain the transfer function to design the PID controller. In order to get the optimal value of PID controller, ARX model structure was implemented. The effectiveness of the design is validated using MATLAB/Simulink. From the results obtained, it shows that the output for PID controller will gives the best performance of 87.79% at 55 ms sampling time.

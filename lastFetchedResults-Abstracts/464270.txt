OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop an ultrasonographic method of using multiple electronic calipers for on-screen measurement of fetal cardiac axis.
STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred low-risk patients who were seen for antenatal ultrasonography were studied. Standard biometry, anatomic survey, and echocardiography were performed on all fetuses. By use of a four-chamber view fetal cardiac axis was measured with electronic calipers. A table, derived from a trigonometric formula, was created to convert the caliper measurements to cardiac axis in degrees. The results were compared with a protractor-determined fetal cardiac axis.
RESULTS: All echocardiograms had normal results. Fetal cardiac axis (±2 SD) by the ultrasonographic method was 43 degrees (±16 degrees) versus 43 degrees (±14 degrees) by the protractor method. This difference was not significant.
CONCLUSION: An on-screen method to determine fetal cardiac axis by use of multiple calipers is described. It is comparable to a protractor-measured fetal cardiac axis.

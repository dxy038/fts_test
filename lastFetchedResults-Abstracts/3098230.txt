Quantitative factors are usually taken into account, but qualitative factors are neglected when a retailer in distribution chain decides to order. For this reason, a planning model based on multi-agent is supposed to solve adaptive problems and then analyze the problems by using quantitative and qualitative factors to improve the retailerspsila ordering efficiency. Using AHP approach, the multi-attribute analysis method is developed to evaluate the influence factors for ordering quantities. The weight for each retailer is calculated via Super Decisions software. In addition, According to the weights and qualitative data in ERP, a multi-objective decision-making method is given to determine the ordering quantities. The simulation results show that the proposed model based on multi-agent increases ordering flexibility and offers a good planning method with cooperation between retailers and a DC.

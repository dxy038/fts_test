The impact within a known process due to the introduction of new technology may entail many factors such as workflow modification, increase of wait time, modification in service quality, and even cultural changes. The inclusion of these factors into a process affects its performance, but the implementation of innovations may counteract the impact and could even enhance the process. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of the innovations implemented in the X Ray process by the estimation of the learning curves and the estimated time in which the maximum learning may be reached.

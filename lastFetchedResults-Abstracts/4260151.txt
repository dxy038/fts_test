The minimum average total cost of the system as the objective function determines the optimal order cycle and order quantity. Uses example to verify the validity of the model and analyzes the various system parameters on the optimal order quantity and the objective function of the sensitivity. It plays a guiding role to reduce Enterprise inventory cost.

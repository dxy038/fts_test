Video transmission over OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access) system is a challenging problem which involves better received video quality and stringent transmission delays. In this paper, we present a cross-layer design based on the joint optimization of resource allocation and packet scheduling in which the importance of each video packet is taken into consideration. The objective is to maximize the received video quality of all the users subject to the network resource constraint. By employing the Lagrange dual decomposition method, we can obtain the global optimal solution to the optimization problem. We also propose a method of suboptimal solution to reduce the high complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have superior performance.

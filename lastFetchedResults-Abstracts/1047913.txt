In an attempt to characterize additional structural classes that could serve as lead antituberculosis agents, 48 structurally diverse marine-derived natural and semisynthetic compounds were examined for in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Three new classes of compounds including C-19 hydroxy steroids, scalarin sesquiterpenoids and tetrabromo spirocyclohexadienylisoxazolines have been identified as having potential as leads for continued investigations as new antituberculosis agents. New additions to the established antituberculosis structural classes quinone-methide and peptide are also reported.


Background: Antimicrobial packaging is a form of active packaging that could extend the
shelf-life of foods and provides microbial safety for consumers. In order to control undesirable
microorganisms on food surfaces, volatile and non-volatile antimicrobial agents can be
incorporated into polymers. Incorporation of essential oils and other antifungal agents in edible
films composition is an antimicrobial packaging that able to inhibit fungal growth on the
pistachio and aflatoxins production.
Objective: The antifungal activity of Avishan-e Shirazi (Zataria multifora) extracts against
Aspergillus flavus in whey protein concentrate-based coating on pistachio kernels was
investigated.
Methods: The antifungal effect of Avishan-e Shirazi extracts was investigated in culture media
by direct method (cup plate method) and application of whey protein concentrate (WPC) films
as discs (disc deffusion method) incorporated with different concentrations of extracts. In order
to evaluate the antifungal effect of extract in pistachio kernels coated with different
concentrations of extract inoculated with a culture media discs contain 9-day-old growing
A. flavus colony and the growth rate of inoculated discs were measured during 1 week.
Results: In experimental condition, minimal inhibition concentration was achieved by 90 ppm
of ahcoholic extract (30 percent concentration). The results also showed that WPC coating
incorporated with 2500 ppm of Zataria multiflora extracts on pistachio kernels inhibited A.
flavus growth totally.
Conclussion: Regarding to application of importance of contamination with toxigenic fungi in
pistachio kernel is suggested the application of Avishan-e Shirazi extract incorporated in edible
coatings for toxigenic fungi growth and toxin production in foods.

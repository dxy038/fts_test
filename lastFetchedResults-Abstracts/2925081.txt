The overall objective of this work was the study of the visual aspect of the man-machine interface for future aircraft. The primary concept was that of the virtual cockpit in which information is presented in ways which are easily interpreted, unambiguous, economical and spatially consistent with the external world. Such an environment should allow experimentation in laboratory conditions or use in simulation of real activities. The work was limited to the visual element, although a full environment would include, for example, tactile and auditory elements

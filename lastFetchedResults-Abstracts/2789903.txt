There are two important theory to deal with a human relationship. One is called Balance Theory and the other is Socion Theory. Balance theory can simulate how human relations vary on a interaction and Socion Theory can express the difference between subjective relations and objective relations. However, Balance theory cannot apply on the structure of Socion Theory without a modification. The paper proposes how to calculate Balance Theory on a social network expressed by Three Socions.

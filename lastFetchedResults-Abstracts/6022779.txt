This paper presents a database with video clips and results of subjective video quality tests oriented to Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT). It makes them publicly available for the research community in the Quality of Experience field, in order to train, verify and validate video quality assessment objective models. The database consists of the results of two sets of tests, each one with one hundred high definition (HD) and one hundred standard definition (SD) video clips. The first one contains video clips with encoding impairments and simulated packet losses due to transmission degradation. The second one contains video clips obtained from real recordings from two broadcast TV channels using ISDB-T standard. The paper includes a discussion on the criteria to select the clips and the types of impairments, including packet losses patterns, as well as some experience collected during the subjective evaluation sessions. Finally, it presents a software application developed to automate the subjective tests, which also becomes available to the research community.

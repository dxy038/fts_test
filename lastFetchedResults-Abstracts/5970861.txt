Numerical study of radar echoes from the targets in environmental clutters has been of great interest in many applications. In this paper, the bidirectional analytic ray tracing (BART) method for composite scattering from three-dimensional (3D) electrically large complex target above a randomly rough surface is reported. Analytic tracing of polygon ray tubes in bidirectional tracing is developed to precisely calculate the illumination and shadowing of facets, which exempt large patches of the target from any finer meshing. It significantly reduces the complexity relevant to the target electric-size. Numerical examples of angularly composite scattering from a three-dimensional electrically large, e.g., a ship-like target over a randomly rough surface are presented and discussed.

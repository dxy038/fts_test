Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess sexual functioning and patient expectations of sexual functioning after hysterectomy.
Study design
Seventy-five patients who had undergone hysterectomy at an urban academic medical center were surveyed about sexual function at the time of hysterectomy and after hysterectomy. Chi-squared tests compared responses for discrete outcomes.
Result
Most patients expected no change in sexual desire or orgasm quality. Hysterectomy had no effect on the frequency of sexual activity or on orgasmic response. Postoperatively, patients were less likely to report pain with intercourse (relative risk, 5.34; 95% CI, 2.2-12.95; P = .00002): 49.3% of patients had discussed sexual functioning after hysterectomy with their physicians, and 64.8% of patients recalled initiating the discussion.
Conclusion
Most patients expected and experienced no change in sexual desire, orgasm frequency, or orgasm intensity. Hysterectomy appears to result in decreased pain with sexual relations.

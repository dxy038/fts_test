The frequency demultiplication phase-locking phenomenon in a relaxation-oscillating circuit under periodic external excitation is explained with the mathematical theory of the diffeomorphism of a circle circumference. This approach is applied to a bidirectional negative-resistance transistor (BNRT). Phase-locking zones in the parameter plane are computed and agree with experimental results.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

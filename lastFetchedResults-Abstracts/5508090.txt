A statistical circuit/system design method which combines the cost of component tolerance, cost of repair and cost of throw-away as the objective function for minimization is proposed. This method automatically produces the optimal manufacture yield and optimal tolerances. It does not require repeated Monte Carlo simulations and does not depend on convexity of the acceptable region. It can also be applied to cases when the circuit/system performances can only be obtained by measurements and not by simulations

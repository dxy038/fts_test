An external load can be connected to a chiral clement in two ways; a parallel connection or a series connection. The parallel connection places the external load across the dipole-loop gap, putting the loop terminals, the dipole terminals and the load terminals in parallel. The other configuration breaks the connection between the dipole and loop sections at the center gap, reconnecting the loop, the load and the dipole in a series configuration. The terminal impedance and backscatter behavior of the chiral clement is different for each connection method. The objective of this paper is to develop useful equivalent circuit models for both series connected and parallel connected versions of canonical chiral elements.

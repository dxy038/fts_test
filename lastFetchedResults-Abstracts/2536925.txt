Background and Objective: Summer savory (Satureja hortensis) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Satureja hortensis hydro-alcoholic extract on anxiety and depression in male Wistar rats exposed to chronic immobilization.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 48 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to 6 groups (n=8 for each): control, stress group (6 hours/day during 21 consecutive days restraint stress), Satureja200 and Satureja400 (receiving doses 200, 400 mg/kg/bw of hydroalcoholic extract of Satureja hortensis), stress-Satureja200 and stress-Satureja400 groups (received Satureja extract in addition to chronic immobility stress). At the end of study, anxiety and depression were evaluated using elevated plus maze and forced swimming test, respectively.

Results: The percentages of open arm entry and time spent in open arm significantly increased in satureja-stress groups as compared with stress animals (p < 0.01). The results of forced swimming test showed that the immobility time in satureja-stress400 group significantly decreased as compared with stress animals (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The results suggested that hydroalcoholic extract of Satureja hortensis has anxiolytic effect and at dosage of 400 mg/kg decreases depression-like behavior in rats.

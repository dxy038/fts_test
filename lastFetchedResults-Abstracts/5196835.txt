The control of robotic systems actuated by Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires is still an open issue. The goal of this work focuses on the development of a competent control system for a humanlike, 2-DOF, SMA actuated finger. We pursue this objective through a visual-servoing scheme and the implementation of classical decoupled PID controllers for the joint angles. Experimental results prove the efficacy and usability of the suggested scheme.

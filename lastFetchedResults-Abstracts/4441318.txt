In the mobile radio communication environment the signal arriving at the receiver is composed of replicas of the transmitted signal and which have travelled over independently fading paths. This often causes a considerable time dispersion in the received signal. Recently published papers have shown that properly planned phase modulation followed by differential detection can have a robust feature against delay spread. This can be achieved by exploiting the less severely fading components that present in the received signal. These new schemes are called antimultipath modulation techniques. Moreover if proved effective, these modulation techniques have the advantage of simple receiving systems. The objective of this paper is to estimate the BER performance of these new schemes using a two-ray propagation model with different delay spread values for both binary and quadrature phase modulation.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Introduction and objective: Toxoplasma gondii is an intra cellular protozoan parasite which infects 30 to 60% of the world population. A wide range of toxoplasmosis conditions has been studied, but there are still unknown damages which must be explored. In the present research, the effect of this parasite on testosterone and cortisol changes in the infected men and women was examined. 
Materials and methods: A total of 180 patients (73 females and 107 males), were examined for lgG anti-Toxoplasma antibody, cortisol and testosterone in their plasma. In addition, the patients also filled in personality questionnaire DASS21 (depression, anxiety, and stress).
Results: Results showed that 24(%13/33) females and 39(%20) males were positive with lgG anti-Toxoplasma antibody, respectively. A statistically significant correlation between Toxoplasma infection and testosterone and cortisol increase in women and men were observed. Stress and anxiety index also increased in men and women whereas depression index increased only in men. 
Conclusion: The results show a direct relation between raise Toxoplasma infection and cortisol, and testosterone increase in bout men and women and high DASS21 test score in Toxoplasma infected group. 
Significance and impact of the study: Our results may indicate that following Toxoplasma infection, the probability of stressful condition is high.

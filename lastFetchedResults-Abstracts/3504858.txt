A low-cost internally compensated integrated-circuit operational amplifier occupying a small die area can be fabricated if the compensation capacitor value is low. This objective is attained when the amplifier-input-stage transconductance is reduced to a minimum provided the frequency response remains unchanged. A new technique, transconductance cancellation, meets the objective without extra devices or components.

In this paper, a novel motion compensated frame rate up-conversion (MC-FRUC) algorithm is proposed to enhance the visual quality of video sequences. First of all, the multi-channel mixed pattern (MCMP) is proposed to design a block matching criterion which uses a few computations to reveal the variances of one luminance channel and two chrominance channels in a video frame. Second, in basis of the forward and backward initial motion vector fields (MVFs) estimated by a variant of 3DRS algorithm, the spatio-temporal motion vector refinement (ST-MVR) algorithm is proposed to obtain the more smoother MVF by implicitly adding the spatio-temporal smooth constraint into the process of motion vector refinement, and then the highly fault-tolerant motion vector smoothing (HFT-MVS) algorithm is proposed to prevent the emergence of outliers in MVF. Finally, in order to reduce the edge blurring and occlusions, the proposed dual-weighted overlapped block motion compensation (DW-OBMC) algorithm uses the forward and backward MVFs to jointly produce the interpolated frame. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both objective and subjective quality of the interpolated frame with a low computational complexity, and provide the better performance than the existing algorithms.

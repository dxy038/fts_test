Considers linear discrete-time singular systems with state constraints and subject to constrained additive disturbances. The objective consists in determining the maximal admissible set of initial conditions for which the resulting motions of the system satisfy the state constraints for all admissible disturbances. Due to the specificities of singular systems in terms of initial conditions (consistent or not), the notions of maximal weak, strong and strict admissible sets are defined

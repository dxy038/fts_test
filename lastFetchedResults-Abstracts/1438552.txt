Removal of Fluoride from Drinking Water Using an Electrocoagulation Reactor, Batch Experiments

Backgrounds and Objective: Usage electrocoagulation methods for removal chemical contaminants are widely used in the recent years. The aim of this research is to investigate fluoride removal, agent dental and skeletal fluorosis, from drinking water by batch electrocoagulation reactor with using aluminum electrode.

Materials and Methods: In this study, the drinking water sample is prepared by plastic batch reactor by monopole electrode. Removal efficiency is studied in different conditions, included pH (4, 7, and 10), reaction time (5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min), distance between electrode (2 cm), and current density (1.5, 3, and 4.5 mA/cm2).

Results: In electrocoagulation reactor, percentage of removal fluoride 2 mg/L, current density 4.5 mA/cm2 and reaction time 30 min in pH 4, 7 and 10 are obtained 96.5%, 100% and 90.5%, respectively. In electrocoagulation reactor, percentage of removal fluoride 12 mg/L removal in distance 2 cm, current density 4.5 mA/cm2, and reaction time 30 min in pH 4, 7, and 10 are obtained 60.7%, 64%, and 56%, respectively.

Conclusion: The findings indicated that fluoride removal efficiency is increased with increasing current density and reaction time. The results indicate that increasing the concentration of fluoride ions, the time required to achieve good efficiency should also increase. It can be concluded that the electrocoagulation technology is an effective process for defluoridation of drinking waters.

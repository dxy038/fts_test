Effective monitoring of personnel movements, material locations, and construction equipment has always been a topic of concern in construction management. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been proven to increase efficiency for staff and materials management. The objective of this study is to develop a Three-Dimensional (3D) location sensing algorithm using RFID technology to analyze the possible location of objects. To achieve this goal, this research first establishes an indoor wireless sensing network to collect Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). The distance between the antenna and target tag is calculated based on RSSI. The gradient decent method is then used to calculate the location of the electronic tag. The feasibility of this 3D positioning algorithm is verified using a real case. The experiment proves that the location sensing algorithm established in this study can gradually approach the actual location of the target tag. This research is one of the first studies for 3D location sensing with RFID application in the construction industry. The proposed RFID 3D sensing algorithm can be used to assist construction managers in locating the positions of relevant personnel, equipment, apparatus and materials, enhancing management efficiency and safety.

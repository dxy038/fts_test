Late potentials are very small signals (1-20 &#956;V) in the surface ECG with high-frequency components, which are found in patients prone to sustained ventricular tachycardia. Evaluation of these signals requires either very sophisticated recording techniques for single-beat analysis or signal averaging. Signal averaging, however, might disregard information about risk stratification. Therefore, the authors developed the Single-Beat Spectral Variance (SBSV) based on two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform of 80 ms segments of 128 consecutive beats. This approach depicts the beat-to-beat variability of the frequency contents of these ECG segments. An index function enables an objective detection of late potentials. The authors investigated 35 patients after myocardial infarction and sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group 1), 50 patients after myocardial infarction without ventricular arrhythmias (Group 2) and ten healthy volunteers, SBSV classified 29 of 35 patients (83%) of Group 1 as pathologic, 14 of these 29 patients (48%) exclusively on the basis of marked Wenckebach-like conduction pattern. In Group 2, only five of 50 patients showed abnormal SBSV. In Group 3, the authors found no pathologic result. Thus, SBSV is a promising new method to investigate late potentials inpatients after myocardial infarction, SBSV-contains not only the results of frequency analysis after signal averaging, but also evaluates variable ECG components.

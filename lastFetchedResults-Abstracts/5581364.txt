Combined entropy method with TOPSIS method, a comprehensive assessment model for personnel assessment is built. The model firstly adopts entropy method to solve the objective weights of multiple indexes in multiple attribute decision problems, which eliminates the subjective influence of artificial factors, the general difference and other defects in traditional weighting methods; and then TOPSIS is adopted as objective function to obtain the comprehensive evaluation value and prior order of evaluation objects. Application analysis demonstrates that the proposed model is correct and feasible, can reduce the adverse influence of artificial factors and can provide decision support to personnel assessment practice.

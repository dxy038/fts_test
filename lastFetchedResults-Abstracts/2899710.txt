This paper proposes a multi objective optimization method to determine optimal allocation of a distributed generation unit in radial distribution system. The multi objective function to be optimized includes two objectives: viz Power Loss Reduction and Tail End Node Voltage Improvement. The proposed methodology uses Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm to optimize the multi objective function. This method is tested on standard IEEE 33 bus and 69 bus radial distribution systems using MATLAB 8.0. The results show that the proposed method is accurate and fast. Since weightage is given to tail end node voltage improvement there is considerable improvement in tail end node voltage.

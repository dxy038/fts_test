Dispersions of 1 wt% titandioxide (titania or TiO2) were investigated with respect to their stability in non-aqueous media. The objective of this work was to find conditions for the substrate-induced coagulation (SIC) process in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). The SIC process is a dip-coating process that enhances adsorption of fine dispersed particles on a pre-conditioned surface. The wetting behavior of titania and NMP was investigated by the powder contact angle method. The absorption process of the polar solvent NMP on the acid oxide TiO2and Aerosol OT (AOT) (bis-2-ethylhexyl sodium sulfosuccinate) was also investigated and a polar or hydrophilic interaction was found. The stability of titania in NMP dispersions and the influence of the solvent AOT and the electrolyte LiCl was investigated. By studying the electrophoretic mobilities of titania particles in NMP and the influence on solutes by the electrophoretic method phase analysis light scattering (PALS) and the electroacoustic method this paper explores suitable conditions for non-aqueous substrate-induced coagulation of titania.

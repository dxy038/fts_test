The Communication Measurement Tool II (CMT II) is a modular architecture for comprehensive IP measurements. The main objective of CMT II is to provide an overall quantitative and qualitative picture of a network. CMT II operates on different layers of the OSI layer model and its open standard based architecture is designed to allow further extensions for upcoming new protocols, networks and applications. Unlike other measurement tools, CMT II can be employed in wireless or mobile scenarios as well, in order to study the behavior of wireless and mobile data transmissions. This paper provides an introduction into the CMT II architecture, its measurement possibilities and the supported analysis methods.

Background: Help to return people who have social disorders, including alcohol consumption, are the important topics of research in the field of biology, which in this area regarding the efficiency of the pharmacological interventions and physical activity.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two weeks of swimming training or curcumin supplementation on spatial memory improved after the destruction caused by the binge ethanol drinking in male rats.
Methods: In an experimental trial, 24 Wistar rats (male, 200-250 g) were selected and every eight hours one time received ethanol for 4 days. After six days of abstain, for 2-weeks interventions of the swimming and curcumin supplementation was applied. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: 1) control; 2) swim; and 3) curcumin. After 2-weeks by using the Morris Water Maze, learning and spatial memory were assessed.
Results: After 2-weeks of swimming training and curcumin supplementation, time and distance to reach the platue found a significant reduction, which represents the process of  learning (P  <  0.05). The amount of this reduction was larger in curcumin group than the other groups. No significant difference was observed between the effects of interventions in spatial memory (P  >  0.05).
Conclusion: Despite the slight improvement in the training and curcumin groups compared to control group, two weeks of swimming or curcumin supplementation can not improve spatial memory after binge ethanol drinking. According to the results of this study concludes that learning performance during the period of recovery after ethanol consumption under the influence of two weeks aerobic exercise and curcumin supplementation, but spatial memory dose not affected by these two interventions.

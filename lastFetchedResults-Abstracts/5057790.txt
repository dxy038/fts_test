To achieve substantial tactical advantage over future submarine threats the combat management system has to quickly plot and maintain the trajectory of the moving targets for early response. Within this objective, the focus is to develop optimal end to end processing approaches that produce significant gain in establishing faster submarine reliable trajectory and motion. The method, based upon grid filtering, described in this article will contribute to this aim as a key component. The paper is organized as follows: first, the particular context of angle only tracking is recalled. Second, the theoretical framework is briefly introduced and we describe our approach. Then, using a typical testing scenario, we compare the target kinematics features obtained by our approach versus the well known least square solution widely used in this context and the more recent unscented Kalman filter. Finally we will see how the grid filter allows for a supplementary time reduction in the convergence of the estimated trajectory.

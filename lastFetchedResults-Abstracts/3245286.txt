This paper presents a MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) software package which enables users to study small signal behavior of power systems with wind unit and Energy Capacitor Systems (ECSs). For hybrid systems including wind and storage units, studying dynamic behavior of overall system is a complicated and time consuming task. The objective of this paper is to design a user friendly GUI as an educational tool that helps students study the effect of wind and storage units on power system. Modeling of wind units with squirrel-cage induction generators connected to the network through a full-scale AC/AC converter and ECS units consisting of Electric Double-Layer Capacitors and DC/AC converter are explained thoroughly. GUI let the users to choose load change disturbance in any bus or wind speed change in any wind unit and displays the variation of desired state variable after such disturbance.

This paper presents an analysis of radiometric data taken at 21, 2.8, and 1.67 cm during a NASA sponsored flight over agricultural fields in Phoenix, AZ. The objective of the mission was to provide comprehensive information concerning microwave responses due to a broad range of soil moisture contents. Generally, data taken over bare fields agree well with theoretical estimates from a combined multilayer radiative transfer model with simple roughness correction. With the surface moisture content ranging between &lt;5 and &gt;35 percent, the emissivity ranges between &gt;0.9 and ~0.7. The response to soil moisture content at 21 cm is more senstive than that at either 2.8 or 1.67 cm. The vegetation model takes into account both the effect of dielectric coefficient and the volume scattering characteristics of the vegetation layer. At the longer wavelengths (e.g., 21 cm) radiation from soil penetrates through vegetation layers of wheat and alfalfa and provides surface moisture information. However, short wavelength radiation from soil cannot penetrate through vegetation canopies; the volume scattering characteristics of vegetation controls the overall microwave signatures.

An important objective of health monitoring systems for civil infrastructures is to identify the state of the structure and to detect the damage when it occurs. System identification and damage detection, based on measured vibration data, have received considerable attention recently. Frequently, the damage of a structure may be reflected by a change of some parameters in structural elements, such as a degradation of the stiffness. Hence it is important to develop data analysis techniques that are capable of detecting the parametric changes of structural elements during a severe event, such as the earthquake. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive tracking technique, based on the least-squares estimation approach, to identify the time-varying structural parameters. In particular, the new technique proposed is capable of tracking the abrupt changes of system parameters from which the event and the severity of the structural damage may be detected. The proposed technique is applied to linear structures, including the Phase I ASCE structural health monitoring benchmark building, and a nonlinear elastic structure to demonstrate its performance and advantages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique is capable of tracking the parametric change of structures due to damages.

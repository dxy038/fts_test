Summary form only given. The frequency-dependent impedance characterization has been carried out in ferromagnet (FM)/ organic semiconductor (OSC)/FM tri-layered organic spin valves (OSVs) over the frequency range of 10 Hz-1 MHz with the objective of studying interfacial properties between ferromagnetic materials and organic semiconductors. The magnetoresistance and magnetocapacitance effects is investigated by fitting the field-dependent impedance spectra with an equivalent resistor-capacitor (RC) parallel network model. The analysis validates the RC parallel network model for OSVs and the extracted field dependent resistive parameters agree with the experimental values, indicating an effective magneto-transport characteristic in OSVs dominated by the charge accumulation at the organic-ferromagnet interfaces.

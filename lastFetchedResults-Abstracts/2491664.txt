Background: Camellia sinensis and Zataria multiflora as the potent antioxidants and anti-inflammations are crucial in the management of wound therapy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used for the proliferative potential on fibroblast cells and induction of inflammatory mediators.
Objective: We examined the effects of LPS and herbal extracts combination in order to identify their mechanisms of action in fibroblast proliferation and tissue regeneration.
Methods: Human foreskin fibroblasts were treated by Salmonella enterica LPS (100?g) and extracts (5%w/w). Tissues of male Balb/c mice were harvested at 1, 3 and 7 days for biochemical and histopathological evaluations. Effects of LPS and extracts on cell viability, Nitric oxide (NO), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were examined respectively by XTT assay and related kits.
Results: Our pathological investigations for Camellia sinensis and LPS co-treated group indicated inflammatory cells on day 1 and fibroblast proliferation through wound area on day 3. After wound modelling the samples features were the same but with the difference in groups treated by LPS and Camellia sinensis extract which dermis and epidermis were seen. The Camellia sinensis extract and LPS co-treated wounds were showed low levels of H2O2 and higher levels of NO compared to extract treated group (P < 0.001). Results illustrate a dose and time dependent significant difference in cell proliferation between groups.
Conclusion: These results suggest that Camellia sinensis extract in combination with LPS may have potential of accelerating inflammatory phase of wound healing process by regulation of COX-2, NO and H2O2 in skin fibroblast.

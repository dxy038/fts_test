In the model, fuzzy cluster arithmetic is adopted to obtain an optimal cluster number of multi-product, the equivalent logistics quantity is used to substitute the logistics quantity, and consideration of the factors of geometry, density, degree of vulnerability on product are included. Practicability and validity of the proposed model is verified by the instance.

It is believed and assumed that meaningful and significant information can be acquired from DW which provides valuable knowledge to support business process and decision-making. A mail questionnaire survey was regarded as the appropriate method for gathering data. The questionnaire was developed based on the findings from related literature and other related research questionnaires. All the firms (277), which were listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), at the time of data collection, were selected over half answered positively.

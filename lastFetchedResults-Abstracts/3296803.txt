Business intelligence (BI) has become significant in providing organizations with knowledge and insights to improve business performance and to sustain competitive advantages. However, many organizations still remain at either low or moderate level in the BI maturity chart. There is a limited literature available regarding the role of demographic factors play in the BI maturity. This paper highlights a proposed maturity model that consists of four dimensions: organizational management, process, technology, and outcome, spanning across five levels of maturity. The main objective of the research was to study the impact of organizationÂ´s demographic factors such as types of industry, organizational size and the age of BI initiatives on the BI maturity. The results from the hypotheses testing showed that only the types of industry have significant effects on the BI maturity.

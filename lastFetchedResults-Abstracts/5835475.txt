The objective of hybrid impedance control is defined, and a robust hybrid impedance control method is proposed. The task space is split into force-controlled and position-controlled subspaces based on the concept of hybrid control. Desired inertia and damping are introduced in the force control subspace to improve the dynamic behavior, and impedance control is used in the position-controlled subspace. In the proposed control scheme, the hybrid impedance control is equivalent to tracking a desired acceleration trajectory, which is generated in real-time. The computed torque technique and a PI control law are used to reduce the influence of model uncertainties. Experimental results obtained with a two-degree-of-freedom direct drive robot have shown the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid impedance control method

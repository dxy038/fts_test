Considering the inter-domain identity authentication problem for mobile object, a Beidou-based inter-domain identity authentication method for mobile object is proposed based on the safe and credible brief message communication function and accurate time service provided by Beidou satellites navigation system. The system structure and protocol of Beidou-based inter-domain identity authentication for mobile object are designed. The security analysis for protocol shows that it is safe and credible, it can realize the bidirectional authentication between the authentication center in the new administration domain and the mobile object in the inter-domain identity authentication, it can realize the anonymous authentication of mobile object, and it also provides the ability to resist the replay attack. Moreover, the protocol decreases the spending of the authentication center in home domain effectively.

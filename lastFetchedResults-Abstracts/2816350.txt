The power quality has degraded due to the increase of power electronic equipments for developing efficient interfacing of renewable energy to the grid. The wide uses of non-linear loads are responsible for harmonic problems and have a significant impact on the quality of power supply. The renewable energy source is directly connected to the grid which will inject the harmonics in the power grid and also produce the power quality problems in the power grid. The main objective of this paper is to design the shunt active filter with modified control algorithm interface to the grid for compensating the reactive power and harmonic current elimination. Hysteresis current controlled Voltage-Source Inverter is used to realize the shunt active filter. The shunt active filter with modified controllerÂ´s effectiveness is analyzed by considering two types of nonlinear loads. One is AC voltage controller fed induction machine with diode bridge rectifier controlled R load and another one as AC voltage controller fed RL load with diode bridge rectifier controlled R load. The shunt active filter using modified control algorithm proposed for improve the power quality of grid, reduce the percentage of THD values and the control algorithm response for dynamic load variation are verified through simulation.

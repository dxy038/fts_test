Background and Objective: Microsporidia is an obligatory intracellular parasite known as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. Its laboratory diagnosis is relatively difficult and modified trichrome staining is a standard diagnostic method for detection of Microsporidia. The aim of present study was to identify intestinal Microsporidia in kidney- transplanted patients, using   modified Trichrome Staining and Calcofluor White Methods.
Material and Methods: In 2012, 180 stool specimens were taken from kidney transplanted- patients given immunosuppressive drugs in Hamadan, Iran. To identify Microsporidia, we use modified Trichrome Staining and Calcofluor White Methods.
Results: The mean duration of kidney transplant and immunosuppressive drug using  was 5.5 Years. Only one female patient was positive for Microsporidia.  
Conclusions: Owing to low frequency of this opportunistic infection among kidney transplanted patients, we can conclude that their hygienic conditions   are good enough and they are not exposed with the parasites.

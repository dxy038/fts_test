This paper proposes a zero voltage switching (ZVS) technique for bidirectional dc/dc converters. The dc/dc unit considered consists of two distinct bidirectional dc/dc cells paralleled at both input and output and whose two input bridges are coupled by means of passive inductive branches. A multiangle phase-shift modulation method is proposed which simultaneously achieves bidirectional power control, power sharing, and ZVS of all the electronic devices over the full power range without the need for auxiliary switches. Simulation and experimental results are reported for a 2.4 kW dc/dc unit consisting of two paralleled 1.2 kW bidirectional dual-bridge series resonant converter cells.

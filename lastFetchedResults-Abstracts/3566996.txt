Research and development laboratories use information as a raw material in the course of carrying out their assigned function. They, in turn, generate new information. The input of information referred to is of several varieties&#194;&#191; theory, data, applications, economic factors, etc. The information generated is likewise of several kinds&#194;&#191;theory, data, devices, processes, etc.&#194;&#191;which are of importance to the company in maintaining and extending its competitive position and its prestige. Input information is defined as all of the information that can be gleaned from all sources that will be useful as background in carrying out this project. Similarly, output information will be the results of the project when written up as company reports, scientific papers, general articles plus the ideas, devices, data, etc., carried to the manufacturing operation. The handling of input information to the research project is a communication process which involves collection, evaluation and dissemination. In analogous fashion, these processes are operative in handling the information output of the laboratory. An analysis of the nature of input and output information components permits a more detailed study of specific requirements and leads to improved procedures for increasing the effectiveness of the communication process. Recognizing the fact that technical information must compete for top management attention with reports from other major parts of the company&#194;&#191;sales, public relations, legal, etc.&#194;&#191;the importance of the attention-getting power of research reports and communications becomes clearly evident. Some suggestions are given that may be helpful in attaining this objective.

The main objective of this research which is based on descriptive  analytical method and documentation is to demonstrate the impact of globalization on the new social movements and the role and impact of the Internet in this regard. The results show that the new social movements and globalization are interrelated so that most of the movements are orchestrated when associated with global problems. Meanwhile, the possibility of establishing this kind of exchange and raising awareness about global problems has largely increased through the second aspect of globalization, namely the spread of transnational communication . In this context, internet is also one of the main tools of information and communication technology that has helped to increase the new social movements power. One of these movements is Occupy Wall Street that can be explained according to the structural changes in industrial capitalist societies having as one of its indicators the widespread use of the Internet and especially the virtual social networks that have contributed greatly to its internationalization.

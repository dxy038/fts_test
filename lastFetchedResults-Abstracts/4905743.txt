However, there is a lack of in-depth scientific understanding for emergency resource allocation and scheduling under such unexpected situations. In this article, firstly, a grey-prediction-based emergency resource allocation model is proposed according to the reality and problems of current research on emergency resource allocation and scheduling under unconventional social emergency. This model can be used to optimize the year\´s total amounts of emergency resource requirements. Next, with the design of a multi-objective-based single emergency location resource scheduling model, unexpected events are further subdivided into a number of stages and a mathematical model of non-uniform multi-constraint multi-stage scheduling is established. The model is analyzed and the problems of "how to make an emergency response the earliest time" and "the least number of rescuing locations" are solved. The theoretical model will be able to guide the emergency resource allocation and scheduling under unconventional emergencies in the future.

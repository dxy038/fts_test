In order to fully exploit the high speed broadband multimedia services, prolonging the battery life of user equipment is critical, especially for the current smartphones. In this work, we investigate the problem of designing a content sharing collaborative mobile cloud (CMC) via user cooperation to reduce the energy consumption at terminal side. Given a group of users interested in downloading the same content from an operator, a grouping and scheduling based algorithm is proposed in order to select the proper data receiver in each scheduling time. The objective of the presented algorithm is to obtain energy efficiency as well as user fairness among the members of CMC. The proposed scheme can take both base station and terminal aspects into consideration and it is shown that the significant energy saving performance can be achieved without scarifying and drowning the battery of any terminal.

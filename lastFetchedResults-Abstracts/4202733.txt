The Practical Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms are required to accomplish more services in the real time indoor environment. There is uncertainty to traverse the multi robots in real time robust indoor environment from one point (start) to another point (Goal). This research made capable to handle robust indoor environment with an efficient hardware scheme using behavioural control of multi robot to carry out successful navigation. The main objective of the robots is to reach the goal point, which is placed with IR beacon and the precision of the proposed algorithm is to avoid the different convex polygon type of static and dynamic obstacles in indoor environments. The customized prototype Robots are equipped with: FPGA (spartan 6), PMOD RF2 transceivers, Ultrasonic sensor and IR seeker. The proposed algorithm is implemented with efficient hardware and found that robots are marching towards goal by avoiding obstacles while communicating implicitly and this design is pragmatic in industrial and medical fields.

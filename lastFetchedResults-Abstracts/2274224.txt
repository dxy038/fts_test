One of the difficulties toward analyzing complex structures is loading phenomena and determining the constraints due to the boundary conditions. Although in aerodynamic loading,applying distributed load is an appropriate approach, in case of being simultaneous with inertia loading, the simulation process can be extremely difficult and near impossible. This article is an attempt to introduce a new method for simultaneous aerodynamic and inertia loading on aircraft finite element model using genetic and mapping approach.  To this end, the equivalent aerodynamic and inertia load have been regarded as an unspecified pressure distribution. Furthermore, the surfaces under study were divided into bands in which the amount of pressure was considered as the optimizing variable. The objective function has been chosen in a manner so that it could satisfy the required lift and drag forces as well as the torque resulted from these forces. One of the merits of this method is that the pressure would be distributed on the surface geometry, and even in case of change in the elements, there is no need to reapply the loading. To ensure the validity of this method, we conducted it on the finite element of the wing and the fuselage of a sample aircraft which led to satisfactory results. The results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of this method.

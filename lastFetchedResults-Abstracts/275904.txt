The deformational behavior of articular cartilage has been investigated in confined and unconfined compression experiments and indentation tests, but to date there exist no reliable data on the in situ deformation of the cartilage during static loading. The objective of the current study was to perform a systematic study into cartilage compression of intact human femoro-patellar joints under short- and long-term static loading with MR imaging. A non-metallic pneumatic pressure device was used to apply loads of 150% body weight to six joints within the extremity coil of an MRI scanner. The cartilage was delineated during the compression experiment with previously validated 2D and 3D fat-suppressed gradient echo sequences. We observed a mean (maximal) in situ deformation of 44% (57%) in patellar cartilage after   h of loading (mean contact pressure 3.6 MPa), the femoral cartilage showing a smaller amount of deformation than the patella. However, only around 7% of the final deformation (3% absolute deformation) occurred during the first minute of loading. A 43% fluid loss from the interstitial patellar matrix was recorded, the initial fluid flux being 0.217±0.083 μm/s, and a high inter-individual variability of the deformational behavior (coefficients of variation 11–38%). In conjunction with finite-element analyses, these data may be used to compute the load partitioning between the solid matrix and fluid phase, and to elucidate the etiologic factors relevant in mechanically induced osteoarthritis. They can also provide direct estimates of the mechanical strain to be encountered by cartilage transplants.

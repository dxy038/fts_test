Objective Minority sexual orientation has been repeatedly
linked to elevated rates of suicide attempts. Whether
this translates into greater risk for suicide mortality is
unclear. We investigated sexual orientation-related differences
in suicide mortality in Denmark during the initial 12-
year period following legalization of same-sex registered
domestic partnerships (RDPs).
Method Using data from death certificates issued between
1990 and 2001 and population estimates from the Danish
census, we estimated suicide mortality risk among individuals
classified into one of three marital/cohabitation
statuses: current/formerly in same-sex RDPs; current/formerly
heterosexually married; or never married/registered.
Results Risk for suicide mortality was associated with
this proxy indicator of sexual orientation, but only significantly
among men. The estimated age-adjusted suicide
mortality risk for RDP men was nearly eight times greater
than for men with positive histories of heterosexual marriage
and nearly twice as high for men who had never
married.
Conclusions Suicide risk appears greatly elevated for
men in same-sex partnerships in Denmark. To what extent
this is true for similar gay and bisexual men who are not in
such relationships is unknown, but these findings call for
targeted suicide prevention programs aimed at reducing
suicide risk among gay and bisexual men.

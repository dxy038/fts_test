Hospitalized patients have a potential risk for nosocomial infections.
Airborne fungi are one of the main causes of fungal infections
in this group. The objective of this study was to investigate
the concentrations and species of airborne fungi in two general
hospitals in Shiraz, southern Iran . Air samples were collected
from high-risk wards, using settle plate method. Fungal colonies
were identified, enumerated, and reported . A total of 1075 microbial
colonies were detected, 419 of which were fungi . Fungal
isolates from two hospitals, belonged to 15 genera. 4.25% of
rooms in hospital A and 16% in hospital B were clean rooms.
Cladosporium followed by Aspergillus spp were the predominant
genus in two hospitals studied. The highest fungal deposition
rates were 1016 and 1797 CFU/m2 in Emergency and Surgery
rooms. Monitoring airborne fungi is one of the best ways
for prevention and control of these infections. Caring for highrisk
patients in hospital rooms has lead to reduced rates of nosocomial
fungal infections.

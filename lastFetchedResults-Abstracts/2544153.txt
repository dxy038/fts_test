The main objective of this paper is to analysis the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on energy consumption in the MENA region selected countries during the period 19952011. For this purpose, used the model presented by Sadorsky (2012) and three indicators that measured ICT: the number of Internet users, the number of mobile lines and the number of telephone lines. Also, estimated and analyzed the short run and long run elasticities between the variables of the model using a system generalized method of moments (GMMSYS). The results show that the development of ICT with each three measured indices, increased energy consumption per capita in MENA region selected countries in the short run and long run. So that a one percent increases in this indicator, average of energy consumption increases in the short run and long run respectively 0.007 and 0.089 percent.

An electromechanical system that follows a bright visual stimulus is presented. At the core of this system is an analog VLSI chip that incorporates photosensitive elements and computational circuitry. The circuitry converts a focused 1D visual imager into a bidirectional motor signal that is encoded as a pair of pulse trains. These outputs are amplified and are used to drive a mechanical motor system that `closes the loopÂ´ around the circuitry by moving the chip to follow the stimulus. The circuitry has been incorporated into a wheeled vehicle that follows a light source

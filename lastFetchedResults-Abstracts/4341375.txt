A sophisticated sensor design of the aeroMEMS surface fence probe for wall shear stress measurements in turbulent flow is presented. The fence deflection (proportional to the wall shear stress) is directly measured by a piezoresistive Wheatstone bridge. The fence is 5 mm wide, 700 &#956;m (max.) high and 7 &#956;m and 13 &#956;m thick, respectively. The cantilever height is 1700 &#956;m or 2200 &#956;m. The sensing element rests on a silicon body of 5200&#215;7500 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>. A sensitivity up to 6 mV/(V&#183;N/m<sup>2</sup>), a resolution of up to 10<sup>-4</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> and a symmetrical behavior for bidirectional measurements was obtained in a measurement range of &#177;0.3 N/m<sup>2</sup>. Two pn-diodes were implemented for temperature monitoring (sensitivity: -2 mV/K @ 100 &#956;A).

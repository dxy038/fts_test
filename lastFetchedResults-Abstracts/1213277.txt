The results of numerical simulation of the mosaic embedding iron ore sintering (MEBIOS) process according to the model presented in the first part of the study are introduced. The main objective of the second part is the elucidation of key factors influencing the process efficiency, particularly the sintering completeness, velocity of the heat wave propagation and maximum temperature achievable in the pellet during the wave propagation. Numerical results reveal that the mass fraction of coal, diameter of coal particles and air inlet velocity are of prime importance in determining efficiency of the MEBIOS sintering process.

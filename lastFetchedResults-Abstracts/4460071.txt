This article introduces the analysis on Internet Of Things (IOT) technology, thermal technology and logistic Unified Information System (UIS), for the mobile logistic storage of logistic storage temperature control as well as the actual requirements for supply chain logistic circulation storage and fixed logistic storage, to implement integration design for temperature control perception system of logistic UIS. In the IOT environment the logistic storage temperature control UIS is supported by IOT technology, uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology associating with Internet, Computer Telecommunication Integration (CTI) technology to form an interactive real time logistic temperature control model. The logistic storage UIS is using GPRS and RFID technology to form a RFID thermal tag, RFID temperature control module and GPRS communication module, through API function as well as AT command program design of GPRS communication module, to realize logistic storage temperature control unified information bidirectional interactive management and control mode centering in unified information, and develop logistic storage temperature control into a controllable information behavior. The output of system test result by data factor analytical approach suggests the Logistic Storage Temperature Control Unified Information System based on IOT is feasible.

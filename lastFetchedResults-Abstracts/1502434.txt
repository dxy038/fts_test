Fuels from biomass (biofuels) are used to mitigate the greenhouse gases produced through the utilization of fossil fuels. Non-edible or waste biomass can be pyrolyzed to produce bio-oil. The oil, an unstable and low energy product, can be further upgraded through hydrodeoxygenation to produce gas and/or diesel range hydrocarbons and value added chemicals. The objective of this review is to explore upgrading techniques that are currently being researched and utilized. This review reveals several aspects that in turn will serve as an aid for bio oil valorization, such as, evaluating characterization techniques involved in understanding salient features of bio-oil, insight of bio-oil pretreatment methods for water removal to increase heating values and decrease risk of catalyst poisoning in subsequent hydroprocessing, studies regarding model compound upgrading, reaction mechanism and finally, provides brief review of common catalysts for hydrotreatment of bio-oil in order to yield value added chemicals and fuels.

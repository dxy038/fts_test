Background and Objective: Spoligotyping is a method based on 36bp Direct Repeat (DR) chromosomal loci
polymorphism which is connected to one or two 35-4 I bp spacer sequences. There are 94 different intra DR
spacer sequences which are identified so far and only 43 of them are used as usual. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex strains can be identified based on lacking or having these sequences.
Materials and Methods: Spoligotyping test was carried out on 238 Tn smear positive patients. Primary
separation ofmycobacterium strains was done through Petrof4% method and Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media.
Biochemical tests such as Niacin test/Catalase activity/Nitrate reduction were done in order to identify the
strains. Drug sensitivity to INH (0.2Mglml)1 RJF (40Mglml)1 STM (lOMglml) and ETBI (2Mglml) identified
by proportional method and according to that, the strains were divided into three groups: sensitive, multi
drug resistance (MDR) and non MDR. Then DNA was extracted by CTAB method from the positive
colonies. Sequences were amplified by PCR and after denaturizing, hybridization with Streptavidine
peroxidase enzyme was performed by Line reverse blot method. Radiography was done after adding the
Luminoscense and membrane onto the X-ray films.
Results: Serotypes were divided into 9 groups (Beijing/ CAS II Haarlem I VI T21 TIl EA131 EAl2 and
CAS2). Most of the strains were from Haarlem (27%) and CASI (25%) groups. Two strains were also
identified in this method that belonged to Mycobacterium bovis.
Conclusion: Spoligotyping method is an easy, rapid and sensitive test in order to identify Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex strains.

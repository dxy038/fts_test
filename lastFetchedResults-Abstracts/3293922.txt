This work proposes an electronic driver for street lighting systems integrated to renewable energy. In recent lighting applications, the use of micro renewable generators in lighting points makes necessary the use of special electronics to handle the bidirectional energy flow in the ballast. The proposed input stage is a topology based on the integration of two flyback converters with different polarities, in order to avoid the use of the input diode bridge rectifying stage, allowing the converter operate with bidirectional energy flow. Thus, this system has two distinct operation modes. The rectifier mode is responsible to supply a street lighting system based on LEDs from de utility grid during the night, and the inverter mode must deliver energy into the power grid provided by a solar panel during the day. This work focuses in the inverter stage, which comprises a boost converter, responsible for the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), and a flyback inverter. The present topology is an alternative to standard bidirectional input stages, as it can be used to deliver energy into the power grid, due the avoidance of the input diode bridge.

Helical microswimmers that are capable of propulsion at low Reynolds numbers have great potential for numerous applications. Several kinds of artificial magnetic-actuated helical microswimmers have been designed by researchers. However, they are primarily open-loop controlled. This paper aims to investigate methods of closed-loop control of a magnetic-actuated helical swimmer at low Reynolds number by using visual feedback. For many in-vitro applications, helical swimmers should pass through a defined path, for example along channels with no prerequisite on the velocity profile along the path. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to achieve a velocity-independent planar path following task. Since the planar path following is based on 3-D steering control of the helical swimmer, a 3-D pose estimation of a helical swimmer is introduced based on the real-time visual tracking with a stereo vision system. The contribution of this paper is in two parts: The 3-D steering of a helical swimmer is demonstrated by visual servo control; and the path following of a straight line with visual servo control is achieved, then compared with open-loop control. We further expect that with this visual servo control method, the helical swimmers will be able to follow reference paths at the microscale.

This paper presents a Time-Oriented-Multiple-Objective (TOMO) approach to Production Target Setting system (PTSs) of wafer fabrication (Fab). One approach to determine those weighting of each objective that are based on different production phase. This paper attempts to set specific step target for the production line by taking into account the TOMO approach of each WIP and the available tool capacity. This is achieved through the application of Improved Index that is determined by combined dispatching rule through TOMO.

This paper presents results from an experimental investigation into real-time sensing and control of resin flow in an resin transfer molding (RTM) process. The objective of the research was to develop intelligent process control methodologies using in-situ sensors and process models, for real-time control of the RTM process. The real time control of the RTM process enables an increase in throughput, high yields, low defects, and consistent repeatability of quality between the parts. We concentrated on controlling the resin flow using multiple injection ports and vent locations. The results from the preliminary investigations indicate the feasibility of implementing real-time control on the RTM production floor

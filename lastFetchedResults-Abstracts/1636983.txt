The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential application of a lightweight concrete produced with lightweight coarse aggregate made of the water treatment sludge and sawdust (lightweight composite), by determining the thermal properties and possible environmental impact of future residue of this concrete. Two types of concrete were prepared: concrete produced with the lightweight composite dosed with cement/sand/composite/water in a mass ratio of 1:2.5:0.67:0.6 and conventional concrete dosed with cement/sand/crushed stone/water in a mass ratio of 1:4.8:5.8:0.8. The thermal properties were determined by the hot wire parallel technique. The possible environmental impact was measured using the procedures and guidelines of the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards â€“ ABNT. The concrete produced with the lightweight composite presented a 23% lower thermal conductivity than the conventional concrete. The concrete produced with the lightweight composite presented a set of thermal properties suitable for the application of this concrete in non-structural sealing elements. The concentration of aluminum in the solubilized extract of the concrete produced with the lightweight composite was much lower than the concentration of aluminum in the water treatment sludge, confirming the possible reduction of environmental impact of this composite for use in concrete.

The objective of this study is the design of a multi-stage wet wire drawing process for improving the drawing speed for high carbon (0.72 wt% C) steel wire. In this study, the pass schedule and the design of a multi-stage wet drawing machine have been executed for achieving the objective. In the high-carbon steel wet wire drawing process under high speed, the excessive rise in the wire temperature not only increases the wire-breakage but also worsens the qualities of the drawn wire. In this study, a wire-temperature calculation model for the wet wire drawing process is established. An appropriate pass schedule, which can control the wire temperature, is achieved by using the temperature calculation model. Moreover, a new multi-stage wet wire drawing machine is designed for carrying out a wire drawing experiment to verify the new pass schedule. From the result of the experiment, the final drawing speed can be approximately doubled in relation to that of the current drawing process.

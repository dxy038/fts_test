Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm can be applied to problems in Economies, Management and Engineering; actually, most of design problem in real world can be reduced to multi-objective optimization problem. This paper proposed a new Parallel Evolutionary Algorithm based multi-objective optimal algorithm. The experimental results show that this algorithm can obtain quite fine approximated Pareto fronts and the fronts cover the theoretical Pareto front; these results imply that the proposed algorithm performs well.

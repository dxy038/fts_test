Objective
To evaluate adherence to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations on postpartum rubella vaccination in hospitals with a high proportion of foreign-born Latina mothers, the highest risk group for congenital rubella syndrome.
Methods

In four large hospitals in Miami–Dade County, maternal medical records for births in 2001 were randomly selected. Using demographic information from birth certificates, vaccination information from medical records, and policy information from a hospital survey, postpartum rubella vaccination rates were characterized among women eligible for vaccination (non-immune and not screened) through univariate and multivariable analyses. Data collection was performed in 2002–2003 and the analysis was completed in 2004–2005.
Results

Among 1991 women, 1209 (61%) were foreign born. Overall, 410 (21%) were eligible for vaccination, and of these 44 (11%) were vaccinated. Vaccination rates were not associated with maternal race/ethnicity or the existence of institutional standing-order vaccination policies. A vaccination order was recorded for 59% (240/410), but even in the presence of an order, only 17% (31/240) of those women were vaccinated.
Conclusions

Despite policies and standing orders to vaccinate, postpartum rubella vaccination rates were very low among all racial/ethnic subgroups in a sample of hospitals caring for high-risk, foreign-born women. These findings suggest that additional system-level interventions, such as comprehensive operational guidelines, must accompany standing orders to vaccinate rubella non-immune women postpartum.

Study objective: To evaluate selective aortic arch perfusion (SAAP) with an oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion, with and without aortic arch epinephrine during cardiac arrest. Methods: This randomized, controlled study, undertaken at a university research laboratory, involved 15 mixed-breed dogs. After 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation and 30 seconds of CPR, the dogs were randomized to three groups, each comprising five dogs. Group 1 (controls) dogs were given CPR and intravenous epinephrine, .01 mg/kg, at 10.5 minutes and then every 3 minutes. Group 2 dogs (IVE-SAAP) were treated with CPR and intravenous epinephrine (IVE) in the same fashion as the control group but were also subjected to SAAP with 275 mL of oxygenated 60% wt/vol perflubron emulsion over 30 seconds. Group 3 dogs (AoE-SAAP) received the same treatment as the IVE-SAAP group, except that the first epinephrine dose was given intraaortically. Results:  Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) increased during SAAP in both the IVE-SAAP and AoE-SAAP groups but was greater in the AoE-SAAP group. CPR diastolic CPP after SAAP was significantly greater in the AoE-SAAP group than in the control group. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) occurred in two control dogs, all five IVE-SAAP dogs, and all five AoE-SAAP dogs. The time elapsed from the initiation of CPR to ROSC was 6.1±1.9 minutes in the AoE-SAAP group, compared with 11.0±5.8 minutes in the IVE-SAAP group. Conclusion:  SAAP with oxygenated perflubron emulsion improved ROSC, both with and without aortic arch epinephrine. The combination of SAAP with perflubron emulsion and aortic arch epinephrine resulted in higher CPP and more rapid ROSC.

Common problems of high reliability computing are, on on e hand, the magnitude of total testing time required, particularly in the case of high reliability components and, on the other hand, the number of devices under test. In both cases, the objective is to minimize the costs involved in testing without reducing the quality of the data obtained. One solution is based on accelerated life testing techniques which permit to decrease the testing time. Another solution is to incorporate prior beliefs, engineering experience, or previous data into the testing framework. It is in this spirit that the use of a Bayesian approach can, in many cases, significantly reduce the amount of devices required. This paper focuses on a method of building the prior distribution using the previously acquired field data information in such a manner that the newly obtained law is a pseudo-conjugated form of the reliability law describing the product under test.

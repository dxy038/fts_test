Necessity, principles, and quality of motivation, are three main parts of this writing. In the first part, the issue of creating motivation for active work in social systems is touched upon; in the second part, the principles for determining methods and procedures are taken into consideration. In this part, four principles are briefly elaborated, which include: interrelation of human forces; conformity of the individual and the crowd; conformity of the motives and the motivated; and the direction of the association of human forces. The third part deals with the function of motivation in two intellectual and practical domains. In the first domain (explanation of intellectual system), the theoretical quality of motivation in the social system is dealt with under four headings of “delineation of goals and expectations”, “delineation of principles and motivations”, “delineation of means and the motivated”, and “delineation of relations and functions”. In the second domain (actualization of practical system), the practical and objective actualization of a desirable social system is further reviewed.

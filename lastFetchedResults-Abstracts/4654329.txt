This paper provides a distributed algorithm to guarantee synchronization between agents for multi-agent systems. Motivated by vertex coloring from graph theory, we explore an approach based on tentative overlay as a condition mapping from interrelation and interaction between each agent, which equipped with local sensing and wireless communication capabilities. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to achieve synchronization, that is, making the most of cooperation of the agents in the multi-agent systems with networkÂ´s connectivity, while other than nearest neighbor information, our approach assumes no knowledge of global network topology. We provide analysis and design results for multi-agent networks in arbitrary dimensions topology. The novel correctness poof relies on proximity graphs and their properties. In addition, simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, for which we show a distributed dynamic programming of multi-agent system.

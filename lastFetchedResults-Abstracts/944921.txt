Introduction: considering the short period from registration of HIV disease in country and according to the documented data, evaluating the changing process of variables related to HIV seems necessary. This epidemiological study is done to reach this goal.
Material and methods: this study is based on gathered data from Shiraz University of medical science behavioral disease counseling center. Single variable regression following multiple regressions was done to consider the relation between variable illnesses companied by HIV and induced mortality. Timing of the illness was then traced and data interpretation was done upon it.
Results: from 1387 HIV infected patients, 1204 were men. The maximum prevalence observed in 30 to 40 year old aged group by 50.43% and minimum prevalence by 0.65% documented in 50 to 60 year old age. By confidence interval of 95%, the Relations are as follow: AIDS syndrome (5.02 to 01.2, 4.9) ,B and C Hepatitis (3.3 to 6.6, 4.4) (3.004 to 5.47, 4.05), syphilis (0.06 to 0.007, 0.02), cerebrovascular stroke (18.91 to 2.97, 4.39), pulmonary tuberculosis (23.8 to 2.82, 2.88). The relation of mortality induced by HIV between gonorrhea, non-pulmonary tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis, according to the attainable data, was unavailable. 
Conclusion: because most of the patients were young, main focus of caring and preventing programs must be on this group of age. Meaningful relation between AIDS syndrome and mortality with few identified infected persons shows severe weakness in diagnosis of this syndrome before death. Relation between B and C hepatitis and mortality reveals the importance of their rule in prognosis of infected persons.

Neurologists need a rating scale for their patients that help in setting the medication and treatment. In the daily routine neurologists evaluate the movement of Parkinsonians. Different devices aid the objective evaluation. The authors tested 13 Parkinsonians, 36 young healthy and 13 senior healthy subjects using marker-based motion analysis. The reproducibility of the movement test is varying, even healthy subjects exhibit substantial differences while performing movement patterns. However, for most tested persons it is possible to define a subset of movement patterns so that the related parameters were relatively stable for that person. The &#8220;personalisation&#8221; of the test is in harmony with the fact that the manifestation of the disease is unique for each patient

Menadione (vitamin K3) a redox cycling quinone, is a clinically important chemotherapeutic agent. The objective of this study was to clarify the cytotoxic mechanisms by which menadione induces cell death in a lymphoblastoid cell line. Our results show that while the Jun kinase cascade and FasL expression may contribute to cell death at lower drug concentrations, a mitochondrial pathway dominates the cytotoxic effect at higher menadione concentrations. Menadione treatment clearly affected the mitochondrial function of Jurkat T cells by inducing a collapse of the inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and a decrease in inner membrane mass, which could be completely reversed by N-acetylcysteine. Importantly, while a broad range of fmk-derived caspase inhibitors had potent effects on Fas-induced apoptosis, they failed to interfere in menadione cytotoxicity, indicating that menadione-induced cell death is predominantly Fas-independent. In addition, the mitochondrial changes coincided with ATP depletion. The failure in ATP production explains the occurrence of Fas-independent death events.

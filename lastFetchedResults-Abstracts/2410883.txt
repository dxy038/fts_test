Regarding to the increase of cost and consumption of the nonrenewable energies such as natural gas and electricity, using renewable energies such as solar energy reduces the consumption of nonrenewable energies. In this research, at first, a regenerative organic Rankine cycle with flat plate solar collector as energy source is simulated and the effects of different parameters such as turbine inlet temperature, turbine inlet pressure, condenser temperature, solar collector area, environment temperature and solar radiation intensity on energy and exergy efficiency of system under seven organic fluids are investigated. Finally, system optimization with mentioned parameters is taken related to objective function of energy efficiency and objective function of exergy efficiency. The results of optimization illustrate that among the chosen fluids: R141b, R113, R32, R134a, R12, R717, R290, the highest and lowest performances belong to R113 and R32 respectively.

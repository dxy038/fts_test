Objective. A search was conducted to identify the dental materials publications that appeared in biomedical journals from January 1996 to June 1996 and to compare the frequency of citations among the different categories.

Methods. The tables of contents of 16 primary journals and 48 secondary journals were examined to identify dental materials articles that were published from January to June 1996. These citations were divided into 17 categories and the numbers of citations in each category were compared. To assess the usefulness of the citation listing, as survey of Academy of Dental Materials subscribers was conducted (n = 153 of 382 or 40.1% have responded to date).

Results. As in previous years, the greatest number of citations were found in categories of bonding (n=83) and resin-based restorative materials such as composites and resin-reinforced glass ionomers (n=80). Results of the reader survey indicated that 84.3% of the respondents have used the citations lists, and 95.4% feel that its publication should be continued.

Significance. The literature compiled in this list serves to supplement the electronic indexing mechanisms so that academicians and researchers can have ready access to the current literature in the field of dental materials.

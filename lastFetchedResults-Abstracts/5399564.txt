A successful manufacturing is rated based on its ability to produce high quality product on time. Cycle time reduction is one of the most important elements of successful manufacturing today. Its goal is to incorporate less human effort, fewer inventories, and less space to become highly responsive to customer demand while producing top quality products in the most efficient and economical manner possible. At its most basic level within a manufacturing environment it involves an "attack" on rework, inventory, unreliable equipment, poor quality, and unnecessary activities and labor. Customers are demanding that manufacturing quickly respond to their wants and needs; deliver perfect quality products on time. This trend, which will continue, has led more attention on cycle time reduction. Improving the cycle time is the best option due to none/less capital investment is required. The fundamental objective of the Six Sigma methodology is the implementation of a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction. Six Sigma DMAIC approach were utilized to improve the situation, the decision were based on the P-value to minimize the risk. A new design tool/apparatus (patent pending) were used to improve and obtain the desired capacity. The implementation and fan out of the tool/apparatus has indeed improved the quality and cost and productivity.

In this article, acceleration signals, which are obtained by the embedded high-overload electronic solid recorder at the test of armor-piercing bullet penetrating steel target, is done of wave filtering and integral analysis and so on in time domain, frequency-domain analysis through FFT, as well as Wigner-Ville time-frequency analysis and wavelet analysis. It is obtained of the characteristic signal when armor-piercing bullet penetrates steel target under certain conditions. Through signal processing and comprehensive analysis, the trait of armor-piercing bullet penetrating steel target is obtained, also a kind of data processing method is provided to engineers, by which concerned parameters can be got.

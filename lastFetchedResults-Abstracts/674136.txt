Objective
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy
that occurs mostly after prior infection. The diagnosis of this syndrome is
dependent heavily on the history and examination, although cerebrospinal
fluid analysis and electrodiagnostic testing usually confirm the diagnosis.
This is a retrospective study which was performed to investigate the atypical
features of GBS.
Materials & Methods
Thirtythree patients(21/63.6%males and 12/36.4%females)withGBSwere
retrospectively studied and prospectively evaluated at the Child Neurology
institute of Mofid Children Hospital of Shahid Beheshti University of
Medical Sciences between May 2011 and September 2012.
Results
The mean age was 5.4 years (range, 1.5-10.5).Twenty one patients (87.9%)
had previous history of infections. Eight patients (24.2%) admitted with
atypical symptoms like upper limb weakness (3%), ptosis (3%), neck
stiffness (3%), inability to stand (proximal weakness) (9.1%), headache
(3%) and dysphagia (3%).According to disease process, weakness was
ascending in 26 (78.8%), descending in 5 (15.2%) and static in 2 (6.1%)
patients. Cranial nerve involvement was found in 8(24.3%) children, most
commonly as facial palsy in 3 (9.1%).
Conclusion In thisstudy, 24.3%of our patients presentedwith atypical
symptoms ofGBS as upper limb weakness, ptosis, neck stiffness, inability
to stand (proximal weakness), headache and dysphagia

The main objective of this paper is to propose a new controller for robot manipulators on Cartesian coordinates with formal confirmation of stability, to verify its performance comparing it with the Cartesian PD controller. In this paper we describe an experimental Cartesian robot for research and development of robot control algorithms. This system allows the development and easy test of Cartesian control strategies on three degrees of freedom. The functionality of this system is explained via real-time experimental results of a new position Cartesian control algorithm with global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.

OBJECTIVE: Thi tudy aimed to decribe a yndrome that the author call human T-lymphotropic viru type I–related chronic intertitial keratiti.
METHOD: A conecutive erie of 194 human T-lymphotropic viru type I–infected patient (divided into 119 patient with human T-lymphotropic viru type I–aociated myelopathy/tropical patic paraparei and 75 aymptomatic human T-lymphotropic viru type I carrier) wa ytematically examined.
REULT: Twenty patient (10.3%) had bilateral anterior tromal leion made up of approximately 10 elevated, rounded or cloudy whitih opacitie that were more or le confluent. The opacitie were characteritically ituated at the periphery of the anterior troma, and the viual axi remained unaffected. The intertitial keratiti wa chronic and unreponive to topical adminitration of corticoteroid. It wa mainly oberved in patient affected by human T-lymphotropic viru type I–aociated myelopathy/tropical patic paraparei among whom there were 18 cae (15.1%), a oppoed to two cae (2.7%) in aymptomatic carrier.
CONCLUION: A new caue of intertitial keratiti i reported. Human T-lymphotropic viru type I infection may have a much broader pectrum of ocular manifetation than previouly decribed. A with the other manifetation of human T-lymphotropic viru type I infection, corneal leion could be linked to a lymphoplamocytic infiltration of the troma leading to corneal opacitie

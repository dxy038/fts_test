Background: Considering the prevalance of pain after surgical operations and the importance of rapid pain alleviation, physical exercises after surgery is a simple method for relieving pain. Objective: To determine the effect of exercise on pain after cesarean section.
Methods: This clinical trial study was performed on 40 volunteer patients for cesarean section at Aytollah Kashani hospital in Jiroft in 1999-2000. The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups of 20 : Case and control groups. Physical exercises were taught to the case group including proper deep breathing, effective coughing, limb movement, changing position in bed and leaving bed , but they were not demonstrated to the control group. All operations were performed by one surgeon and the effects of exercise were measured by numerically illustrated comparsion criteria. Using chi-square and Fisher tests the data were analyzed.Findings: Results showed that the cases had significantly lower pain magnitude and receptive after operations especially on the 1st , 2nd and 3rd days after operation there was a significant correlation between pain of both groups (P<0.0005) , (P<0.0001).Conclusion: Considering the findings of this study, physical exercises after abdominal surgeries is recomended as a simple non-medical and non-invasive method for relieving pain.

The performance of a model-based control system depends strongly on the accuracy of the process model used. LS-SVM is a powerful method for modeling nonlinear systems. The main objective of this paper is to implement a conventional controller based on LS-SVM model for hydraulic motor. An off-line model is first identified based on LS-SVM, then via simulation tests the parameters of the discrete PI-Controller and its velocity-form are obtained then the controller parameters are applied experimentally for the hydraulic motor as a speed controller. The system performance has been evaluated; results show good performance over a wide range of operating conditions and load disturbances.

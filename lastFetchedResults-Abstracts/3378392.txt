A bidirectional radio-on dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) transport system based on external light injection technique and adaptive filters is proposed. Not only were a low bit-error rate and error vector magnitude obtained, but also good performance of third-order intermodulation distortion to carrier ratio (IMD<sub>3</sub>/C) was achieved for local area network (LAN) and intelligence transport system (ITS) applications.

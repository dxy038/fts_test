In order to in-depth understand and represent knowledge work, this article conduct a research on knowledge system and its functions within the knowledge work from the perspective of objective ontology. Knowledge work is a production system whose input is knowledge system and output is specific function. From this point of view, a framework model of knowledge work is constructed. Furthermore, the model of knowledge work was used to analyze the software design work. The results demonstrate that software design work can be considered as a production system with its input as the code system and output as the function implemented by code system. This model accurately characterizes knowledge work from the objective ontology perspective and provides a foundation for quantitative measurement of knowledge work.

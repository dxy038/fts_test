Mobile Robotic teleultrasonography is an emerging technology that can be applied in different clinical settings for remote ultrasound scanning without the need of the expert at the point of care. Guaranteed medical image quality for diagnostic purposes and their delivery in bandwidth limited wireless environments is a challenging issue. In this paper we present some of the subjective and objective image analysis acquired from a robotic teleultrasonography system operated remotely by the expert to provide an assessment of these medical imaging measures for such advanced wireless telemedical system.

In this paper, two short-time spectral amplitude estimators of the speech signal are derived based on a parametric formulation of the original generalized spectral subtraction method. The objective is to improve the noise suppression performance of the original method while maintaining its computational simplicity. The proposed parametric formulation describes the original method and several of its modifications. Based on the formulation, the speech spectral amplitude estimator is derived and optimized by minimizing the mean-square error (MSE) of the speech spectrum. With a constraint imposed on the parameters inherent in the formulation, a second estimator is also derived and optimized. The two estimators are different from those derived in most modified spectral subtraction methods, which are predominantly nonstatistical. When tested under stationary white Gaussian noise and semistationary Jeep noise, they showed improved noise suppression results

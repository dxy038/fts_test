Introduction: Detergents are formulations designed to have cleaning and solubilisation properties. These formulations consist of surface-active agent (surfactants) to gather with subsidiary components including builers, boosters, fillers and auxiliary compounds. Discharge of wastewater detergent has been highly considered as main environmental problems by both the municipal and industries, which produce them. This research has studied the coagulation effectiveness and performance for reduces of detergent in effluent wastewater.
Material and Methods: The objective of this research, the wastewater effluent, was provided from the paksan industry and composite sampling were done. Following coagulation and flocculation with one kind of coagulant material were done in the different pH (2-13). So optimum pH was determined for each of them. Then optimum concentration of coagulant material was determined by the jar test.
Results: The process of the flocculation was tested by Alum, Ca(oH)2 ,FeSo4 and FeC13. This examination has gained the best results with applied FeCl3. So that removal efficiency of this coagulant for surfactant, turbidity and COD respectively were 82, 96.1 and 93.4 percent.
Conclusion: The results showed that detergents wastewater can be treated by the flocculation process and result indicated that FeCl3 can remove surfactant 82%. Hence remove of detergent enhanced by the other wastewater advanced treatment.

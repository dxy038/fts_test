It is necessary to take the apparent movement recognition quantitatively, objectively and simply and definitely to design the tactile display of touch sensor which used the apparent movement. In previous paper, we reported the possibility that the characteristic movement of a body site was produced when we presented the apparent movement to the subjects who were in the experiment environment, keeping the body specific condition. In this study, we analyze and verify the muscle activity related to the swinging motion of the body site with EMG. Originally, the apparent movement is a movement sense (illusion). Therefore, we interpret that the subjects present reaction to resist it when the subjects recognize the apparent movement and feel that his body site is tempted by the movement of this stimulation image. In this study, we used the feature extraction related to the biological reaction when recognizing the apparent movement by the technique that put STFT and cluster analysis together as analysis object for a low level ingredient of EMG which treated an envelope curve. In the experiment, we instructed the subjects to maintain their arms in a horizontal position with putting one by one in total four oscillators between the fingers of the left hand. In addition, the subjects click a mouse instead of pushing a button when recognizing the apparent movement. As a result, we could confirm the effectiveness of the suggestion technique, and the objective technique of the apparent movement recognition was enabled by measuring the activity of the deltoid.

We consider the problem of optimizing traffic flow in a fixed network of wired and wireless links where some wireless links interfere with each other. The objective of the network operator is to maximize the total amount of traffic carried. We present algorithms for computing traffic flow in in a mixed wired-wireless network to meet demand and maximize the total traffic carried.

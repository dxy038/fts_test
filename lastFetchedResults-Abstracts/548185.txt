The amount of forage production is basically used to determine grazing capacity. Measuring the amount of rangeland production to determine the carrying capacity, is one of the most important factor. Various methods depend on vegetation type, density, percentages of canopy cover, affordable time, accuracy, experts experience, etc., have been proposed. Measuring the amount of forage production with clipping and weighting method is the most reliable method, but it is time consuming and expensive. So we must choose an accurate and simple method with less cost and time consumption. One of these methods is application of grass master that is one of the capacitance meter type. The objective of research was investigation on grassmaster efficiency comparing with clipping and weighting method in three types of grassland, alfa -alfa fields and shrublands in two growth stages (flowering and seed ripening). In each habitat along 2 transects, 200 plots (1m2) were used. In each plot production with clipping and weighting method and with grassmaster was measured. Data were analysed using SPSSversion 15 software. The Results showed that grass master in shrub land didn`t record any data. Therefore, grass master is not suitable for shrub lands. In grassland and alfa-alfa field according to correlation coefficients, results were as follows:  grasslands in flowering stage (97%), seed ripening stage (92%), cultivated alfa-alfa in flowering stage (61%), seed ripening stage (27%). So the best efficiency obtained for Grasslands.

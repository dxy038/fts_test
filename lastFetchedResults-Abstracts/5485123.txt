This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that has been implemented to control the steam temperature in steam distillation for the extraction oil. The objective of this research is to implement the ARMAX model structure and to design the typical controller using FLC to control the steam temperature as a controlled parameter. Temperature regulation is an importance factor to avoid the degradation of the quality oil produced. PRBS input is triggered to the system and output of steam temperature is modeled using ARMAX model structure. FLC is designed with two inputs and one output which are error, difference error and voltage respectively. There are 49 fuzzy rules that involved in performing the FLC. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed of FLC achieves the better result in controlling the temperature as compared to the PID controller considering the test on the set point tracking.

In this paper, a new scheme to control an Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) installed in a two-area power system is proposed. The power system is equipped with the SSSC to improve Load-Frequency Control (LFC). In the proposed scheme, SSSC is able to compensate for load changes in both areas on both sides of SSSC. Objective functions of designing parameters are based on Integral of Time multiplied by Absolute value of the Error (ITAE). Parameters of conventional integral controllers and active power controller of SSSC are designed using defined optimization problems. To solve the optimization problems, PSO algorithm is used. Simulation results of the two-area power system equipped with SSSC and without SSSC are compared.

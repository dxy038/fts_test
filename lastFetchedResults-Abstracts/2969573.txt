A probabilistic model for evaluating the blocking and forced termination probabilities for voice and data calls in wireless communication networks is presented. Ongoing traffic can access a waiting queue and reserved guard channels for their own use to reduce the forced termination probability. Priority is given to voice handoffs over data handoffs. The objective of this traffic policy is to achieve higher quality of service (QoS) for voice, while maintaining low deterioration for data calls and keeping good utilization of the mobile network. The model can be applied when the mean service times for voice and data are different. The analysis is validated by results obtained from a comprehensive simulation

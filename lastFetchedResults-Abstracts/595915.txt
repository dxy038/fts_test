Objective: Evaluation of the results after the first 105 cycles in private IVF centres in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Study design: Retrospective analysis of one hundred and five infertile couples who underwent IVF procedures. Results: The mean age of women who underwent IVF/ ICSI was 34.1±5.1. The male factor was the cause of infertility in 50 (47.6%), tubal factor in 24 (22.2%), idiopathic infertility in 14 (13.3%), advanced age in 14 (13.3%) and PCOS in 4 (3.8%) infertile couples. The average number of retrieved oocyte was 7.84±5.30. In 96.2% cycles ICSI was performed and in 3.8% IVF/ICSI. The average number of transferred embryos per cycle was 2.49±0.9. The pregnancy rate per aspiration was 26.7%. The clinical pregnancy rate per transfer was 26.3%. The percentage of live births per transfer to date was 13.1 % and 7 of them are still pregnant. In the entire group of pregnant women 40% had twin pregnancies, 1 of them had an ectopic pregnancy (1.01%) and 4 (4.04%) had spontaneous abortions. Conclusions: The pregnancy and delivery rates are not satisfactory. The twin pregnancy rate is higher than is acceptable. Low-cost hormonal stimulation, natural cycles and freezing of embryos could be a possible way to make IVF affordable to a larger number of infertile couples.

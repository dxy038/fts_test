Aesthetics, integrity of the existing roofing, installation cost, and ease of installation become critical issues for successful introduction of residential grid-connected PV systems. The objective of this work is to develop an easily installed grid-interactive power system that incorporates direct-mount modules that are designed for large-area Silicon-Film<sup>TM</sup> solar cells. The authorsÂ´ goal is to develop a total system package that meets all National Electrical Code requirements, eliminates the need for the installer to procure components, and significantly reduces the labor and cost of a rooftop installation. They have developed a flexible module framing system that is scaleable and allows for direct or offset roof mounting. The framing system is compatible with Silicon Film<sup>TM</sup> and single crystal products. They have designed and tested a complete power system package and provide this as assembled kits for installers. Future systems will incorporate a low-cost AC power-monitoring interface that is integrated into the system

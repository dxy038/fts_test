Tailoring broad optical sources to the free spectral range of a waveguide-grating router, we show that multiple independent broadcast services can be delivered efficiently over a common wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (PON). In addition to 1) delivering two independent video services, each comprising 80 digital video channels, we further exploit the periodicity property of the router to simultaneously deliver; 2) bidirectional 50-Mb/s baseband conventional PON service; 3) a limited (50 channel) digital broadcast video service; and 4) an individual 2.5-Gb/s bidirectional link to a "business" subscriber, demonstrating several distinct upgrade paths. Bit-error-rate performance and dispersion measurements are presented.

We describe a network architecture for bidirectional transfer of information in the upgraded design of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Special requirements imposed by the application lead to a non-conventional network design compared to commercial telecommunication networks. The main factors driving the design are the highly asymmetric and upstream-intensive traffic and the requirement for low mass, low power and radiation hard front-end components. Following the analysis of the proposed network we focus on the temperature sensitivity of the selected front-end component and its impact on system performance.

The study objective was to estimate the level of asthma knowledge and self-management skills among asthmatic patients who are not on inhaled corticosteroids and who present with acute asthma to the emergency department (ED). The design was to interview of patients by telephone at 90 to 100 days after enrollment in the Fourth Multicenter Airways Research Collaboration (MARC-4), a randomized trial comparing inhaled fluticasone versus placebo in addition to standard post-ED therapy. The setting was a multicenter trial involving 41 US urban EDs. Persons aged 12 to 54, not on inhaled steroids, who presented to the ED with acute asthma were studied. Of the 617 patients enrolled on MARC-4 405 (66%) were contacted. Mean (±SD) age was 30 (±11); 54% were women; acute asthma severity was 44% moderate and 56% severe; and 9% had prior intubation. Twenty percent (95% CI 16%–24%) responded that asthma could not be monitored and 40% (95% CI 35%–44%) scored low on a hypothetical acute asthma attack scenario. Predictors for lack of asthma knowledge and self-management skills were: less than a high school education; current smoking; lower median household income; and no history of steroid use. These data suggest that many ED patients with asthma have poor knowledge of asthma monitoring and poor self-management skills and that a “high risk” group is also identifiable. Efforts to design and implement an ED-based educational program should be tailored to better meet the needs of this high risk group.

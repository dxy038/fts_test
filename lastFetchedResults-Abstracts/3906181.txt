A type of leaky-wave antenna that is particularly suitable for applications in the millimeter-wave range is analyzed. The objective of this work is to provide a practical and accurate theory for the design of this class of antennas. The analysis procedure is based on the development of a novel, multimode transverse equivalent network representation. All mutual coupling effects are rigorously taken into account. A single dispersion relation is derived via a transverse resonance procedure, and the complex dispersion behavior of the antenna is obtained through its numerical solution. Useful approximate initial design formulas are given, and a detailed parametric analysis is carried out, showing the effects of changes of all the structural parameters. The results obtained indicate that the structure, in addition to being mechanically simple to realize, exhibits a very flexible electrical behavior. The theory developed, therefore, is a powerful tool for the design and optimization of this class of antennas

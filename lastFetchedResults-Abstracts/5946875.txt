This paper presents a comprehensive program based on a novel analytical model for a variable reluctance machine (VRM) developed in Matlab-language to compute the value of the flux linkage, coenergy and instantaneous electromagnetic torque as functions of rotor position and winding currents, taking into account the non-linearity of the magnetic circuit. The models are compared with the ones obtained, for the same motor, via a 2D finite elements analysis (FEA) using Flux-2D software. The genetic algorithms (GA) and analytical model are able to determine optimal geometriy of a doubly salient 6/4 VRM with the objective function maximizing the torque with a rate of undulation maintained constant. The obtained results are discussed and shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

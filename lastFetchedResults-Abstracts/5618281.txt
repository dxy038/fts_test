Mobile robotics has been used widely in education as a learning tool, as it provides a motivating and interesting tool to perform laboratory experiments within the context of mechatronics, electronics, computer, and control. The robot innovative platform made it possible for the students to practice and learn many necessary skills. A tracing algorithm about machine vision intelligent tracing System based on CCD camera was described. The proposed system is comprised of a modular robot and the microcontroller XS128 as tools to design and implement the intelligent tracing system. The objective of this machine vision system is to implement an intelligent tracing system, which can track a black line as fast and stable as possible. It is student-oriented and career-oriented. The encouraging results demonstrate that students learn to design and give creative solution to given problems from an interdisciplinary point of view.

Success of any IT industry depends on the success rate of their projects, which in turn depends on several factors such as cost, time, and availability of resources. These factors formulate the risk areas, which needs to be addressed in a proactive way. The rudimentary objective of risk management is to circumvent the possibility of their occurrence by identifying the risks, preparing the contingency plans and mitigation plans in order to reduce the consequences of the risks. Hence, effective risk management becomes one of the imperative challenges in any organization, which if deemed in an apt way assures the continued sustainability of the organization in the high-end competitive environment. This paper provides visualization of risk assessment through a graphical model. Further, the matrix representation of the risk assessment aids the project personnel to identify all the risks, comprehend their frequency and probability of their occurrence. In addition, the graphical model enables one to analyze the impact of identified risks and henceforth to assign their priorities. This mode of representation of risk assessment factors helps the organization in accurate prediction of success rate of the project.

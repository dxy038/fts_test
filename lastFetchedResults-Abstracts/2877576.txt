In production planning, one of the major challenges for plan optimization lies in quantifying the dependence of the objective criterion (typically total cost) upon the decision variables that specify a release plan of jobs. Existing methods either fall short in capturing such a relationship, which involves non-stationary stochastic processes of a manufacturing system (e.g., the number of jobs over time), or require discrete-event simulation (DES) to evaluate the objective criterion for each candidate decision, which is time-consuming. To enable the accurate and precise estimation of the objective for any decision plan within a reasonable time, this work proposed a metamodeling-based approach. The metamodels take the form of difference equations, embody the high-fidelity of DES, and can be used to address &#8220;what if&#8221; questions in a timely manner. When embedded in the optimization of production planning, the metamodels can help to improve the quality and responsiveness of decision making.

Due to new needs of supply systems, new solutions must be developed and evaluated. One of the important tools is discrete simulation model. Companies and manufacturers can use it to perform analyses to estimate the impact of their decisions performance on the overall before they made any real system changes. In this paper, we consider multi objective functions and integrated inventory. Also, regarding other states such as opening warehouses for some of plants and designing a three echelon supply chain will be performed. We survey the new model and will be compared with the previous method of same authors.

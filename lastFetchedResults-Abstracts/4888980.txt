This work focuses on the problem of dynamic provisioning of bidirectional connections in all-optical WDM networks. In absence of wavelength converters, each data path forming a bidirectional lightpath needs to use the same wavelength on every link of the entire route (i.e., wavelength continuity constraint). Though existing GMPLS framework faces up the bidirectional lightpath establishment, it fails with high probability under the WCC restriction. Therefore, a distributed and dynamic routing and wavelength assignment (DRWA) algorithm is proposed to perform bidirectional path computation taking into account global wavelength network utilization. By doing so, the algorithm is capable to meet efficiently with the WCC each particular connection request. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared in the ADRENALINE testbed using a traditional bandwidth-based algorithm as a benchmark. The results are expressed in terms of connection blocking and setup delay for different traffic loads.

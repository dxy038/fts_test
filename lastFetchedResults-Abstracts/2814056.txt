Contamination is a growing problem affecting irrigation water. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of two sources of irrigation water, clean one and sewage; and organic matter on the association with Glomus intrarradices on beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Sixteen soil sample wells were located using GPS in a digital orthopicture from the Mexican Institute of Geography and informatics. Half of the plants were inoculated with Glomus intrarradices. Vermicompost was used as a source of organic matter. There were highly significant increases (p&#8804;0.05) in all the variables recorded due to the application of organic matter, and to the inoculation with Glomus intrarradices. The irrigation source of the soils used in this experiment only had a significant effect (p&#8804;0.05) on pod number and nitrogen fixation. The best growth and grain yield occurred with inoculated plants and supplementary organic matter.

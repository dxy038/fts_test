Background and Objective: Food deprivation increases the expression of orexin1 receptor gene in the hypothalamus. On the other hand, food deprivation induces analgesia and orexin has a fundamental and well known role in pain modulation. This study aimed to determine the role of orexin receptor 1 antagonist in analgesic effect of acute food deprivation (12 h) by hot plate test in male rats.

Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups (n=8), control, food deprivation without surgery, stereotaxic surgery with vehicle, vehicle and food deprivation and food deprivation and orexin receptor 1 antagonist groups. 12 hours before the hot plate test, food was removed from the animals&amp;rsquo; proximity, but water was freely available. All groups were tested using the hot plate. Data were analyzed statistically by oneway ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test.

Results: According to our findings, orexin receptor 1 antagonist injection increased pain related behaviors at the time of 5(P&lt;0.05), 15(P&lt;0.05), 30(P&lt;0.01) and 60(P&lt;0.001) minutes in the hot plate test.

Conclusion: Orexin plays an important role in feeding state&amp;ndash;induced pain modulation. Based on our results, change in pain behavior induced by food deprivation may be related to change in orexin expression or in orexin receptors density.

Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes acute gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of contaminated raw or under cooked seafood. The virulence of vibrio parahaemolyticus is initially attributed to the production of a thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH).
Objective: The survey of different concentrations of garlic essential oil (Allium sativum) on MIC, MBC, growth curve and production of TDH toxin of vibrio parahaemolyticus.
Methods: The effects of garlic essential oil at concentrations of 0, 0.005, 0.015, 0.03 and 0.045% on the MIC, MBC, growth curve and production of TDH toxin of vibrio parahaemolyticus were studied in BHI model.
Results: MIC and MBC of garlic essential oil was estimated 0.03%. The essential oil showed significant effect on toxin production, Titers of TDH production in 0 and 0.005% were 1/256 comparing to 1/64 in 0.015% concentration of EO. Concentrations of 0.005 and 0.015% of garlic essential oil reduced the bacterial growth rate significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the control group.
Conclusion: Garlic essential oil showed to be effective against bacterial growth and production of TDH toxin. Its potential application in food systems may be suggested.

In this experiment, high quality thin film acoustic devices were constructed utilizing zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film deposition, integrated circuit (IC), and electrochemical etch techniques. The bridge type ZnO thin film ultrasonic devices produced showed acute high frequency response sensitivity, with the high frequency response at 600 KHz attaining -124 dBV /spl mu/Bar. The highest response was near 8 MHz. Sensitivity increased in direct proportion to frequency, indicating that the bridge-type ZnO thin film acoustic devices were suitable for application as ultrasonic wave sensors at high operating frequencies. Further experimentation verified that the bridge-type ZnO thin film acoustic devices fabricated also had ultrasonic signal transmitting capability and signal bidirectional devices having both transmission and reception functions were successfully constructed. Therefore, bridge-type ZnO thin film acoustic devices will continue to be developed in the future due to the reliable control possible over the structural transformations involved; and, since IC fabrication techniques can be readily adopted in the process, the manufacturing of such devices will be greatly assisted.

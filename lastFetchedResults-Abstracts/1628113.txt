The main objective of this study is to develop a new approach for biofinishing of cellulose-containing fabrics using cellulases under pad-wet batch conditions followed by washing cycle with a high level of mechanical agitation to terminate the enzyme and to remove the weakened fuzz fibers and surface pills, i.e. biopolishing of the fiber's surface. The effect of enzyme dosage, wet-pickup, batching time and temperature as well as type of substrate on the efficiency of enzymatic treatment as well as on the performance and dyeing properties is discussed. Experimental results revealed that padding the used substrates in a bath containing acid-cellulases (20 g/L) and nonionic wetting agent (2 g/L) to a wet-pickup 80% followed by batching at 50 °C for 18 h, and after washing under mechanical action (28 rpm, pH 9, temperature 75 °C, LR 1/20, for 30 min) could upgrade the final properties of the treated substrates especially fabric handle, drapability as well as dyeability with minimal loss in strength. The extent of improvement in the abovementioned properties is determined by the nature of the cellulose-containing fabric. SEM picture clearly shows that the surface of cellulases-treated cotton fabric appear smoother and softer than the untreated one.

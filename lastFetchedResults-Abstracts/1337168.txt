Background: Some patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus have not good glycaemic control with ordinary doses of insulin. So applying other treatment modality in addition to insulin and diet therapy could improve glycaemic control.
Objective: To evaluate whether, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the addition of Metformin to insulin and standard diabetes management result in better glycaemic control and lower insulin dosage .
Methods: In a clinical trial study 16 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes with had high insulin intake and HbA1c  > 8% were participated. HbA1c, FBS, 2hpp BG, insulin dosage and BMI were measured and compared at the onset and end of the treatment.
Results: There were significant differences in HbA1c and insulin dosage between the time of 0 of the study and after 4 months of Metformin addition therapy. But there were no significant differences between BMI, FBG and 2 h pp BG at the onset of the study and end of it.
Conclusion: Metformin treatment lowered HbA1c and decreased insulin dosage in patients with type 1 diabetes in poor metabolic control. Long term studies will determine if these improvements are sustained.

Of special industrial interest is the cross-directional control of continuous coating processes, where the cross-direction refers to the direction perpendicular to the substrate movement. The objective of the controller is to maintain a uniform coating under unmeasured process disturbances based on assumptions relevant to coating processes found in industry. A model for control design is developed. This model is used to derive a model predictive controller with the objective of maintaining flat profiles of coating across the substrate by varying the liquid flows along the cross direction. Actuator constraints, measurement noise, and model uncertainty are investigated to determine which of these limit the achivable closed loop performance. From a knowledge of the effect of these limitations on performance we determine how the plant could be modified to improve the coating uniformity. The theory developed throughout the paper is rigorously verified though experiments on an industrial pilot plant.

Amirkelayeh wetland is an international wetland , located in Guilan province( Iran ) . Fifteen fish species inhabit in the wetland , of these , Perch ( Berea fluviatilis , L. 1785) is the most abundant species. The present study was carried out on parasites of perch in the wetland from March 2001 to February 2002. The objective was the study on parasite communities of perch and also calculating the prevalence mean intensity , range , abundance and dominance of the parasites . Haphazard sampling was carried out using gill net and ect. Standard necropdy and parasitology methods were used for finding the parasites . The speciemens were for finding the parasites . The speciemens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and stained with acetocarmine . The nematodes were cleared in Iactophenol.The parasites were identified by parasite identification keys. In the present study , five parasite species were found in the samples consisting of Camallanus lacustris , ( prevalence = p = 36/2% , mean intensity = mi = 3/75 ) , Diplostomum spathaceum , (p= 8/59% , mi=l ) ,Lemaeasp ., ( p = 4/29% , mi = 2/57%) ,Argulus sp ., ( p = 0/61% , mi I ) and Dactylogyrus sp ., (p -0/61% , mi = 5 ) . In this study , C. lacustris , Argulus sp. and Dactylogyrus sp. are reported for the first time from perch in Iran. The prevalence of C. lacustris was more than other parasites. As a whole , the diversity of parasites in Perch was less than in the other predatory fish ( such as pike ) in Amirkelayeh wetland.

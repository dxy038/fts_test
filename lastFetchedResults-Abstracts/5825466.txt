A power system analysis determines whether the proposed system upgrades, future upgrades and present distribution equipment will meet the present and future system requirements. This project involves two major parts, namely modelling and simulation for the purpose of load flow and short circuit studies. Modelling here refers to the mathematical representation of various components of a power system such as generating units, transmission lines, buses, transformers, loads, machines, etc. While simulation is required to establish the actual situation on the platform and how it will run based on different scenarios. ERACS has been extensively used in this project as it helps to improve the simulation process by increasing the speed of simulation and has a powerful graphical user interface. SUMANDAK phase 2 (SUPG-B) platform is chosen as a case study for sample analysis. The main objective of the project is to determine the performance of an electrical power system for an offshore platform and to validate its precision, based on the system stability and equipment selection of an actual project.

Actual demand and cost in logistics system changed with time. The facility location problem considering the time factor was studied in this paper. A dynamic logistics nodes location model considering capacitated, multi-source and multi-level logistics nodes was presented. We also considered the influence of the transition between hub and non-hub logistics nodes, and established a new node. Based on the previous multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on external dominance clustering (ED-MOEA), a discrete ED-MOEA was proposed to resolve this problem. When solving it, the objective was decomposed into a bi-objective problem. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and the algorithm.

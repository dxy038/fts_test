In this paper, a flux search controller is proposed to increase the efficiency of a direct torque-controlled induction motor in full load range. The value of the flux reference is determined through a minimization algorithm. The amplitude of stator current is used as the objective function since it is shown that samples of the stator current have better statistical properties than input power. In addition, the stator current has more sensitivity to the flux variation than input power. These two properties allow implementing an adaptive algorithm to determine the proper flux step without waste of time. The minimum allowable value of the flux step has been determined based on this process to prevent the divergence problem. This adaptive algorithm set a large flux step for transient state to speed up the convergence process and a small flux step for steady state to minimize the flux ripple. Simulation and experimental results presented in this paper confirm the fast dynamic of the proposed method.

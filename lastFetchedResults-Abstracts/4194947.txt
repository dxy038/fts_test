This paper deals with fine contact force control in robotic grasping. The main objective is to achieve tracking of the planned trajectory for a grasped object and, at the same time, ensure suitable grasp quality. Interaction of the grasped object with the external environment is considered as well. To this aim, an impedance control law is adopted to enforce a compliant behavior of the object when comes in contact with the environment. A simulation case study is developed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

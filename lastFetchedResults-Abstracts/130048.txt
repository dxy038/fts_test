Objective: Psychological debriefing has been used to prevent symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from different traumatic events. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been effective in treatment of PTSD, too. This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of psychological debriefing and cognitive-behavioral group therapy. Method: In a before-after trial (field study), 174 survivors of Barn earthquake with PTSD symptoms who did not require pharmacological treatment for PTSD or other psychiatric disorders were enrolled. They attended one session of psychological debriefing and three sessions of group cognitive-behavioral therapy. PTSD symptoms were assessed by CAPS before, immediately after and 3 months following the intervention. The results were analyzed using paired t-test and repeat ANOVA before and after the intervention. Results: Of 174 subjects, 50 dropped out for migration or personal preferences. Following the intervention, the frequency of PTSD symptoms changed markedly in the short run; however, the severity of symptoms was statistically meaningful in the short run (immediately after the intervention). The change in the mean avoidance symptoms was statistically significant, but the intervention had no effect on re-experience (long term) and hyper arousal (short- and long term). Conclusion: Interventions including a session of psychological debriefing and three sessions of group cognitive-behavioral therapy may be effective in reducing some PTSD symptoms (like avoidance) after the earthquake, but has no effects on hyper arousal symptoms.

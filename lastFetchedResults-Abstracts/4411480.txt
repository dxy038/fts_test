New ultra low capacitance bidirectional transient voltage suppression (Bi-TVS) devices consist of two parallel unidirectional TVS devices facing opposite directions, have been fabricated for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection applications. The reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology allows growing uniform thin Si films with various doping conditions and thicknesses of a PIN and TVS diode in one die. This result in a small turn on dynamic resistance of ~0.7 &#937; and leakage current below 10<sup>-9</sup> A. The employing PIN diode was effective in reducing the capacitance that suppressed down to ~0.6 pF and in leading to the wide signal band pass over 3 GHz. The fabricated Bi-TVS device was capability handled the IEC 610004-2 peak voltage and TLP current in exceeding &#177;29 kV and &#177;30 A. The research results guarantee that the new proposed TVS device is very effective in protecting high speed data line against strong and rapid ESD attacks.

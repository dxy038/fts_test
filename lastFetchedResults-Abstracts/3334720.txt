Test time reduction is an important objective in SoC testing. This becomes harder to achieve when power management techniques, like dynamic voltage scaling, are used, that requires a core to be tested for all its operating voltages. Coupling test time with test power consumption, due to long interconnects and switching power consumption, creates a difficult situation for SoC testing. To cope with this issue, this paper proposes a new Test Access Mechanism (TAM) that uses Multi-Valued Logic (MVL). In this structure, test data going to cores with MVL technique through the same test bus. This paper proposes Binary-MVL converters, and structure of test data on a multi-voltage test bus. This arrangement also reduces test time in multi-VDD SoCs as well. We have analyzed on crosstalk noise, area and power overhead of the proposed structure. In addition, we use IEEE 1450 - Standard Test Interface Language (STIL) to send and receive MVL signal in the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) side. We also present a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for optimal test scheduling based on our new TAM structure. Experimental results for ITCÂ´02 benchmark highlight the effectiveness of the proposed structure.

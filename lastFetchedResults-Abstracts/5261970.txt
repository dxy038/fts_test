The software package ConPAHS facilitates control design of continuous-time piecewise-affine hybrid systems on polytopes. For the control objective of reaching a particular state from a specified initial state, the output of the package is a piecewise-affine control law. After a short review of the control theory for this problem, the paper presents the functional specification of ConPAHS, the objected oriented software principles used, the program structure, and the design choices. Three examples including simulations are provided to illustrate the use of ConPAHS.

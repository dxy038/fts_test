Leaf area index (LAI) is an extremely important structural characteristic of vegetation because it is directly related to the exchange of energy, CO2 and mass from plant canopies at a variety of scales. Research investigating the relationship between forest LAI and satellite data for hardwood and mixed conifer-hardwood forests is lacking, however. The objective of this study was to explore the utility of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data for accurately estimating the LAI of conifer, hardwood, and mixed conifer-hardwood forests in north central Wisconsin. Individual bands and vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from satellite measures of exoatmospheric reflectance were related to the litterfall-estimated LAI of 24 stands. The results showed that individual bands or VIs containing at least one infrared (IR) band (either near- or mid-infrared) or a strong IR component divided data into at least two groups, with each group requiring a different regression line. The primary division was between conifer-dominated and hardwood-doin inated stands. Of the individual bands and VI.s considered, seven were strongly correlated to the LAI of conifer stands (r2=0.69–0.73). For the hardwoods, the best individual band or VI was Green/mid-IR#1 (r2=0.35), although an additional individual band and two VIs did much better using re subset of lower LAI stands (r2=0.60–0.75). For individual bands and VIs not requiring a conifer-hardwood distinction, the sixth Tasseled Cap component was most closely related to LAI (r2=0.60). Multiple-variable models (using LAI as the dependent variable) were found to offer substantial improvement over single-variable models, especially for hardwood stands. We recommend for further consideration a four-variable model for the conifers, and one four-variable and two eight-variable models for the hardwoods.

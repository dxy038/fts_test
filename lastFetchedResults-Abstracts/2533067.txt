Background and Objective: Stroke accompanied by psychiatric disorder and mental performance is   one of the most disabling neurological diseases in adults and depression is the most common psychical complication  among them. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of early depression after stroke.

Materials and Methods: Using a convenient sling method throughout this descriptive study, data gathering was done via  check lists and DSMIVTR criteria. Interviews along with observations were also applied to collect the data.The study population consisted of 80 stroke patients referred to Imam Sajjad and Tonekabon Shaheed Rajaei Hospitals over the years of 20102012. Anatomic location of the lesion was determined by MRI and CTscan after examining and diagnosis. Descriptive and inferential statistics  
(ttest, ANOVA, and chisquare) were used to analyse the collected data.

Results: The overall incidence of early post stroke depression was 45%. There was no significant correlation between early post stroke depression and age, sex, involved vascular line, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, multiplicity of stroke attacks and anatomical place of stroke. There was a significant correlation of  early post stroke depression with type of stroke (p=0.023) and diabetes (p=0.027).

Conclusion: The results showed high prevalence depression in patients after stroke attack. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to depression symptoms and its risk factors for accelerating recovery and decreasing  the risk of subsequent stroke and mortality.

Objective
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel noninvasive technique that can map subsurface tissue structure with a resolution of 10 to 20 Î¼m. The objective of this study was to determine whether an OCT imaging system could be used clinically in vivo to image and distinguish features of normal and abnormal cervical tissue.
Study design
Cervical OCT images and biopsy specimens were obtained from consenting volunteers. Images were analyzed quantitatively for intensity of backscattered light from the epithelia and for rates of signal decay of signal over the depth of epithelia (slope). Patients were stratified by menopausal status, and parameters were compared in normal and abnormal cervical samples, as diagnosed by routine histopathologic techniques.
Results
Average epithelial intensities were significantly stronger in the abnormal tissue than in the normal tissue of premenopausal women (P< .0024), but were stronger in the normal tissue of postmenopausal women (P< .062). No significant differences in signal decay rate were detected.
Conclusion
OCT images, which contain information about epithelial and stromal structure, can be clinically obtained. Image features of normal and abnormal cervical epithelium differ significantly.

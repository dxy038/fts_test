In this work a new approach is proposed for the optimized design of a thinned array, based on a small set of different sub-array types (with assigned properties), properly disposed on a planar surface. The small number of different sub-array shapes is relevant for industrial production, to reduce design and manufacturing costs, as well as to allow scalable antenna designs for different applications. The optimization of the design is based on the maximization of an objective function, involving the side lobe level and/or the main lobe width. The possibility to split the obtained thinned array antenna in a set of sub-apertures is investigated, corresponding to an integer number of sub-arrays connected to independent receiving channels. This is required to apply adaptive processing techniques to cancel external e.m. interferences and/or clutter echoes. The performance obtained by using the adaptive techniques with sub-apertures taken from the optimized thinned array are evaluated with reference to assigned clutter and jamming scenarios, and compared to the sub-array based filled array.

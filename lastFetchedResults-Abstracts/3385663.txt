Flow control in store-and-forward computer networks is appropriate for decentralized execution. A formal description of a class of "decentralized flow control algorithms" is given. The feasibility of maximizing power with such algorithms is investigated. On the assumption that communication links behave like <img alt="M/M/1" src="/images/tex/29.gif"/> servers it is shown that no "decentralized flow control algorithm" can maximize network power. Power has been suggested in the literature as a network performance objective. It is also shown that no objective based only on the users\Â´ throughputs and average delay is decentralizable. Finally, a restricted class of algorithms cannot even approximate power.

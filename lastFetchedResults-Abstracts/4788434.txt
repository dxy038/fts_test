WMS (Web Map Service) is the standard that is formulated by OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium), and TMS (Tile Map Service) is the specification that is formulated by OSGeo (Open Source Geospatial Foundation), the objective of both are to realize the sharing and interoperability of geographical information, using those standards, we can build the network that is composed of distributed map servers, the client can use them to request layers from the server, so we can release remote sensing image data into WMS or TMS in order to realize the sharing of remote sensing information. Through the comparative analysis, the speed of TMS requests and generates layers is greatly faster than WMS, which has an important meaning for improving the response speed of the traditional WebGIS server and ameliorating usersÂ´ experience, therefore, this paper mainly studies the segmentation and release of remote sensing images that are based on Tile Map Service (TMS).

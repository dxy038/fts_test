The dynamics of an aircraft are a perfect example of a multi-input multi-output system; it is known from control theory that the state feedback gain achieving a set of desired closed loop poles is not unique in this case. The objective of this paper is to synthesize the most suitable gain for a given set of desired closed loop poles meeting the best possible closed loop system time response characteristics (small transient, small steady state error, Percentage Over Shoot...), A small system feedback gain to minimize the control energy, and prevent saturation of the controller elements and noise amplification. A simulation study is conducted in order to test the controller for different perturbation models.

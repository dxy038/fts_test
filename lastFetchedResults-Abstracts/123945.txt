OBJECTIVE: One of the major causes of nosocomial infections is staphylococcus aureus. Resistance of this organism to antibiotics has made many problems in its treatment and eradication. So. it is evident that determination and report of its resistance to antibiotics in different regions is necessary. METHODS: 125 positive cultures of staphylococcus aureus obtained from patients and carriers in hospitals and medical laboratories in Babol over a period of one year. Of these , 84 cases (71Â°A) were patients with various skin infections, UTI and surgical wounds. 36 cases (29%) were hospital personnel with samples taken from their nasal mucosa. After isolation of bacteria, antibiotic sensitivity tests to oxacillin were performed with disk diffusion and oxacillin screen plate methods. Sensitivity tests to vancomycin, penicillin and trimethoprim were performed on resistant bacteria.
FINDINGS: 90 samples staph. aureus species (72%) were found to be resistant to oxacillin. All of them were resistant to penicillin as well. 65% of these showed resistance to trimethoprim. But all oxacillin resistant species were sensitive to vancomycin.
CONCLUSION: Prior to treatment of staph. aureus infections, antibiogram tests must be performed as the results show that antibiotic resistance of isolated bacteria is noticeable. This avoids unnecessary expenses and unsuccessful therapy. A continuous microbiologic investigation is recommended to find efficient ways for eradication or at least lowering the incidence of staph. aureus infections.

Background and Objective: Preeclampsia is potentially life-threatening and as a dangerous complication of pregnancy. This study was performed to assess the relationship between serum zinc level and preeclampsia.  

Materials and Methods: This analytical and prospective study was conducted on 1033 pregnant women who referred to prenatal clinics of Tehran city. Demographic questionnaire and reproductive history was completed and also a venous blood sample was taken from all the pregnant women upon entry. Preeclampsia was defined as blood pressure equal or more than 140/90 mmHg along with proteinuria after 20th week of pregnancy. Data was analyzed using SPSS16 software and independent samples t-test.

Results: The incidence of preeclampsia was 1.9 %. Mean serum zinc level was 116.6±95.7 µg/dl. In 27.4% of samples, the zinc serum level was lower than 51µg/dl and the zinc serum level of 72.6% of samples was at normal range. The independent samples t-test showed that there was a significant relationship between maternal serum zinc level and preeclampsia as the mean serum zinc level in pregnant women with preeclampsia was lower than normal pregnant women.

Conclusion: The results showed that serum zinc level is associated with preeclampsia.

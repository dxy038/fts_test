Objective: To determine factors of outcome following surgical intervention for neurologic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS).

Methods: In a retrospective study of patients surgically treated for NTOS, outcome was evaluated by postoperative symptoms and the ability of patients to return to work.

Results: Good, fair, and poor results were obtained in 26 (48%), 21 (39%), and 7 (13%) patients, respectively. The best predictor of a good outcome was occupation. Nonlaborers were more likely to have good outcome (21 of 32, 66%) when compared with laborers (5 of 22, 23%; P = 0.0025). Only 6 of 20 (30%) laborers were able to return to their original occupation compared with 17 of 26 (65%) nonlaborers (P = 0.036).

Conclusions: Laborers with NTOS are less likely to have a good result from surgical intervention, are unlikely to return to their original occupation, and may require retraining for a non-labor-intensive occupation if they cannot return to their original work.

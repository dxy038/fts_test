The objective of the work presented is to determine an accurate position and orientation for mobile robots based on information received from multiple sensors. The approach taken in this paper is to integrate the information from odometry with the inertial system using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The UKF is the newest extension of widely used estimation method, Kalman Filter. The UKF is more accurate and simpler than the extended Kalman filter applied to nonlinear systems.

What consumers know or think they know about product price levels is an
important research area from both a societal as well as a marketing
perspective. This study investigates objective and subjective price
knowledge and the effects of price consciousness, price search behavior,
purchase frequency, time availability, and perceived price dispersion on the
two knowledge dimensions as well as the relationship between objective
and subjective price knowledge. This paper uses a sample of 270
consumers of Shahrvand supermarkets in Tehran; data were collected
from a questionnaire, and structural equation modeling was used for data
analysis. Price search behavior and purchase frequency had positive effects
on both subjective and objective price knowledge, but time availability had
no significant effect on objective or subjective price knowledge mediated
by effects on price search. Furthermore, perceived price dispersion had a
negative effect on objective price knowledge. Price consciousness had a
positive effect on both subjective and objective price knowledge mediated
by effects on price search and purchase frequency, but price consciousness
had no significant direct effect on subjective price knowledge. Finally,
objective price knowledge had a positive direct effect on subjective price
knowledge.

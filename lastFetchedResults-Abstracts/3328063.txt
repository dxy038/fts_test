We consider the problem of multivariable anti-windup bumpless transfer (AWBT) controller synthesis based on the general AWBT framework presented in [18]. Several recent AWBT synthesis techniques are reviewed. Next, we give a completely general formulation of the AWBT controller synthesis problem and show how this problem can be solved in terms of an iterative linear matrix inequality (LMI) scheme. For two simple examples, we demonstrate that an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> objective function is a sufficient performance indicator. Moreover, the objective minimum leads to multiple solutions for the static output feedback parameters; all of which provide equivalent output responses and graceful performance degradation under saturation. We also demonstrate the superior performance of the two parameter framework over an otherwise equivalent one parameter framework.

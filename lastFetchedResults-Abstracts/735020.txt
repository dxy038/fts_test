ABSTRACT: Hydraulic control of network has special complexities in the pressurized irrigation plans especially in large projects with large area and non-uniform and irregular topography. This cannot be achieved simply through the manual computing and it needs the time-consuming processes although the control of calculation accuracy in this method needs to be discussed. In the pressurized irrigation network plan on the lands of Era village in Mazandaran province of Iran, the need to use a tool, which can be useful in further controlling of design accuracy, has been undeniable considering the extent approximately 50 Ha of lands and non-uniform topography of dales with a height difference about 50 meters in the project lands.  Thus it has been tried to apply the available software such as WatNet and WaterGems in designing the water networks in this project. Software model, WaterGems, which has been prepared and provided for hydraulic design of water networks, can have an effective application in hydraulic design of pressurized irrigation network. In this software model, the network can be introduced to the model and the hydraulic simulation can be implemented or be utilized in qualitative modeling by introducing the map of project location as the background and by designing the configuration of network design and introducing the way of supplying the discharge and pressure, valves, facilities needed for the network such as central control, pressure relief valve and.... Due to the high ability of software WaterGems in displaying the results obtained from the simulation and according to the irregular topography of target region, which has made the requirement for using this computerized model in designing the network undeniable, this computerized model has been used as one of the best hydraulic simulators of water networks in hydraulic design of pressurized irrigation network, and thus the hydraulic analysis of target network with specific topography has been simulated in a way that the design criteria in this network are met. The main and ultimate objective of applying this model on the lands of this particular project is to select the appropriate pipe diameter and required pressure for beginning of lines with regard to the non-uniform topography of Land.

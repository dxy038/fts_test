To achieve the broad objective, the study
identified the socio-economic characteristics of the
respondents that were involved in mechanized and non
mechanized farming, determined the level of awareness with
the extent of use of adopted mechanized farming and the
production level of mechanized and non–mechanized
farmers. Data were collected from 120 registered
respondents; the collected data were subsequently analyzed
using frequency count, percentages and mean values as
descriptive tools, while inferential statistical tool used was
Pearson Product Moment Correlation and Anova which were
used to determine the relationship and difference between the
variables respectively. The results of the findings revealed
that the mean age of the sampled mechanized farmers was
47.57. The result of the findings also revealed that majority of
the mechanized and non – mechanized farmers were male. A
significant relationship was found between monthly income,
cultivated farm size and level of production of the
mechanized farmers. Also a significant difference was found
between cassava productions of mechanized and non –
mechanized farmers. High cost of repair was recorded as the
most serious constraint; therefore, the study recommended
that government should help in subsidizing the cost of repair
for the mechanized farmers so as to further boost cassava
production.

A circuit configuration, a circuit topological family, a buck-mode active clamped circuit, and an instantaneous output voltage feedback control strategy of combined bidirectional buck-boost dc-dc chopper-mode inverter with high-frequency (HF) link (HFL) were proposed and fully investigated in this paper. The steady principle characteristic and the design criteria for the key circuit parameters were given in this paper. The circuit configuration is composed of two identical isolated bidirectional buck-boost dc-dc choppers with the same input and output filters. These two choppers in parallel at input end and in series at output end generate unipolarity sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation current waveforms with positive and negative half low-frequency cycles separately. The circuit topological family includes four circuit topologies, such as one-transistor mode. Taking the one-transistor mode circuit topology as an example, the 750VA48VDC/220V50HzAC prototype is designed and implemented. The theoretical analysis and principle test show the inverters have excellent performance.

Objective(s): Naringin has been reported to regulate bone metabolism. However, its effect on osteogenesis remains unclear. The aim was to investigate the effect of naringin on osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) through the activation of the ERK signaling pathway in osteogenic differentiation. Materials and Methods: Annexin V-FITC assay and MTT assay were used to measure the effect of naringin on cytotoxicity and proliferation of hBMSCs, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase activity analysis, Alizarin Red S staining, Western blotting, and real-time PCR assay were used to evaluate both the potential effect of naringin on osteogenic differentiation and the role of ERK signaling pathway in osteogenic differentiation. Results: Our results showed that naringin had no obvious toxicity on hBMSCs, and could significantly promote the proliferation of hBMSCs. Naringin also enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs and increased the protein and mRNA expression levels of osteogenic markers such as Runx-2, OXS, OCN, and Col1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we found that the enhancing effect of naringin on osteogenic differentiation was related to the activation of phosphor-ERK, with an increase in duration of activity from 30 min to 120 min. More importantly, both the enhancing effect of naringin on osteogenic differentiation and the activity effect of naringin on ERK signaling pathway were reversed by U0126 addition. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that naringin promoted proliferation and osteogenesis of hBMSCs by activating the ERK signaling pathway and it might be a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing osteoporosis.

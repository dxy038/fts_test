
Introduction: The main objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of preceding
pictorial stimulus on the emotional autonomic responses of the subsequent one. Methods: To this effect, physiological signals, including Electrocardiogram (ECG), Pulse
Rate (PR), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) were collected. As these signals have random
and chaotic nature, nonlinear dynamics of these physiological signals were evaluated with the
methods of nonlinear system theory. Considering the hypothesis that emotional responses are
usually associated with previous experiences of a subject, the subjective ratings of 4 emotional
states were also evaluated. Four nonlinear characteristics (including Detrended Fluctuation
Analysis (DFA), based parameters, Lyapunov exponent, and approximate entropy) were
implemented. Nine standard features (including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum,
median, mode, the second, third, and fourth moment) were also extracted. Results: To evaluate the ability of features in discriminating different types of emotions, some
classification approaches were appraised, of them, Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) led to
the best classification rate of 100%. The results show that considering the emotional sequences,
GSR is the best candidate for the representation of the physiological changes. Discussion: Lower discrimination was attained when the sequence occurred in the diagonal line
of valence-arousal coordinates (for instance, positive valence and positive arousal versus negative
valence and negative arousal). By employing self-assessment ranks, no obvious improvement
was achieved.

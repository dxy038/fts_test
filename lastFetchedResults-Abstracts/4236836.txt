A new method to improve the input/output (I/O) pad positioning assignment for a placement algorithm based on a resistive network optimization model is proposed. In the sea-of-gates placement program, the preplaced I/O pads are used as boundary conditions in solving sparse linear equations to obtain the module placement. The objective of the pad assignment is to assign I/O pad positions, based on connectivity information, so that the resulting optimized module arrangement will minimize the cost function defined in this case as the total wire length. The pad assignment program is used as a processor for the sea-of-gates placement package PROUD. The results have revealed excellent improvement

In this paper we first build an accurate and general transmission distortion model for H.264/AVC video streams to estimate the importance of each packet. Then, a utility-based optimized cross-layer resource allocation, MCS selection, and packet scheduling algorithm for real-time video transmission over HSDPA is studied. The utility here refers to the packet utility which is defined as a function of the packet urgency and the packet importance . Transmitting the packets with greater utility values firstly in each TTI can provide a higher level of video quality for the users. Thus, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the aggregate packet utility over all the users under the HSDPA physical resource constraints . In order to obtain an optimal transmission strategy, a dynamic programming -based cross-layer algorithm (DPCLA) is proposed. In view of its high complexity, we further develop a greedy-based cross-layer algorithm (GCLA) to find a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed utility-based optimized cross-layer scheme, including the proposed transmission distortion model and the algorithms of DPCLA and GCLA, can provide higher received video quality than the existing ones for video transmission over HSDPA.

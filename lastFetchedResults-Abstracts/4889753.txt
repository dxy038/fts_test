With the advent of semantic Web services, a paradigm that results from adding semantics to Web services, the challenge remains in finding a suitable way of capturing the goals and objectives of the user and attaining a technological solution to fulfill them. In this paper, we aim at solving this problem combining case based reasoning (CBR) and semantics for Web services in the Web independent and generic services architecture (WINGS). The objective of WINGS is to improve the composition of semantic web services by taking into account the goal of the user. We use for this purpose CBR assuming that similar cases may exist and be reused after selection and adaptation. One of the main focus of our approach resides in the semantic matchmaking piloted by ontologies. As a proof-of-concept WINGS has been built above JCOLIBRI, a well-known framework to design CBR applications, and CBROnto, an ontology with knowledge about CBR.

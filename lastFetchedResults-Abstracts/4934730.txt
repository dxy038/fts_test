In this paper, a slot antenna fed by microstrip line with dual V-shaped operates in WLAN/WiMAX applications. This work design and perform characteristics of array structure. The prototype is new layout to allow configuration of the radiation pattern, forming Uni-and Bi-directional patterns. The antenna is designed for working at 2.45 GHz and including 2.40 GHz to 2.48 GHz and bidirectional radiation pattern and unidirectional radiation pattern. The Simulation and design optimization are done by a Commercial software (IE3D) using Moment Method(MoM). Simulation of the results are given and compared with those antennas operation as same band.

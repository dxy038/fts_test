Summary form only given, as follows. Mobile computing has emerged as an important area of computing today as we move to the next millennium. This has been made possible due to the tremendous and continued growth of wireless communications and network technology over the past decade, providing infrastructures for "anytime anywhere" access to distributed computing systems and information repositories. The mobility of users offers new challenges to seamless connectivity in a distributed, heterogeneous network of wireline and wireless components. Several techniques and algorithms developed by the parallel and distributed computing community can be applied to solve typical wireless networks and mobile computing: routing, scheduling, load balancing, cache coherence, information access, and QoS provisioning problems. The objective of this workshop is to bring together technologists and researchers of international reputation in the areas of Parallel and Distributed Computing and Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing in order to have a forum for discussions, exchange of ideas and presentations. It is indeed a very appropriate to have this workshop as part of the IPDPS activities. We received twenty eight papers for the workshop. Each paper was sent to three program committee members for reviewing and after the review process we selected fourteen papers for presentation at the workshop. Due to the high quality of papers received, we had to reject some good papers. We take this opportunity to thank authors of all submitted papers and the referees for their efforts in making this workshop a success. Special thanks to all the steering committee members, the general chair, the publicity chairs and the technical program committee members for their support and assistance. We look forward to having a very fruitful and enjoyable workshop.

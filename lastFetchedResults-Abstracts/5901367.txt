This paper compares the computational time and closed loop system performances for linear and nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the full bridge DC/DC converter under starting, overload and load step change conditions. The control objective is to regulate the output voltage without violating the peak current constraint. The experimental results reveal that both linear and nonlinear MPC algorithms can successfully achieve voltage regulation and peak current protection. Considering the algorithm complexity, the closed loop performance and the necessary computational time, the nonlinear MPC scheme is more desirable than the linear MPC for this application.

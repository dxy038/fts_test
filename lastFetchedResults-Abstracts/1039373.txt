Large eddy simulation of thermally stratified turbulent open channel flows with low- to high-Prandtl number is performed. The three-dimensional filtered Navier–Stokes and energy equations under the Boussinesq approximation are numerically solved using a fractional-step method. Dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) models for the turbulent SGS stress and heat flux are employed to close the governing equations. The objective of this study is to reveal the effects of both the Prandtl number (Pr) and Richardson (Riτ) number on the characteristics of turbulent flow, heat transfer, and large-scale motions in weakly stratified turbulence. The stably stratified turbulent open channel flows are calculated for Pr from 0.1 up to 100, Riτ from 0 to 20, and the Reynolds number (Reτ) 180 based on the wall friction velocity and the channel height. To elucidate the turbulent flow and heat transfer behaviors, some typical quantities, including the mean velocity, temperature and their fluctuations, turbulent heat fluxes, and the structures of the velocity and temperature fluctuations, are analyzed.

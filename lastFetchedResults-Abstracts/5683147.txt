The paper introduces lightweight video encryption algorithms for transmission over wireless networks. The objective of these encryption algorithms is to reduce the total amount of data encrypted (while providing reasonable privacy and security) and to use multiple FEC codes to reduce the expected number of bit errors left in the data after decoding. The goal of this work is to provide encryption of video data while increasing the decodeability of the stream in the presence of network bit error. The first algorithm uses multi-layer video coding (which also helps to increase PSNR) for security and encrypts only a base layer. The second algorithm extends video encryption algorithms to deduce the amount of data encrypted and uses different BCH codes for each level

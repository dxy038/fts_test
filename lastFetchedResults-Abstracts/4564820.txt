The equations governing the multiport multiband antennas are analyzed in this paper with the objective of drawing the design guidelines for low coupling small antennas. Those guidelines have been applied in the design and optimization of a dual band two-port small antenna of size around lambda<sub>0</sub>/13 times lambda<sub>0</sub>/13. The antenna geometry is shown together with coupling minimization results.

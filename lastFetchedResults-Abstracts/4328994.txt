This paper presents powertrain comparison for fuel cell hybrid non-road mobile machinery. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of different fuel cell hybrid powertrain topologies. This study concentrates on hybrid powertrain topologies which are generated from the fuel cell source output to loading inverters inputs. The compared features of different powertrains are efficiency, weight, size, cost and lifetime costs, as well as, benefits and disadvantages. The study considers fuel cell hybrid topologies with different active and passive connections of a battery pack, an ultracapacitor pack or the both. The comparison of different powertrain topologies requires a validated simulation tool, specific power control algorithms for each topology, knowledge of the target application and several iteration rounds for simulations.

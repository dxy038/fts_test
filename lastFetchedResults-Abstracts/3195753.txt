In this paper, a new cooperative control framework using L<sub>1</sub> adaptive control is presented for a two-agent dynamic system with uncertainties. In this framework, each agent uses the L<sub>1</sub> adaptive control law to handle both local uncertainties and interconnected uncertainties from the effects of the other agentÂ´s control signals and dynamics. The global objective is achieved when each agent achieves its local objective. The stability condition for the closed-loop global dynamic system is derived. Simulation results illustrate the presented cooperative control framework.

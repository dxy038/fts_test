The objective of this paper is to describe how open network communication can be the basis for a modular control architecture. Benefits highlighted include: increased efficiency for system design, installation, operation and maintenance; superior decision making processes through &#8220;transparent&#8221; data access; lower system life cycle cost; greater flexibility to add to the functions and scale of a control system so as the needs of an enterprise mature, the control system will adapt to the new requirements rather than serve as a barrier

Wireless Sensor Networks (WNs) as emerged as promising paradigm to monitor the physical world and it allows the network deployment at a very low cost. In WSNs energy consumption of a node is a critical aspect as it is a limited resource. Since the nodes are tiny devices with limited storage, computational capability a power, it is necessary that all protocols at all layers in WSNs must be energy efficient. The focus, however, has been given to the routing protocols which might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this paper, we present a survey of the state-of-the-art Hybrid Routing Algorithms (HRA) for WSN. Here, we present classification of different HRA for the various approaches chased. This paper also proposes a novel energy efficient Multi Objective HRA (MOHRA). MOHRA uses a two-level hierarchical clustering and the data packets are forwarded using best route which uses weighted sum of different metrics to achieve both energy efficiency and energy balance throughout the network. MOHRA takes into account Total Energy consumption, Control Overhead, Reaction Time, LQI, and HOP Count for selecting the best path from source to sink.

Using pressurized irrigation is one of the most effective practices for conservation of water resources. Emitters clogging are the most important problems in operating drip irrigation system which reduces the emission uniformity and irrigation efficiency. Evaluating the anti-clogging performance of emitters and clogging thresholds, are the first and most important step in optimal design of irrigation water filtration system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical anti-clogging performance of three types of pressure compensation emitters including Micro flapper, Corona and Eden in laboratorial scale. For this purpose, a physical model of drip irrigation system with water and sand mixing tank was established and the discharge rate of emitters by various concentration and particle sizes was measured at eight phases. The average discharge, clogging rate and uniformity coefficient indices were calculated for the three types of emitters in different phases. The result showed that Corona and Eden emitters with 12 and 37 percent of clogging rates have the best and worst performances, respectively. The results also indicated that the uniformity coefficient of corona emitters is larger than 95% in all phases during the experiment. Based on the results of the study, Corona emitter stand as the best physical anti-clogging performance and it can be recommended to be use in farms and gardens.

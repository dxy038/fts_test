Objective
Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that may have a therapeutic role in cervical cancer.
Study design
We investigated the cellular and molecular effects of 30 Î¼mol/L Coenzyme Q10 in HeLa cells. Cell growth assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses, and Oil Red O staining were performed. Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate and analyzed on the basis of 2-fold changes in levels of gene expression.
Results
Coenzyme Q10 inhibited cell growth and led to apoptosis. Microarray analysis showed that 264 sequences were altered over time, with enrichment in lipid-related genes. Enhanced lipid accumulation was confirmed with Oil Red O staining.
Conclusion
A lipid response to Coenzyme Q10 may affect mechanisms of growth inhibition in HeLa cells.

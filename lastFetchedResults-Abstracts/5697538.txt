Due to the renewed interest in distributed generation (DG), the number of DG units incorporated in distribution systems has been rapidly increasing in the past few years. This situation requires new analysis tools for understanding system performance, and taking advantage of the potential benefits of DG. This paper presents an evolutionary multi-objective programming approach to determine the optimal operation of DG in distribution systems. The objectives are the minimization of the system power losses and operation cost of the DG units. The proposed approach also considers the inherent stochasticity of DG technologies powered by renewable resources. Some tests were carried out on the IEEE 34 bus distribution test system showing the robustness and applicability of the proposed methodology.

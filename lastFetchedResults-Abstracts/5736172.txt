This paper describes the use of a formal optimisation procedure to optimise a plug-in hybrid electric bus using two different case studies to meet two different performance criteria; minimum journey cost and maximum battery life. The approach is to choose a commercially available vehicle and seek to improve its performance by varying key design parameters. Central to this approach is the ability to develop a representative backward facing model of the vehicle in MATLAB/Simulink along with appropriate optimisation objective and penalty functions. The penalty functions being the margin by which a particular design fails to meet the performance specification. The model is validated against data collected from an actual vehicle and is used to estimate the vehicle performance parameters in a model-in-the-loop process within an optimisation routine. For the purposes of this paper, the journey cost/battery life over a drive cycle is optimised whilst other performance indices are met (or exceeded). Among the available optimisation methods, PowellÂ´s method and Simulated Annealing are adopted. The results show this method as a valid alternative modelling approach to vehicle powertrain optimisation.

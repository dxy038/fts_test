Vegetation cover on a variety of different land uses in different parts of a city creates different forms of heat flow that this, in turn, generates the main framework of urban microclimate. The objective of this study is to survey the effect of land cover type on air temperature in the Isfahan city. To do this, five regions in the Isfahan city with different land cover type were selected. In each region automatic weather stations were installed in order to measure air temperature. The measurements were logged over a year every 5 min; then an hourly average of temperature data was calculated for all analysis. The results showed a significant difference between air temperatures in different parts of the city covered by different land cover type. The highest maximum air temperature difference was 3.51° C between Station 2 and reference station in November. The highest minimum air temperature difference was 8.15° C between Station 1 and reference station in July. The results also showed that in all seasons especially in spring and summer, there is a significant difference (P < 0.01) between air temperature in the city and air temperature in the reference station. Air temperature in the city was strongly influenced by the land cover type and extent of vegetation cover. Therefore, the measurement of air temperature in the city is necessary for irrigation management

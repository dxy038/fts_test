Studies show that those living with nonbiological ‎and single parent families run a double risk of ‎delinquency; However, This is reduced nearly by ‎half with those who enjoy good skills in solving ‎problems. The present research is set out to ‎establish whether there is a significant ‎discrepancy between the problem solving skills ‎enjoyed by girls living in biological families with ‎those living in institution as the result of family ‎troubles. The other objective was to study the ‎efficacy of group training on improving problem ‎solving skills. To this end, Cassidy and Long ‎problem solving Questionnaire (CLQ) was used ‎to compare the normal girls’ problem solving ‎skills (15 person) with that of badly supervised ‎and unsupervised ones (15 person). The results ‎showed a big difference in helplessness, ‎creativity, approach and avoidance styles. Badly ‎supervised and unsupervised girls were then put ‎into two groups, one experimental and one ‎control. In the problem solving styles of ‎helplessness, creativity, approach and avoidance, ‎the experimental group demonstrated significant ‎difference with those of the control group. Results ‎indicated the efficacy of problem solving training ‎in improving these skills among the girls studied.‎

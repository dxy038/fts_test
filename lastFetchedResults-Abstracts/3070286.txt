Interworking between wireless LANs and 3G networks is expected to the best models for vehicle communications. This paper presents an embedded video camera for vehicle over WLAN and CDMA1X. The main objective is to evaluate the conditions and restrictions under which seamless continuity of video sessions across the two networks is feasible. First, it constructs high speed automobile communication environment by wireless access router which can automatically switched between CDMA1X and the WLAN. In order to fit the bandwidths sharply variety of wireless channel, adaptive video compression algorithms based MPEG4 is utilized to encode the high quality video. Moreover, unique transmission mechanism using media server and media gateway is presented, which can support large scale concurrent users up to 1000. This transmission mechanism uses the buffer on media server to smooth the video transport in wireless channel. The live surveillance video of mobile can be viewed over Internet and does not need fix IP address. Furthermore, control center can be set up anywhere with Internet access without being restricted by monitored site locations. Therefore the networked vehicle can achieve seamless roaming and secured network connectivity anytime and anywhere.

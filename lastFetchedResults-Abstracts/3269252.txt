A methodology to increase the probability of delivering power to any load point through the identification of new investments in distribution network components is proposed in this paper. The method minimizes the investment cost as well as the cost of energy not supplied in the network. A DC optimization model based on mixed integer non-linear programming is developed considering the Pareto front technique in order to identify the adequate investments in distribution networks components which allow increasing the probability of delivering power for any customer in the distribution system at the minimum possible cost for the system operator, while minimizing the energy not supplied cost. Thus, a multi-objective problem is formulated. To illustrate the application of the proposed methodology, the paper includes a case study which considers a 180 bus distribution network.

In this paper a typical structure of a permanent magnet flux-switching machine (PMFSM) with 12 stator poles and 10 rotor poles is considered. The PMFSM design procedure is based on a specific analytical algorithm, which is validated by the results obtained via a two dimensions finite element method (2D-FEM). Also an optimal design procedure, based on Hooke-Jeeves method, applied to a permanent magnet flux-switching machine is implemented. Different objective functions, as maximum torque density and maximum efficiency were considered.

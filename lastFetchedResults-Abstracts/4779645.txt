According to the characteristics of multi-source and multi-variety material supply under special cases such as wartime, this paper sets up a multi-objective programming based on time, cost and safety objectives, gives an algorithm combining tolerance layer evaluation method with fuzzy programming for this model, and finally illustrates the algorithmÂ´s effectiveness for this model by an example.

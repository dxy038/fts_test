There are different reasons which may result in a need for finger joint arthroplasty, the main reason is thought to be rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Geometric models of the Swanson and the Neuflex implants which are two of the most commonly used implants were constructed, and meshed after a convergence test and refinements were made in critical regions. The main objective of this study is to use finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate conditions (using Abaqus/CAE) in which the implants are imposed to; these conditions are mainly flexion and extension of the implants [1] Finite element studies are done on issues of stress/strain concentration and also effects of a crack on the implant are analysed. The two chosen designs will be evaluated and compared analytically; the results of this study will be compared to that of literature and in-vitro /in-vivo results (where possible). The effect of the difference in the geometry of the two implants is also considered. In order to achieve these goals three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) models were constructed in FEA software. It was found that such implants tend to fail at their hinge-stem interface, with the main reason being their material rather than their design.

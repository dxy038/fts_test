Aesthetics objectivity or subjectivity has always been a noteworthy philosophical problem for aesthetic philosophers during the history of thought. History of such a discussion could be pursued from Plato’s dialogues with aesthetics objectivity to Kant’s third critique which perches on top of aesthetics subjectivity. The question about aesthetics objectivity or subjectivity would be like this: if the aesthetics qualities have objective truth so is it true to attribute them to things or they are just subjective attributes being different among people? 
Theorizing about this is one of the most challenging discussion in philosophical aesthetics. Instead of endless disussions about aesthetics subjectivity or objectivity, Frank Sibley as an effective aesthetic philosopher in twentieth century tried to propell it to colors’ objectivity and to prove, on this basis, the objectivity of aesthetic qualities. 
In this paper while clarifying Sibley’s point of view, I will try to criticize his theory and to see if he was successful in gaining victory against sophists and subjectivists or not. Finally, it will be concluded that although Sibley has failed in proving the objectivity of aesthetic concepts, he has opened a way that can help people for importing philosophy in their life and that’s what really important.

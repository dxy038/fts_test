The paper presents a critical review of the watershed transformation and the associated algorithm based on topological notions. The watershed transform is a method for image segmentation in the field of mathematical morphology. The objective of this work is to show that the results to be obtained using this transformation depend of the raster-scan order. The appropriate examples are given.

Silica aerogel granulate is a nanostructured material with high solar transmittance and low thermal conductivity.
These properties offer exciting applications in building envelopes. One objective of the joint R&D project ISOTEG
at ZAE Bayern was to develop and characterize a new glazing element based on granular silica aerogel. Heat transfer
coefficients of less than 0.4 W/(m2 K) and a total solar energy transmittance of 35% for the whole glazing unit were
achieved. The glazing has a thickness of less than 50 mm. Another application for granular silica aerogel is, for example,
in solar collectors.
The thermal properties of the glazing as well as the optical and thermal properties of the granular aerogels are presented
here. The solar transmittance of a 10 mm packed bed of silica aerogel was 53% for semi-translucent spheres and
88% for highly translucent granulate. In our heat transfer experiments the gas pressure, external pressure load, temperature
and gas filling were varied. The various thermal conductivity values measured for the glazing and collector applications
were compared to the values calculated using two different packed bed models. For the gas-dependent
measurements the intergranular voids in the granulate were 1.0 ± 0.1 mm before loading the packed bed,
0.3 ± 0.1 mm at an external load of 3.2 bar (3.2 · 105 Pa) and 0.6 ± 0.1 mm after release.
A direct radiative conduction of kdirect = 4.5 ± 0.5 · 10 3Wm 1 K 1 was obtained.

OBJECTIVE: This research was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients who were unaware of their eye condition. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in a 12-month period on patients who were referred to Meybod Imam Sadegh Diabetes Center. 152 patients who had no eye complaint were selected. Pupil dilation was created by Cyclopentolate and fondus examination was performed by indirect ophthalmoscope. In some cases for maculae examination, if needed, trimirror lens was used. Examination results and risk factors were recorded and statistically analyzed by SPSS.
RESULTS: Of the 152 visited patients, 38 were male and the rest were female. Mean age was 53.2 years and mean diabetic period was 6.2 years. Without gender consideration 11% suffered from one type of DR. 
The results of this study showed that age, duration of disease, hypertension, blood sugar level and hyper lipidemia were effective risk factors for DR, but sex was not significantly related to DR.
CONCLUSION: Diabetic retinopathy is a well-recognized complication of diabetes mellitus. Screening programs for detecting diabetic retinopathy and early identification of disease could significantly decrease the complications of DR. By a good planning, such as  periodic eye examinations and adequate treatment, blindness due to diabetic retinopathy can be reduced.

This paper presented a bandwidth gain analysis on HTTP and HTTPs traffic in an IP Based network. A framework model to run the analysis has been setup which caters about 40 thousand concurrent users to the internet that included wired and wireless access users in a university. All traffic flow to one access Virtual Local area Network (VLAN) is configured. Five bandwidth collectors (BC) are setup in the running framework. Network traffic then is filtered according to the identified policies that are based on type of applications, protocols and rules. Two main policies rules are configured called the static object and customized object rules. Three main filtered content are also configured which are Integrated uniform resource locator (URL) and content filtering, instant message and point to point applications and the third filtered objects is web category. The objective of the traffic analysis is to observe the bandwidth gain in the network and manage the bandwidth used according to the prioritized applications needed. One hour and one day of internet traffic are collected to analyze the bandwidth used. Bandwidth gain then is presented for the five setup bandwidth collector. Results shows that the model framework helps to reduced the bandwidth utilization mainly on http and https traffic. An analysis on bandwidth gain and byte saved are presented in multiple times and percentage.

In the cooperative system with a large number of users, the base station may select a subset of users to serve in order to maximize the total throughput. The brute-force search for the optimal user set, however, is computationally prohibitive. We propose a clustering algorithm for cooperative communication systems, whose objective is to increase the cellular network throughput and further improve the system performance. In this cellular system, we consider all the available users are divided into two groups. One is the super group which locates in the cell central region, and another is the regular group which locates in the cell boundary. The super group is served by Base Station (BS), and the Mobile Stations (MSs) locate in the cell boundary are served by the clusterhead (CH) which is elected from the regular group. Simulation results show that this scheme can bring higher system throughput, and it also can increase the data rate at the cell edge.

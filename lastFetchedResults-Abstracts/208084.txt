Introduction and Objective:
The main source of suffering
and debility seems to be pain
which seriously damages the
life quality of millions of
people all over the world The
purpose of this study is to
determine the analgesic
effect of TENS after femur
fracture surgery.
Materials & Methods: This
experimental study aimed at
determining the impact of
TENS on pain control after
the operation of femur
fracture among the patients
hospitalized in Dehdasht
Imam Khomaini hospital
Sixty patients hospitalized in
the orthopedic ward were
randomly selected. For data
collection, we provided a
questionnaire, the first part of
which contained
demographic Information and
the second part included a
check list of the variables
such as intensity (severity) of
pain, duration of pain,
recurrence of pain. and the
vital signs during 48 hours
after operation A numerical
scale was employed to
determine the intensity of
pain. The surgeon
Anesthesia procedure,
sedative and narcotics dunno
anesthesia were the same for
both experimental and control
groups In order to alleviate
pain, and when insufficient,
sedative drugs were
prescribed for patients Pain
intensity and vital signs in
both experimental group
(before and after TENS) and
control group (before and
after the use of narcotics)
were carefully studied.
Results: Results of the study
showed that intensity,
duration and recurrence of
pain, and the amount of
sedative drug remarkably
decreased after use of TENS
(p<O 05)
Conclusion; TENS can be
used as an effective. non
Invasive and drug free way of
reducinq femur fracture pain
after operation.

Background: Changes in the spectrum of general surgery and the delivery of surgical care have placed the requirement for a mandatory general surgery rotation in the surgical clerkship in question.
Methods: We tested the hypothesis that equal mastery of surgical clerkship objectives can be obtained in a clerkship with and without general surgery. Students chose any two surgical rotations and were assessed by written examination, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), ward evaluations, self-assessment objectives questionnaire, and satisfaction survey.
Results: Data for 54 students showed no differences in scores between groups on any parameter. No specific concerns related to the absence of general surgery were identified.
Conclusions: Effective undergraduate surgical education can be offered in many specialty settings. Removal of the requirement for general surgery in clerkship may lead to a more effective use of all educational opportunities. A careful analysis of local programs and facilities is necessary before suggesting this change to other institutions.

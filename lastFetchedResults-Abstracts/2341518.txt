Objective
Children with leukemia and their families face a long period of medical treatment
and uncertainty about the future. These families may suffer from short- and
long-term emotional problems. The aim of the present study was to assess the
effect of supportive psychotherapy on the anxiety of mothers whose children
suffer from leukemia.
Materials & Methods
The current research were performed on mothers who had a child with leukemia
hospitalized in Mofid Children’s Hospital, Tehran, Iran. They were randomly
selected. The research method was a quasi-experimental study with pretest/
posttest design. The pretest Kettles’ anxiety questionnaire was given to all the
mothers and after seven sessions of supportive psychotherapy, the posttest was
performed and the grades were compared.
Results
Ten mothers finished all seven therapeutic sessions. There was a statistically
significant difference between the pretest and posttest mean scores, confirming
the mothers’ reduced anxiety level.
Conclusion
Finding effective and newer approaches to improve the well-being of parents
with a sick child is an important challenge of today’s medical researches. Based
on our findings, it is possible to reduce the anxiety in mothers of children with
leukemia through supportive psychiatric therapies.

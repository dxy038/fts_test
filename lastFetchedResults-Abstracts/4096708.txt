We have developed an interchip data transmission scheme through passive transmission lines on a multi-chip-module (MCM) carrier and 100-&#956;m solder bump bonds. In rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) logic, digital data are in the form of single flux quantum (SFQ) pulses. A reliable scheme for transmission of SFQ pulses through non-superconducting solder bumps between chips through a passive MCM substrate is yet to be established. Therefore, we have devised a scheme that converts SFQ pulses into toggles in a voltage waveform for interchip transmission. Data in the form of SFQ pulses are reconstructed from this voltage waveform using a sensitive quantizing pulse receiver. Our objective is to eliminate the need for amplification of the transmitted signal. This is achieved by increasing the receiver sensitivity. However, a sensitive receiver, a dc SQUID, may produce more than one SFQ pulse for each rising/falling edge of the voltage waveform. A simple circuit, pulse resurrection logic (PRL), is employed to discard any extra SFQ pulses. Together with the sensitive quantizer, the PRL circuit makes our scheme error tolerant. We have demonstrated the receiver operation using 3-&#956;m Nb RSFQ circuits at frequencies up to 20 GHz

Objective: Radiation myelopathy (RM) is known as a serious complication of head and
neck radiation therapy. Furthermore, the radioprotective roles of melatonin have been
investigated on different tissues. The aim of this study was to assess the radio protective
effects of melatonin on biochemical, histopathological and clinical manifestations of RM
in the rat cervical spinal cord.
Materials and Methods: Four groups of rats were investigated as follows: The control
group was treated with vehicle. The second group (melatonin only) was intraperitoneally
injected with 100 mg/kg melatonin. The third group's (radiation) cervical spinal cord area
was irradiated with 22 Gy cobalt-60 gamma-rays. The fourth group (melatonin plus irradiation)
received 100 mg/kg melatonin intraperitoneally, and after 30 minutes their spinal
cord area was irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation. Five animals from each group were
randomly selected. 72 hours, 8 and 22 weeks after irradiation for analysis of malondialdehyde
(MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, and underwent histopathological studies.
Results: The MDA levels in the irradiation group were significantly higher than in the control
group (p<0.001). Furthermore, the GSH levels in this group were significantly lower
than that of those in the control group (p<0.001). Administration of melatonin markedly
reduced MDA (p<0.001) and increased GSH (p<0.05) levels in this group. Demyelination
and clinical signs of myelopathy were decreased in the melatonin plus irradiation group in
comparison to the irradiated group.
Conclusion: Our study confirms the radioprotective effects of melatonin at early stages
of biochemical, as well as late histological and clinical changes in the spinal cord.

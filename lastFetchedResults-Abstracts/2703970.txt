The possibility to use aeronautical metallic halls (AMHs) equipped with a mode stirrer as mode-stirred reverberation chambers (MSRCs) is investigated. The objective is to study the ability of these facilities to generate an electromagnetic environment equivalent to an MSRC in spite of the apertures linking the inner and the outer environment. In particular, the objective is to check if a sufficient number of independent positions of the mode stirrer can be obtained and if the energy storage can be sufficient within these facilities. Encouraging experimental and numerical results, respectively, obtained on a real AMH and calculated with full-wave method on prototype halls are presented and discussed.

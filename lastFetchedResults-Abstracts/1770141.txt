Objective: The aim of this study was to extract suitable spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters to
determine how Total Knee Replacement (TKR) alters patientsâ€™ knee kinematics during gait, using a rapid
and simplified quantitative two-dimensional gait analysis procedure.
Methods: Two-dimensional kinematic gait pattern of 10 participants were collected before and after the
TKR surgery, using a 60 Hz camcorder in sagittal plane. Then, the kinematic parameters were extracted
using the gait data. A student t-test was used to compare the group-average of spatiotemporal and peak
kinematic characteristics in the sagittal plane. The knee condition was also evaluated using the Oxford
Knee Score (OKS) Questionnaire to ensure that each subject was placed in the right group.
Results: The results showed a significant improvement in knee flexion during stance and swing phases
after TKR surgery. The walking speed was increased as a result of stride length and cadence
improvement, but this increment was not statistically significant. Both post-TKR and control groups
showed an increment in spatiotemporal and peak kinematic characteristics between comfortable and fast
walking speeds.
Conclusion: The objective kinematic parameters extracted from 2D gait data were able to show
significant improvements of the knee joint after TKR surgery. The patients with TKR surgery were also
able to improve their knee kinematics during fast walking speed equal to the control group. These results
provide a good insight into the capabilities of the presented method to evaluate knee functionality before
and after TKR surgery and to define a more effective rehabilitation program.

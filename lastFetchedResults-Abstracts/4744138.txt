An objective function is proposed in this paper to evaluate the minimum zone cylindricity error. The error model is optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The mathematical model may work out the minimum zone solution of cylindricity error with arbitrary position in space, and there are no special requirements in choosing measurement points. A test has been given to prove that optimal approximation solution to cylinder axisÂ´s vectors and minimum zone cylindricity can be worked out by the objective function. The approach can also be extended for solving other form and position errors when cylinder axis is used as datum.

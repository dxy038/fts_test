In essential hypertension, cardiovascular structure is believed to be influenced by hormonal and by hemodynamic factors. The objective of the present study was, in essential hypertensives, to investigate the relationship between blood pressure (BP) level as well as circulating hormones on the one hand and cardiovascular structure on the other. Seventy-nine untreated essential hypertensives were examined by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, echocardiography, microscopy of subcutaneous resistance vessels and analyzes of plasma for angiotensin II (P-Ang II), aldosterone, atrial natriuretic factor and 24-h urinary excretion of catecholamines. Multiple regression analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between P-Ang II and the end diastolic interventricular septal diameter (IVSDd) (R = 0.32, P = .005) and a weak correlation between P-Ang II and the left ventricular posterior wall diameter (R = 0.22, P = .049). These correlations were closer in the subgroup of patients (N = 54) who had never received antihypertensive treatment (R= 0.42/0.32 respectively). A weak, though statistically significant, correlation was found between the catecholamine excretion and systolic BP (R = 0.26, P = .03). A statistically negative correlation existed between catecholamines and end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter index (R = âˆ’0.36, P = .001). No significant relationship was found between hormonal levels and the tunica media structure of the resistance arteries. In conclusion, P-Ang II was in this study significantly correlated to IVSDd, but not to resistance artery structure. In essential hypertension a complex relationship exists between humoral and hemodynamic factors and cardiovascular remodeling.

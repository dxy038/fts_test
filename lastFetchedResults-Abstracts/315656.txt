The objective of the current study was to determine the correlation of spinal and femoral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and calcaneal ultrasound, measured in situ with intact soft tissues, with the in vitro failure loads of lumbar vertebral bodies. Forty-nine cadavers with intact skin and soft tissues (32 men aged 82.1 ± 9.0 years, 17 women aged 83.1 ± 10.1 years) were examined. The bone mineral content (BMC), the projectional area, and the bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur were determined with DXA, and the ultrasonic properties of the calcaneus with quantitative calcaneal ultrasound. The fourth lumbar vertebra was then excised with adjacent intervertebral disks and its mechanical failure load determined, using a materials testing machine. Absolute fracture loads were significantly higher in men than in women, but they were similar after adjusting for body weight and height. Spinal DXA was significantly associated with vertebral failure load (r = 0.62 combined; r = 0.54 men; r = 0.58 women). Femoral DXA (r = 0.46) and calcaneal ultrasound (r = 0.48) showed somewhat lower correlation coefficients, with the speed of sound (SOS) being able to add predictive information in a stepwise regression model. Normalizing the vertebral failure loads to body weight and height reduced the correlations, with only spinal DXA yielding a significant relationship. Our data suggest that previous in vitro studies may have overestimated the association between spinal DXA and vertebral failure loads, presumably because measurements were performed on excised bones, but not in situ in the presence of soft tissue inhomogeneity. The results indicate that, even in a population of old age and under in situ conditions, spinal DXA may still be somewhat better than femoral DXA and calcaneal ultrasound in predicting vertebral failure loads.

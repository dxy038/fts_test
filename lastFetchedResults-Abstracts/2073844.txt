Folic acid (FA) is a relevant factor in the prevention of a number of pathologies; thus supplementation and/or fortification strategies using FA have been widely introduced as a result. In Spain, there is a lack of reliable data to assess the impact of the increasing number of FA fortified foods. The objective of this work was to evaluate FA fortification levels in breakfast cereal products in Spain. Seventy-three breakfast cereals were analysed for total folate (TF) content. Adequacy was evaluated vs. labelled values (LV), recommended intakes (RI) and tolerable upper intake levels (ULs). Mean TF content ranged from 253 to 427 μg/100 g (76–128 μg/30 g) in different cereal matrix categories. Higher TF content was found in wheat and bran/whole-wheat cereals. As for commercial types, low-fat cereals contained the highest TF levels (445–630 μg/100 g). By consuming these, children (1–9 years old) and women of childbearing age could meet 40–160% and 20–40% of their RIs, respectively, with a standard serving size (30 g). However, children 1–6 years old are at higher risk of excessive FA intake, since low-fat cereals contain more than 50% of their ULs. Our conclusion is that overage (the addition of excess vitamin content) is a practice in FA fortified breakfast cereals. This could be a potential risk for children, but a benefit for women of reproductive age. Physiological status and age are therefore critical factors to take into account to give pertinent advice in consuming FA fortified foods.

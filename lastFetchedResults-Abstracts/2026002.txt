The paper is aimed at studying and analyzing the network performance parameters of SIP protocol. SIP is content based protocol, in which various message are required to be transacted so that a session could be created, terminated or modified. Therefore, the objective is to analyze various SIP activities and the delay incurred in session startup under various network conditions. The overall project is split into key areas like Networking, Traffic modeling, Simulation and Reporting. The objectives behind the work are as follows: Getting acquainted with the concept of IMS, SIP and their functionalities, To define a Hybrid Network Topology consisting of the IMS entities and the fixed and mobile SIP User Agents, To set the proper configuration of the nodes such that they are able to communicate with each other properly, To identify the parameters based on which the performance evaluation will be done, To find the options of specifying different types of traffic flow in the network, To vary the parameters for different scenarios and simulate them, To study the variation in the results and analyze the performance of SIP protocol in the network.

Discusses multiobjective controller synthesis for the fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno model. Various performance specifications are included. Both the state-feedback controller and the dynamic feedback controller are presented. They are in the format of a parallel distributed compensation controller which is essentially a nonlinear controller. The controller synthesis is formulated as an LMI problem. The approach in the paper can also be applied to hybrid or switching systems

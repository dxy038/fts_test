This work describes methods for the analysis of CAN message traces to identify the configuration of systems with a missing or incomplete message set specification, and also to detect the cause and find the possible remedy to timing faults or non-ideal timing behaviors. Based on the message id and time stamp recorded at a tracing node by a bus probe, the analysis reconstructs the expected message arrival time at the source node and detects the queuing and transmission policies used at the middleware- and driver-level by the supplier of each node. We show the application of our analysis method to two automotive case studies. In the first, a timing fault is analyzed and its causes are detected. In the second, the objective is to identify the message set and its configuration when this information is not available.

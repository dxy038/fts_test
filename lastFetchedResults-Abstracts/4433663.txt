Assuming SAW filter structure parameters as chromosome genes, multi-objective simultaneous optimization on SAW filter pass-band insertion loss, pass-band ripple and band rejection performance parameters et al., was conducted by using the parallel selection algorithm based on genetic algorithm and evolutionary strategy which is often used in simulting biological in natural environment and evolutionary process of genetic selection, crossover and mutation operation. Automatic generation of filter performance meets the various structural parameters of the filter parameters of indicators, and thus, the multi-objective simultaneous optimization on surface acoustic wave filter performance parameters has been realized truely. Such techniques not only improve the overall performance of the filter, and also increase the efficiency of SAW filter design.

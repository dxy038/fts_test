Fuzzy multiple attributes decision making (FMADM) dealing with fuzziness in ranking and selection of alternatives with respect to multiple attributes. The determination of weight of each attribute being one of the most important parts in FMADM, as it will dominate the evaluation process. In this paper, the integration of subjective and objective weights is put forward for determination of attributes´ weight in FMADM model under conflicting condition. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and Shannon´s entropy measure are proposed as integrated weights. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.

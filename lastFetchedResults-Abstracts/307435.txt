Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the erythrocyte CAI and CAII concentrations in nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients, and observe the relationship with acidosis, zinc, anemia, and iron supplementation.
Methods: Erythrocyte CA concentrations were measured in nondialyzed patients (n = 38) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The zinc concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
Results and conclusions: The CA levels were observed to be increased in the patients. The mean erythrocyte zinc concentration was also high and the levels of zinc in plasma were baseline values. Correlation was found between CAI and erythrocytes Zn (r = 0.46; P = 0.003), but there was no correlation with ferritin or pH and bicarbonate. The CA levels did not change after iron supplementation, but the zinc erythrocyte levels were reduced. It is concluded that the CA erythrocyte concentration in CKD patients is increased but this cannot be explained by iron deficiency or acidosis.

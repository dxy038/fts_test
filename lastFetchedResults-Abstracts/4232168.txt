The objective of these new algorithms is to specify means of using IP to leave and retrieve voice mail. The next generation wireless/wireline network is targeted to use IP as the transport for data and voice. However, the integration of PLMN/PSTN voice mail with IP network is not fully specified. Traditionally, the voice packet always has priority in the transmission in the IP network. The voice mail can and should be handled in a more efficient means so that its quality and timing will not suffer. However, the cost can be significantly reduced. This proposal uses the integrated signaling among wireline and wireless (PSTN/PLMN, TDMA, GSM, CDMA, AMPS) networks so that voice mail can be stored and later forward to the final destination with appropriate and most efficient bandwidth and vocoding resources. After the called party voicemail engine takes over, the signaling will be set up to notify the calling party network that the call is going to voice mail system. The calling party network can have local storage media to take over the recording from the caller and gives a estimated time of delivery on the current network traffic. The voice packets will, then, be sent through the IP network. It works like store and forward fax with some kind of efficiency and intelligence built in. IP multicast technology can also be integrated to support group or broadcast voice mail. As 3G is right around the corner, some features that could be supported by 3G technology are also discussed. For example, more efficient and intelligent interaction between user and handset regarding voice mail can be a reality now. The fundamental channel can be used to control the air-link resources. The JAVA enabled handset can support voice mail applications and be the middleware between user and system. This provides a means to better use the RF resources.

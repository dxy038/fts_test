Objective: The present study compares the efficacy of two most commonly used biofeedback relaxation techniques in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Method: 45 individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder were randomly assigned to three groups (n=15): Group I received electromyographic biofeedback relaxation training, Group II received alphaâ€“ electroencephalographic biofeedback relaxation training and Group III served as the control group. Results: Both treatment groups resulted in more consistent pattern of generalized relaxation changes reflected in galvanic skin resistance, state and trait anxiety as compared to the control group. Significant changes were observed in galvanic skin resistance and trait anxiety in the electromyographic group as compared to the electroencephalographic group. At follow-up, maintenance of effects of treatment was observed in both treatment groups. Conclusions: Both Biofeedback trainings are efficacious in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

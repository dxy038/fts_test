Objective

The aim of this study is to examine the impact of different feeding strategies on the child's food intake as well as the effect and influence socio-economic status and weight have on the use of feeding strategies.
Methods

219 mothers and their children between 3 and 6 years of age at risk for becoming overweight took part in this cross-sectional study. The participating mothers were recruited from inpatient-clinics and kindergartens with a lower socio-economic background. Besides demographic and weight data, which describe the child's risk for overweight, the mothers were asked for their use of feeding strategies and their child's food intake.
Results

Maternal feeding practices have an important impact (22.2â€“26.9% explained variance) on the child's food intake. There are three strategies (rewarding, child's control and pressure) which turned out to be significant predictors. Additionally, the child's weight, family income and educational level have an effect on the choice of feeding strategies and their impact on the child's food intake.
Conclusions

The results are evidence of the influence of parental feeding practices on the child's food intake. Parent training in prevention and intervention of childhood obesity should include the discussion and modification of feeding practices.

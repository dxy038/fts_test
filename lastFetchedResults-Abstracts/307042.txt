Objective: To evaluate and compare two new commercially available immunoturbidimetric and immunonephelometric assays for measuring soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in serum. To adapt the immunonephelometric assay to an automated chemistry analyzer.
Design and methods: Total imprecisions and detection limits were calculated and compared. Fifty-six samples were used for methods comparison. The nephelometric assay was adapted to the Hitachi 911 analyzer.
Results: Both methods displayed acceptable imprecisions and detection limits. Their correlation was good but a proportional bias was observed. The adaptation of the nephelometric assay to the Hitachi 911 was successful.
Conclusions: These two new immunoassays are analytically acceptable and more practicable than previously developed methods. The differences observed between both methods underscores the need for standardization. The nephelometric assay was easily adaptable to an automated chemistry analyzer.

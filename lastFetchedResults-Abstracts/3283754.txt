A complete communication terminal operating in a LTE frequency band is presented for operation in the maritime environment. The objective is to propose an antenna system with electronic or mechanical stabilization along with the LTE modem and control unit to provide at least a 10 nautical mile coverage area along the coasts for low cost, high data rate (~10 Mbps) communications in the 800 MHz &amp; 2600 MHz LTE frequency bands. The system for 2600 MHz communication using electronically selectable antennas has been developed and validated over a LTE test bench.

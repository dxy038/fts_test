The present paper deals with the optimization of composite sandwich panels subjected to low-velocity impact using advanced genetic algorithm (GA). Equivalent multi degree-of-freedom system is used to predict the contact force history and deformation response of the sandwich panels. Also, analytical solutions are used to determine the impact force and velocity at damage initiation. The GA's objective is to maximize the strength of panel by varying the ply angles of the facesheets. The results show that the stacking sequence of facesheets plays an important role in the strength of the composite sandwich panels subjected to impact loading.

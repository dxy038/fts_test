We present a preliminary study on the Rate-Distortion (RD) gain that can be achieved applying RD optimization techniques in a multiview plus depth encoder. We consider the use of Multiview Video Coding (MVC) for both, color and depth sequences, and evaluate the improvement that can be obtained allowing a quantization parameter (QP) assignment on a macroblock basis compared to the use of a fixed QP for the whole sequence. The optimization criterion is the minimization of the distortion of the synthesized views generated at the receiver. Our motivation for this criterion is to capture the impact of depth coding according to its final purpose: the generation of virtual views. Since a unique objective quality metric for view synthesis artifacts evaluation has not been set yet, the performance of several algorithms for quality evaluation of the target synthesized view have been compared. Beyond obtaining a better RD performance, as could be expected, results also show that optimized synthesized views achieve absolute lower distortion values than the best result of the approach that uses a fixed QP for the whole sequence.

Enantiomerically pure THPPs are useful pharmacological agents in relevant therapeutic areas such as tuberculosis, osteoporosis and hepatitis C. Typically resolved by preparative chiral HPLC, in this work the catalytic approach – via hydrolase-catalyzed kinetic resolution – has been demonstrated for the first time. After biocatalytic successful proof-of-concept, future opportunities for protein engineering and process set-up appear.

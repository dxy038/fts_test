Objective: Tuberculosis is an important infectious disease which can involve respiratory
system and other organs. Lymph nodes are common site for tuberculosis involvement.
Clinical Presentation and Intervention: We report a 30 year old male patient with a draining
sinus on neck and lymphadenopathies in the inguinal region. He was improved by a standard
medical therapy after being documented with a suggestive pattern for tuberculosis by lymph
node biopsy.
Conclusion: cervical Lymph adenopathy is a presentation of tuberculosis. Extra pulmonary
tuberculosis should be ruled out via Para clinic studies. Lymph-node biopsy is helpful in this
era.

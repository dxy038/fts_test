A method for the optimization of three-phase electrical systems is proposed in this paper, the proposed method can be used in transmission, distribution and joint studies of transmission-distribution systems. The proposed methodology is based on the three-phase currents injection method and primal dual interior point method. This document presented the mathematical models of electric components, operative constraints and some objective functions. In the results some cases are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed method.

This paper presents an improved algorithm for simultaneously retrieving both land surface emissivity (LSE) and land surface temperature (LST) using data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board the MSG-2 satellite. First, the temperature-independent spectral index-based method for LSE retrieval is reviewed and improved in terms of three aspects: atmospheric correction, fitting of the bidirectional reflectivity model, and retrieval of the LSE in SEVIRI channel 10. Then, the generalized split-window method with seven unknown coefficients is used to derive the LST. Finally, this improved algorithm is applied to several MSG-2/SEVIRI data sets over a study area with geospatial coverage of latitude 30 &#176; N-45 &#176; N and longitude 15 &#176; W-15 &#176; E, and using detailed cases, the modifications to the original LSE/LST retrieval methods are shown to be effective and reasonable. In addition, the SEVIRI-derived LSTs are cross-validated primarily using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived validated LST data extracted from the MOD11B1 product on two clear-sky days (August 22, 2009 and July 3, 2008). The validation results indicate that more than 70% of the differences are within 2.5 K and that the LST differences tend to be lower at night than in the day, which may result from the homogeneous thermal conditions at night.

We have fabricated Fabry-Pe&#180;rot tunable filters based on a multi-air-gap/InP suspended structure. High spectral selectivity is achieved by displacing the resonant cavity into the high index material rather than in air. This configuration reduces the lateral losses of the cavity. The filters feature a bidirectional electrostatic actuation. A spectral linewidth better than 0.15 nm over a tuning range of 40 nm is experimentally demonstrated.

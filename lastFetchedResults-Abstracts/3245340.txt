This research describes the construction of a discrete event simulation model of the operations of a major emergency department (ED) in Melbourne, FL. Real data were used to fit distributions to patients´ interarrival times, and to validate the model using statistical analyses. After meetings with the ED´s management personnel, a major problem identified was the constant occurrence of bottlenecks due to the staffing levels of nurses. Thus, the objective of the simulation model was to understand the system´s behavior under different alternative staffing solutions. Two different staffing level alternatives were evaluated and compared to the current staffing approach via statistical analyses. The results showed that the average patient time in the system of the alternatives were significantly different. Conclusions were made based on the results from the simulation study, and future research opportunities were identified.

In multicasting routing, the main objective is to send data from one or more sources to multiple destinations, while at the same time minimizing the usage of resources. Examples of resources which can be minimized include bandwidth, time and connection costs. In this paper, we survey applications of combinatorial optimization to multicast routing. We discuss the most important problems considered in this area, as well as their models. Algorithms for each of the main problems are also presented.

Objective: Therapy for twin-twin transfusion syndrome includes amnioreduction, septostomy, and laser ablation, but there is no accepted standard of care. Mechanisms for the reported improvement in survival are incompletely understood. We sought to model the mechanisms and predict the response of varying severities of twin-twin transfusion syndrome and placental angioarchitectures to current therapies to determine optimal clinical interventions. Study Design: We used our mathematic model of twin-twin transfusion syndrome that predicts fetal and amniotic fluid abnormalities that are related to the placental angioarchitecture. Amnioreduction was modeled as reduction in amniotic fluid volume; septostomy was modeled as the merging of donor and recipient amniotic fluid, and laser ablation was modeled as the cessation of all placental anastomotic blood flows. Results: Amnioreduction reduces amniotic fluid pressure, which improves transplacental fluid flow from mother to fetus and increases both donor and recipient blood volume. However, net arteriovenous transfusion increases, because of increased donor arterial pressure, which negates, in part, the benefit of amnioreduction. Septostomy allows amniotic fluid to be swallowed by the donor, with minimal effects on donor growth and blood volume. Laser ablation eliminates anastomotic exchange of blood and reduces discordant fetal growth. Conclusion: Amnioreduction may be effective in milder twin-twin transfusion syndrome pregnancies but ineffective in severe cases. Septostomy is unlikely to offer significant therapeutic efficacy. Laser ablation is equally effective in mild and severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome but has a higher spontaneous abortion rate than amnioreduction. The model indicates improved outcomes with the use of amnioreduction in mild twin-twin transfusion syndrome cases and with laser ablation in severe cases. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:996-1003.)

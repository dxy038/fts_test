Outpatient treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) seems as safe and effective as inpatient treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH). However, most of the randomized trials comparing a LMWH with UFH described clinical outcomes within 3-6 months. The long-term incidence of recurrent VTE after treatment of DVT with LMWH remains to be established. The primary objective of this retrospective study was to document the longterm incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with DVT treated with a LMWH, nadroparin in an outpatient basis. The patients were evaluated 46 months after inclusion in two cohorts comparing home treatment with nadroparin (n = 130) with in-hospital treatment with intravenous UFH (n = 149). More than 60% of the patients in the nadroparin group could be treated at home, either entirely or after a short stay in hospital. The age-adjusted thrombosis-free survival was not statistically significant between nadroparin and UFH-treated patients (P = 0.084). There was a nonsignificant trend favoring nadroparin as compared with UFH. The hazard ratio (HR) for recurrent VTE in the nadroparin group with respect to the UFH group was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.17-1.12). No significant differences were observed in overall mortality or major hemorrhage between the two treatment groups. Our study suggests that home treatment of DVT with LMWH is at least as effective and safe as in-hospital UFH after a long-term follow-up period.

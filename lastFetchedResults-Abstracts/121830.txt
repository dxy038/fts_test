Background : Airborn lead level in Tehran's radiator repair plants is six times higher than the standard level. This high percentage necessitates evaluating engineering controls and efficient ventilation system in these plants.
Objective : To evaluate a cost-effective ventilation enclosure made of a flexible silicone sheet that forms a tent-like structure verthe water bath that is used to leak test radiators. Methods : Through an experimental study , the samples were gathered from 10 radiator repair plants which had no technical control The effectiveness of this ventilation enclosure was evaluated by collecting short-term and time-weighted average personal samples for lead data (controlled work-station) that used the enclosure. In addition , similar Personal breathing zone samples for lead were collected at a work station in the same facility without the enclosure (uncontrolled).
Finding : Lead exposure during radiator repair at the controlled work-station was 24Âµg/m3 (50% of OSHA PEL). Personal breathing zone samples taken at unncontrolled work stations averaged 143 iug/m3 which was 7 times higher than controlled stations.
Conclusion : The results demonstrated an excellent control of lead fumes using this ventilation enclosure.

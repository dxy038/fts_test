Structured mesh quality optimization methods are extended to optimization of unstructured triangular, quadri-
lateral, and mixed  nite element meshes. New interpretations of well-known nodally based objective functions
are made possible using matrices and matrix norms. The matrix perspective also suggests several new objec-
tive functions. Particularly signi cant is the interpretation of the Oddy metric and the smoothness objective
functions in terms of the condition number of the metric tensor and Jacobian matrix, respectively. Objective
functions are grouped according to dimensionality to form weighted combinations. A simple unconstrained
local optimum is computed using a modi ed Newton iteration. The optimization approach was implemented
in the CUBIT mesh generation code and tested on several problems. Results were compared against several
standard element-based quality measures to demonstrate that good mesh quality can be achieved with nodally
based objective functions

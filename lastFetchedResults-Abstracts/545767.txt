Objective
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of central 
nervous system (CNS) that is increasingly being recognized as a disease affecting 
children. However, the clinical features of childhood MS at onset have been 
rarely reported from Asia.
Materials & Methods
This report presents a retrospective chart review of 26 patients with MS (20
females and 6 males), with an onset age of MS of less than 16 years, in the south 
of Iran between March 2001and November 2007; it documents researchersâ€™ 
experiences
Results
Female/male ratio was 3:1. Mean age in females was higher than males (13
vs.12.16).The disease was highly variable in onset presentation; the most 
common initial symptoms were limb weakness, disequilibrium, and diplopia. 
Three patients had a positive family history of MS in their first degree relatives. 
VEP was abnormal in 9 of 19(47%). MRI demonstrated multiple plaques in the 
brain in 24(92%) cases. Relapse remitting MS was a dominant pattern noticed 
in 23(88%) cases.
Conclusion
MS, in childhood, is not as rare as commonly believed; although its diagnosis 
is essentially a clinical one, paraclinical investigations are of great value in the 
identification of demyelinating disorders in childhood. The disease, as it occurs 
in children, does not appear to differ clinically from the disease as observed in 
adults. If pediatricians should confront a child showing evidence of scattered 
neurological deficits that remit, particularly weakness, disturbance of vision and 
co-ordination, they need to consider the possibility of MS.

For a PWM (pulsewidth-modulated) AC-to-DC converter, a predicted current control strategy with fixed switching frequency (PCFF control) is proposed. Its principle and implementation are described, and experimental results are provided which show that the converter under PCFF control has bidirectional power transmission ability with high dynamic performance. The line currents are close to sinusoidal with unit power factor. The PCFF control produces a better switching pattern than hysteresis current control. This results in a reduction of harmonics in the line currents and lower stress on the switching devices.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

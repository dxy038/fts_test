This paper presents a new efficient method for network reconfigurations with step voltage regulators (SVRs) in distribution networks. Recently, the power market becomes more deregulated, competitive and complex. Therefore, the conventional methods are insufficient because of the simple objective problem expression. This paper defines the network reconfigurations as multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). Furthermore, this paper considers SVRs to improving the voltage deviation in distribution networks. Multi-objective meta-heuristics (MOMH) is efficiently used for MOP. This paper makes is of a new MOMH that combines with REX* and a tabu-search-based method. The proposed MOMH has higher performance method in comparison with conventional MOMH. Therefore, the proposed method provides system operators with the better solution candidates in consideration of the trade-off between the cost functions. In addition, the proposed method is successfully applied to a sample system.

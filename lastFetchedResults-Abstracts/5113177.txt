To obtain an efficient AC-to-AC (or DC) power conversion topology, one with minimum size and weight, all energy storage elements should be removed. The result is a switch matrix power converter that only has power switches and snubbers. This resulting topology was evaluated and found promising for many applications. It features unity power factor by design, variable output voltage and frequency, low harmonic generation, and bidirectional power flow. This flexible power conversion topology consists of a switch matrix connected between the AC input and AC (or DC) output. Each switch on-time is selected based upon input AC voltage and current and pulse-width modulated in accordance with developed algorithms. The output voltage can be preset from zero to 0.866*Vin or can be modulated during operation. The output frequency can be preset from zero Hz (DC) to a fraction of the switching frequency or can be slaved during operation. This paper presents a description of the switch matrix power converter based on a compilation of the work done by Venturini, Ishiguro and Holmes. It illustrates the basic components required and switching sequences necessary for efficient operation. It also presents simulated waveforms resulting from a Basic program written to verify the performance capabilities of this advanced power conversion technique

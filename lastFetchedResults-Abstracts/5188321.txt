Deals with the problem of model reduction based on an optimization technique. The objective function being minimized is the impulse energy of the overall system with unity, and double-sided weights. A number of properties of the gradient flows associated with the objective function are obtained. An example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and results are compared with balanced realization method

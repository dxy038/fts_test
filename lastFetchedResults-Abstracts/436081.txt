We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with Ebsteinâ€™s anomaly and intractable heart failure who had undergone only tricuspid valve replacement 30 years earlier. She was treated conservatively for 1 month; however, she was placed in the New York Heart Association functional class IV. Therefore, we operated on her with the objective of improving her quality of life and cardiac function. One-and-a-half repair and a second tricuspid valve replacement with right ventriculoplasty were quite effective in ameliorating her critical condition.

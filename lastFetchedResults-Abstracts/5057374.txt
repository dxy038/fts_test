The theory of entropy is abundant in content and has be applied to the economy. Usually, we measure the system quantity, that is the measuring of amount and quality of information that people acquire, the concept of entropy is usually changed into the quantitative concept of entropy weight. The entropy value is smaller, and the entropy weight is bigger, that imply the system provided useful information toward the decision maker. When the evaluation object is assured, adjust or increase and decrease to the index according to entropy weight, thus get the more credible and accurate. We also should review the evaluation and entropy weight when itpsilas necessary. Based on the entropy theory, this paper will give an approach about the multiple objective decision methods, and at the end, give a more accurate and credible engineering item choice.

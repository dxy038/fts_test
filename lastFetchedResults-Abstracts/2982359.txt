Computerized image processing techniques are widely used in the textile industry. Here, we propose objective measurement methods for fabric quality assessment, an activity usually carried out by specialized textile laboratories. Two important fabric features-both of them exhibiting 3D characteristics-namely pilling and wrinkledness are dealt with. This is why special illumination arrangements were used to grasp the depth information. The major processing steps are presented for both features

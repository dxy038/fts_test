In order to promote the green building policy of water and green construction project in the "Challenge 2008- National Development Plan" of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, and to cooperate with the green silicon island construction objective, the green building design orientation and deployment is the most important topic at present. This study used environmental assessment indicator system for green buildings to collect expert opinions from the industry, government units, and academia, then used the Green Building System Assessment of Taiwan for an empirical model to analysis "Green Building" and to reveal methods of improving gaps in each dimensions and criteria to achieving the aspired levels in performance. This study used the MCDM (multiple criteria decision making) model combining DEMATEL-based ANP (called DANP) with VIKOR to identify the problems in green building system assessment and to generate the improvement factors. The DEMATEL expert questionnaire was used to analyse four major dimensions and nine major indexes. The results of DANP showed that the waste reduction accounts for the highest weight (0.269), it is the most important influencing factor among the four dimensions. Three green buildings were also evaluated by VIKOR. This study identified the improvement factors with influence by evaluating the green building system, and provided the administrators with improvement strategies, so as to minimize the consumption of earth resources, and promote the development of sustainable buildings.

Be different from the structure design of traditional integrated super high-speed grinding wheel, In this paper, to control the radial displacement and reduce the equivalent stress of the super high-speed grinding wheel are set as the optimization objective in order to ensure the safety of grinding wheel. Models for the connection between inner micro-unitÂ´s displacement and stress of wheel base was established. By research the structural and mechanical characteristics of wheel base, strength check of the theoretical formula about variable cross-section wheel was also established. At last, super-high speed segment grinding wheel base type, wheel base material, wheel section number and wheel section thickness were optimized with finite element method. It proposed a reference rule for optimization design of segment grinding wheel.

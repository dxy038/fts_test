ABSTRACT: Mastitis is an inflammatory reaction of the mammary tissue in response to the introduction and multiplication of pathogens and is characterized by increasing somatic cell count (SCC) in milk. The main objective of present study is to assess the probable associations between somatic cell (SC) levels and calcium and phosphorus and ratio of Ca/P in raw milk. Milk samples were collected from individual quarters of 30 Holstein cows and divided into three groups based on SC level, including: low SC level ( < 200,000), intermediate SC level (200,000 â€“ 800,000) and high SC level ( > 800,000 cells ml-1), followed by calcium and phosphorus analysis. Significant negative association between SC level and Ca, P, Ca/P ratio and titratable acidity (TA) of raw milk were found, while pH increased significantly by increasing SC level. It might be concluded that nutritional quality of milk and milk products strongly depends on the establishment of effective control measures for SC levels in raw milk.

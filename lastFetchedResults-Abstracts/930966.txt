Antimicrobial packaging, besides protecting the product from external environment, inhibits or retards microorganism growth in foods, minimizing direct addition of preservatives and satisfying the actual demand of consumers for healthier foods, containing less additives. Pediocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by Pediococcus sp. and researches have revealed their ability to inhibit the growth of some pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate the antimicrobial efficiency of films incorporated with pediocin on sliced ham conservation. The antimicrobial films were incorporated with pediocin (25% and 50%) in a cellulose base emulsion. The antimicrobial efficiency of the films against Listeria innocua e Salmonella sp. on sliced ham was tested by means of a challenge test, in which the slices were immersed in 0.1% peptone solution containing about 106 CFU/mL of L. innocua or Salmonella sp. The experiment was set up overlapping the slices of ham with the films (control, 25% and 50% of pediocin). These systems were packaged under vacuum and stored at 12 Â°C. The slices of ham were analyzed for L. innocua and Salmonella sp. counts at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 storage days. The antimicrobial films were more effective inhibiting growth of L. innocua. The 50% pediocin-film presented a reduction of 2 log cycles in relation to control treatment after 15 days of storage. The 25% and 50% pediocin-films had similar performance on Salmonella sp. inhibition, both presenting 0.5 log cycle reduction in relation to control, after 12 days of storage. Hence, the films incorporated with pediocin showed potential use as one hurdle technology added in the storage period among others good manufacturing practices for preservation of sliced ham.

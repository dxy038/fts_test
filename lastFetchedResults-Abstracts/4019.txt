Vibration damping is becoming increasingly important for improved vibration and noise control, dynamic stability, and fatigue and impact resistance in advanced engineering systems. There is a particularly strong need for information on methods for improvement of damping in lightweight structural composite materials so that they may be more effectively used in the design of high performance structures and machines. This paper summarizes some recent analytical and experimental results regarding the improvement and optimization of damping in polymer composite materials at both the macromechanical and micromechanical levels. Also included is a relevant review of the recent developments in experimental techniques for measuring damping in composite materials. The basic objective of this paper is to review some of the most recent results and solutions for damping improvement and optimization in composites, and to offer recommendations regarding future research.

Background and Objective: Acinetobacters are opportunistic pathogens. Nowadays these bacteria are are among the pathogens causing nosocomial infections, so the aim of this study was to identify of acinetobacter in surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Rasoul Akram hospital and to assess the possibility of transferring antibiotic resistance by conjugation method.
Materials and Methods: In this study 100 samples were collected from respiratory tubes, respiratory secretion, intensive care unit room, food trays, beds' wheels, serum tubes and bed sheets of patients in hospitalized at Rasoul Akram hospital. Bacteria were isolated and identified by using standard bacteriological methods. After identification, antibiogram tests were done performed to determine the antibiotic sensitivity. Ater this phas, conjugation were done between donor and recipient strains in BHI broth medium.
Resuits:From all 100 collected samples, 21 samples acinetobacter was isolated. Isolated acinetobacters showed 100% resistance to rifampin, penicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline, 9512% resistance to gentamicin, nalidicsicacid, amikacin. seftizokcim, streptomycin, sephazolin, and cloroamphenicol, 9015% resistance to seftazidim and cyprofelocsazin. They showed maximum sensitivity 2816% to sulfumetoxasol.
Conclusion: Isolation of acinetobacter from surgical intensive care unit showed the contamination of this unit with this opportunistic pathogen bacteria. So more care for sterilization of this unit and tools that are used are suggested. Suitable use of antibiotics for prevention of producing multiresistant bacteria and nosocomial infections are necessary too.

In the search for lead compounds for new drugs for tuberculosis, the activity of 38 synthetic chalcones were assayed for their potential inhibitory action towards a protein tyrosine phosphatase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis – PtpA. The compounds were obtained by aldolic condensation between aldehydes and acetophenones, under basic conditions. Five compounds presented moderate or good activity. The structure–activity analysis reveals that the predominant factor for the activity is the molecule planarity/hydrophobicity and the nature of the substituents.

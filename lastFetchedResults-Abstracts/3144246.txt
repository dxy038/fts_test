In this paper a detailed theoretical investigation into the synthesis method named "Maximally Flat Beams" proposed by Ksienski for linear periodic arrays is presented. The synthesis objective, which consists in developing a rigorous design procedure aiming at obtaining flat-top beams, is reviewed and deepened. The reformulation of the problem provides a strong theoretical background which allows a full comprehension of Ksienski approach (specially for what concerns the synthesis of arrays composed by an even number of radiating elements) and casts light on its intrinsic limitations, which arise when considering arbitrary beamwidth radiation patterns. The in-depth analysis carried out represents also a useful starting point for further improvements of the method.

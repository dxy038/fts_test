This paper questions the existence of factors influencing the quality of the synthesized views, in the context of multi-view video plus depth coding (MVC). The issue of bit-rate allocation between texture and depth data in MVC is still open, despite the many efforts already raised for the development of optimization techniques. The originality of this study lies in the investigation of direct relationships between the best bit-rate allocation, in terms of objective quality of synthesized views, and the sequence characteristics (entropy of depth maps, depth complexity and camera baseline distance, background/foreground contrast areas). The results confirm our assumptions regarding the impact of the sequence features on the bit-rate allocation. The results and the limitations of the study are also discussed.

This paper explores the notion of cross-source integration of cloud-based, context-aware information. The objective is to develop a new solution that incorporates remote, web based configuration of Android phones and advances the research area of context-aware information and web applications. It expands the notion of context-awareness harvesting from web applications, enabling automatic adaptation and behaviour altering of smartphones in accordance with implicit user needs. Results from the conducted experiment show the viability of tailoring contextual information through a web application to provide users with timely, relevant and adapted application behavior and content. Through the developed application suite, we present a remote configurable, adaptive application solution to demonstrate the validity of our proposal. The novelty in this work is the new proposed solution and design whereby context-aware information is harvested from several dimensions to allow web application executions to build rich foundations on which algorithms for context-aware computation can be based.

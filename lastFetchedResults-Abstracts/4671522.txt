Since the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) was established in 1972. The world has seen an ever increasing need from decision makers, resource managers, school children, media and the public for getting access to information about the state of the global environment. To improve on this situation UNEP established the Global Resource Information Database GRID in 1985. GRID´s main objective is to provide up-to-date, reliable and easily understandable environmental information to decision makers and the public. GRID´s main technological tools are geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). The paper describes the current status of GRID including data and information available. The future development strategy of GRID is also presented particularly as a response to the recommendations made at the Rio conference regarding the needs for improved access to environmental information

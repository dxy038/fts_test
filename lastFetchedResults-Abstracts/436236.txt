A 55-year-old woman was referred to our department with the diagnosis of a bronchopleural fistula and empyema. Her medical history revealed that she had undergone a left pneumonectomy 25 years prior due to a destroyed lung associated with tuberculosis. Open drainage and a biopsy was performed because of the large mass detected on thoracic computed tomography. Postoperative pathology revealed squamous cell carcinoma.

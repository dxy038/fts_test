A joint encryption and watermarking technique is an efficient method for verifying the reliability of medical images. The medical image integrity control is achieved by the combined watermarking algorithm, QIM (Quantization Index Modulation), with an encryption algorithm. The proposed method uses two encryption algorithm namely RC4, AES are Stream cipher, Block cipher algorithm respectively. The main objective of this method is to provide integrity control for medical images although it is encrypted. Experimental security analysis is taken for the 8-bit ultrasound images and 16-bit Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. The results achieved are demonstrates the capability of the system to provide security attributes while minimizing the distortion in encrypted and spatial domain. When AES algorithm is operated with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode the output image is transparent with the DICOM standard.

In this research, we propose a fuzzy gain scheduler (FGS) with an intelligent
learning algorithm for a reactor control. In the proposed algorithm, the gradient
descent method used in order to generate the rule bases of a fuzzy algorithm by learning.
These rule bases are obtained by minimizing an objective function, which is called
a performance cost function. The objective of the FGS with an intelligent learning
algorithm is to generate adequate gains, which minimize the error of system. The
proposed algorithm can reduce the time and efforts required for obtaining the fuzzy
rules through the intelligent learning function. It is applied to reactor control of
nuclear power plant (NPP), and the results are compared with those of a conventional
PI controller with fixed gains. As a result, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is
superior to the conventional PI controIler

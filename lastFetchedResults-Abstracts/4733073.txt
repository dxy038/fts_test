There are available in the clinical community several practical risk tools to assess the risk of occurrence of a cardiovascular event. Although valuable, these tools typically present some lack of performance (low sensitivity/low specificity) when applied to a general (average) patient. This flaw is addressed in this work through an innovative personalization strategy that is supported on the evidence that current risk assessment tools perform differently among different populations/groups of patients. The proposed methodology is based on two main hypotheses: i) patients are grouped through a proper dimension reduction technique complemented with an unsupervised learning algorithm, ii) for each group the most suitable risk assessment tool can be selected improving the risk prediction performance. As a result, risk personalization is simply achieved by the identification of the group that patients belong to. The validation of the strategy is carried out through the combination of three current risk assessment tools (GRACE, TIMI, PURSUIT) developed to predict the risk of an event in coronary artery disease patients. The combination of these tools is validated with a real patient testing dataset: Santa Cruz Hospital, Portugal, N=460 ACS-NSTEMI<sup>1</sup> patients. Considering the obtained results with the available dataset it is possible to state that the main objective of this work was achieved.

Background: Many attempts have done to improve cryopreservation of mammalian
ovaries using simple, economical and efficient technique “vitrification”.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare the mouse ovaries
cryopreservation by direct cover vitrification (DCV) using different concentrations of
ethylene glycol (EG) with conventional vitrification methods (CV).
Materials and Methods: Ninety NMRI mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation;
their ovaries were divided into three main experimental groups: control or non-vitrified
group, CV group and DCV groups with 4, 6 and 8M EG as cryoprotectant. After
vitrification-warming, the viability of mechanically isolated follicles and the
morphology of ovarian follicles by light and electron microscopes were studied.
Results: The normality of primary and preantral follicles in non-vitrified and CV
groups were higher than those achieved by DCV groups (p < 0.001). The survival rates of
isolated follicles in non-vitrified, CV and DCV groups with 4M, 6M and 8M ethylene
glycol were 98.32, 96.26, 84.10, 85.46 and 84.56 %, respectively and in DCV groups it
was lower than other groups (p < 0.001). The ultrastructure of ovarian follicles was well
preserved in CV technique. The follicles in DCV groups appeared to have vacuolated
oocyte with nuclear shrinkage and irregular distribution of cytoplasmic organelles.
Their mitochondria were located mainly in the sub cortical part of the oocyte and the
granulosa cells demonstrated some signs of degeneration.
Conclusion: DCV of mouse ovarian tissue using only EG has induced some alteration
on the fine structure of follicles. The integrity of mouse ovarian tissue was affected by
DCV technique more than CV.

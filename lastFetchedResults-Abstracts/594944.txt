Objective: The management of post traumatic posterior urethral stricture is one of the most difficult surgical problem faced by a urologist. It is an uncommon injury at an inaccessible location.Material and Methods: We did a study on 22 patients, who had 1 stage perineal urethroplasty and were followed for more then one year. We compare the results of initial suprapubic catheterization at the time of injury and delayed urethroplasty, with patients, who had initial realignment procedure with railroading and presented to us with recurrent stricture formation.Results: The result of primary catheterization and delayed urethroplasty is very satisfactory, it is associated with less chances of impotency and incontinence. Subsequent stricture if formed, is usually short and can easily be managed by day case opticle urethrotomy.Conclusion: Post traumatic posterior urethral stricture should have suprapubic catheterization before definitive surgery.

Section II introduces the Korean pharmaceutical distribution system and its current situation; Section III explores the distribution systemÂ´s strengths and weaknesses. Section IV, identifies the problem and possible solutions for the Korean pharmaceutical distribution system; Section V summarizes and concludes this paper and acknowledges its limitations. Finally, this paper has a clear limitation. The lack of objective information and scientific analysis due to the data being based on interviews with company representatives is its most significant shortcoming. However, it offers implications for new directions for future research.

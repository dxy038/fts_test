In this paper, a description of a technique for improving transient performance in the velocity inertial system while minimizing the standard deviation of the system error, (i.e., standard deviation of the system velocity measurement error &#194;&#191;v2) is given. To accomplish this objective, a prescribed settling time constraint is formulated for the system response. The constraint equation is then imposed on the minimization process. The result shows that considerable settling time improvement can be derived without sacrificing system accuracy.

The double wishbone suspension and steering system were regarded as a whole system, then its multi-body model and array of lower serial number objects were established based on multi-method physical science in Kane. Kinematical equations and constraint equations of this system were set up, providing a genetic algorithm using the MATLAB toolbox for solving exactly constraint equation approach. Based on Ackermann theorem, the optimization model of double wishbone suspension and steering mechanism was founded using the overall steering error as the objective function. In order to obtain the practical requirements of a reasonable distribution of error, the three-dimensional continuous weight function composed of probability curves was joined; Optimization program was compiled by calling Matlab GA toolbox. Take one real vehicle type as an example, kinematics analysis and optimization design of double wishbone suspension steering system was done in this paper.

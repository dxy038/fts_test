We investigate the convergence rates of diffusion in bidirectional Erdös–Rényi networks. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that the asymptotic distribution is far from a bell shape. Further, we numerically verify that the dynamical networks generated by the Barabasi–Albert model, which is a standard scale-free network model, exhibiting faster convergence of average consensus.

In semiconductor manufacturing, the rapid development of manufacturing equipment allows product processing to be achieved by machines of different generations whose processing speed may be different. In this study, we propose several heuristics to schedule independent jobs on machines with different processing speeds. The scope of this research is limited to a static and deterministic problem. The scheduling objective is to minimize two due-date-related criteria: total lateness and total tardiness, respectively

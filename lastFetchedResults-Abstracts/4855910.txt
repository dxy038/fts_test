Video quality has a direct impact on user experience and how to evaluate it has become an important topic of current research. Existing video quality assessment methods have their advantages as well as drawbacks. Assessment methods hitherto can reflect video quality to some extent but they could not well establish the relationship between Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, a video quality assessment method combining subjective experiments and objective analysis is proposed. By gradually changing the objective indicators and collecting the result of the subjective evaluation at the same time, we establish the mapping relationship between objective indicators and subjective experience. Simplified MPQM method and graded method are used and four mapping formulae are obtained by mathematical fitting. The formulae represent how key indicatorsÂ´ variation quantitatively and respectively affects user experience.

The main objective of this paper is to monitor the phasors of voltages and currents at the sending and receiving ends of a transmission line using a microcontroller based Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU). The PMU is designed and developed to acquire the samples of voltage and current signals of the line ends in a synchronized time reference frame. The voltage and current samples from the PMUs are collected and stored in a PC using a microcontroller based Intelligent Electronic Device (IED). A MATLAB based front end graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to acquire these data using the PCÂ´s serial port. The IED coordinates all the time synchronization pulses to the PMUs and maintains a sequential routing for the data collection from them. The overall functioning of the PMUs, IED and the GUI is tested in a laboratory model of the power system and satisfactory performance is obtained.

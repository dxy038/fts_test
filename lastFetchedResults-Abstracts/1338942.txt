It can be a challenge to find suitable horse bedding materials that provide higher moisture absorption, better animal comfort, greater fertilizer values, and improved indoor environment. Our first objective was to determine the water absorption capacity (WAC) of two bedding materials, flax shive (FS) and pine wood shavings (PWS), commonly used by equine facilities. The second objective was to measure ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations emitted from these bedded stall surfaces. In this study, the WAC of bedding materials were measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours in the laboratory. A total of eight horses were used for a 14-day study period. Of these, four horses (group-1) were bedded with FS and the other four (group-2) were bedded with PWS for week-1. In week-2, bedding materials were switched between the two groups. Ammonia and H2S were measured in situ. For GHG measurement, air samples (methane [CH4], carbon dioxide [CO2], and nitrous oxide [N2O]) were collected 152 mm above the bedded stall surface in Tedlar bags using a vacuum chamber and analyzed for GHG using a gas chromatograph. The WAC of FS was 56% greater than the PWS. There were no significant differences in NH3, H2S, CH4, CO2, and N2O concentrations between the two bedding materials (P > .05). Nutrient contents between fresh and soiled bedded samples for each bedding type were different (P < .05). Measured nutrient contents between fresh FS and PWS and bedded FS and PWS bedding materials were similar (P > .05).

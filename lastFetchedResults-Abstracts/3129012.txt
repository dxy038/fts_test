For making full use of combat efficiency of electronic warfare equipments, it is critical to prefer electromagnetic interference (EMI) tactics. Several uncertainties in the process of preferring are analyzed, and the modeling steps and flowchart for uncertainty preference are proposed in details. Firstly, linguistic terms quantification of indices based on expert system and vague set is studied. Secondly, a comprehensive weighting method based on analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and information entropy (IE) is proposed, which can consider subjective opinions and objective information sufficiently. Thirdly, preference of EMI tactics based on relative predominance is researched using vague similarity measure and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Lastly, the proposed method is applied on uncertainty preference of EMI tactics imposed on a certain communication group, and the calculation results have shown the validity.

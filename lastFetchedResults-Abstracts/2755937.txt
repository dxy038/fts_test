This paper presents an experimental study on human-robot comanipulation in the presence of kinematic redundancy. The objective of the work is to enhance the performance during human-robot physical interaction by combining Cartesian impedance modulation and redundancy resolution. Cartesian impedance control is employed to achieve a compliant behavior of the robot´s end effector in response to forces exerted by the human operator. Different impedance modulation strategies, which take into account the human´s behavior during the interaction, are selected with the support of a simulation study and then experimentally tested on a 7-degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR4. A comparative study to establish the most effective redundancy resolution strategy has been made by evaluating different solutions compatible with the considered task. The experiments have shown that the redundancy, when used to ensure a decoupled apparent inertia at the end effector, allows enlarging the stability region in the impedance parameters space and improving the performance. On the other hand, the variable impedance with a suitable modulation strategy for parameters´ tuning outperforms the constant impedance, in the sense that it enhances the comfort perceived by humans during manual guidance and allows reaching a favorable compromise between accuracy and execution time.

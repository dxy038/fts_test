Study Objective
To document an unusual cause of vaginal bleeding in early puberty.
Design
Case Report.
Results
Clinical presentation with the aid of pelvic ultrasound pointed to the diagnosis of an endometrial polyp in this young adolescent prior to menarche. A hysteroscopy was deemed necessary to allay concerns for a serious pathology and confirm diagnosis.
Conclusion
Endometrial polyps are infrequent in adolescents but should be included as a differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding in this population.

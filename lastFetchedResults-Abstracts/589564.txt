    Mutation studies in different prolific sheep breeds have shown that the effectiveness programs in this reqard are necessary for improving sheep population. One of the important agents on prolificacy is transforming growth factor beta superfamily (TGFB). The growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) family is belong to TGFB superfamily. 
FecGH mutation that belongs to the GDF9 family has additive effects for litter size and ovulation rate in carrier sheep. The present study was therefore designed with the objective to evaluate FecGH mutation in the Lory-Bakhteyari and Arabic sheep. Results show no FecGH mutation is in Lory-Bakhteyari and Arabic sheep. So mutation of FecGH is not cause of prolificacy in these breeds. Further research requires evaluating fecundity gene and genotyping of these sheep breeds.

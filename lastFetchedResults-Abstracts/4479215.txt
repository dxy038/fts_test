System evolution, such as addition or replacement of a component, may necessitate complete re-design. Such redesign may be needed to respect new or updated requirements. The models then have to be modified. In this paper, we present a procedure for reconfiguration of a discrete event system (DES) controller. Based on supervisory control theory (SCT), the objective of this work is to show how the SCT is convenient in order to reconfigure the controller to take into account the new and updated requirements without re-verifying the requirements that do not change because they are still respected.

The Space Shuttle Program objective is to establish a national space transportation capability that will substantially reduce the cost of space operations and support a wide range of scientific, defense, and commerical uses. The Space Shuttle Program has successfully completed its first phase-the Approach and Landing Test (ALT) Program. Testing is currently underway on all major components of the Space Shuttle. The first Space Shuttle orbital flight is scheduled for next year. This flight will be the first of six Orbital Flight Test (OFT) missions. Following the OFT phase, which will last approximately one year, the Space Shuttle will enter operational service.

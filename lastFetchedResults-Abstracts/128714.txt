Background : Experimental studies have showed that dietetic protein consumption can decrease glomerulal pressure , prevent progressive, glomerulal sclerosis and postpone the progression of the chronic renal failure.
Objective : To determine the effects of a designed dietetic regimen on the control of chronic renal failure in early stages (renal insufficiency).
Methods : 65 randomly selected patients were divided into two groups: test group and control group including 35 and 30 patients respectively. After assessing Wt., BP, Ht., lab data, and dietary condition of patients for several times, a nutrition regimen consisting of protein 0.6-0.7 gr/kg, phosphrus 10-12 mg/ gr protein, energy 35-40 kcal/ kg, calcium 1-1.5 gr/day, and sodium 2-4 gr/day was designed for test group for 6 months. Lab data, protein catabolism rate, the rate of phosphorus excretion were assessed. Assessing renal function from creatinine clearance rate and performing the lab tests, pars azemoon kits for creatinine measurement, zist shimi kits for urea, kitman for phosphorus, and trichloroacetic acid 3% for measurement of urine proteine were used. The groups were followed up every 1.5 months for six months.
Findings: The results showed that, after the intervention there was a significant difference in mean creatinin clearance rates of two groups (P<0.01), while there was not any before intervention.
Conclusion : The designed nutrition regimen may delay the progression of chronic renal failure in the early stages, decrease the clinical signs of the disease, and postpone the necessity of dialysis.

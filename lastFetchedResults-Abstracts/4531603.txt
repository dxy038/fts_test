The objective of our work is to design and implement an automatic recognition system of mechanical wear out in a conductive non magnetic material. Especially in the flight industry, this is a very important issue as recognizing wear out in a material can avoid material failures. Nowadays this exploration needs highly skilled operators that using hand-operated eddy current testing (ECT) are able to recognize the flaws type and shape. With the introduction of a microprocessor based system the performance is enhanced by increasing the test speed while avoiding errors due to human failure like inexperience and inconsistency. In the present paper a computer based eddy current testing system is proposed. A description of the implemented prototype including some details on the digital processing techniques used and the measurements obtained for different artificial defects in an aluminum plate are presented.

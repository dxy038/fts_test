Over the past ten years, extensive research has been devoted to extended LMI characterizations for stability and performance of linear systems. These characterizations constitute a valuable tool for reducing conservatism in hard problems like multi-objective control, and robust stability and performance analysis. The present paper proposes a general, projection lemma based methodology for deriving such extended LMIs and hereby provides a straightforward and unified proof for all known literature results as well as some currently missing extended LMIs.

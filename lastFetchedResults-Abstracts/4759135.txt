Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web, promises to revolutionize the way learning is delivered over the internet. In this paper, we discuss how the underlying technological elements of the semantic web combine to add intelligence to web-based, desktop or mobile, education and learning. We moreover present three types of semantic web applications for education, namely learning objects, learning object repositories and pedagogical agents, and critically appraise their contribution to learners and instructors alike. Our work offers a systematic taxonomy of the current state-of-the-art along with the relevant future research challenges in the field and an objective assessment of the critical aspects for the successful integration of semantic web applications in learning, aiming to assist researchers in positioning their future work and contribution in the area.

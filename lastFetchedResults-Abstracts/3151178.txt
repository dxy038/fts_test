The characteristics of the patent index are heterogeneous although the patent pool is essential for high-tech product developments. The objective of this paper is to explore the reliability of existed patent indicators. The empirical study examines the major firmÂ´s patent indicators for DVD technology. Patent data is thus divided into patent-pool group and non patent-pool group. The results show that forward citations, backward citation, patent family, scientific literature, maintenance, transfer of assignee are significant indicators; technological lifecycle, number of assignees, and number of claims are not significant indicators. The contribution of this paper is to find the heterogeneity of technology strategies in the same pool.

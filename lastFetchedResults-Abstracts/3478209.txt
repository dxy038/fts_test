We propose and demonstrate a single-fiber bidirectional wavelength division multiplexing self-healing ring network for metro-access applications. By incorporating a simple bi-directional optical add-drop multiplexer at each network node as well as employing our proposed alternate-path switching scheme, the bi-directional traffic can be restored promptly under single fiber failure in the ring network. All the protection switching is performed at the hub only, thus the operation, administration and management cost can be easily optimized

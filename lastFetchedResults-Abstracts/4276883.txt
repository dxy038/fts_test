As we all known, almost all of the complex systems have network structures. The investigation of complex networks has become a research hotspot at the frontiers of science. The existence of bidirectional information transfer mechanism between the nervous system and the immune system has been confirmed, which means the immune system is not only affected by the regulation of neural system, but also feeds back to the neural system. Combining with some statistical properties of complex networks, this article puts forward the compound network research of neural-immune system, such as statistical characteristics of the degree distribution, act degree distribution, dyad act degree distribution and cluster coefficient. It is proved that complex network degree, act degree, dyad act degree distribution fit SPL distribution. It denotes that the connection between medium may be choosen linear optimization or randomly or both of them at present. By this way it also verify that there are different choices among the cell secretion medium in the neural-immune system. Finally, we propose a way to analyze cell medium cluster properties through the study of cluster coefficient.

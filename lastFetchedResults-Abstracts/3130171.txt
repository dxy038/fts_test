Using Genetic Algorithm to optimize mechanical properties of ceramic die material, the best volume fraction of each mechanical property can be obtained respectively. And the best volume fraction of comprehensive mechanical properties also can be obtained by multi-objective optimization. Experimental results of the material fabrication indicate that the developed ceramic material possesses good comprehensive mechanical properties when the volume fraction of SiC is 14.6% and Ti(C,N) is 15.2%. It proves that the method proposed in the present study is reasonable and feasible not only for the SiC/Ti(C,N)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> material but also for design of other advanced ceramic materials.

This paper assesses the quality of media synchronization of recovery control schemes from asynchrony, which are referred to as reactive control schemes here, in terms of objective and subjective measures. We deal with four reactive control techniques: skipping, discarding, shortening and extension of output duration, and virtual time-contraction and time-expansion. We have carried out subjective and objective assessment of the media synchronization quality of nine schemes, which consist of combinations of the four techniques. The paper makes a comparison of media synchronization quality among the schemes. It also clarifies the relations between the two kinds of quality measures

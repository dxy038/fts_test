The objective of the Silicon-Film program is to produce a high-performance, large-area solar cell that utilizes low-cost materials and manufacturing for terrestrial applications. A 2.82 watt solar cell has been developed. This solar cell is fabricated from a continuous sheet of thin-film polycrystalline silicon at a projected rate of 4.4 MW/yr. The as-grown sheet has a minority carrier diffusion length of 25-40 micrometers. Diffusion lengths of 160 micrometers have been achieved by employing post-growth gettering, bulk defect passivation and device design. Further improvements are expected as the process for providing as-grown sheet material is fine-tuned, which will result in a 3.15 watt solar cell in the near term. PC-1D modeling has been employed to provide the process development path to 3.75 watts

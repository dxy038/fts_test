The ordinary differential equation (ODE) method is one of the most powerful tools for the convergence of stochastic approximations. The objective in this method is to associate to a given algorithm a deterministic differential equation with continuous right-hand side, through which the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is investigated. In this paper a different method using differential inclusions is described: instead of a differential equation with continuous right-hand side, a differential inclusion is associated to the given algorithm. Several types of algorithms are considered for illustration

It is noted that optimization is important to the development of high-current, heavy-ion accelerators for power production based on inertial confinement fusion. Two heavy-ion recirculating linac configurations are examined that eliminate the necessity to provide reset pulses for the cores used in the linac induction accelerator modules. The configurations considered use the reset pulse to accelerate beam bunches traveling in the reverse direction and thus potentially improve system efficiency and/or reduce cost. A three-linac recirculator and a bidirectional recirculator are considered.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The operation of a three phase induction motor from a single phase supply with a capacitor in circuit is well known. While detailed investigations on induction motor performance under such operating condition are reported in the literature, no such work is reported for a synchronous motor. This paper presents analytical and experimental evaluation of the performance of a three phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) fed from a single phase supply. A capacitor is connected across two of the stator phases during starting and running. The symmetrical component concept is used for the analysis. Estimation of capacitor value to meet the desired objective such as minimum unbalance or maximum efficiency is carried out. Experimental load tests are conducted on the machine, which validate the simulation results

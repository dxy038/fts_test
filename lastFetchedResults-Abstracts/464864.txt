OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate whether the secretion of a cardiovascular hormone, calcitonin gene - related peptide, is modified in climateric women according to cardiovascular adaptive responses. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide levels were measured in climateric women in a basal condition (n = 15), in response to an upright position (n = 8), and during hot flushes (n = 12). The effect of hormonal replacement therapy on plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide was also studied (n = 9). Plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide levels were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay after an acidic extraction. RESULTS: Plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide levels in postmenopausal women were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.01). After the women assumed an upright posture, a lack of plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide increase was observed in control fertile women, who showed the typical significant hormonal increase (p < 0.01). In all patients the occurrence of hot flushes was associated with a significant and rapid increase of plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide levels. After 3 months of hormonal replacement therapy basal plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide levels returned to the range of healthy fertile women. CONCLUSIONS: The current data show that the secretion of plasma calcitonin gene–related peptide is lower in postmenopausal women and its response to postural stimulus is impaired. Vasomotor changes are associated with an increase of plasma levels of this cardiovascular hormone. An effect of hormonal replacement therapy on calcitonin gene–related peptide secretion has been shown. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:638-42.)

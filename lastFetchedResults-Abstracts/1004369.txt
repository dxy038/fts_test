Numerous empirical studies have focused on aspects of capital
structure; however, a new branch of capital structure, debt maturity
structure has not been studied enough. Debt maturity structure means
the mixture of short term and long term debts that the corporation
chooses to achieve an appropriate capital structure. However, there is
no study in Iran about debt maturity structure; hence the objective of
this research is the investigation about the effect of macroeconomic
variables including GDP growth rate, inflation and money supply, on
debt maturity structure in companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange.
To examine research hypotheses, multi-variable regression analysis
via pool data and financial information of 92 sample companies were
utilized, during time period of 2001 to 2010. To test the hypotheses,
Fisher F-test and t- student test were applied. The study findings
represent the negative correlation between inflation rate and debt
maturity structure on the whole sample used in the study.In addition,
there is a negative relationship between the debt maturity structure and
money supply. Furthermore, there exists a positive relationship
between GDP and debt maturity structure. There are also various
correlation results in different industries. Therefore, we propose in the
periods in which inflation and money supply are high and their
changes are long term, the firms should select short term debts on
their debt maturity structure; since agency costs will be reduced.

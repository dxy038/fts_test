Optimising energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is of dominant importance. Sink mobility is introduced to deal with this problem by approaching the sensor nodes and collecting their data buffers using the less energy demanding single-hop communication. The sink route is very crucial for the data collection operation performed in the network especially when the collection requests generated by the sensors are revealed dynamically to the sink and not known ahead. This paper presents a practical motion heuristic for constructing the sink route based on the dynamic arrival of the collection requests. Three control schemes are proposed for coordinating the interaction of multiple mobile sinks collectively performing the data collection in the network. The main objective is maximising the data collected by each mobile sink while minimising the sleeping time of each sensor awaiting the collection service. Simulation results show the performance of the mobile sinks under the proposed control schemes and the impact of the motion heuristic on the sensorsÂ´ sleeping time in the network.

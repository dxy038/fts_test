Background and aims: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are a serious problem among the nursing staff. Manual patient-handling tasks, such as lifting, transferring, and repositioning patients, are the major causes of WMSDs among nursing staff. The objective of the present study was risk assessment of musculoskeletal disorders during patient transfers by the movement-and-assistance-of-hospital patient (MAPO) technique among hospital nursing staff of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), Shiraz, Iran.Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 400 randomly selected nurses from 75 wards in 11 hospitals in Shiraz. Data were collected using demographic and Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaires and the MAPO index checklist. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.Results: The means of age and job tenure of the subjects were 30.76±6.44 and 6.92±5.75 years, respectively. The 12-month prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders was 88.2%. The results of assessment by the MAPO index revealed that more than 83% of the subjects were at risk, 20.5% of them exposed to high risk. Further analysis of the data indicated that the musculoskeletal disorders occurrence was significantly associated with the MAPO index score (p<0.05).Conclusion: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders were found to be associated with the MAPO index. Therefore, MAPO is an appropriate tool for musculoskeletal disorders risk identification and assessment due to patient handling in the nursing personnel. In any attempt to improve the working conditions, patient transfer aids, environmental factors, and proper training should be taken into consideration.

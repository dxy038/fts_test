We have developed a new method of equalization using an artificial neural network to obtain higher density readout and to guarantee greater margins for frames and for focusing. In this method, a neural network is trained to eliminate intersymbol interference and aberrations. The neural-net equalizer (NNEQ) offers advantages over conventional linear transversal equalizers. The NNEQ, combined with an objective lens with NA 0.60 and a 670 nm laser, enables playback of disks at densities four times that of CDs.

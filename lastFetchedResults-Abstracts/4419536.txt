This paper focuses on the output feedback stabilization for fractional-order singular (FOS) uncertain linear systems with the fractional commensurate order 0 &lt;; &#945; &lt;; 1. The objective is to design suitable output feedback controllers that guarantee the stability of closed-loop systems. Based on the matrixÂ´s singular value decomposition (SVD), some new results in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) are developed to the output feedback controller synthesis for the FOS systems. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods.

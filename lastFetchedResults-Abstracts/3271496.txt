In single fiber bidirectional central light seeding wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (CLS WDM-PON), Rayleigh backscattering (RB) noise is the main factor limiting system performance. We propose and demonstrate a cascaded reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOAs) structure to suppress signal RB noise in WDM-PON. Experimental results demonstrate that upstream and downstream receiver sensitivity can be improved, with better signal RB noise tolerance in both upstream and downstream directions.

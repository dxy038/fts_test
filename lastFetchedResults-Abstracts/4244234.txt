This paper addresses subcarrier allocation and power distribution in a sectorized two-cell downlink OFDMA system impaired by multicell interference. The objective is to maximize the sum throughput in a way that the SINR of the transmitted data substream on each subcarrier meets a target SINR. In cellular systems due to intercell interference, it may not be possible to guarantee the target SINR in all cells simultaneously; therefore, we have suggested a cooperative resource allocation algorithm which tries to provide the target SINR in all cells through cooperation in the interference control. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only guarantee the target SINR but achieve an efficient sum throughput in many practical situations.

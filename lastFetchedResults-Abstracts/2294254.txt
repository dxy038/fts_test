This paper deals with experimental works the objective of which aims at improving the design of riveted joints for airframe crashworthiness purposes. Complex assemblies are considered at this stage as the sum of simpler ones constituted of 1 rivet and 2 plates, the behaviour of which is investigated under different points of view. Research is divided in two major parts. The first one investigates the consequence of rivet processing in term of possible material and structural embrittlement (residual stress and strain in rivets and plates). In the second part, the overall behaviour and strength of the considered basic assembly (1 rivet and 2 plates) is studied. The aim is here to characterise basic failure modes of assemblies linked to rivet failure or crack propagation in punched metal plates. The measurements of local variables enable to assess the influence or not of dynamics on the different failure mechanisms. Eventually, an original test procedure based on the ARCAN test rig is presented, the objective of which is to give access to multi-axial failure criterions for rivets.

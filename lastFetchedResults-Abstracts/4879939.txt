Power distribution systems are now integrating Smart Grid technologies allowing for widespread implementation of demand response and direct load control. This paper will present a service restoration problem formulation and solution algorithm for power distribution systems which incorporates load curtailment. A ranking based heuristic search algorithm is proposed which prioritizes the multi-objective service restoration problem and returns a new system configuration and load curtailment scheme to restore power to out-of-service customers following fault isolation. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the mechanics of the proposed algorithm.

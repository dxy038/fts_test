Then by using Fuzzy Delphi method and seeking others' opinion with a five Likert scale questionnaire from 32 masters and the PHD students of physical education of university of Guilan and based on Pareto rule, 11 criteria which achieved scores more than 0.8 were identified as critical criteria. According to 11 critical criteria and 3 coaching alternatives, final questionnaire was prepared and distributed among five decision makers on coach selection in Guilan's Damash Sports Club. After gathering the data, it was analyzed by TOPSIS technique.
Results: After identifying and determining critical criteria such as technical, managerial and leadership, psychology-mental, social, communication, sports and motivational skills, initiative and intelligence, background and personality characteristics, a decision structure was designed in three levels and accordingly a selection process was carried out by using developed TOPSIS MADM technique.

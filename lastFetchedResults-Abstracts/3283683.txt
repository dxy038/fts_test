Merging advanced control and information and communication technology (ICT) technology with the power grid is an appropriate approach for realizing the promising potential of massive distributed energy resources (DERs) integration, that is necessary for the vision of a sustainable society. This paper introduces a storage integrated photovoltaic (S-PV) system at residential areas as a multiple objective unit to address requirements either from technical or commercial side. Furthermore, a coordination mechanism for multiple S-PV units based on multi-agent system (MAS) technology will be discussed. The decision-making ability of the agents is necessary for arbitrating possible conflict of interests among S-PV units in case of disagreement between serving network functions and trading in the energy market. The proposed decision-making method of the agents is based on the coalitional game theory. More specifically, the two concepts for solving a coalition game with transferable pay-off are examined including the Shapley value and the Nucleolus. These concepts are compared to pro rata division of payoff in order to demonstrate their effectiveness in providing economic incentives for the S-PV units to participate in a coalition. A simulation with three S-PV units is used to verify the proposed coordination mechanism.

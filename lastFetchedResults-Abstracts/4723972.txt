The past decade has seen a dramatic change in the manner in which the power industry is organized. It has moved from a formerly vertically integrated and highly regulated industry to one that has been horizontally integrated in which the generation, transmission and distribution are unbundled. In a deregulated environment, Congestion in the transmission lines can be relieved by one of the two congestion management methodologies viz. cost, free and non-cost free methods. In this paper, Congestion is relieved by using Cost Free method and is reduced by employing Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC). Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony search algorithm (ACSA) were used to obtain the global optimal solution as the objective function is nonlinear in Congestion Management. Simulations are carried out to show the performance of the proposed methodology.

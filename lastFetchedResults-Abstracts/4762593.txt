Motivated by higher bandwidths and the need to handle a range of packet data services, several enhancements over the IS 95A/B packet interface have been proposed for third generation (3G) CDMA systems: enhanced physical layer to provide data rates greater than 64 kbps, enhanced MAC layer to support concurrent operation of any combination of voice, circuit and packet data, each with varying QoS and enhanced signaling to enable efficient resource management. The objective of this paper is to introduce concepts from queueing theory that address radio resource management issues for supporting packet data services over 3G CDMA systems

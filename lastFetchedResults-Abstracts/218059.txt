The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of an anionic surfactant from wastewater in ICEAS. The surfactant considered here was anionic SDS being widely used in the household and industrial detergents. Basic wastewater COD was 260 mg L^-1 and SDS surfactant added in range 20 to 400 mg L^-1. The effect of the inlet SDS concentration and reaction time on COD and SDS removal was investigated. The results from this study indicated that the aeration time of 2 h was sufficient for removal of SDS ranged 20 to 400 mg L^-1. Obtained data showed low effluent SDS concentrations of 0.3 to 5 mg L^-1 and removal of SDS was more than 98%. These results revealed that biological treatment using ICEAS process is capable to treating wastewaters containing high concentration of SDS surfactant.

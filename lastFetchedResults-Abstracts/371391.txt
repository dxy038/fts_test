The objective of this study was to characterize a series of anionic biodegradable polymer resins for their compatibility in a biological environment, comparing them with respect to the influence of ionic function on enzyme catalyzed biodegradation when the polymers were incorporated into a porous calcium polyphosphate (CPP) 3-D structure to form an interpenetrating phase composite (IPC). The swelling behavior of the polymers was investigated by immersing the cured polymer resins in growth media at 37 Â°C. In vitro cytotoxicity of the polymer resins was assessed using a HeLa cell line. Cell viability increased when the amount of low molecular weight monomer was minimized. Despite observing that the addition of carboxylic acid groups into the polymer resin chains contributed to an improvement of the chemical bonding between the polymer and the CPP, the addition of high ionic content into the resin led to the greatest loss of bending strength for the samples incubated in phosphate buffer and cholesterol esterase enzyme solutions, when compared to their as made state. The increased degradation for the higher ionic component materials and their loss of physical strength was attributed to enhanced hydrolysis within the materials and by water transport deep within the composites, via the anionic components of the resin. The findings indicated that the introduction of anionic content must be optimized to promote increased mechanical performance for the CPP, balancing the features of polymer CPP bonding versus polymer swelling and cytotoxicity.

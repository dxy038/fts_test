This paper presents a new control method based on a genetic algorithm (GA) technique to control a unified power flow controller (UPFC) installed in a single-machine infinite-bus power system. The objective of the GA based UPFC controller is to damp power system oscillations. Phillips-Herffron model of a single-machine power system equipped with a UPFC is used to model the system. The paper shows the capability of the UPFC to enhance power system performance by controlling its power flow. The GA controller is added to give the UPFC more flexibility and to increase its capability to damp the power system oscillations.

This paper focuses on subchannel and power allocation problem in OFDMA-based decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative relay networks. The objective of this problem is to maximize the total data rate under the constraints of joint total transmission power and subchannels occupation, while maintaining the maximum fairness among multiple relay nodes. We transform this mixed integer programming problem to a standard convex optimization one through Lagrangian relaxation method. Accordingly, the optimal solution can be achieved by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In addition, we propose two suboptimal subchannel allocation schemes with and without subchannel permutation (SP), which reduce significantly the computational complexity with small performance loss. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed suboptimal algorithms with SP approaches asymptotically that of the optimal algorithm and with the increment of the number of relay nodes.

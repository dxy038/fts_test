The objective of the reported study has been to assess and evaluate as comprehensively as possible the environmental impact of Octadecyl 3(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate (CAS no: 2082-79-3, Irganox® 1076, Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc., Additives), which is used as an antioxidant. The potential impact on the compartments soil, groundwater and surface water is to be considered. For comparative purposes, additionally, other chemical compounds being currently under environmental discussion are also taken into account. These comprise pesticides and phthalates which are ubiquitously distributed plasticizers as well as a complexing agent. Since the data basis for each of the compounds under consideration is different, a tiered approach comprising various methodologies of impact assessment has been chosen to achieve the best possible comprehensiveness. The tiers are: 1. 1. Tier: hazard assessment using a scoring system2. 2. Tier: comparative risk assessment.
When interpreting the results of each method, system boundaries as well as underlying assumptions were taken into consideration. Both methodologies showed, that - as compared to the reference substances — there is no relevant environmental and toxicological concern due to low environmental and human hazard from Octadecyl 3(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate.

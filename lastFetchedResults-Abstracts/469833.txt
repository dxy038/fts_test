Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the consistency of calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by custom genome resequencing microarrays compared with capillary DNA sequencing.
Study design
Amplified genomic DNA from 23 patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was hybridized to microarrays containing 30 kilobases of sequence from 6 different candidate genes. Capillary DNA sequencing was performed in 10 patients.
Results
For 10 patients with ≥90% of bases called, 49 SNPs in 5 of 6 genes were identified. Of the 490 bases, 75 were ambiguous (read as “N”), and 415 were able to be called an A, C, G, or T. Of 415 called, 401 (96.6%) sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All homozygotes (285/285) were called identically, while sequence from 89.2% (116/130) of heterozygotes agreed by both methods. The level of agreement between microarray calls and capillary DNA sequencing demonstrated substantial accuracy.
Conclusion
Custom genome resequencing microarrays are highly consistent with capillary sequencing in calling individual bases in genomic DNA from patients with human disease.

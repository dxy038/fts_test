As it currently stands, waveform generators are being employed in many diverse areas such as communication systems, radar applications, simulation, and testing. Thus, the objective here is to develop an algorithm for a waveform generator capable of synthesizing analog signals from a specified collection of discrete signal points, and polynomial splines are employed to develop a smooth curve (continuous derivatives) connecting these points. Texas Instruments recently released its 720 MHz digital signal processor (worldÂ´s fastest), and the purpose of this brief paper is to add to the body of knowledge associated with splines and digital to analog conversion.

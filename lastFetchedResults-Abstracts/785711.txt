This study is based on one specific major objective to study income and marital factors
influencing Leadership skills of the Women Managers. The main purpose of the study is to find
out the performance perspectives of leadership skills among women managers working in public
and private sectors in India. Descriptive study was used for the present study as it aimed to know
the present situation and behaviour of the women managers who are working in different
sectors/organizations in the study area. The sample consisted of 450 female managers between
20 to 50 and above years of age in different organizations from different parts of Andhra Pradesh
ranging from banks to IT, pharmaceutical companies to call centers. The primary data were
analysed using SPSS software and applied statistical tools like percentages, Mean, Standard
Deviation and F-tests were carried out for testing the results. The study results revealed that the
biggest challenge faced by women managers today is managing their dual role of organizational
managers and housewives. Women experience tremendous stress caused by either work over
load or under load. Women's over load comes from the pressure to work harder to prove them.
While Indian men do not mind having women as subordinates, they do not like them as bosses.
Dissatisfaction from subordinates is a source of stress for women managers, which they see as a
challenge to be confronted.

Objective
Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a life-threatening disease in children
wherein the patient’s convulsive seizures do not respond to adequate initial
anticonvulsants. RSE is associated with high rate of mortality and morbidity.
This study was aimed to survey the risk factors leading status epilepticus (SE) to
RSE in children, and their early outcome.
Materials & Methods
Patients with SE hospitalized in Tabriz Children’s Hospital, Iran were studied
during the years 2007 and 2008 with regard to their clinical profile, etiology, the
treatment methods available to them and their outcome upon release from the
hospital.
Results
Among 132 patients with SE, 53 patients (40.15%) suffered from RSE. Acute
symptomatic etiology was a risk factor responsible for developing RSE in
the patient (P=0.004). Encephalitis was the most common etiology of acute
symptomatic SE. There was no significant relationship observed between RSE
and the patients’ age, gender, date of initial drug intake and type of seizure. The
mortality rate was 8.3% and a new neurological deficit occurred in 25.7% of
cases. None of RSE with encephalitis returned to the baseline status. Mortality
and morbidity rates were significantly higher in children with RSE than in those
with SE (P=0.006).
Conclusion
Etiology of SE significantly influenced prognosis of it with significant incidence
of RSE in acute symptomatic group. Because acute neurological insult such as
encephalitis and meningitis are common causes of RSE in children, properly
management of them is necessary to avoid permanent brain damage

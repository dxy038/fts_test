This paper presents a scheme to improve the efficiency of radio MAC protocols in the case of bidirectional connections, like TCP connections and multimedia streams. First, the impact of directionality over the contention process is analysed. Then the PiggyData scheme is presented, which decreases the collision rate and overhead of bidirectional traffic over MAC protocols based on CSMA/CA. Finally, the new protocol is simulated in various scenarios to show how it performs

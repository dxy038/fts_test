In this paper a multi-state deterioration system which experiences several states of performance degradation until it fails is studied extensively and condition-based preventive maintenance policies are examined. The optimal maintenance policy aims at maximizing system´s asymptotic availability and at minimizing its total operational cost, with respect to the two different inspection intervals. For the simultaneous optimization of the aforementioned measures, multi-objective optimization methods are employed. In the current work, the inspection times are assumed to be constant, thus the system´s evolution in time is modeled by a semi-Markov process. Finally, the proposed system is compared with the corresponding Markov one which is the most commonly used approximation of the original system in practice.

The primary objective of load balancing is to minimize the job execution time and maximize resource utilization. The load balancing algorithms for parallel computing system must adhere to three inherent policies; viz. information policy, transfer policy and placement policy. To better utilize the system resources this work proposes a load balancing strategy with information exchange policy based on random walk of packets for system with decentralized nature. Information is exchanged via random packets so that each node in a system has up-to-date states of the others nodes.

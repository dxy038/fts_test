The present study simulates a two-stage silica gel + water adsorption desalination (AD) and chiller system. The adsorber system thermally compresses the low pressure steam generated in the evaporator to the condenser pressure in two stages. Unlike a standalone adsorption chiller unit which operates in a closed cycle the present system is an open cycle wherein the condensed desalinated water is not fed back to the evaporator. The mathematical relations formulated in the current study are based on conservation of mass and energy along with isotherm relation and kinetics for RD-type silica gel + water pair. Various constitutive relations for each component namely the evaporator, adsorber and condenser are integrated in the model. The dynamics of heat exchanger are modeled using LMTD method, and LDF model is used to predict the dynamic characteristic of the adsorber bed. The system performance indicators namely, specific cooling capacity (SCC), specific daily water production (SDWP) and coefficient of performance (COP) are used as objective functions to optimize the system. The novelty of the present work is in introduction of inter-stage pressure as a new parameter for optimizing the two-stage operation of AD chiller system.

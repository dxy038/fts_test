The objective of this work was to analyze the physicochemical quality of single producer and blended cachaças from small-scale producers in the south of the state of Minas Gerais (Brazil) and to advise them concerning possible contamination in their products. Samples from 16 producers were sent to the Laboratory for Physicochemical Analyses of Sugar Cane Spirits of the DQI/UFLA, where they were analyzed according to the Federal Decree of the Ministério de Agricultura, Pecuلria and Abastecimento (MAPA of September 4, 1997). The blend of sugar cane spirits presented values within the standards required for consumption; however, when producers were analyzed singly, 43.75% were below the quality standards relative to a particular parameter being analyzed.

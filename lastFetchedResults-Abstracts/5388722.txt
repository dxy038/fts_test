The main objective of the paper is to replace conventional interface and interconnectivity with Amanda (Advanced Maryland Automated Network Disk Archiver) with that of SQLiteÂ´s. Its objective is to design and develop a tool that is user friendly, portable and can be easily used by any technical and non-technical user. The system being developed will create an interface between SQLite and Amanda. This will allow the user to use SQLite instead of conventional database to back-up his data. In the first module, SQLite is used to back-up the data present on each individual host in the network. Then Amanda is used to take (incremental or full) backup of the data present on all the hosts. Further in the next module would be uploading the backed up data with cloud interconnectivity.

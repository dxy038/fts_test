Email campaign effectiveness is a real challenge for the web industry. According to the literature, privacy concerns, trust and attitude toward a company web site influence consumers' intentions to return to a web site (Chelappa and Pavlou, 2002; Belanger et al., 2002; Eastlick et al., 2006). The objective of this paper is to investigate whether those variables spill over to the email campaign response process. The research framework is an opt-in marketing campaign, with email planned as a loyalty-generating tool and based on a quantitative survey on 330 shoppers of a web retailer. The study results indicated a positive effect of intention to return to the web site on attitudes toward the email campaign; however, consumers' attitude toward a web site had no influence on attitude toward the email campaign in this study. Finally, attitude toward the email campaign had a positive influence on the response process.

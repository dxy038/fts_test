In this paper, firstly, the support mechanism of emergency logistics including infrastructure support, unified command and network coordination, law guarantee, contingency plan and emergency transportation channel is analyzed. Secondly, The evaluating indexes are specified by introducing the salvable concept, the salvable degrees of the affected areas which determine the degrees of urgency of relief demands in the corresponding affected areas are evaluated with the extension technique, and then a two-objective optimization model with the goals of maximizing the time-varying fill rate of relief demand of the affected areas and minimizing the time-varying time length of relief distribution is developed in order to distribute relief to the identified affected area sets. Finally, a numerical example illustrates our conclusion.

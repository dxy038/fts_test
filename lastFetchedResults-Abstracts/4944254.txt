Most of the people around the world face the problems related to health especially due to the food intake and disorders in the digestive system. Nowadays endoscope procedure is followed to investigate the problems in the digestive system disorders, which is a tedious, expensive and invasive method. A non-invasive, cheap and painless method called electrogastrogram (EGG) has been devised for the detection of electrical signal cutaneously from the stomach and it is an initial mode of investigation for gastric disorders before encouraging the endoscope procedure for uncomplicated Gastric disease and benign (non cancer). The main objective of this paper is to propose a simple method of finding the digestive systempsilas disorders more easily and accurately using virtual instrumentation (VI) based EGG. The recording setup or the model explained in this proposed system helped us to record the EGG for more than hundred patients, nearly 70-75% of the patient results in digestive systempsilas disorder such as dyspepsia (D), stomach ulcer (SU), gastric esophagus reflux disease (GERD), nausea (N), cyclic vomiting syndrome, etc. For the above said digestive systempsilas disorder dissimilarity is found in its frequency, amplitude, power spectrum analysis and the statistical analysis compared with its normal individual parameter at a high fair amount of accuracy.

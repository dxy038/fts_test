Demosaicking process is generally performed to reconstruct full color images from color filter array samples acquired by digital cameras. Over the past recent years, a large number of demosaicking algorithms have been proposed in the literature. When comparing the performances of different demosaicking algorithms, some existing work might use different experimental settings and test images. The objective of this paper is to show that different experimental settings and test images could affect the comparison results substantially. In particular, a series of experiments have been conducted to examine and demonstrate the effects of three experimental settings-CFA arrangement, image size, and image luminance-on demosaicking performance. It is advocated that for a fair comparison of different demosaicking algorithms, these performance factors should be taken into consideration

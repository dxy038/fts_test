This paper deals mainly with the modelling of induction machine inductances by taking into account all the space harmonics, the introduction of the skewing rotor bars effects and linear rise of MMF across the slot. The model is established initially in the case of symmetric machine, which corresponds to the case of a constant air-gap. Then in other cases where the machine presents a static or dynamic eccentricity, an axial or radial eccentricity. This objective would be achieved by exploiting an extension in 2-D of the modified winding function approach (MWFA). Moreover, the theoretical aspects are presented and the stator current spectra analysis proves the effectiveness of this approach in case of eccentricity

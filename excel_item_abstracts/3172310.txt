A novel particle swarm optimization algorithm for adjusting the gains of a PID controller used for controlling the process of bar rolling is presented. Conventional PID controller can not satisfy static and dynamic performances requirement of continuous rolling system. In order to overcome the shortcomings of conventional PID controller, a new type of PID controller based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is designed. The new PSO-PID controller combines the advantages of conventional PID controller and PSO controller. Computer simulation results show that the performance of the IPSOPID controller is better than that of traditional PID controller.

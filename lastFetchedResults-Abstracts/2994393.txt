Communication requirements and build-out specifications for substation integrated protection, control and data acquisition are in development as a standard, P1525, under sponsorship by the Substations Committee. The work is being performed under task force C2TF4. Electronic ballot of the standard is planned for late 2000. P1525Â´s objective, scope, technical specifications, and interaction with other standards activities are discussed. This standard defines communication requirements, specifies message delivery time between intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and specifies data structures of information to be exchanged for substation-integrated protection, control, and data acquisition

The design and construction of an ultrasonic Doppler transducer with a fixed angle for medical application using a novel acoustic matching material are described. This transducer was constructed using an 8 MHz commercial piezoelectric ceramic (PIC255) and REXOLITE which is an excellent acoustic matching material. The objective of the present work was the design and construction of an ultrasonic transducer using REXOLITE, this transducer will be part of a Doppler blood flow measurement system, the novelty of this transducer is that it includes an internal angle (45&#176;). The resonance frequency is around 5 MHz. The transducer must work with the associated electronics using quadrature demodulation generated for the ultrasonic Doppler blood flow signal.

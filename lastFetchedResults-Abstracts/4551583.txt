In 21st century software engineering domain, reusability plays a vital role. Reusability is an important attribute in object oriented metrics. The objective of reusability is to enhance the quality of the software product, improve productivity and to reduce the cost effort. Object-oriented programming languages like C++ have an exciting features i.e. Templates which provide the reusability component through which we can develop reusable functions and classes. In this paper we have analyzed object oriented metrics as well as the CK metrics suite. Several researchers have studied software reuse but still there remain lacuna in the study of re-usability in software development. This paper clearly points out the necessity of re-usability in software projects and the need for research in this area.

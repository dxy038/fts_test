Oriental sore and tuberculosis are considered the main therapeutic and hygienic problems in developing countries such as Iran. Dispersion rate of these diseases are not equal in Iran. The greatest rate of dispersion of oriental sore in Iran is related to northeast of the country and Khorasan Razavi has been at the sixth level in 2008 with 5447 affected among all provinces. Of all the people affected by oriental sore in Khorasan Razavi, 55.22 percent were found in Mashhad indicating it is considered as a very risky region regarding oriental sore in Khorasan Razavi. Dispersion rate of the disease is not the same across different areas in Mashhad; regions of Abobargh, Shahrak Abozar, Khaje Rabi and Hojat account for 43/35 of all affected by oriental sore. Dispersion of tuberculosis across provinces of Iran is not the same either; Khorasan Razavi is recognized as a risky region regarding this disease as well. The main factors increasing tuberculosis in this province are believed to be proximity with Afghanistan and plenty of Afghan immigrants and their traffic in the province especially in Mashhad, given that Afghanistan is one of the main focuses of tuberculosis in the world. Out of all people who are affected by tuberculosis in Khorasan Razavi in 2008, 1207 of them (i.e. 64.29 percent) were reported in Mashhad.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the rates of recurrent dysplasia with longer follow-up durations and to determine whether margin status and other variables were associated with recurrence. Study Design: A retrospective chart review was performed for all women who underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure at Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, between January 1993 and December 1994. Extracted information included age, parity, indication for the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, histologic classification of the loop electrosurgical excision procedure specimen, margin status, and whether a “deep” (endocervical) pass had been performed. Follow-up data included findings of repeated cytologic examination, colposcopy, and biopsy if performed. Results: The mean duration of follow-up for all women was 24 months. Margins were positive in 28%, with 73% of these being endocervical. The overall recurrent dysplasia rate was 31%, with a mean time to recurrence of 11.9 months. Participants with any positive margins had a higher recurrence rate than did those with negative margins (47% vs 26%; P = .009). High-grade lesions at the margin were more commonly associated with recurrence than were low-grade lesions relative to those with clear margins (high-grade lesion vs negative margins, 55% vs 26%; P = .003; low-grade lesion vs negative margins, 36% vs 26%; P = .34). Recurrence was not associated either with the performance of an endocervical pass or with the histologic diagnosis of the loop electrosurgical excision procedure specimen. Conclusion: With comprehensive long-term follow-up, positive margins on loop electrosurgical excision procedure specimens were shown to be a risk factor for recurrence of cervical dysplasia, particularly when high-grade lesions were seen at the margin. Recurrence was also considerable among women with negative margins. Women should be counseled regarding this risk, and the importance of follow-up should be emphasized.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a fully digital controller for interleaving DC/DC converter. In this paper, a new adaptive control method is proposed to improve the dynamic performance in rapid load current slew rate requirement. This control architecture is according to PID controller with Gain Scheduling architecture and based on pole-zero cancellation method to build the parameters of PID to optimize in transient response. The proposed digital controller is tested on a 12-V input with 1.2-V, 30-A buck converter by FPGA-based and the simulation and experimental results are presented.

Underfill encapsulant is the material used in flip-chip devices that fills the gap between the integrated circuit (IC) chip and the organic board, and encapsulates the solder interconnects. This underfill material can dramatically enhance the reliability of flip-chip devices as compared to nonunderfilled devices. Current underfill encapsulants generally consist of epoxy resin, anhydride hardener, catalyst, silica filler, and other additives to enhance the adhesion, flow, etc. Catalyst determines underfill properties including pot-life, cure speed, and cure temperature. However, long pot-life and fast cure at relatively low temperature (~150&#176;C) are desirable, as such, it requires a room temperature latent catalyst which would be able to catalyze the epoxy curing efficiently at desirable temperature. Currently, the pot-life of commercial underfills at room temperature is normally less than one day. The underfills have to be stored in the freezer at -40&#176;C and in the dry ice for shipping. The objective of this work was to test various catalyst systems that have the potential to enhance the pot-life of the underfill without adversely affecting its curing. The pot-lives of the underfill with various catalysts were obtained from their viscosity versus time relationships, which were established by measuring the viscosities of the underfill with these catalysts periodically using a stress-controlled rheometer. The curing of the underfills was studied using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The pot-life and curing data of the underfill pre-mixed with each of these catalysts are presented in this paper

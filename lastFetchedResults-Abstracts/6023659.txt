The long-term objective of our research is to develop a rapid method for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and other infections caused by mycobacteria, using biosensor technology. The work presented here describes the construction of antibody-based piezoelectric crystals capable of detecting mycobacterial antigens in diluted cultures of attenuated M. tuberculosis, in an immunologically specific manner. The antigens were detected in either a liquid or vapor phase

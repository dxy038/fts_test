Introduction & Objective: Hepatitis C viruses (HCVs), which is an enveloped RNA cense positive, are classified into six major genotypes and multiple subtypes. Infection with this virus has been found to be a major cause of liver disease. Also, HCV infection is quite high among chronic hemodialysis patients. The purpose of the present study was to compare the genotypes of HCV and associated risk factors in hemodialysis patients with positive HCV non uremic patients.
Materials & Methods: Sera sample were taken from population consisted of 113 non uremic patients and uremic ones with HCV who referred to Imam Khomeini nephrology clinic and Sari and Ghaemshahr Dialysis Centers: Case group was consisted of 55 patients with positive HCV hemodialysis disease. The control group consisted of 58 patients suffering from non-uremic positive HCV. Samples were tested with improved Real-Time PCR technique using the appropriate kit.
Results: In this study, the mean age of case group was 44.88±14.6 and for the control group was 46.73±11.9. Considering the sex of participants, 23 (41.8%) were female patients and 32 (58.2%) were in the case group while 13 female (22.4%) and 45 male (77.6%) were in the control group. The most common genotype of HCV in case group was 1a-b (72.7%) and in control group was 3a (50%). Significant differences (p<0.05) were seen in HCV genotypes between two case and control groups. BUN and Cratinin in hemodialysis patients showed observable differences in comparison to control group (p<0.05), while PTT, AST, ACT in control group were higher in compare with hemodialysis patients (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that the hepatitis C virus genotype and its associated risk factors in hemodialysis patients and non uremic patients is different.
Key words: HCV genotype, Nonuremic, Hemodialysis patients, RT- PCR.

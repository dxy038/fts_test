Independent and automatic image processing is
a fundamental objective of the computer vision community.
Understanding the role of the eye movement scanpath in human
vision is an important step toward the achievement of this
objective. This top-down model of higher human vision is a
new approach to bottom-up image processing algorithms and
provides an important new metric and tool in computer vision.
We have demonstrated that a small and manageable collection of
image processing algorithms, experimentally selected and then
combined together can serve in a task such as predicting human
eye fixations identifying geological features. Thus, automatic
picture analysis based upon human vision could be an essential
element in planetary exploration.

This paper describes the implementation of temperature controller based on fuzzy logic intended for industrial application in software and hardware platform. C++ is chosen as the software platform while VHDL is chosen as the hardware platform. The system is built of four major modules called fuzzification, inference, implication and defuzzification. The composition method selected for the fuzzy model is the max-min composition while the Mamdani min operator was chosen as the implication method. Following the successful simulation, verification, analysis and comparison were performed for both implementations. It is shown that both implementations produce similar results in term of functionalities and outputs with the maximum of 1.18% deviations. This shows the algorithm advantage for dual implementations which is the objective of this work.

The current work discusses the results obtained from the screening analysis using a model that dynamically manages supply contract modifications. These changes are related to customer order patterns at the wafer fabrication stage and at a mid-term master planning level. A demand-driven two-stage model is used to depict the operations of a typical silicon foundry, in which the objective is to find the optimal economic production plan based on the existing customer base, demand profile, capacity utilization status, and modification patterns. The first stage finds the initial pre-production optimal distribution plan for manufacturing activities among the existing facilities over the entire planning horizon. In the second stage, the plan attained from the first model is reviewed and tweaked based on changes on demand (i.e. rescheduling or additional requests) or even production capacity. Therefore, new scenario-specific production plans over a shorter planning horizon are created. The aggressive customer due-dates and customer-specific production represents the main process conditions. Several scenarios for a case study are evaluated to assist with the development of the supply contract clauses.

The paper is dealing with present Lifelong Learning in Europe through the current state of ELLEIEC European project (Enhancing Lifelong Learning for the Electrical and Information Engineering Community) [1]. ELLEIEC project is the follow-up of EIE-Surveyor TN which aims at acting both as an observatory and a proposition force for the evolution in the interdisciplinary fields of Electrical and Information Engineering (EIE), of engineering curricula through the implementation of the Bologna process [2]-[3]. The first objective of the ELLEIEC project is to develop a virtual European Centre for Entrepreneurship Education in Electrical and Information Engineering with an internal e-learning assessment offer which will be a reference point for any applicant in the Lifelong Learning framework. The second objective is to study through an experiment and a survey of the mutual recognition process to gather information on good practice in the design of international cooperation at both master and bachelor levels. At the same time, a study will be undertaken across different European countries on how to incorporate the accreditation of prior Lifelong Learning into the PhD process which will allow engineers within a company to move back into education to continue their studies and prepare and validate a doctoral thesis. This benchmark will be used to analyse the recognition systems required to ensure the appropriate credit transfer for prior informal learning.

In this paper, the design objective of the proposed weighted context modeling algorithm aims to minimize the adaptive code length of the context model weighted. The relation between the weights and the model adaptive code length is discussed firstly. In order to search the optimal result, the intelligent searching algorithm is suggested to obtain the weights for the context modeling. Experiment results indicate the proposed algorithm could perform better results than the results by other predecessors.

Five new meroterpenoids, chevalones A–D (1–4), aszonapyrone B (8), and a new sequiterpene alkaloid, eurochevalierine (5), together with four known compounds, sequiterpene (6), terpenoid pyrrolobenzoxazine named CJ-12662 (7), meroterpenoid, aszonapyrone A (9), and ergosterol were isolated from the fungus Eurotium chevalieri. The structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic evidence. The configurations of 1 and 5 were determined by X-ray analysis. The biosynthetic pathway of 1–3, 8, and 9 were proposed. Chemical transformation of aszonapyrone A (9) was also studied. Compounds 4, 5, and 7 exhibited antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, while 3, 5, and 7 showed antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, compounds 2–7 showed cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines.

The accurate electrode positions are required by our cardiac isochrones positioning system. Therefore we developed a KINECT camera based system to localize the electrodes. The KINECT camera was used to take 3D images of the torso of five male subjects with ECG electrodes attached. Our software transformed the 3D quantitative image into a subject specific electrode torso model. These torso models were scaled to obtain an objective standard for electrode misplacement. New KINECT camera computer software automatically and rapidly detected misplacement of 12-lead ECGs electrodes. An increased database is needed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of distances and angles to determine accurately misplaced leads.

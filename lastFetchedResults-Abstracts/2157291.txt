
Background and Objective: Tracheostomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in intensive care unit. Although the implementation of standard care can lead to decrease the postoperative complications, but some factors causes the negative attitude in nurses and consequently lead to implementing the routine and non-standard care. The current study was conducted aimed to determine the level of observing standard tracheostomy care and some barriers from perspective of nurses.
Materials and Method: In this descriptive-analytical study 42 nurses who were working in two selected hospitals in Tehran in 2013 were entered the study through census. Data were gathered through researcher made questionnaire for demographic data, observation checklist for standard tracheopstomy  care and its barriers. The researcher observed 3 times concerning the how to care of tracheostomy by nurses and then nurses completed the demographic and barriers to standard care questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21using one sample T-test, independent T-test, chi-square, ANOVA and Pearsonsâ€™ correlation coefficient.
Results: According to results, only 2 nurses (4.8 percent) performed the standard tracheostomy care. The Most barriers affecting on the standard tracheostomy care were the administrative barriers (54.76 percent). Also, there was a moderate positive correlation between standard care with administrative barriers (r = 0.46, p = 0.002), personal barriers (r = 0.38, p = 0.012) and all of the barriers (r = 0.46, p = 0.002).
Conclusion: Most tracheostomy care are not according to standard protocols and most important barriers of its implementation are administrative barriers. With attention to the importance of this care, some necessary measures must be taken to resolve the barriers.

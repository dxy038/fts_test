Objective: Some saliva substitutes have been shown to demineralize dentine in vitro. This effect is counteracted by the application of various fluorides. In contrast, remineralizing saliva substitutes might be supported by these treatments, depending on the dynamics during remineralization. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of fluoride mouthrinses or gels in combination with de-/remineralizing saliva substitutes on dentinal subsurface lesions. Design: Demineralized bovine dentine specimens were stored either in mineral water [saturation with respect to octacalcium phosphate (SOCP): 0.7], Glandosane (G, SOCP: 0.3) or in a modified saliva substitute Saliva natura (SN, SOCP: 1.9) for five weeks (37 °C). Fluoride agents were applied twice daily for 10 min (n = 15/group): no treatment, Meridol mouthrinse, Elmex sensitive solution, ProSchmelz fluoride gel, Elmex gelée. After storage thin sections were prepared and mineral losses before and after storage were evaluated from microradiographs. Results: Specimens stored in G alone showed significantly higher mineral loss compared to those stored in water, SN or G in combination with any additional treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Storage in SN and treatment with ProSchmelz fluoride gel led to significantly higher remineralization compared to all other groups (p &lt; 0.05) and resulted in distinct mineral gain within the lesion body. Conclusions: Under the in vitro conditions chosen, use of fluoride agents in combination with a demineralizing saliva substitute resulted in reduced mineral loss. Storage in modified Saliva natura in combination with the application of ProSchmelz fluoride gel induced the most pronounced remineralization also of deeper lesion areas.

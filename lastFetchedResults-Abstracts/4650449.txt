Speech recognition is a computer technology that enables a device to recognize and understand spoken words, by using signal processing techniques to extract features for the spoken Arabic speech. A comparative study is performed in two different ways. The first includes two tests. The first test is an objective test where the computer has to recognize the recorded data. The second test is a subjective test where 15 persons judged the recognition process for the tested materials. The second form of comparison is performed for different transmission media, acoustical speech (direct), via telephone (PSTN, PBX), Wireless (cellular), Internet (VoIP). The results of the paper showed that the objective test recognition rates for all the Arabic words in the different testing materials concerning the transmission media are lower than those for direct. The objective test recognition rates are the lowest when the used recognizer (neural network) is trained with the direct transmission medium data. It also showed that the subjective test recognition rates are higher.

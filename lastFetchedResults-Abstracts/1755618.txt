Objective
esent study examined the efficacy of bibliotherapy in assisting individuals experiencing distress related to tinnitus.
s
ndred sixty-two tinnitus sufferers from Australia participated in a study designed to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive–behaviorally based self-help book in reducing distress.

imize the ecological validity of the findings, we excluded no individuals interested in treatment for tinnitus-related distress.
s
perimental condition lost 35% of participants at postassessment, compared to 10% in the control group. In an analysis of participants who completed postintervention assessment, those assigned to the intervention condition, who received a tinnitus self-help book, showed significantly less tinnitus-related distress and general distress 2 months later compared to those assigned to the waiting list control condition. The intervention group's reduction in tinnitus-related distress and general distress from preintervention to postintervention 2 months later was significant, and these participants maintained a significant reduction in distress on follow-up 4 months after they received the tinnitus self-help book. A long-term follow-up of all participants, who at that time had received the book at least a year previously, showed a significant reduction in tinnitus distress. Although these group differences and pre–post changes were significant, effect sizes were small. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant effect for between-groups analyses, but did show a significant effect for the 1-year follow-up pre–post analysis.
sion
ation on the effectiveness of using a self-help book, without therapist assistance, in alleviating distress is important, as bibliotherapy can provide inexpensive treatment that is not bound by time or place.

The commercial offer concerning microkernel technology constitutes an attractive alternative for developing operating systems to suit a wide range of application domains. However, the integration of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microkernels into critical embedded computer systems is a problem for system developers, in particular due to the lack of objective data concerning their behavior in the presence of faults. This paper addresses this issue by describing a prototype environment, called MAFALDA (Microkernel Assessment by Fault injection AnaLysis and Design Aid), that is aimed at providing objective failure data on a candidate microkernel and also improving its error detection capabilities. The paper first presents the overall architecture of MAFALDA. Then, a case study carried out on an instance of the Chorus microkemel is used to illustrate the benefits that can be obtained with MAFALDA both from the dependability assessment and design-aid viewpoints. Implementation issues are also addressed that account for the specific API of the target microkemel. Some overall insights and lessons learned, gained during the various studies conducted on both Chorus and another target microkemel (LynxOS), are then depicted and discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper by summarizing the main features of the work presented and by identifying future research

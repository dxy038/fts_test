Islamic Gnosticism, due to its purpose and goal, is a notion focused on recognition, awareness and intuition. In general, it is a process toward superego to achieve evident hierophanic knowledge of epiphanic phenomena. This provides an active and appropriate background to review the cognitive events from phenomenological perspectives.
This study, thus, is going to deal with some aspects of this fact that are ‘intentionality, ‘reduction’ and the relationship between objective and subjective aspects which are considered as ‘union’ and ‘separation’ in Ruzbah?n's Gnosticism. 
The attempt is to pinpoint the potentials of Islamic Gnosticism, especially cognitive role of Gnostic epiphany in accordance with Ruzbah?n's standpoints. Finally, on the basis of philosophy and Gnosticism, new conclusions and findings are derived.

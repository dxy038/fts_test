
Background and Objective: Ghrelin and leptin are two hormones involved in the regulation of energy balance and obesity. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a course of aerobic training on serum levels of ghrelin and leptin in the middle-aged men. Materials and 

Materials and Methods: Twenty middle-aged volunteered males were randomly divided into experimental (n=10) and control (n=10) groups. Aerobic training protocol consisted of 3 sessions per week for 10 weeks. Each training session was a slow running trial with intensity of 65 to 75 percent of maximal heart rate for a period of 10 minutes. To follow the principle of overload, half-a-minute was added to each session, so that, at the last session the running time reached to 25 minutes. Before and after the training period, blood sampling was performed. Data were analyzed using independent t-test. 

Results: There was no significant difference in serum levels of ghrelin and leptin between control and experimental groups (p < 0.05). However, aerobic training significantly reduced body mass index, body weight, waist to hip ratio, and body fat percent and significantly increased the lean body weight and maximum oxygen uptake. 

Conclusion: It can be deduced that 10-week aerobic training has no beneficial effect on serum levels of ghrelin and leptin in the middle-aged men. However, to achieve more conclusive results, further investigation is warranted.

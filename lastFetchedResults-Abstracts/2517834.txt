Background: Lichens are symbiotic organisms between a mycobiont (fungus) and a phycobiont (Photoautotrophic green algae and/or cyanobacteria). The biological property of some lichen compounds against viruses, bacteria, parasites and their antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities are known.
Objective: This study was tested the effect of Xanthoparmelia lineola thallus extract on wound healing process in rabbit's skin.
Methods: The species X. lineola was collected from Zirab area in Mazandaran province. Then thin layer chromatography was carried. The methanol extract prepared by soxhlet. After wound excision, rabbits were randomly placed into four groups: control group, treated group with alpha ointment, treated group with 5 percent ointment of methanolic extract of X. lineola, and treated group with 10 percent ointment of the extract X. lineola. Then the treatment was continued until complete healing. For histopathological examination, tissue samples were obtained 20 days after surgery from improved tissue.
Results: In the extract (eg. methanol extract of X. lineola) -treated wounds, the wound area was considerably reduced in comparison with the control. The presence of usnic acid, protocetraric acid and salazinic acid compounds were proved.
Conclusion: Methanol extract of X. lineola acetates the wound healing process due to the presence of anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activities. It reduces the recovery time.

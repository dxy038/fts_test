Objective: Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes has been associated with infection, cigarette smoking, and bleeding. Hypochlorous acid (a reactive oxygen species) is central to the body’s response to infection, yet it may damage surrounding tissue while destroying pathogens. We examined in vitro the tissue-damaging actions of hypochlorous acid on the amnion-chorion and the protective role provided by pretreatment with vitamins C and E. Study Design: Amnion-chorion samples were obtained from 4 term pregnancies, cut into segments, and divided into 6 exposure groups. Half were treated in advance with vitamins C and E (Trolox C) and half were treated with buffer solution alone. After rinsing, amnion-chorion samples were exposed to hypochlorous acid at 1 or 10 mmol/L for 4 hours. Histologic and immunocytochemical evaluations were conducted with antibodies for collagen I and IV. Results: Extensive damage to amniotic epithelium and collagen I but not collagen IV resulted from hypochlorous acid exposure and was dose related. Pretreatment with vitamins C and E prevented this damage in all cases. Conclusion: Hypochlorous acid damages the amniotic epithelium and collagen I in the amnion-chorion. The protection against hypochlorous acid–induced damage provided by antioxidant therapy (vitamins C and E) is of therapeutic significance. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:979-85.)

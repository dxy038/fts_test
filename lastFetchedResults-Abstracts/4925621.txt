This paper introduces a new approach of a radio frequency (RF)-wireless fluid level detection system. The relative geometrical variation of the floating tag inside an automobile fluid container is identified. Significant fuel consumption of automobiles will be reduced by the substitution of RF-links as well as the complexity of engine carrier. To achieve the objective of this research, a sender circuit with dipole antenna and two passive ultrahigh frequency UHF)-tags with identical electrical rates are used. Considering the feasibility in automobile engine carriers, the sender circuit parameters and prototype model of automobile fluid level detection system are designed.

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity motion estimation algorithm for frame rate conversion. Insteading of using sum of absolute difference (SAD) calculation, the algorithm adaptively uses simple comparison operation in different hierarchical motion estimation level to achieve good image quality and fast processing capability. Experiments are carried out on applying this algorithm for frame rate conversion and subjective and objective comparison results demonstrate the proposed algorithm is a good candidate for estimating the motion in complex frame rate up-conversion module.

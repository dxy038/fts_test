Transportation plays a key role in economic, production and service provider systems and has a high effect in GNP scale of each country. Therefore, researchers try to omit the unnecessary paths in order to minimize the traversed links in the network. On the other hand, distribution is an important issue in production industry because it has been estimated that 20 percent of final price is spent on transportation. Improving the distribution system of each company leads the higher productivity. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) tries to improve the distribution system. In this paper, demand of customer is considered as a fuzzy variable and transportation time between nodes is also assumed to have a probability distribution. Due to the complexity of the model, a new multi-objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) is developed for obtaining Pareto optimal solutions. The performance of the proposed solution algorithm is compared with that of two well-known meta-heuristics, namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and Pareto archive evolution strategy (PAES). Computational results show that MOICA outperforms the other meta-heuristics.

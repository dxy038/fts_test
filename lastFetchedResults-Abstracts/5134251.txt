MPAQM algorithm is able to adapt to the varying network environment and improve the robustness by moving horizon optimization, and handling network constraints in the process of obtaining the drop probability. Based on MPAQM scheme proposed previously, the predictive model is improved to reduce the order of optimization problem in this paper. Considering the causality of time-delay system, the predicted output is defined, and the future queue length in data buffer, which is the basis of optimizing drop probability, is predicted. Furthermore, the optimal control objective and the system constraints are derived correspondingly. The simulation results show that MPAQM algorithm outperforms RED and PI algorithms in terms of stability, disturbance rejection, and robustness.

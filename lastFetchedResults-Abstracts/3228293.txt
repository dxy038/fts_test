Institutions of higher education serve to enhance the system of student assessment by paying attention to the students´ achievement in order to produce competitive and quality students in the face of global competition. As a part of quality improvement, standard setting for students´ examination scoring should be established in the institutions. This paper will explore the Objective Standard Setting (OSS) using Rasch measurement model which was developed by Wright and Grosse in early 1990s. This method deal with the constructed-response items using Rasch-based approach in the quantification of the judges´ ratings. A case study of Design Project course (KKKM4955) in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia resulted that the OSS using the Rasch measurement model facilitates the determination of cut score for passing mark.

The objective of this research is to propose a new location registration procedure for System Architecture Evolution (SAE) which is the core network architecture of 3GPPÂ´s future Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless communication standard. Under the proposed procedure, the authentication between access systems supporting different IP versions is carried out. A signaling message for a new location registration procedure is developed to evaluate the performance of the signaling procedure. The numerical results showed that the proposed procedure reduces the registration costs and latency for location registration. Therefore, this procedure results in significant performance improvements for SAE.

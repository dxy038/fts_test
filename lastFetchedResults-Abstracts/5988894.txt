Selected algorithms and application problems connected with identification methods for glass strength behavior are reported. Contactless objective image processing procedures for smart metrical measurements of break cones within glass probes are described. Technologies for the modeling of mechanical edges by optical images and for statistical edge detection with pixel resolution are presented. Special emphasis is given to the explanation of differences between static and dynamic edge detections, as well as differences between measurements with pixel and subpixel resolutions

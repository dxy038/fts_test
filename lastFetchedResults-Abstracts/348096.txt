Objective: To determine if aging is associated with differences in attentional regulation using behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures.
Methods: Younger (n=13;M=20 years) and older (n=12;M=76 years) subjects performed an auditory cued attention task. Verbal cues correctly (valid) or incorrectly (invalid) predicted the ear receiving a target tone 1.5 s later, or were uninformative (neutral). Targets were either ‘high’ (2000 Hz) or ‘low’ (1000 Hz) pitch monaural tones. Subjects pressed one of 4 buttons to indicate target ear and pitch. ERPs following cues and targets (P50, N100, P200, slow waves), and negative slow potentials (CNV) between cues and targets were assessed.
Results: Cue information had significant effects on reaction time for both groups (valid<neutral<invalid). Target N100 amplitude was significantly affected by cueing in younger (invalid>valid) but not older subjects. Target slow waves were also affected by cue information (invalid>valid), and the difference was larger and lasted longer in older subjects. Slow waves following cues were significantly larger in older subjects, but the subsequent CNV amplitudes were comparable among groups.
Conclusions: When performing a cued attention task, age differences are present in transient ERPs following cues and targets.
Significance: Age differences in ERPs associated with attentional regulation support the hypothesis that attentional changes contribute to cognitive aging.

This paper studies body-conducted speech for noise robust speech processing purposes. As body-conducted speech is typically limited in bandwidth, signal processing is required to obtain a signal that is both high in quality and low in noise. We propose an algorithm that first equalizes the body-conducted speech using filters obtained from a pre-defined filter set and subsequently fuses this equalized signal with a noisy conventional microphone signal using an optimal clean speech amplitude and phase estimator. We evaluated the proposed equalization and fusion technique using a combination of a conventional close-talk and a throat microphone. Subjective listening tests show that the proposed method successfully fuses the speech quality of the conventional signal and the noise robustness of the throat microphone signal. The listening tests also indicate that the inclusion of the body-conducted signal can improve single-channel speech enhancement methods, while a calculated set of objective signal quality measures confirm these observations.

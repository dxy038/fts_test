Shape optimization of a submarine for minimized noise emission has been the objective of this work. Boundary element method and finite element methods have been employed to determine the acoustic field around the object. A combined neural network and genetic algorithm scheme is developed to find the optimum external geometric ratios of the submarine for a minimized emitted acoustic energy in certain reference points. The obtained optimum geometric values stay in normal range for minimum hydrodynamic forces and show a close agreement with the trend of change for models coming to operation.

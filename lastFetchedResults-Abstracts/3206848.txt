Several radio technologies such as IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth operating in the 2.4 GHz license-free ISM frequency band when present in the same environment leads to signal interference and result in performance degradation. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of mutual interference on the performance of IEEE 802.11n system in presence of bluetooth devices. We develop a simulation framework for modeling interference based on detailed MAC and PHY models. First we studied a simple wireless simulation scenario and then moved to more complex scenarios involving multiple Bluetooth nodes and WLAN devices based on the practical implementation. These helped us to highlight the effects on Transfer data rate, Average delay, Packet drop ratio and eventually on Throughput.

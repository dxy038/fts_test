This paper studies a novel constrained decentralized shaping control problem for nonlinear large-scale interconnected distribution systems. Such systems are generated by multiple output probability density functions (PDFs) and exist in complex non-Gaussian stochastic processes. The B-spline expansion and decentralized PI controller are designed to fulfill the modeling and control tasks for large-scale distribution systems with interconnected time-delay terms. Multi-objective control requirements, including stability, robustness, tracking performance and state constraint, can be achieved simultaneously by the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm can also reduce the complexity of the control coefficient matrices caused by large-scale interconnected systems. Finally, computer simulations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

A pole placement technique for power system stabilizer (PSS) and thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) based stabilizer using simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is presented in this paper. The proposed approach employs SA optimization technique to PSS (SAPSS) and TCSC-based stabilizer (SACSC) design. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem where SA is applied to search for the optimal setting of the proposed SAPSS and SACSC parameters. A pole placement-based objective function to shift the dominant eigenvalues to the left in the s-plane is considered. The proposed SAPSS and SACSC have been examined on a weakly connected power system with different disturbances, loading conditions, and system parameter variations. Eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear simulation results show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed stabilizers and their ability to provide efficient damping of low frequency oscillations. In addition, the performance of the proposed stabilizers outperforms that of the conventional power system stabilizer (CPSS). It is also observed that the proposed SACSC improves greatly the voltage profile of the system under severe disturbances.

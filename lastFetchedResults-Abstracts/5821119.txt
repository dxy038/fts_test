For the problem of 1553B bus system testability modeling which has the character of bidirectional information transmission, to put forward a method of testability modeling for 1553B bus system based on multi-signal flow graph. On the basis of analyzing the bus topology, information transmission mechanism and fault mode of 1553B bus, to construct the multi-signal flow graph model of 1553B bus system by modeling of bi-redundancy bus structure, multi-dimension function attribute definition, multi-work mode and test item definition. Finally, by analyzing of an example, it proved the effectiveness of this 1553B multi-signal flow graph constructed in this paper.

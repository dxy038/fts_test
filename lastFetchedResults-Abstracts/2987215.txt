We present a control scheme for high-speed vibration-free positioning of a system consisting of a rigid manipulator mounted on a flexible base. The objective is to move the end-point of this macro-micro manipulator system rapidly by proper motion of the micro-manipulator and without inducing structural vibrations when the joints of the flexible macro-manipulator are locked. It is shown by an example that the system is in general non-minimum phase. A control strategy is developed for rapid positioning of the end-effector of the micro-manipulator that will achieve the above goal. Simulation results are presented for a two-link manipulator mounted on a flexible boom

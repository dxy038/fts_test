Hybrid wireless network (HWN) composed with cellular wireless network and ad hoc network represents the trend of the next generation wireless network. The research of agent-get Problem in hybrid wireless network has the important instruction significance to the network planning and designation. This paper proposes a model to analyze the agent-get problem, introduces an objective function named agent-got probability, and deduces the analytical expression of agent-got probability under one-hop condition for the first time. The simulation results indicate that the analysis expression can accurately describe agent-get problem in HWN.

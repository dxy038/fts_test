According to the various mobility, the resource allocation, interference, and the characteristics of heterogeneity and ubiquity of access network based on the next generation network, namely, the network IMS (IP Multimedia subsystem), have imposed several challenges. In regard to mobility management, handover management, and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning, this paper proposes an adaptive environment based on IMS, between the heterogeneous access technologies, like WiMAX, WLAN, UMTS and LTE/LTE Advanced interfaces. Nevertheless, especially, the problem of handover decision, as resolving it influence, mainly on the handover performance; ANN(Artificial Neural Network) is proposed to solve the problem of decision and selection of best network access based IMS. The objective of proposed approach algorithms, is to maximize handover performance and reliability, with a new generic mobility management architecture, for system resource utilization by reducing handover latency and achieving load balance between different heterogeneous cells and networks.

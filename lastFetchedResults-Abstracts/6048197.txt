The fundamental equations characterizing the full-bridge zero-voltage-switched (ZVS) DC-DC power converter are utilized in a nonlinear design optimization routine. The design is subject to realistic constraints along with an objective function of minimal total volume and/or maximum efficiency. The routine is used to study the effects of switching frequency, leakage inductance and load range for ZVS on the efficiency and size. Maximum efficiency is shown to occur when ZVS is maintained in the immediate vicinity of full load operation. Experimental measurements confirm computed predictions

For manufacturing industries, the coordination of demand and price decisions with other aspects of the supply chain such as production and distribution is not only useful, but is essential. The coordination of these decisions mean an approach that optimizes the system rather than individual elements, improving both the efficiency of the supply chain and of the firm. In this paper, we present a multi-objective inventory model  so that  with Maximizing of retailer's profit and the service level with stochastic lead-time, selling price, lot size and reorder point are determined. problem for uniform and exponential lead time are studied. Since pricing is important and influence demand, the demand is considered as a general function of price. Concerning the properties of non-linear model, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal solutions. Finally, numerical examples with sensitivity analysis of key parameters are presented to illustrate the model.

Background and Objective: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear is One of the most common injuries at knee joint. Threshold of motion sense included inputs that are received by mechanical receptors at dynamic position. The objection of present study was to find the effect of functional brace on the Kinesthesia motion sense in patients with ACL rupture.
Materials and Methods: In this Quasi- experimental study, 20 patients with ACL tear, with aging range between 18 to 44 years old were recruited. Patients were selected in a simple non probability sampling manner. Using Continuous passive motion for testing the Kinesthesia motion sense, as a dependent variable. Data was analyzed with Paired t-test and
Colmogrof-Smirnof tests.
Results: Threshold of motion sense at affected knee before and after bracing was 3.93±1.67, 4.45±1.86 in open eyes and 3.82±1.61, 4.13±1.96 in closed eyes (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that the functional brace did not play in important role in the improvement of threshold of motion sense in patients with ACL tear.

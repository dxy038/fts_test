Coal mine water inrush is a very difficult problems which should be solved more earlier, and it have long plagued safe production of coal mines. The reliable operation of coal mine drainage systems plays a vital role in safe production of coal mines. Based on the non linear relationship of the state parameters of the coal mine drainage facilities, we propose a safety monitoring method based on BP neural network in this paper. This method can get the results of monitoring quickly and accurately, and provide Scientific decision-making information for Coal Mine Safety management in order to avoid accidents. Through the validation of examples, the method is objective, validity and accuracy. It can provide a more scientific and reliable theoretical basis for the monitoring and warning of the coal mine drainage facilities.

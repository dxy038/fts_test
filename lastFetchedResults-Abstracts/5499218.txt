The joint French-Swedish SAR experiment RAMCAR98 was carried out in two predominantly forested regions of France. The test site in Les Landes is very flat, whereas the area of Loze`re exhibits a variability in the terrain topography of hundreds of metres. Good ground truth data are available for both areas. A comprehensive data set has successfully been co-registered at VHF-, L-, and X-band, consisting of fully polarimetric radar scenes for the two microwave bands as well as single-polarized interferometric acquisitions at X-band (single-pass) and VHF-band (repeat-pass). The main objective with the campaign was to investigate the use of radar imaging techniques in heavily foliated geographies and address application issues such as retrieval of the woody biomass, generation of digital elevation maps, and detection of man-made targets located in deep hide

In this paper, a new algorithm is designed to solve time-cost tradeoff problem. Conventional algorithm is to reduce length of longer paths in activity network first, and then reduce shorter ones step by step. The contrary idea is adopted in the paper, firstly, the activity network is simplified equivalently by using theory of network planning technology and float, and paths which should be considered in network are found out, which could realize effect of simplifying objective and reducing quantity of computation, secondly, the shortest paths of these paths are reduced, and then longer ones are reduced step by step until all length of longer paths are reduced to appointed length, viz. the total duration, and finally, circs of whether reducing is excessive is judged by checking whether float of activities with reduced duration are zero, and method of modification is designed, which could help to give reasonable scheme and result of solving the problem.

<div><div><div><p>Pituitary gland metastasis was seen in elderly patients, and the incidence of pituitary metastasis is 1% to 4% of all cancer patients. Renal cell carcinoma is a primary malignancy in only 2.6% of pituitary metastases. We reported a 50-year-old man with pituitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma that had signs of diabetes insipidus. He had multiple lesions in both lungs, and bone scan involved L12 and L1 vertebrates. He was treated with combination bevacizumab 600 mg/month and sunitinib 50 mg/D for four weeks with two weeks rest for 6 months. Treatment with targeted drugs without surgery of pituitary or radiotherapy improved metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the patient.</p></div></div></div>

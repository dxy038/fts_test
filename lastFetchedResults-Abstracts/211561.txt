Tuberculosis is an infectious disease. The pulmonary form of the disease is the most common type. Cutaneous tuberculosis is an extrapulmonary type of the disease which has been increasing during the last decade.
This retrospective study was conducted on a group of patients with cutaneous tuberculosis who were treated in Zahedan health centers. The medical records of the patients with tuberculosis were reviewed and the patients with cutaneous tuberculosis were selected and analyzed.
In this study, 1,740 patients were evaluated. Of these, 400 patients had extrapulmonary tuberculosis of whom 24 (6%) had cutaneous tuberculosis which had been treated. The disease was observed mostly among people aged 20 - 29 years. The disease was more common in females than males. The youngest patient was 5 years old and the oldest one was 48 years. The disease was more observed in patients with a history of BCG vaccination and was more frequent in Iranians than Afghans. All patients had the lupus vulgaris type and just one patient developed lupus vulgaris after BCG vaccination.
The incidence of cutaneous tuberculosis is higher in Zahedan than in other parts of Iran. In keeping with previous reports, the most common type of the disease was lupus vulgaris. To control and manage chronic cutaneous tuberculosis, it must be more carefully studied.

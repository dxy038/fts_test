BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Convulsions are the most important symptom of generalized epileptic attacks, a neurological disorder in which many people of different societies are suffering from it. Because of the side effects and toxicity of the synthetic drugs, nowadays herbal medicines are used in the treatment of convulsions. This study was performed to survey the anticonvulsion effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Matricaria chamomilla on nicotine induced convulsions in mice.
METHODS: In dose-response study, different doses of the extracts (500, 600, 800 and 1000mg/kg) were injected to test groups (each group 8 animals) intraperitoneally, and control group received normal saline (lm1/100g IP). After 30 minutes, nicotine (5 mg/kg) was given to all groups (IP) and the time for onset, duration and intensity of the convulsions were recorded. In time-response study, the most effective dose of extract (1000 mg/kg) and normal saline were administered 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes before nicotine injection, respectively and time for onset, duration and intensity of convulsions were recorded.
FINDINGS: Results of dose-response showed that 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg of extracts increasing time for onset and decrease duration of convulsions. The results of time-response showed that, the time of onset, duration and intensity of convulsions, increased, decreased and decreased for 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Results obtained from this study showed hydroalcoholic extracts of Matricaria chamomilla has anticonvulsions effect. In order to know the mechanism of action of extracts, it needs more study on different animal models.

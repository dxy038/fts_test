Background and Objective: There is ample evidence that prevalence of both communicable and no communicable diseases due to consumption of red meat and its processed products, e.g., sausages, is on the increase. Considering this, and concern about undesirable effects of adding preservatives to red meat products, prompted us to explore the feasibility of producing non-meat sausage without addition of preservatives.
Materials and Methods: The fixed components of the sausage to be produced were isolatedsoy protein, gluten, soybean oil, ice, water, salt and spices.Using the full actorial design method, 8 formulations were developed, each one of the 3 variable components(modified corn starch, carrageen an and egg white powder) being added to the fixed componentsattwolevels. To judge the quality of the processed products, sensory evaluation was performed on taste, odor, and texture, slicing ability and overall acceptability by the hedonic (scale 1-9) test. In addition,the ability of the model was assessed by lack of fittest, correlation coefficient(R2)androot meansquare error (RMSE). Also ANOVA was performed to determine the independent effect of each one of the variables andtheir interactions (a p < 0.05was used for statistical significance).
Results: The independent effect of each variable (modified corn starch, carrageen an and egg white) on each response shows that the overall evaluation model (p=0.0001; lack of fit=0.1220; r=0.83, the highest correlation)is the best model for predicting the optimum formulation. Further analysis of the data showed that, in addition to the independent effect of each of the the 3 variable components, their interactions also affect overall assessment significantly.
Conclusion: Based on the equation obtained for overall assessment, it can be concluded that real levels of 0.5, 3 and 3 are best for carrageen an, modified corn starch and egg white, respectively.

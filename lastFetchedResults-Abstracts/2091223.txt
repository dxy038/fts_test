Background: Considering the importance of Trazodone as a serotonin antagonist reuptake inhibitor in treating nervous diseases, its side effects on the endocrine axis are extremely important. Objective: In this research the effect of Trazodone on the concentration of testosterone, FSH and LH levels and spermatogenesis were studied.  Materials and Methods: 40 male wistar rats were divided to 5 groups of 8. The control group received no treatment and the sham group was given distilled water as a solvent. The experimental groups were administrated 30, 60 and 90 mg/kg of the drug orally for 28 days. Blood serum samples were taken at 29
th
 day and concentrations of testosterone, FSH and LH were measured by RIA method. In addition, the testes were separated at the 29th day and histological changes were studied among experimental, control and sham groups. The results were evaluated by ANOVA using SPSS software. Results: The results showed that 90mg/kg of Trazodone reduced serum testosterone level while it increased FSH 
and LH levels ( 
0 / 05p ?
). Histological investigation of the testes showed a decline on spermatogenesis chain in 90 mg/kg dose. Conclusion: According to our findings, Trazodone decreases the concentration of testosterone level and the number of spermatogenic cells and increases FSH and LH levels at high doses. Also, it can probably weaken the function of reproduction activity.

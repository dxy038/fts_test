Objective
Compare evaporation techniques in the work-up procedure of saliva samples for cortisol analysis by a previously validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method.
Design and methods
Samples were evaporated using freeze drying, centrifugal concentration, and nitrogen flow and analyzed by LC–MS/MS.
Results
Cortisol concentrations detected using each technique did not significantly differ. Factors other than the recovery of cortisol were evaluated.
Conclusions
Evaporation using freeze drying/centrifugal concentration is an automated process, reducing overall processing time for analysis of numerous samples.

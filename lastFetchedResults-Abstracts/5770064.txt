The CECÂ´s TELEMAN programme has the objective to develop advanced teleoperators (robots) that can operate in hazardous or disordered nuclear environments. The programme consists of 16 projects, one of which is ENTOREL (ENvironmental TOlerance, RELiability and safety). The function and reliability of a robot will be affected by environmental factors such as dust, water, vibrations, heat, and ionizing radiation. In order to assess the influence of these factors, ENTOREL will provide data as well as models for the calculation of the environmental tolerance and reliability of the machine as a function of time and exposure

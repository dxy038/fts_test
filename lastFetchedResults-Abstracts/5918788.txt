The authors consider the problem of nonpreemptive scheduling of <e1>w</e1> independent tasks on an <e1>n</e1> processor partitionable hypercube system. Each task can be executed on a subcube of any dimension, with a smaller execution time on larger subcubes. The schedule must determine the subcube to be allocated to each task, with the objective of minimizing the overall finishing time. The authors present a polynomial time approximation algorithm which generates a schedule whose finishing time is within twice that of the optimal schedule

A method for concurrent clearing of energy and reserve market is presented in this paper. The proposed method considers two important objectives in an optimization problem; the first one is including the stochastic nature of power generation variations by applying a probabilistic clearing model and Monte-Carlo simulation; the second one is assignment of energy and reserve capacities to generating units with consideration of economic and reliability criterions. In the objective function of the considered problem, in addition to the offered costs for energy and reserve, the costs of non-delivered energy and non-delivered reserve are included. Solution results of the optimization problem can be applied as a guidance to provide incentives for generating companies to improve their reliability and have higher share in the market. The proposed method is validated through its application to a test system.

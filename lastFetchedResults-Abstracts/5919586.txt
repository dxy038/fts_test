MoDSE is a workshop dedicated to model driven engineering for software evolution. It is nowadays commonly admitted that software evolution represents and becomes a crucial research area and challenge. It is the scope of several academic and industrial research works. One of the most promising explored ways is model-driven approach. Last year, the first edition of the MoDSE workshop was dedicated to explore how can model-driven engineering enforce and enhance software evolution. According to the great raised interest, a second edition is organised, as a continuation of the first one. The objective is to present model-driven evolution research and practical. The main motivations are to present research and industrial activities about, or against, the use of MDE to manage and direct software evolution through innovative proposals, leading to an interesting debate and opening several research and applications ideas.

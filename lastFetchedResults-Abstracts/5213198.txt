Good Governance is an important objective for improving responsible management of public resources. Also the formulation of policies for e-government research requires complying with Good Governance. To ensure that the principles of Good Governance are met in strategic planning of e-government research, stakeholder involvement in the formulation and scoping of future research fields is crucial. Stakeholder involvement and participation encompass political, social and societal engagement. In this paper, we first examine in how far stakeholders can be and are already involved in policy-oriented science and technology roadmapping. We then propose a concept for open collaboration to facilitate online stakeholder engagement in strategic planning of e-government research.

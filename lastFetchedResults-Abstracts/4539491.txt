The educational ontology we presented in this paper is used to model web-based e-learning systems for higher education. Our main objective was to create domain ontology to play an important role in representing higher education concepts and to assist specialized e-learning systems. We have stressed the need for developing educational models that meet the expectations of higher education community with regards to e-learning adaptation and efficiency by employing ontologies and Semantic Web techniques.

Low back pain reduces the physical and social activities as well as the joy of life. The objective of this study was to assess the importance of the muscle endurance and anthropometry as risk factors in chronic low back pain as well as the necessity for the continuation of the treatment period. Pain, disability, muscle endurance of trunk flexors and extensors, lower limbs extensors and somatotype of all subjects were measured. All the measurements on patients were repeated after a three-month exercise therapy. Results showed that pain and disability decreased after the treatment by 58% and 53% . On average, muscle endurance of patients was 62% lower than that of the normal group. Anthropometry and somatotype of both groups were similar_ After the treatment, the muscle endurance of trunk flexors did not improve, while the endurance in extensors significantly improved by 51% (p=0.01).
The muscle endurance in low back pain patients were affected. The applied exercise therapy reduced significantly the pain and disability, and increased the muscle endurance in extensors. The abnormal flexor's endurance is a risk factor for repetitive LBP.

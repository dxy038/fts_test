Partially connected heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (hWSNs) can be reconfigured via the utilization of mobile agents that aim in reconnecting the disconnected clusters of nodes. Under the assumption of the knowledge of the nodespsila spatial location and the transmitting power of their uniform radiation pattern, the presented algorithm aims at optimizing the positioning of a limited number of mobile agent for the establishment of the connectivity among the disjoint clusters of nodes. The developed algorithms maximize their corresponding objective functions, whose primary terms are related to (a) the cardinality of each cluster of nodes and (b) the minimum distance between the clusters. The extended simulation results are offered to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions.

The objective of this work was to develop a numerical simulation method to study the heat transfer process and inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during gas grilling of non-intact beef steaks (NIBS). A finite difference and optimization algorithm was developed to determine the effective heat transfer parameters during grilling. After validation, these parameters were used in a finite element method to simulate the temperature profiles at various locations of NIBS (2.54 cm in thickness). The computer simulation results showed that E. coli O157:H7 may survive the heating processes if normal grilling conditions for intact beef steaks were used. Computer simulation results also suggested that E. coli O157:H7 might be effectively inactivated if NIBS (2.54 cm) were evenly flipped (every 4 min) and cooked for 16 min during cooking. The result of this study may help the food service industry to develop more adequate grilling methods and conditions to cook NIBS.

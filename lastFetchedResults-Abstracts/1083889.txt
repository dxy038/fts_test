Many countries have investigated the new sandfilter backwash water treatment process to recycling the backwash water. There are various methods for reclamation of sandfilter backwash water (Such as Sedimentation, Sand filter, Membrane Filtration System ETCâ€¦), but the membrane filtration system is generally regarded as most efficient. This study is applied tubular membrane filtration system for backwash water treatment. In general, crossflow filtration operation mode is used in the tubular membrane system. Thus, the objective of this study is to verify the application of a dead-end filtration operation mode for tubular membrane filtration system in order to reduce electricity usage for the pump. For efficient operation of filtration and bleed, a matrix was established to simulate various sets of filtration and bleed times.

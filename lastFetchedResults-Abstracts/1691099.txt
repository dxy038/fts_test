Inroduction & Objective: The effects of the probiotic, Pediococcus acidilactici, commercially known as Bactocell on some immunological parameters in the fingerlings of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 3600 fingerlings with an average weight between 3 and 5 g were randomly stocked in equal numbers in 12 channels. Three experimental feeds comprising 100, 200 and 300 g of bactocell per ton feed and one control feed were tested in three replicates while the experiment lasted 8 weeks. Fish were fed three times a day and feeding rates were adjusted to their body weight and water temperature. Five fish were randomly selected from each group at the end of the forth week and at the end of the eighth week and blood samples were collected and analyzed for Biochemical analyses and also conducted to determine levels of lyzozyme enzyme (lgM), total protein, complement CH50, SGOT, SGPT and glucose .
Results: Results obtained from this study indicate that increase in  concentration of levels of lyzozyme enzyme, immune globulin and compliment CH50 , Albumin  and total protein in treatments which contain probiotic Bactocell than those found in the controls treatments .
Conclusion:Increasing of those enzymes in blood serum of fingerlings is an indicator of immune system activities that could cause increase in the resistance of rainbow trout fingerings towards pathogenic factors and environmental stimuli

Background. Extrapleural pneumonectomy is still indicated in some patients with empyema. We examined morbidity and mortality after this high-risk operation.
Methods. Between 1979 and 1998, 94 (92 chronic, 2 postsurgical) patients with empyema underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy. There were 79 men and 15 women (mean age, 59 years). Eighty-eight patients had a history of tuberculosis, and 53 had undergone a therapeutic pneumothorax. The right side was operated on in 50 patients and left in 44.
Results. Operative mortality was 8.5%. Fifteen major complications (1 esophageal perforation, 9 empyemas, and 5 bronchopleural fistulas) occurred in 13 patients. Eight patients required reexploration for hemorrhage. Reexploration was a risk factor for empyema. Bronchopleural fistulas occurred only on the right side. Eighty-nine percent of the 86 operative survivors were free of empyemas at 5 years. Overall 5-year survival was 83%, and survival was better in patients without than in those with empyema.
Conclusions. Extrapleural pneumonectomy for empyema has acceptable morbidity and mortality. Postoperative empyema affects prognosis. Covering a bronchial stump with muscle is recommended, especially when the operation is performed on the right side.

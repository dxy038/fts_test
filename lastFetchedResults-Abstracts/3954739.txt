In coastal regions the presence of the marine boundary layer can significantly affect RF propagation. The relatively high specific humidity of the underlying &#8220;marine layer&#8221; creates elevated trapping layers in the radio refractivity structure. While direct sensing techniques provide good data, they are limited in their temporal and spatial scope. There is a need for assessing the three-dimensional (3-D) time-varying refractivity structure. Previously published results indicate that matched-field processing methods hold promise for remotely sensing the refractive profile structure between an emitter and receive array. This paper is aimed at precisely quantifying the performance one can expect with matched-field processing methods for remote sensing of the refractivity structure using signal strength measurements from a single emitter to an array of radio receivers. The performance is determined via simulation and is evaluated as a function of: (1) the aperture of the receive array; (2) the refractivity profile model; and (3) the objective function used in the optimization. Refractivity profile estimation results are provided for a surface-based duct example, an elevated duct example, and a sequence of time-varying refractivity profiles. The refractivity profiles used were based on radiosonde measurements collected off the coast of southern California

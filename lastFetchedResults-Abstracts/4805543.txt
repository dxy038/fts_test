As the percentage of the elderly in the worldÂ´s population continues to increase, the drive for improved technological support for assisted living follows. A new global objective that aims towards enhancing the elderly quality of life appears where lot of research has been taking place in the field of ambient intelligence consideration factors which includes more comfort, improved health and security for the elderly while living in their homes longer. This paper describes steps towards that goal. Thus a new intelligent fuzzy agent have been created with an emotion aware system that transforms a living environment into a pseudo robot which within which they reside providing a non-invasive, self-learning, intelligent controlling system that constantly adapts to the requirements of an individual. The system developed aims to towards providing a level of care for those who have difficulty in their interaction with standardised living spaces and a comparison of the two different self-learning methodologies developed is discussed. The empirical results of experiments performed at the Glamorgan Intelligent Home Care (Glam i-Home Care) will be presented shown the potential of the approach in assisting the extension of independent living.

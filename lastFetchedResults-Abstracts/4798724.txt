Much is being written about &#8220;cognitive engineering&#8221; or the process of applying psychology and human factors engineering data to human interface design. Most of this literature is strong on theoretic advocacy of such a process but weak on implementation details. The present paper describes in detail the first part of one suggested methods for cognitive engineering of computer interfaces. This crucial first phase is the acquisition of knowledge from potential users and subject matter experts about what the computer system will do and how it should do it. Most contemporary application development processes rely heavily on user inputs, using these inputs to deliver what the user &#8220;wants.&#8221; Unfortunately what the user &#8220;wants&#8221; often differs from what the user &#8220;needs.&#8221; The present cognitive engineering method uses objective processes called concept mapping to process user inputs into system requirements based on needs rather than wants. New software under development to create and analyze concept maps is described and sample output is presented. An application based on efforts to assist development of the Open Command Tactical Information System (CTIS) command and control system of the Air ForceÂ´s Alaskan Air Command serves as an example of the process

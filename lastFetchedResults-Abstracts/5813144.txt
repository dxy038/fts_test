In this study, we proposed an objective estimation of decline of arousal level by analyzing microsaccade rate and pupil fluctuation while subjects were continuously gazing a fixation target. Previous studies show that the slow eye movements (SEMs) could be a candidate for an indicator of decline of arousal. However, it is not sufficient to evaluate transition of arousal states since SEMs appear just prior to sleep onset. To establish more objective assessment of arousal, we examined the effects of the transition of arousal on microsaccade rate and pupil fluctuation. The subjects were instructed to indicate by mouse clicks when they were aware of having slept. We have analyzed the eye movement and pupil fluctuation data in advance of the occurrence of SEMs which were detected just before the mouse clicks. In the results, longitudinal pupil diameter shrinking and gradual rise of microsaccade rate were observed prior to SEMs. These results suggest that the arousal level could be evaluated by monitoring eye movements and pupil fluctuations.

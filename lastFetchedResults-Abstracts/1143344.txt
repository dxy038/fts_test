Modelling is an important task in food engineering and numerous approaches are possible. Based on the massy experience the paper discusses the challenge, interest and difficulties of modelling of food and food processes. Some key points are specifically discussed mainly on the base of heat processing operation. Heat and mass transfer and their consequences on structure evolution and on the building of the chemical content of food are discussed. Different kind of modelling approaches are also discussed considering control, optimisation and design objective. The coming challenge is as a conclusion presented on two main questions. The building of parameters that are necessary for simulation, mainly using molecular modelling approaches and the challenges related with scales description and the way a continuous understanding becomes probably possible in the future between all the scales.

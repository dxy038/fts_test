A novel algorithm for measuring image edge properties was proposed. The wavelet coefficients in the wavelet domain were used to give two measures: edge intensity measure indicating the intensities of edges and edge diffusion measure describing the distribution of strong and weak edges. Because all the cases of edge degradation (e.g., blurring and noise corruption) are considered, the measures can be taken as objective basis for choosing detection algorithms and tuning parameters in the chosen algorithms. And the experiments on a wide variety of images are acquired which show that the proposed algorithm is efficient

In this paper, hybrid tabu search and simulated annealing (TSSA) with search space managing methods are proposed to determine the optimal number and allocation of FACTS controllers to enhance power transfer capability of power transactions between generators and loads in power systems. Particular optimal allocation includes optimal locations and parameter settings. Two types of FACTS controllers including thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and static var compensator (SVC) are used individually. The objective function is formulated as maximizing total transfer capability (TTC) and minimizing power losses. Power transfer capability determinations are calculated based on the optimal power flow (OPF) technique. Split and non-split search space managing methods are used to improve the solution searching capability. Test results on IEEE 118-bus system and the practical Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) 58-bus system show that the proposed hybrid TSSA with optimal number of FACTS criteria and the split search space managing method give higher TTC and less number of FACTS controllers than those from evolutionary programming (EP) and non-split search space method.

According to the actual operation status of a hotel in Dalian in 9 years, aiming at different seasons, the rule of influence of hotel occupancy ratio on energy consumption was educed by using hotel occupancy ratio as objective parameter to reflect utilizing level; furthermore, "hotel mean daily energy consumption of unit utilizing room" which was closely interconnected with occupancy ratio was put forward to reflect the concept index of energy consumption of unit utilizing level, by which the difference of mean daily consumptions of various energies and mean daily total energy consumptions of hotel in different seasons and in different occupancy ratios could be analyzed and compared. The analyzing results showed that: (1) mean daily consumptions of hotel various energies and mean daily total energy consumptions of unit utilizing room were linearly decreased with the increase of occupancy ratio in any seasons, which demonstrated that the energy utilizing efficiency would be higher with a higher hotel utilizing level; (2) in same occupancy ratio in north hotel, averagely, total energy consumptions of unit utilizing room in winter was 1.5 times of that in summer, 1.64 times of that in spring and autumn, thus there was a large energy-saving potential in winter.

We propose a new adaptive streaming model that utilizes DCCP in order to efficiently stream stereoscopic video over the Internet for 3DTV transport. The model allocates the available channel bandwidth, which is calculated by the DCCP, among the views according to the suppression theory of human vision. The video rate is adapted to the DCCP rate for each group of pictures (GoP) by adaptive extraction of layers from a scalable multi-view bitstream. The objective of the streaming model is to maximize perceived quality of the received 3D video while minimizing the number of possible display interrupts. Experimental results successfully demonstrate stereo video streaming over DCCP on wide area network.

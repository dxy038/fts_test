Objective.  To determine under which layer the silicone implants should be inserted into, the biomechanical properties of fascia and periosteum were investigated.

Design. Biomechanical testing of cadaveric tissues.

Background. In silicone augmentation rhinoplasty, most complications are closely related to the depth of implant and the mechanical character of the tissue surrounding the implant.

Methods. Biomechanical properties of human nasal periosteum and fascia were studied, including tensile strength, stress–strain relationship and stress relaxation under uniaxial elongation.

Result. Although with less failure strain, the periosteum has more tensile strength than fascia. The slope of the linear part of stress–strain curve of the periosteum is bigger than that of fascia, which indicates the periosteum is stiffer than fascia. The stress-relaxation slope of periosteum is smaller than that of fascia.

Conclusion. In the view of biomechanics, the periosteum is thicker, stronger and stiffer than fascia. Under periosteum the silicone implants are easier to be fixed at desired position, thus periosteum is more suitable for covering silicone implants.

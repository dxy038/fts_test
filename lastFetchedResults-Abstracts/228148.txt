Multichannel blind deconvolution has received increasing attention
during the last decade. Recently, Shalvi andWeinstein proposed an
attractive approach to single-channel blind deconvolution called the superexponential
methods The objective of this correspondence is to extend the
Shalvi andWeinstein approach to the multichannel case and present superexponential
algorithms for multichannel blind deconvolution. We propose
three approaches to multichannel blind deconvolution. In the first one, we
present a multichannel super-exponential algorithm. In the second one,
we present a super-exponential deflation algorithm. In the third one, we
present a two-stage super-exponential algorithm.

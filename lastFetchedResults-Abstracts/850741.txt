Nayshabour  plain in Khorasan Razavi with arid and semi-arid climate, have an important role in agricultural production by using groundwater resources. In this study, by using groundwater balance model the equations which are required for estimating water table variations is obtained for plain. afterwards since, there are too many variables in the objective function of water consumption(optimized crop pattern and intensification) a meta heuristic method which require less computation of effect while it is more efficient will be used. In this research PSO optimization algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization) is used. Model results based on a normal year (2008) showed that can earn highest income from the aquifer with 30 percent reduced spring cultivation, and increased 30 percent of wheat, barley and calona. Among the spring crops, corn and tomato ratio to another crops have largest increase area. The results showed that can obtain 7500 (thousands rial /hec)more benefit with increasing 20,591 hectares to autumn crops and reduced 10,970 spring products

The objective of this work is to present the development of an automatic solar water heater (SWH) fault diagnosis system (FDS). The
FDS system consists of a prediction module, a residual calculator and the diagnosis module. A data acquisition system measures the
temperatures at four locations of the SWH system and the mean storage tank temperature. In the prediction module a number of artificial
neural networks (ANN) are used, trained with values obtained from a TRNSYS model of a fault-free system operated with the
typical meteorological year (TMY) for Nicosia, Cyprus and Paris, France. Thus, the neural networks are able to predict the fault-free
temperatures under different environmental conditions. The input data to the ANNs are various weather parameters, the incidence angle,
flow condition and one input temperature. The residual calculator receives both the current measurement data from the data acquisition
system and the fault-free predictions from the prediction module. The system can predict three types of faults; collector faults and faults
in insulation of the pipes connecting the collector with the storage tank and these are indicated with suitable labels. The system was validated
by using input values representing various faults of the system.

Objective Substantial delays in providing
access to treatment in first-episode psychosis have been
well documented. The present study examines the impact
of strategies aimed at improving access and reducing
delays. Method A pilot community education campaign
was conducted with the aim of reducing the
duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in a geographically
defined intervention sector located in the northwestern
region of Melbourne, Australia. Utilising a
quasi-experimental design, a comparison sector with
similar demographics was selected from another part of
the north-western region.A mobile early detection team
and the same treatment system served both sectors. Results
While there was no significant difference between
the mean DUP for intervention and comparison sectors,
the distributional features of DUP between the two regions
were significantly different. In the intervention
sector, disproportionately more cases with very long
DUP were detected. When a small number of outliers
were removed, the mean and median DUP in the intervention
sector was reduced. Conclusion These findings
highlight the complexity of treatment access and delay
and suggest that efforts to reduce DUP may have two effects,
not one. Firstly, a different sample of cases is
treated through the detection of hidden “long DUP”
cases that otherwise may have remained untreated. Secondly,
the DUP for the remainder may indeed be reduced.
More research with larger samples and more potent
campaign strategies is clearly required. It may also
be worth considering whether there is a safe and ethical
way to undertake a RCT of early versus delayed antipsychotic
treatment to perhaps settle the DUP debate once
and for all.

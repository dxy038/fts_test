Besides that, we also did not take the marginal utility of the new added emergency service facilities into consideration. On the basis of the analysis of classic location models, this paper established a new comprehensive multi-objective probabilistic location model. This model meets the fairness of location by setting up the minimum accessibility, considering the new facilities marginal utility and cost, and then we come to find the emergency services location method. Finally the results of an example demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.

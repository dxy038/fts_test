Optimal scheduling of tasks of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) onto a set of processors is a strong NP-hard problem. In this paper we present a scheduling scheme called TDS to schedule tasks of a DAG onto a heterogeneous system. This models a network of workstations, with processors of varying computing power. The primary objective of this scheme is to minimize schedule length and scheduling time itself. The existing task duplication based scheduling scheme is primarily done for totally homogeneous systems. We compare the performance of this algorithm with an existing scheduling scheme for heterogeneous processors called BIL. In initial simulations TDS has been observed to generate scheduling lengths shorter than that of BIL, for communication-to-computation cost ratios (CCR) of 0.2 to 1. Moreover TDS is far more superior than BIL as far as scheduling time is concerned

Centrifugal pumps are widely used in a variety of applications. In many applications the role of centrifugal pump is critical and condition monitoring is essential.The objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and fault diagnosis of centrifugal pump. This was achieved by vibration analysis and investigating different operating conditions of centrifugal water pump. This pumpcoupled to the electromotor that was run under of speed 1450 RPM. The pump conditions were considered to be normal pump, broken impeller and leakage faults with the aim of fault detection. Vibration data was collected from the inspected pump and compared with vibration spectra in normal condition of healthy machine. The results from this study have given more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing machine faults.

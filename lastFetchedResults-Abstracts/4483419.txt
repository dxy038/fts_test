Designing an interactive Human Machine Interface (HMI) for Air Traffic Management (ATM) applications is a complex and experience intensive process. Historically, the ATM community has not been very successful in using lessons gained in the previous development of Controller Working Positions (CWP) to support the design of subsequent generations. Our CoRe (Core Requirements for ATM Working Positions) project seeks to establish a set of methods, traceable and re-useable requirements and solutions for the development and evaluation of CWP. We are currently working in a simulation context. The objective is to make existing knowledge more readily available to the operational world and to provide the ATM community with mechanisms to capture, consolidate and exploit its experience more effectively

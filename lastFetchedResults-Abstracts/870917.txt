A sufficient optimality theorem is proved for a certain minmax programming
problem under the assumptions of proper b,h.-invexity conditions on the functions
involved in the objective and in the constraints. Next a dual is presented for
such a problem and duality theorems relating the primal and the dual are proved.
The dual for a minimax generalized.fractional programming problem is presented
as special case of the main problem considered in the paper.

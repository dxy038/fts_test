For a higher education public institution, young in relative terms, featuring local competition with another
private and both long-established and reputed one, it is of great importance to become a reference university
institution to be better known and felt with identification in the society it belongs to and ultimately to reach a
good position within the European Higher Education Area. These considerations have made the university
governors setting up the objective of achieving an adequate management of the university institutional
brand focused on its logo and on image promotion, leading to the establishment of a university shop as it is
considered a highly adequate instrument for such promotion. In this context, an on-line survey is launched
on three different kinds of members of the institution, resulting in a large data sample. Different kinds of
variables are analysed through appropriate exploratory multivariate techniques (symmetrical methods) and
regression-related techniques (non-symmetrical methods). An advocacy for such combination is given as
a conclusion. The application of statistical techniques of data and text mining provides us with empirical
insights about the institution membersâ€™ perceptions and helps us to extract some facts valuable to establish
policies that would improve the corporate identity and the success of the corporate shop.

Route guidance instructions are crucial in the implementation of an evacuation plan. Considering travelersÂ´ compliance with these instructions is controllable by adopting traffic management at intersections, a simulation-based framework for optimizing traffic management is presented with the objective function of maximizing evacuation efficiency with uncertain budget constraint. A comprehensive case study illustrates the sensitivity of traffic simulation model with traffic demand, duration of hazard, and traffic management. The specific analyses on network performances provide some practical insights. In reality, mandatory traffic management is unnecessary as the optimal instructions are unavailable. Well-staged departure and appropriate enforcement of traffic management at intersections are recommended, which contribute to extensive distribution of traffic flow and then high-efficiency evacuation.

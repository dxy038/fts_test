Objectives: In this study, we investigated the determinants of
poor adherence with anti-tuberculosis therapy among pulmonary
tuberculosis (TB) patients in Mumbai, India, receiving Directly
Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) therapy.
Methods: A cross-sectional study on 538 patients receiving DOTS
I and II regimen was conducted. Patients were interviewed and
clinical and laboratory data were collected. Eighty seven patients
were considered non-adherent. Multivariable logistic regression
was used to determine risk factors associated with non-adherence.
Results: Factors associated with non-adherence were found to be
different among the newly-diagnosed patients and all the other
residual groups. Smoking during treatment and travel-related cost
factors were significantly associated with non-adherence in the
newly-diagnosed patients, while alcohol consumption and shortage
of drugs were significant in the residual groups.
Conclusions: An approach, targeting easier access to drugs, an
ensured drug supply, effective solutions for travel-related concerns
and modification of smoking and alcohol related behaviors are
essential for treatment adherence.

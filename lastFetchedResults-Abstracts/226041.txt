This paper presents an application of a customized linear programming (LP) based model predictive control strategy to the paper
machine cross direction (CD) control problem. The objective of CD control is to maintain ¯at pro®les of variables of interest by
minimizing worst case deviations from setpoints (defects). These control problems can have as many as 200 actuators (inputs) and
400 sensor measurements (outputs). This large size coupled with the stringent real-time requirement of computing a control move in
a few seconds poses a very challenging control problem. Computational results that demonstrate the eectiveness of this strategy
will be presented. For typical disturbances this algorithm can compute provably optimal control moves for a 400 input  400 output
control problem in approximately 5 s versus approximately 90 s for a generic LP algorithm on a HP 9000/770 workstation.

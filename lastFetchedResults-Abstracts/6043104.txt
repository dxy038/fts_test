The highly need of flexibility and more robust controllers in areas such as motor controllers, renewable energy, and power electronics have opened the niche for applying and developing a new family of more active controllers such as: fuzzy, linear quadratic, passivity, pulse adjustment, etc. All these controllers are able to work in operations regions rather than at a single operation point and they make use, for practical implementation purposes, at least one DSP or FPGA. Following this trend, the main purpose of this work is to propose a new hybrid controller, which is able to work in several operation regions while having the feature of being of simple structure and easy to implement. In addition, the proposed strategy has several advantages that makes it attractive, (i) the controller is able to solve a multi-objective problem (i.e. voltage regulation and current limitation), (ii) it is robust against parameter uncertainty (i.e. the controller does not make use of knowledge of system parameters), and (iii) the controller operates at constant frequency. Controller description, numerical simulations and experimental work in a boost converter are presented.

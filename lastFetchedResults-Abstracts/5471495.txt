A hybridised and Knowledge-based Evolutionary Algorithm (KEA) is applied to the multi-criterion minimum spanning tree problems. Hybridisation is used across its three phases. In the first phase a deterministic single objective optimization algorithm finds the extreme points of the Pareto front. In the second phase a K-best approach finds the first neighbours of the extreme points, which serve as an elitist parent population to an evolutionary algorithm in the third phase. A knowledge-based mutation operator is applied in each generation to reproduce individuals that are at least as good as the unique parent. The advantages of KEA over previous algorithms include its speed (making it applicable to large real-world problems), its scalability to more than two criteria, and its ability to find both the supported and unsupported optimal solutions.

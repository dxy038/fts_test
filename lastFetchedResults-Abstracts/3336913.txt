This paper tackles the issue of the emergency transshipment inventory management in a multi-echelon, multi-location distribution system. The inventory control policies at the warehouse is the (R, s´, Q´) periodic review and at the retailers is the (s, Q) continuous review. The objective is to determine the policy parameters (s, Q) and (s´, Q´) which minimize the total cost subject to a desired service level. The determination of these parameters is carried out by a method based on simulation-optimization by using the software &#8220;Oracle Crystal Ball&#8221;. This experimental study allows us to examine the effect of the input parameters on performance measures and transshipment benefits.

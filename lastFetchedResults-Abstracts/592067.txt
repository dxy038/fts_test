The objective of the present study was to find out the effect of AM fungal inoculation on growth, productivity and nutrient uptake in four chickpea Cicer arietinum) varieties. The AM inoculated plants out performed than non-inoculated plants (control) in terms of growth and productivity parameters and nutrient uptake. VAM had a significant effect on productivity of chickpea attributed to growth, viz., and plant height, no. of nodules, mycorrhizal dependency and flowers per plant.

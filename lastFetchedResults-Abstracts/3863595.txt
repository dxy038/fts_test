Multiplayer feedforward networks trained by minimizing the mean squared error and by using a one of c teaching function yield network outputs that estimate posterior class probabilities. This provides a sound basis for combining the results from multiple networks to get more accurate classification. This paper presents a method for combining multiple networks based on fuzzy logic, especially the fuzzy integral. This method non-linearly combines objective evidence, in the form of a network output, with subjective evaluation of the importance of the individual neural networks. The experimental results with the recognition problem of on-line handwriting characters show that the performance of individual networks could be improved significantly

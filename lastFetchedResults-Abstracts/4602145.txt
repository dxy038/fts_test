The main objective of this paper is the analysis of the convenience of implementing Finite State Machines (FSM) in FPGAs programming mini-microprocessors, instead of implementing a specific FSM. To reach this objective, the performance of some mini-microprocessor cores have been analyzed, and compared with the specific implementations. The obtained results expound some guidelines to help in the decision of using or not a mini-microprocessor to implement a FSM in a project.

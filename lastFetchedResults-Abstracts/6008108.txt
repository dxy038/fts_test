Objective: Discussion based on neural networks in the <sup>31</sup>P MR spectroscopy to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma, normal liver and cirrhosis in value. Methods: Using self-organizing map neural network (SOM) analyse 66 data of <sup>31</sup>P MRS, including hepatocellular carcinoma (13 samples), normal liver (16 samples) and liver cirrhosis (37 samples). Results: <sup>31</sup>P MRS can be used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis between hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis nodules. The four experiments show that neural network model based on the <sup>31</sup>P MR spectroscopy data analysis may increase diagnostic accuracy rate of hepatocellular carcinoma from 85.4% to 92.31%. Conclusion: <sup>31</sup>P MRS data analysis based on neural network model provides a valuable diagnostic means of of hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo.

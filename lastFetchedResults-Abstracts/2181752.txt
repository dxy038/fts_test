      Objective(s):  The aim of this study was to insert nitrofurazone in a chitosan membrane to be used as a wound dressing.    Materials and Methods: Several blend films using chitosan (Cs) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), containing nitrofurazone were prepared by means of casting/solvent evaporating technique. Different characteristics such as mechanical properties, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), oxygen permeability (OP), swelling ability (SW), differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), drug release profiles and antibacterial activity of the films were investigated.  Results: The results showed that nitrofurazone decreased tensile strength, OP and SW of Cs films, while increased WVTR. Addition of PVA at any concentration improved mechanical properties, reduced WVTR, and increased OP and SW of nitrofurazone-loaded Cs films. The latter films showed higher activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than drug-free chitosan films.  Conclusion: The presence of PVA improves many properties of Cs-nitrofurazone films and makes them more desirable as dressing material for burn wounds. Although nitrofurazone alone is ineffective against P. aeruginosa, it is able to increase antibacterial effect of chitosan in composite films

The adaptive pulse compression (APC) technique has been proposed in the literature of pulse compression radar for superior performance for polyphase coded signals in comparison to conventional matched filter (MF) and mismatched filter techniques. However, its performance degrades in case of binary phase coded signals. The recently reported hybrid MF and radial function (MF-RF) model performs well only for the single target case. Thus there is a need to develop a model which would perform efficiently both for single and multi-targets conditions for binary phase coded signals. To achieve this objective a hybrid model (APC-RF) combining the APC and radial function is developed. The performance of the new scheme has been evaluated under different noise and Doppler shift conditions. The results of the simulation study demonstrate superior performance of the proposed APC-RF model over several pulse compression techniques such as MF, APC and MF-RF.

We relax some assumptions of the traditional scheduling problem and suggest an adapted
meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize efficient utilization of resources and quick response to
demands simultaneously. We intend to bridge the existing gap between theory and real
industrial scheduling assumptions (e.g., hot metal rolling industry, chemical and
pharmaceutical industries). We adapt and evaluate a well-known algorithm based on
electromagnetic science. The motivation behind our proposed meta-heuristic approach has
arisen from the attraction-repulsion mechanism of electromagnetic theories in physics. In this
basic idea, we desire to bring our search closer to a region with a superior objective function
while going away from the region with the inferior objective function in order to move the
solution gradually towards optimality. The algorithm is carefully evaluated for its performance
against two existing algorithms using multi-objective performance measures and statistical
tools. The results show that our proposed solution method outperforms the others.

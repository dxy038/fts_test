Prediction model of region competitiveness gives an objective understanding of the developments and advantages of the regions. It helps to make the strategies of competition of the regions and to accelerate the development of the regions. In the paper, we construct the evaluation index system for the region competitiveness of Shanxi province in China with local actual conditions on the basis of diamond theory. Then the classifications of individual region are determined by clustering algorithm. Finally, an alternative prediction and evaluation model for the region competitiveness of Shanxi province is created by using entropy computing and classification decision tree algorithm. Furthermore, we use the results to make further countermeasures to enhance the competitiveness of regions for Shanxi province.

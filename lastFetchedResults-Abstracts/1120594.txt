Background: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is one of the most common infectious diseases largely resulted from patients' lifestyles. The purpose of the present study was to investigate factors related with adopting healthy behaviors by patients with tuberculosis based on health belief model.
Methods: The present cross-sectional study was performed on 196 patients with tuberculosis. Data was collected using a 47-item self-designed questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the reliability of the questionnaire and it was calculated as 73.9. Pearson test was used to study the correlation between independent variables and adopting healthy behaviors.
Findings: The mean score of adopting healthy behaviors by patients was 87.52 Â± 13.8. Pearson correlation test indicated statistically significant relations between adopting healthy behaviors and scores of knowledge (P  <  0.001; r = 0.536), perceived susceptibility (P  <  0.001; r = 0.36), perceived benefits 
(P  <  0.001; r = 0.347), and perceived barriers (P = 0.046; r = 0.143).
Conclusion: Direct relationship exists between adopting healthy behaviors and scores of knowledge, perceived susceptibility, and perceived benefits. Although the results of this study can be the basis of educational interventions, any generalization should be performed cautiously.

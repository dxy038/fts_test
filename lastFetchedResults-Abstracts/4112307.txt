A new and efficient diakoptical static state estimation algorithm is proposed for a power system. The main objective of developing this algorithm was to obtain an estimator with an improved performance in terms of robustness, accuracy, online CPU time, core memory occupation, intercomputer data transfer, scope for sparsity exploitation, and localisation of bad data effect. In the developed method, a system has been divided into a number of subsystems to take advantage of low dimensionality, sparsity, fast decoupled estimation and parallel processing. The co-ordination among the subsystem level estimators has been done, in each iteration, to improve accuracy of estimates. The results of a comprehensive comparative study of the performance of the developed method, against the integrated fast decoupled method are also presented

Nowadays, numerous processes of any supply chain are done by suppliers and
consequently they cause a massive amount of pollution released to the nature.
Hence, greening the suppliers has become a necessity. Although most of green
supplier development programs need high investment, formal optimization models
that address this issue are very rare. This paper mainly aims to address this problem
by introducing a two-stage mathematical model which can help managers allocate
optimal investment in their suppliers. In the first stage, suitable green supplier
development programs are selected. Then, a multi-objective optimization model is
presented for investing in an appropriate set of green programs, concurrently.
Moreover, the conceptual framework presented in this paper provides managerial
insight in every step of this process. Also, a comprehensive analysis is done under
two scenarios of budget estimation and it has been found that these programs
highly influence their required investment, and therefore, they must be considered,
simultaneously.

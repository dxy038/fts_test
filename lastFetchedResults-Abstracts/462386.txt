Objective: To characterize Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States with reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Methods: AIDS surveillance data reported through June 1998 were analyzed. Characteristics of cumulative case patients, rates of AIDS incidence in 1996 through 1997, and trends from 1982 through 1996 were analyzed.
Results: Through December 1998, 4,928 Asian and Pacific Islander adults and 46 Asian and Pacific Islander children with AIDS were reported in the United States. Of the total cases, 89% were in men, and 79% of those were in men who have sex with men (MSM). Five states, which account for 63% of the Asian and Pacific Islander population in the United States, reported 78% of the cases: California (45%), Hawaii (12%), New York (15%), Texas (3%), and Washington (3%). Of the 92% of Asian and Pacific Islander patients with country of birth information, 59% were foreign-born, a percentage that corresponds to the distribution in the general population. The overall incidence rate per 100,000 for 1996 through 1997 was 12.8 (21.3 for men; 3.3 for women). The highest rate was in the Northeast (15.9), followed by the West (13.8), South (10.6), and Midwest (5.7). Tuberculosis, reported for 6% of Asians and Pacific Islanders, was higher among foreign-born than among U.S.-born Asians and Pacific Islanders (8% and 4%, respectively). Between 1982 and 1996, AIDS incidence among MSM increased and peaked in 1994. Among heterosexual contacts and injection drug users, incidence has increased but remained low.
Conclusions: The AIDS epidemic among Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States has primarily affected MSM and is concentrated in a few states where most Asians and Pacific Islanders reside. Prevention activities should include consideration of cultural diversity and an understanding of cultural norms regarding sexuality. Additional information on risk behaviors and seroprevalence among Asian and Pacific Islander MSM is needed to better guide prevention planning.

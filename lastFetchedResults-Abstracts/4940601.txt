Energy-saving is an important policy meeting with current energy shortage and environmental problems. Heating is the main energy consumption in Chinese northern areas. Taken typical northern city Shenyang City for example, this study applies the technology of remote sensing on urban residential construction heating-loss monitoring. The thermal infrared (TIR) data-ASTER, as main data source, is used to retrieve the urban land surface temperature based on the improved split-window algorithm. Integrating the high resolution multi-spectral remote sensing image QuickBird (QB), field sample data of thermal infrared imaging devices and the local residential areasÂ´ attribute, the analysis is done to estimate the feasibility of the remote sensing application in monitoring the construction heating-loss condition in Northern China. Through the ground validation, the accuracy rate can reach up to 91%. It is proved that remote sensing monitoring based on ASTER is an efficient and objective method in the urban construction energy-saving monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on the continual presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences in bulky cervical cancer tissues and the relationship between the presence of human papillomavirus and the response of these patients to chemotherapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Multiple tissue sections obtained from 33 patients with bulky cervical cancer both before and after chemotherapy were analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 by deoxyribonucleic acid amplification.
RESULTS: The cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy did not significantly alter the continual presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences in these tissues (p = 0.8048). The presence of human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid in tumors treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with favorable tumor response compared with type 18-positive patients and type 16/18-negative patients (94.7% vs 42.9%, p = 0.0059 and 94.7% vs 44.4%, p = 0.0004, respectively). Additionally, patients with type 18 deoxyribonucleic acid had a significantly higher risk of recurrence than did type 16-positive patients (p = 0.0123).
CONCLUSIONS: These results seem to suggest that the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences may serve as a marker to predict the response of bulky cervical cancer to chemotherapy and may be useful in reassessing neoadjuvant treatment for those patients who are free of human papillomavirus or those with type 18 deoxyribonucleic acid.

The European project COMSON (coupled multiscale simulation and optimization in nanoelectronics) is a Marie Curie RTN project that involves five partners from academia and three from industry world, with the main objective of realising an experimental demonstrator platform (DP) in software code, which comprises coupled simulation of devices, interconnects, circuits, EM fields and thermal effects in one single framework. The DP is the basis for a lifelong e-learning system, devoted to the training and transfer of knowledge within COMSON, in order to promote exchange of resources and to share knowledge. In this paper we give a brief description of COMSON and summarize the characteristics and functionality of MODMAT.net, a prototype e-learning platform realized for the management of information and didactics online. In our intention, this platform is used as the starting point for developing an e-learning platform with high levels of portability and reusability

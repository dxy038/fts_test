The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of three artificial larval and four artificial adult diets on development and reproduction of Medfly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). The larval diets were based on wheat bran, wheat bud and soybean protein, and the adult diets were based on honey solution, protein hydrolysate, brewer's yeast+sugar, and brewer's yeast+sugar+banana fruit. All experiments were carried out under 25±2 °C, 60±5% RH, and 13:11 h L:D laboratory conditions, using a completely randomized design for larval diets and a factorial design for adults diets. The shortest larval duration, highest larval survival, highest pupal weight, and highest female’s weight were observed in wheat bud based diet, and their means were estimated 6.7±0.07 days, 69.3±2.6 %, 9.7±0.007 mg and 7.3±0.2 mg, respectively. In contrast, the larvae reared on soybean protein based diet had the longest developmental period, lowest survival rate, lowest pupal weight, and lowest adult emerging rate with means of 7.54±0.11 days, 60±1.3 %, 8.98±0.06 mg, and 79.84±0.85 % respectively. The results of this study also demonstrated that those flies that fed diets containing both wheat’s bran/bud and brewer's yeast during the larval period and provided with mixture of brewer's yeast and sucrose during the adult stage, had the highest reproduction period, fecundity, and eggs fertility. The means of these parameters were estimated as 23.75±0.8 days, 115.2±5.9 eggs/female/lifespan, and 78.1±2.64 %, respectively. In conclusion, wheat bud or bran based diets, and brewer's yeast+sugar were recommended for mass rearing of larvae and feeding of adults Medfly, respectively.

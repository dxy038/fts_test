As an important usability evaluation method, usability testing has been widely used by domestic and foreign large enterprises, and academic institutions. But how to analyze the subjective and objective data that collected in usability testing by a normative, correlation method, and apply the conclusions to improving product design-as guidance or advice, has became an important direction of this method for future development. In this paper, the author structured a new data-processing mechanism for scenario-based usability testing by using various types of data that from current implementation methods and processes of universal usability testing. The method integrates qualitative and quantitative analysis of various types of data, and combines with the pre-design of tested products, then, summarized into a final normative evaluation form. The evaluation form will effectively serve to improve the product design scheme, better integrate usability testing to the product iterative design, and improve standards and efficiency of usability testing data processing.

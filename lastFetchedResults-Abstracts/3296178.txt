Natural-Disaster makes a huge threat to the lives and properties of the people. When large-scale disaster happens, in order to open up the rescue as soon as possible, the scheduling of emergency materials becomes especially important. At the beginning, we have obtained the information which contains grey part from the emergencies. In connection with grey theory, a bilevel optimization grey model is established with &#8220;the earliest emergency-start-time&#8221; and &#8220;fewest retrieval deports&#8221; as optimal objective, and the continual consumption of emergency resources as constraint. At the same time, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to choose better retrieval deports which have more material resources, thus avoiding excessive retrieval deports involved. Finally, an example is presented which illustrates that the model is rational and the algorithm is effective.

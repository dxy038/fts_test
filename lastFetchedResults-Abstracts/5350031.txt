Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) along with Functional Requirements (FRs) are the most significant and critical requirements for software development. NFRs are often ignored and inadequately specified during software development. If NFRs are not properly considered at early stages of software development, it may become very complex and expensive to address them later on. This paper analyzes various techniques, frameworks and recommendations from various literatures and identifies their limitations as well. Further, the paper discusses different techniques for individual NFRs specified in FURPS quality attribute model. The objective of this study is to provide an analytical comparison of NFRs techniques and perform critical analysis on NFRs.

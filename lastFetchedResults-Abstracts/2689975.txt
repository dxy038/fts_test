This paper presents the application of a superconducting fault current limiter to energy storage for protection in a power distribution system. An energy storage system is increasingly being used to help renewable energy resources integrate into the grid. It is important to keep an energy storage system interconnected with the grid without interruption and to supply electrical power to the grid. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a superconducting fault current limiter to keep the energy storage system from disconnecting from the grid when ground faults occur. Its effect is analyzed using transient simulation software.

Background: In human, about 25% of implanted embryos are losing 1-2 week following attachment to the uterus. A subset of this population will have three or more consecutive miscarriages which define as repeated pregnancy loss (RPL). Introducing the assisted reproductive technologies (ARTS) made a chance for infertile couples to solve their childless problem.
Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of Y-chromosome AZF region's micro-deletions in male partners of couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM).
Materials and Methods: Thirty male partner of couples with RM and thirty infertile males, who referred to the Yazd Research and Clinical Center for Infertility were recruited to this study. In addition, 30 healthy men were screened as a control group from the same center. After DNA extraction using salting out method, the multiplex-PCR was done for amplifying 8 known STSs proximal to the AZF region of the Y-chromosome. The results were compared between the groups using Fisher's exact t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: Of the 30 infertile males, 5 (16.6%) cases were associated with the AZF region micro-deletions of DYF87S, DYF84S1, DYF83S1 and DYF51S1, STSs. But in the fertile and RM male groups was found no deletions similar to those, of the infertile males (p=1.0). Instead 4 (13.3%) cases of the RM group males had different micro-deletions included DYS220 (AZFb, sY129), DYS262, DYF8551, and DYF8651, STSs. The AZFc locus of Y-chromosome micro-deletions have a significant role in RM (p=0.045).
Conclusion: It seems that the Y-chromosome AZF region's micro-deletions are associated with RM, and we recommend adding this AZF region STSs into infertility analyzing panels.

A low computationally-cost generalized predictive controller (GPC) is presented. The objective of this work is to show a way of reducing the prediction and control horizons, and so the computational burden, by means of a robust stabilization in the plant. With this, it is intended to guarantee the applicability of the GPC, even for plants with small time constants. A comparison between this algorithm and the GPC applied directly on the plant is given

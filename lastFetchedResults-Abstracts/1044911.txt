Optimal configurations of finned annulus with parabolic fins have been investigated for maximum convection by employing trust-region and genetic algorithms. Flow is considered to be steady, laminar, incompressible and fully-developed subjected to constant heat flux boundary condition. Finite element method is employed to compute field variables for providing function values to the optimizers. Using Nusselt number as objective function various optimal configurations have been proposed depending on practical and industrial requirements. A comparison of optimal configurations of parabolic fins with those of trapezoidal and triangular fins indicates that no single fin-shape is best in all situations and for all criteria.

Objective.
Psychosomatic health symptoms are commonly experienced by young people and are associated with chronic health problems. This study examines reports of psychosomatic health symptoms during adolescence, and associations between adolescent risk-taking and the occurrence of these symptoms.
Method.

A cross-sectional national health survey was performed in 2001/02 and involved 1746 young Canadians. Principal components analyses were used to derive a multiple risk-taking score. Multi-level regression models with individual participants (1st level) nested in schools (2nd level) were used to examine associations between individual then multiple risk-taking behaviors and psychosomatic symptoms.
Results.

37% of males and 48% of female students reported psychological health symptoms > once per week, while 30% of males and 41% of females reported somatic health symptoms. Strong associations were observed between individual risk-taking behaviors (cannabis use, other illicit drug use, drunkenness, smoking, unprotected sex) and psychosomatic health symptoms. A risk gradient was observed between multiple risk behaviors and these health symptoms. Youth who engaged in high levels of risk-taking behavior were two to four times more likely to report health symptoms.
Conclusion.

Adolescent lifestyles that include risk-taking behavior are strongly associated with the occurrence of psychosomatic health symptoms. Collectively, these measures are useful clinical indicators of adolescent health status.

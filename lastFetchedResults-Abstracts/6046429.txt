Wind energy presents great potential for applications as a renewable source for power systems. However, it is an unsteady power source due to the randomness of the wind speed. If the power injection level of a grid-connected wind generator is high, it can lead to serious power quality problem. Hence it is important and necessary to find way to calculate and analyze the impact of wind power on system frequency. The objective of this paper is to report a method which can be used to assess wind power impacts on power quality. Through statistical analysis of wind speed and thus wind power injection, the study allows a prediction of the network frequency deviations to be made. The deviations are expressed in a probabilities manner which is amenable for risk/benefit analysis.

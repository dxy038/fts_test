Background: Despite numerous studies over a decade, it still remains controversial about the biological effects of RF EMF emitted by mobile phone telephony.
Objective: Here we investigated the effect of 900 MHz GSM on the induction of
oxidative stress and the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human
mononuclear cells, monocytes and lymphocytes as defence system cells.
Method: 6 ml Peripheral Blood samples were obtained from 13 healthy volunteers
(21-30 year-old). Each sample was devided into 2 groups: one was exposed RF radiation emitted from a mobile phone simulator for 2 hour and the other used as control
group which was not exposed to any felds. After that, mononuclear cells were isolated
from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque. The intracellular ROS content in monocytes and lymphocytes was measured by the CM-H2DCFDA ?uorescence probe using ?owcytometry technique.
Results: Our results showed signifcant increase in ROS production after exposure
in population rich in monocytes. This effect was not signifcant in population rich in
lymphocytes in comparison with non exposed cells.
Conclusion: The results obtained in this study clearly showed the oxidative stress
induction capability of RF electromagnetic feld in the portion of PBMCs mostly in
monocytes, like the case of exposure to micro organisms, although the advantages or
disadvantages of this effect should be evaluated.

We present and investigate the problem of finding a min-cost tree for multi-resource manycast in mesh networks. In the traditional manycast problem, or the K-MST problem, the goal is to find a minimum cost tree that spans any k vertices; however, in the min-cost tree multi-resource manycast problem, the objective is to find a minimum cost tree that spans any k computing resources distributed throughout the network, where each node may have multiple computing resources. Simple polynomial-time heuristic algorithms are proposed for the problem of min-cost tree multi-resource manycast. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is evaluated through simulation.

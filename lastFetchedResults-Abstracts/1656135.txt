During the well publicised Cardington structural fire research programme, parts of some connections suffered fracture during cooling. This led some to believe that fire spread and structural collapse may occur during the cooling stage of a fire and therefore this issue should be considered in structural fire engineering design. This paper focuses on steel framed structures using concrete filled tubular (CFT) columns and the objective of this paper is to find means of reducing the risk of structural failure during cooling. It reports the results of a study using the general finite element software ABAQUS to numerically model the behaviour of restrained structural subassemblies of steel beam to CFT columns and their joints both in fire, emphasising on the cooling stage. Validation of the finite element model was achieved by comparing the simulation and test results for the two fire tests investigating cooling behaviour, recently conducted at the University of Manchester on similar structures. In these two tests, the test assembly was heated to temperatures close to the limiting temperature of the steel beam and then cooled down while still maintaining the applied loads on the beam. One of the tests used reverse channel connection and the other test used fin plate connection. The finite element models give very good agreement with the experimental results and observations. Remarkable differences in tensile forces in the connected beams were observed during the tests depending on the beam temperature at which cooling started. This leads to the suggestion that in order to avoid connection fracture during cooling, it may be possible to reduce the limiting temperature of the connected beam by a small value (&lt;50 Â°C) from the limiting temperature calculated without considering any axial restraints in the beam.

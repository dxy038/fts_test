In order to achieve a large improvement in the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of Army communications-electronics equipment, the U. S. Army Electronics Command (ECOM) has been conducting a comprehensive program to determine the fundamental causes of interference. The objective of the program is to find design techniques of broad applicability which will maximize EMC without degrading the primary functions of the equipment. Some interesting and potentially valuable studies which are discussed are: EMC education, non-linear devices, shielding and filtering, the binomial pulse, and receivers. Some ideas, held by many design engineers, which are fallacious are mentioned, and some problems yet to be solved are pointed out.

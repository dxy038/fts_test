Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in infants is important. There are a few studies around tuberculosis in infancy in the literature. This study defines the clinical and radiological features of tuberculosis in infants less than one year of age. The medical records were reviewed for all infants aging 12 months or less with diagnosis of tuberculosis at TB wards of National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (N.R.I.T.L.D.) in Tehran, Iran between 2006 - 2012 retrospectively. Nine infants with a median age of eight months were identified, all of whom had endothoracic Tuberculosis. The cause of medical evaluation was the unset of symptom in five infants and close contact with infected patients in four. Common symptoms and signs included cough in four, Night sweat in three and Crackles in two patients. Chest X-ray showed consolidation in three, nodular lesions in three, consolidation and ground glass in one, mediastinal bulging in one. Chest CT scan revealed consolidation in three, disseminated pulmonary nodules in one, tiny nodules in two, ground glass lesion in two, right Para-tracheal and subcarinal lymphadenopathies in two, pre-bronchial thickening in one and bronchiectasis in one. Culture was obtained from all of the patients and was positive in one. All infants promptly responded to the treatment. No complications and deaths occurred. Pulmonary tuberculosis predominates in infants. Prompt diagnosis and treatment seem to reduce morbidity and mortality in this age group. Chest CT may be supportive in the diagnosis of infants with characteristic lymphadenopathy.

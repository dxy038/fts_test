In this paper, we present a formulation of minimum classification error linear regression (MCELR) for the adaptation of Gaussian mixture continuous-density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) parameters. Two optimization approaches, namely generalized probabilistic descent (GPD) and Quickprop are studied and compared for the optimization of the MCELR objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed MCELR technique is confirmed via a series of supervised speaker adaptation experiments on a task of continuous Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese) speech recognition

Objective: Standardization of herbal formulations in terms of quality and composition of raw materials are important to ensure quality and optimum levels of active principles. HPTLC has recently emerged as a preferred analytical tool for ?ngerprints and quanti?cation of marker compounds. An Ayurvedic veterinary formulation used as effective appetite enhancer, in the animals suffering from anorexia, off-feed & ulcers. It contains Zanthoxylum alatum DC, Piper longum Linn, Piper nigrum Linn, Ferula narthex Bioss, Cuminum cyminum Linn, Carum copticum Linn, Zingiber officinale Roscoe. The need of the ours is to evolve a systematic approach and to develop well-designed methodologies for the standardization of herbal raw materials and herbal formulations. 	Method: The present study was to develop the fingerprinting and quantification methods for the formulation by simple high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) determination using piperine and zingiberene as standard, which is an important and major content in formulation. HPTLC quantification methods for determination of piperine and gingiberine from the market formulation and lab formulation had been developed. Result: The concentration of piperine present in raw lab and market formulation was found to be 3.7% w/w and 3.15% w/w respectively and that of for zingiberene was found to be 9.04% and 10.36% respectively. Conclusion: Lab and market both the formulation were up to the standard.

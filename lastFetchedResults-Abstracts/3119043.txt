A humanoid robot head was developed with function of face detection, face recognition and face automatic follow. AdaBoost algorithm was used to detect face from video image and 2DPCA algorithm was used to realize face recognition. With mechanical structure design of two degrees of freedom and through control of motor, the humanoid robot head can track the objective face, which imitate the interaction between human.

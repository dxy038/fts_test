In this paper, a bidirectional current-fed resonant push-pull converter is proposed for energy storage applications where high voltage conversion ratio, high power and low current ripple are needed. In this study, theoretical waveforms of bidirectional RPP are shown, analytical analysis is provided and a modulation method for reverse power flow operation is proposed. Finally, theoretical results are verified with a 5kW prototype. The main contribution of this paper is modifying previously presented resonant push-pull topology and its modulation principle to provide bidirectional power flow.

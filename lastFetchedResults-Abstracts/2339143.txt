Objective
GM2-Gangliosidosis disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that
includes two disorders (Tay–Sachs and Sandhoff disease).These disorders cause
a progressive deterioration of nerve cells and inherited deficiency in creating
hexosaminidases A, B, and AB.
Materials & Methods
Patients who were diagnosed withGM2-Gangliosidosis in the Neurology
Department of Mofid Children’s Hospital in Tehran, Iran from October2009to
February 2014were included in our study. The disorder was confirmed by
neurometabolic and enzyme level detection of hexosaminidases A, B, and AB
in reference to Wagnester Laboratory in Germany. We assessed age, gender,
past medical history, developmental status, clinical manifestations, and neuroimaging
findings of 9 patients with Sandhoff disease and 9 with Tay Sachs
disease.
Results
83% of our patients were the offspring of consanguineous marriages. All of
them had a developmental disorder as a chief complaint.
38%of patients had a history of developmental delay or regression and 22% had
seizures. The patients with Sandhoff and Tay Sachs disease were followed for
approximately 5 years and the follow-up showed all patients were bedridden
or had expired due to refractory seizures, pneumonia aspiration, or swallowing
disorders.
Neuro-imaging findings included bilateral thalamic involvement, brain atrophy,
and hypo myelination in near half of our patients (48%).
Conclusion
According to the results of this study, we suggest that cherry-red spots, hyperacusis,
refractory seizures, and relative parents in children with developmental delay
and/or regression should be considered for assessment of GM2-Gangliosidosis
disease.

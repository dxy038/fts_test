It is the basic requirements to reduce the weight and size of the gearbox of unmanned electric light armored reconnaissance vehicle. In order obtain the features of small, light and fast, we take the minimum volume of gearbox as the objective, and the modulus, number of teeth and the center distance as variables in this paper. On the basis of performance and transmission function, the optimization and analysis work are done. The optimization results show that it can provide a theoretical basis to improve the structural design of gearbox. Meanwhile, the design results provide the references to other similar gearboxes design.

UWB (Ultra Wide Band) technology is a reliable transmission scheme for wireless communication with high data rates. It is called as impulse radio, impulse radar or carrier free ultra high resolution scheme. UWB is defined as signals with fractional band width more than 20% of its central frequency or as signals with bandwidth more than 500 MHZ. UWB can be characterized with ultra-short duration pulses called monopulses which has excellent immunity in interference from sensitivity or multi path effects or fading problems. The objective of the paper is to examine different types of pulse shaping and modulation schemes for UWB performance evaluation. By considering three different types of pulses and three different types of modulation techniques the BER (bit error rate) performance of the modulation techniques are evaluated in the presence of the AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise).

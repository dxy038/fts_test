In this paper, we consider distributed source coding (DSC) problem over actual noisy channel addressed as distributed joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) while targeting the important applications of real-world transmission. Our objective is to design robust syndrome-based Slepian-Wolf decoding schemes guaranteeing both efficient distributed source compression and error protection. We utilize low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and systematically design a decoder matrix based on the parity-check matrix of the encoder which is optimized for efficient decoding in DJSCC scenario.

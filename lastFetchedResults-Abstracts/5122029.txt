Bispinor is a differential operator endowed with objective connotation and lots of particular characters, and thus becomes a key and unavoidable concept in electromagnetic theory. This paper points out that it is impossible or even purely self-deceptive for us to suppose forms of gauges in order to replace bispinor with other mathematical forms. Based upon a rather systematic analysis of bispinor, a fresh formula about its properly posed boundary value problem is supplied. Then, a properly posed boundary problem or an exact mathematic-physical model for a dynamic electromagnetic field excited by a varying current is reconstructed.

This study presents an experiment that integrates a semiotic investigation with a dynamical perspective on embodied social interactions. The primary objective is to study co-creativity of a communication system on the human-human nonverbal interaction. Throughout the experiment, the results of established communication system on uni- and bi-directional interactions are compared. Finally, the role of co-creativity in the evolution of communication systems will be discussed.

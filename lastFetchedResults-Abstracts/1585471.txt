In this paper, a systematic procedure for modelling, simulation and optimal tuning the parameters of a thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) controller, for the power system stability enhancement is presented. The design problem of the proposed controller is formulated as an optimization problem and differential evolution (DE) is employed to search for optimal controller parameters. A detailed analysis on the selection of objective function and controller structure on the effectiveness of the TCSC controller is carried out and simulation results are presented. The dynamic performance TCSC controller under various loading and disturbance conditions are analyzed and compared. Finally, the proposed design approach is extended to a multi-machine power system for simultaneous design of multiple and multi-type controllers.

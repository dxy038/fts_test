This paper presents an application of a two-dimensional continuous/discrete model based repetitive control method in voltage control of DC/AC inverters. The control objective is to suppress harmonic distortion, ensure high quality sinusoidal voltage output. Total harmonic distortion (THD) is one of the main criteria to evaluate power quality, it should be kept as small as possible. Modeling of the plant and controller design procedures are introduced in detail. Different working modes of the system are tested with simulation. By comparing results of controlled and uncontrolled system, the effectiveness of the approach was verified.

The current research of product variant design is focused on how to make it effective and feasible, but it is of no any methodology to get the optimized result of the designing. Based on the special research of the parametric variant design and genetic algorithms, a new optimal method of parametric and variant design is presented. By analyzing mechanical product parameters and their relevance, we build the master cast of the mechanical product. In the genetic algorithm module, the engineering requirements are expressed by mathematic model. The parameters are optimized through global searching, and the objective function and performance constraint function are built in genetic algorithm. After a global optimal convergence, the optimal solution will be found. The solution of product variant design is achieved after importing the optimal solution into the master cast. Moreover, the procedure based on genetic algorithm is realized, which aimed at a type of high speed shaft. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed method is efficient and feasible.

Objective: Spiritual beliefs can help people find meaning of life, and can also influence their feelings, behaviors and mental health. The present research studied the relationship between basic religious beliefs (Human, Existence and God) and five personality factors: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness.
Method: randomly selected 178 students of Islamic Azad University in Torbat-Jam completed the Basic Religious Beliefs and NEO Questionnaires.
Results: Data showed that basic religious beliefs have a significant negative correlation with neuroticism (r=-0.29), and a significant positive relationship with extraversion(r=0.28), openness(r=0.14), agreeableness (r=0.29), and conscientiousness (r=0.48). Also, the results of the regression analysis showed that basic religious beliefs can anticipate neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness, but they cannot anticipate the openness factor significantly.
Conclusion : The  findings  of  this  study  demonstrate  that  basic  religious  beliefs  have a positive  relationship   with  some   characteristics  that  help  people    resolve   the  challenges  of   their lives   and   identity  crisis . Thus,  the results  of  this   study  support the  idea  of  Religious  Cognitiveâ€“Emotional   Theory  that  religiosity  is  correlated with  positive  personality  traits.

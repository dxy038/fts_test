Electricity is one of most widely used energies and encouraged to be saved by scientific management and new technologies such as Time-of-Use policy. Batch scheduling can significantly improve production efficiency and is used in many high electricity consumption and high technology industries. This paper investigates a new bi-objective single machine batch scheduling problem with TOU policy. The first objective is to improve productivity and the second aims to minimize the total electricity cost. For the problem, a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is formulated. Its corresponding single objective optimization problems are linearized by analyzed properties such that the multiobjective &#949;-constraint method can be used to obtain Pareto solutions.

An iron pole shape optimization method to reduce
cogging torque in Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) motors is
developed by using the reduced basis technique coupled by
finite element and design of experiments methods. Objective
function is defined as the minimum cogging torque. The
experimental design of Taguchi method is used to build the
approximation model and to perform optimization. This
method is demonstrated on the rotor pole shape optimization of
a 4-poles/24-slots IPM motor.

In the present research, laboratory thermomechanical processing using single pass hot
compression was carried out on a low carbon Nb-Ti microalloyed steel to study the effect ofdeformation
strain on the microstructural evolution. The objective is to understand how to attain a homogeneous,
equiaxed and ultrafine ferrite (i.e. grain sizes < 3pm). Deformation schedules were conducted at two
phase region (i.e. between Ad-ArJ). Hot compression experiments were executed at constant temperature
with strains from 0.25 to J, and strain rate of 0.001s-1. The physical processes that occur during
deformation were studied by analyzing the true stress- true strain hot flow curves. Examination of the
microstructural evolution was carried out by optical microscopy. Results show that at the deformation
temperature lower than Ar3, in two phase region (a+r), there is not any evidence of dynamic softening
events, and both austenite andferrite are work hardened during the deformation. Very fine and equiaxed
ferrite grains (EFG) ofabout 1.6 urn are obtained by deformation at 785 0 Cfor the strain of1. This has
been attributed to the occurrence of strain-induced transformation (SIT) of austenite to ferrite. With
increasing strain, EFG size reduces and its volume fraction increases. It was inferred that the amount of
strain plays an important role in SIT. This is by controlling the amount ofactivation energy requiredfor
SIT, when the specimen experiences the same strain rate.

Introduction: Fasting is a commitment to God, therefore many pregnant women have a tendency to perform it, but they are concerns about its possible complications which may affect fetal health.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the relationship between fasting on pregnant women and their fetal birth weight.
Method: This study was conducted on pregnant women referring to maternity hospitals in Kashan city during Ramadan in 2009 who were divided into two groups of fasting and no fasting. Regression model was used to control the multiple confounding factors. Study data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent tests, Chi-square, Variance analysis and Linear Regression. 
Results: The mean gestational age in fasting group was 3338±498gr and 3343±339gr in no fasting group. Findings indicated no significant difference between the mean neonate birth weight born to fasting and no fasting pregnant woman (P < 0.931). Also conducting linear regression and controlling variables showed that fasting was not a predictor of birth weight. 
Conclusion: People studied showed that fasting of mothers had no effect on neonatal birth weight.

The finite element method (FEM) is quite commonly employed in electromagnetic device optimisations, where computation of the field or energy is required for objective function evaluation. It is well known, that the FEM brings about a remarkable computational burden, so that objective function evaluations often take most of the optimisation time. In this paper, an approach is proposed, based on the principle of evolutionary search: the required precision is directly related to the search resolution, determined by the optimiser at the current iteration.

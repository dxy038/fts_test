In order to improve the magnetic properties of 34Ni -29Co-3Mo-Fe alloy, two types of new alloys have been developed by adjusting the composition and controlling the textures of recrystallization:35Ni-27Co-3Mo-Fe(Ku <img src="/images/tex/2566.gif" alt="\\gg"/> Kl) and 34Ni-29Co-4Mo-Fe(Ku&#8784;Kl). These alloys not only retain the high saturation induction of original al -loy(Bs=15800G), but also possess some other better mag -netic properties respectively, i.e, for the first alloy &#956;m=117.5 * 10<sup>4</sup>G/Oe and Br/Bs=0.992, and the second alloy: &#956;5=5.24 * 10<sup>4</sup>, &#956;10=14.2 * 10<sup>4</sup>, and P1.0/400=0.89w/kg. The two alloys can meet different requirements for various types of electronic devices. The first new alloy may be used to make cores of bidirectional pulse transformers, magnetic modulators and transformers with adjustable pulse width etc. The second new alloy may make D.C.conversions etc.

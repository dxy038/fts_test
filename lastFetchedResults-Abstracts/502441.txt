Background and Aim: Coma has many complications affecting cognitive, perceptive and emotional functions. Sensory deprivation as one of the most common complications is considered as threatening for the patient. It is developed by decreasing sensory inputs or receiving monotone or unstructured stimulations. Sensory stimulation of comatose patient may prevent these complications, but using the best program is of great importance. The objective of this study was to assess changes in level of consciousness during 14 day period of auditory stimulation by familiar voice in comatose patients.
Material and Method: In this quasi-experimental study, 30 traumatic and non-traumatic comatose patients aged 15-75 years, hospitalized in intensive care unit in Shariati and Sina hospitals were selected by purposeful sampling and randomly allocated to either control or experimental group. The patients in intervention group received a familiar auditory stimulation 2 times (each time 5-15 minutes) per day for 2 weeks, Glasgow coma scale was assessed before and after every intervention in experimental group. In control group, the level of consciousness assessed 4 times daily, similar to intervention group. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Fisher exact, Freidman, Independent t-test.
Results: The findings showed that there was a statistically significant difference between daily mean level of consciousness during 14 days (P < 0.001) in experimental group, but in the control group, no difference was seen between daily mean level of consciousness during 14 days (P=0.86). 
Conclusion: Auditory stimulation by familiar voice may have an effect on promotion of level of consciousness in comatose patients.

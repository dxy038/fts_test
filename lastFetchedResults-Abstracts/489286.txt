The objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate the levels of beta hydroxy butyrate (BHB), glucose, protein and albumin in serum of healthy Holstein cows and those with subclinical ketosis. In this survey, blood samples were collected at two stages from cows selected at 7 dairy farms in Shahriar province of Tehran. Five to 7 ml of blood were taken from the coccygeal vein of 100 cows during the last week of pregnancy when the animals were dry and once again 2 months after parturition from the same cows, their sera separated and the amounts of BHB, glucose, protein and albumin determined by enzymatic techniques and commercially available kits. With the cut point of BHB at 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7 mmol/lit, the percentage of cows affected with subclinical ketosis were 18, 14 and 4 percent, respectively. Mean levels of BHB in ketotic cows was significantly higher than healthy cows before and after parturition while mean levels of glucose, protein and albumin was significantly lower during the same periods (P<0.05). There was a significant correlation between BHB and glucose levels before parturition (r = - 0.27). After parturition, the correlation coefficient (r) between BHB and glucose, protein and albumin were - 0.64, - 0.64 and - 0.48 respectively. In ketotic cows, significant correlation was seen between BHB and glucose (r = - 0.38), BHB and protein (r = - 0.44) and BHB and albumin (r = - 0.56).

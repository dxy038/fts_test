Alluvial soils, formed by rivers as accumulated sediment deposited at different times, show large variations in their physical properties over short distances. Soil physical properties that have been taken into consideration in this study showed variability as a result of dynamic interactions among natural environmental factors such as parent material, land use managements and topography. The main objective of this research was to determine impact of selected land use types and different soil textures (clay, clay loam and loam) interactions on some soil physical characteristics such as soil organic matter (SOM), bulk density (BD), water stable aggregates (WSA), and hydraulic conductivity (HC) in surface layers (0-20 cm) of an alluvial land. This study was carried out in Cetinkaya district located on Bafra Deltaic Plain. The study area covers about 1365.4 ha. The main water resource to this area is K?z?l?rmak River. Most of the study area is flat and slightly sloped (0.0-2.0%) and the majority of research areaâ€™s soils are Entisol, Inceptisol and Vertisol. The study area has been commonly used for irrigated agriculture activities particularly, for field crops (wheat, maize and barley) and for vegetables (bean, pepper, watermelon, cucumber, tomato, cabbage and spinach). According to the results of MANOVA statistical analysis, affecting different land uses was significantly found that was occurred as p < 0.01 for SOM, WSA, and HC, p < 0.05 for BD as well. In addition, while affecting of texture was significantly detected as p <  0.01 for SOM and WSA, it was determined statistically as p <  0.05 for HC.

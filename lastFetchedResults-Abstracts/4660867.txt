A collaborative, haptic, audio and visual environment (C-HAVE) consists of a network of nodes. Each node in the C-HAVE world contributes to the shared environment with some virtual objects. These can be static, e.g., a sculpture or the ground, or dynamic, e.g., an object that can be virtually manipulated. We aim at developing a heterogeneous scalable architecture for large collaborative haptics environments where a number of potential users participate with different kinds of haptic devices. The main objective of the presented research is the development of three prototypes to demonstrate quantitatively the effects of adding haptics to a task. The experimental results reveal the effects of the different implementations on the performance and time delay of a particular task through objective measurement results.

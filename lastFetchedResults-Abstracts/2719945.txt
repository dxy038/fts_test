This paper presents a modular multilevel cascade converter based on triple-star bridge cells (MMCC-TSBC), devoting itself to control and experiment. The TSBC is one of the direct ac-to-ac power converters capable of bidirectional power flow with three-phase sinusoidal currents with any power factor at both supply (input) and motor (output) sides. Therefore, it is suitable for medium-voltage high-power motor drives with regenerative braking, intended to replace a conventional line-commutated cycloconverter using thyristors. This paper provides an intensive discussion on how to control the whole TSBC system, how to regulate and balance the dc mean voltages of all the dc capacitors, and how to mitigate their ac voltage fluctuations. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and tactics are verified by a three-phase 400-V 15-kW downscaled model.

In the past, the examination of quality of work life (QWL) and its effect on the organizational performance has been considered so much and many investigations have been done. In new paradigms in which the development of human resources and organizational goals are considered instead of using them for achieving the organizational goals, the QWL has been defined through new indices, which according to Hayrol et al. (2010) are as follows: interpersonal, the organization's policies and managerial style, organizational support, personal and family life, security and satisfaction in the organization, work environment, well-being and personal health. As it was previously mentioned, one of the indices of QWL is the managerial style in the organization. In this paper, considering the objective of developing human resources, the effect of managerial coaching style which is used today for learning and development through open communications, team procedures, valuing people over task, the acceptance of ambiguity and development of facilities on the QWL in the Government Offices of Yazd city have been analyzed which is done through modeling of structural equations by Lisrel 8.5 software. It becomes obvious that managerial coaching has a significant role on the QWL and it indicates 36 percent variance of the QWL with 95 percent accuracy rate. Also all the observed variables in the model could indicate latent variables except for well-being and individual health and personal life (managerial coaching variable p<0.01 and QWL p< .0.05).

This paper describes the impacts on performance improvement in power conversion systems with newly developed T-type 3-level IGBT module, in which authentic Reverse Blocking IGBT (RB-IGBT) are implemented. The latest generation IGBT-FWD chipsets are installed as main switches and anti-paralleled RB-IGBTs work as AC-bidirectional switch. The simplest combination in semiconductor chipset makes it possible to pack more power into smaller package as well as reduction in power dissipation, which contributes the size reduction in power conversion systems. In this paper, 1200V-300A full T-leg 4in1 IGBT modules which promise wider application opportunity are introduced. As an application example, 1MW solar inverter of improved efficiency of as high as 98.5% will be discussed.

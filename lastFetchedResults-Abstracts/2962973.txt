The main objective of the INtegrated satellite UMTS Real Environment Demonstrator (INSURED) project is to demonstrate satellite-UMTS (S-UMTS) services and functionality in the context of a S-UMTS system demonstrator involving real first generation mobile low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and personal communication systems (PCS). Based on the results obtained from the RACE II Mobile line projects and in particular the strategies, schemes and protocols proposed in RACE II/SAINT, COST and all other ETSI/ITU activities involving mobile satellite applications, the S-UMTS approach towards fully integrated satellite and terrestrial mobile communication is shown

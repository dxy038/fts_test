In order to maintain Air Traffic Control (ATC) system safety and efficiency, the Flight Management System (FMS), as a complete system, must provides for automated Vertical and Lateral Navigation (LNAV). In which, LNAV is the major issue for air traffic controllers. For the problem of designing control law of LNAV in FMS, an optimal design method is proposed. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in optimizing the gain of roll angle command, cross track error (XTK) and track error (TKE) are computed as the variables of objective function. A goal of this paper is to provide a generic method and can be extended to the optimization of other LNAV and VNAV on different platforms. Numerical simulations among the optimized roll angle command gains and other gains provide by FMS manufacturers are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

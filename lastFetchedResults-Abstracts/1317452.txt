In patients with malignancy, the common etiologies of granuloma formation are tumor related sarcoid reaction, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and other granulomatous diseases. Often, the finding of granulomas in malignant patients may obscure the primary malignancy or may mislead towards treatment of infectious and other etiologies. Hence, their proper recognition and necessary follow up is needed to establish the cause of granulomatous lesions and for proper management of patients.

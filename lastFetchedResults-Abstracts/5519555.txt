In this paper, a new image fusion method based on M-band wavelet is proposed. M-band wavelet transform domain has its superiority to 2-band wavelet transform domain in energy compaction and direction selection. Considering both the multi-scale-multi-direction information and the correlation property in M-band wavelet domain, an image fusion scheme based on cross-band-window is brought forward. The simulation results in multi-focus image fusion verify the superiority of our proposed method to the method based on 2-band wavelet in both the subjective and objective evaluation

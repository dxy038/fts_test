In the early years, the E-learning contents are always written by static HTML pages, which can not provide a highly interactive learning activity to fulfil the need of some simulation based learning, e.g., Standard Operation Procedure Training. As we known, the learning objective of simulation based learning can be achieved via Role-Playing Flash interactive learning contents. Since this kind of contents is usually manually created, the construction is time-consuming and costly. Thus, we propose an Object Oriented Interactive Content Model (OOICM) representing the high level game knowledge for authors with the interface of OOICM to assist authors in constructing a Role-Playing learning content easily without writing low level codes. OOICM is composed of three components: Story Control Flow (SCF), Activity, and Scene Object (SO). System layer of OOICM, where we apply Petri Net based rule set to model SCF and use frame knowledge representation to model Activities and SOs, is also defined as the middleware to separate OOICM from low-level implementation. Based on OOICM, we implement a generator with frame engine to help authors to construct the learning content. Finally, we compare the generator with other authoring tools and the experiment result shows the generator has better reusability.

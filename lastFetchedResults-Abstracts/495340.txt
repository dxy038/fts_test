Background and objective: Several studies over the world have been done in considering the necessity of HCV genotype determination and its relation to therapeutic response and clinical manifestations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of HCV genotype and viral load and also their associations with some of variables like sex, age and time of diagnosis.

Material and methods: In this study, 384 patients with hepatitis C who presented in a hepatitis clinic in Tehran were investigated. We measured their sera for type of HCV genotype by PCR method and also for viral load by PCR method.

Results: Of 384 evaluated patients, 307 (79.9%) were men. In total of study subject, the most frequency was for la genotype with 154 (40.1%) of patients followed by genotype 3a with 105 (27.3%) and lb with 43 (11.2%) of study subjects. There were 76 sera (19.8%) which their genotypes could not be determined (non typable). In the samples with more than 106 virus in milliliter, 47 (49.5%) have genotype of la and after that there were genotype 3a and lb with 25 (26.3%) and 16 (16.8%) respectively.

Conclusion: In our study, the relationship between HCV genotype and viral load was approximately similar to the other studies' results in other countries. Unfortunately we didn't evaluate the relationship between these two factors and antiviral therapeutic response and with regard to necessity of knowing this relationship for determination of type and duration of antiviral therapy in next steps; we need to perform complementary studies.

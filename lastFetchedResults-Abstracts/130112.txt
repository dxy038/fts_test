Aspergilloma can be defined as a conglomeration of intertwined aspergillos hyphea matted together with fibrin, mucus and cellular debris within pulmonary cavity or ecstatic bronchus (usually cavitary tuberculosis). Although most patients are asymptomatic, hemoptysis is a common symptom of pulmonary aspergilloma and results in fetal asphyxiation. Most often there is one or two aspergilloma in lung, but we are reporting a 46 year old non smoker diabetic man admitted with hemoptysis; CXR and lung CT showed three cavitary lesions, each containing mass separated from the cavity wall and air space (air crescent sign). In this patient aspergilloma occurs in cavities of an old tuberculosis. Diagnosis was by finding the organism in sputum smear and a positive serology for aspergillus specific antibody. Definitive treatment for aspergilloma is surgical resection, but this case was not operable, thus angiography and bronchial artery embolization (BAE) was done for source of hemoptysis and oral itraconazole 200mg BID was administered. Three pulmonary aspergilloma was not reported from Iran to date and this case is rare.

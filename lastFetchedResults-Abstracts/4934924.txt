In this paper, I analyzed feed forward network using back propagation learning method with early stopping and radial basis neural network to predict the trend of stock price (i.e. classification) and to predict the stock price (i.e. value prediction). Fundamental data or Technical indicators were not used in this research as basic objective of this research was to determine the usability of artificial neural networks in predicting the future prices based on past prices alone.

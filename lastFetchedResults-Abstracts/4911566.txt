Our objective is to design and construct a useful routing protocol for an adhoc wireless network. While working primarily in the small, hand-held computing device arena, Bluetooth wireless technology has emerged as the network medium of choice. We introduce Bluetooth wireless technology, examine current routing protocols, and present the objectives and considerations for the design of a new Bluetooth routing protocol. The protocol design will consider the capabilities of the devices (nodes) within the range of the network. It is envisioned that the capabilities aware routing (CAR) protocol will make routing decisions based on such factors as device power constraints, memory, location and signal strength.

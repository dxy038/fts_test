Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether any preoperative variable had a significant effect on extubation time after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Design: The study design was retrospective. Setting: The study was conducted in a cardiac center in the United Kingdom where 1700 cardiac surgical operations are performed per year. Subjects: The study sample was composed of 89 patients who had coronary artery bypass graft surgery performed by the designated consultant cardiac surgeon in the first 6 months of 1998. Outcome Measures: The measures included preoperative variables (age, gender, body mass index, cardiac status, pulmonary status) and extubation time. Results: Mean extubation time was found to be 4.97 hours. Left ventricular function was found to be statistically significant (P =.05) to extubation time. Conclusions: We found that cardiac status had an effect on extubation time and that this warranted further investigation. No other preoperative variable had a significant effect on extubation time, raising questions concerning the need for strict preoperative exclusion criteria. (Heart LungÂ® 2001;30:216-24.)

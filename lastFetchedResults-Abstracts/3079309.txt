Our objective is to build a distributed terminal system to provide smart, context-aware, rich-experienced applications upon personal environment networking technologies, such as WLAN, IEEE 802.15.3 series, ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc. For the proliferation of smart devices with autonomous applications, the users can get much more service experiences than before. While smart devices facilitate human operation, the coordination of devices through networks may provide applications proactively by gathering much more service context, which indicates the emergence of the pervasive computing age. Hence, we proposed the distributed terminal system for the cooperating of smart devices. In this paper, we analyzed the organization architecture of universal service terminal (UST), the distributed terminal system proposed by us before. In UST project, we have abstracted and encapsulated the capabilities of devices as servers for remote invocation by applications, moreover, the framework functionalities have been introduced for the organization of the distributed system. Though the architecture of UST has been validated feasible in a demonstration, the centralized control mechanisms in the heterogeneous environment are inefficient and unreliable. Thus, we propose an evolved scheme by introducing decentralized mechanisms in this paper. The devices around the user are organized in an overlay peer-to-peer network, and some powerful nodes of them provide the decentralized mechanisms for resource management, service discovery, etc

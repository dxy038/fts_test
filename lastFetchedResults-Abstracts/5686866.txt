Many European countries consider changing current sound insulation regulative to make field measurements of sound insulation mandatory down to 50 Hz. This is also supported by newly proposed standards - ISO/CD 16283-1 (field measurements of sound insulation) and ISO/NWIP 16717-1 (deriving the single-number values). On the other hand there is a lack of data in literature about the measurement results and the uncertainty at such low frequencies. This paper analyzes about 300 results of field reverberation time measurements in the extended frequency range. The measurements are done by five independent institutions involved in EU COST Action TU0901 and gathered in a unique database as a part of STSM (Short Term Scientific Mission). Main objective of the Action is to propose sound insulation descriptors to be widely adopted by European countries.

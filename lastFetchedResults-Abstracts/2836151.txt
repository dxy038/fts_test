The objective of this paper is to analyze the replacement of conventional air conditioner for air conditioner driven by frequency converter in a Consumer Unit (CU) used for public service activities, which carries in addition to increased energy efficiency, positive impact on invoice for electric power of CU. However, when observing the effects of the use of the frequency converter on the electric energy quality in systems where they are employed, verified the appearance of unwanted harmonic distortion in the network. This paper analyzes the process of replacing the proposed system and verifies the impact on the reduction of energy consumption and electric power quality.

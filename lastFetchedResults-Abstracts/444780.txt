Background
Controversy persists over the educational value of the volume of student clerkship clinical activities.
Methods
Students (109) from the class of 1995 recorded their clinical experiences in a logbook during their surgical clerkship at one of four affiliated teaching hospitals. The influence of clinical experience on examination scores and on correlations between prerotation and postrotation examination performance was determined.
Results
Between sites, marked variation in clinical experience was observed but postrotation scores were similar. High-volume experience in emergency admissions and feedback was associated with better objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) performance, but high-volume outpatient clinic experience was associated with less satisfactory OSCE performance. Correlations between prerotation examination performance and the OSCE was increased by feedback on emergency and elective admissions, in a positive and negative direction, respectively.
Conclusions
These data show that surgical clerks' clinical skills were enhanced by an increased volume of some but not all clinical experiences and that feedback does not necessarily enhance performance. These data suggest that both the volume of clinical experience and the quality of feedback should be carefully monitored by surgical clerkship directors.

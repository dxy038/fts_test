Redundancy technique is known as a way to enhance the reliability and availability of non-reparable systems, but for repairable systems, another factor is getting prominent called as the number of maintenance resources. In this study, availability optimization of series-parallel systems is modelled by using Markovian process by which the number of maintenance resources is located into the objective model under constraints such as cost, weight, and volume. Due to complexity of the model as nonlinear programming , solving the model by commercial softwares is not possible, and a simple heuristic method called as simulated annealing is applied. Our main contribution in this study is related to the development of a new availability model considering a new decision variable called as the number of maintenance resources. A numerical simulation is solved and the results are shown to demonstrate the effecienct of the method.

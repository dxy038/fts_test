A novel scheme of a dual-parallel injection locking, based on commercially available Fabry-Perot laser diodes, is proposed. It was verified for the proposed technique to improve a suppression ratio of an optical carrier suppressed signal for generation of 60 GHz carrier. In addition, it was possible to support bidirectional 1.25-Gbps wired and wireless transmission by adopting the remodulation of a gain-saturated reflective semiconductor optical amplifier for the uplink.

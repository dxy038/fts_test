Identification of predictive markers in QTL regions that impact production traits in commercial populations of swine is dependent on construction of dense comparative maps with human and mouse genomes. Chromosomal painting in swine suggests that large genomic blocks are conserved between pig and human, while mapping of individual genes reveals that gene order can be quite divergent. High-resolution comparative maps in regions affecting traits of interest are necessary for selection of positional candidate genes to evaluate nucleotide variation causing phenotypic differences. The objective of this study was to construct an ordered comparative map of human chromosome 10 and pig chromosomes 10 and 14. As a large portion of both pig chromosomes are represented by HSA10, genes at regularly spaced intervals along this chromosome were targeted for placement in the porcine genome. A total of 29 genes from human chromosome 10 were mapped to porcine chromosomes 10 (SSC10) and 14 (SSC14) averaging about 5 Mb distance of human DNA per marker. Eighteen genes were assigned by linkage in the MARC mapping population, five genes were physically assigned with the IMpRH mapping panel and seven genes were assigned on both maps. Seventeen genes from human 10p mapped to SSC10, and 12 genes from human 10q mapped to SSC14. Comparative maps of mammalian species indicate that chromosomal segments are conserved across several species and represent syntenic blocks with distinct breakpoints. Development of comparative maps containing several species should reveal conserved syntenic blocks that will allow us to better define QTL regions in livestock.

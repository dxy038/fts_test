The objective of this study is to develop analytical models for simulating driving-point biodynamic responses distributed at the fingers and palm of the hand under vibration along the forearm direction (zh-axis). Two different clamp-like model structures are formulated to analyze the distributed responses at the fingers–handle and palm–handle interfaces, as opposed to the single driving point invariably considered in the reported models. The parameters of the proposed four- and five degrees-of-freedom models are identified through minimization of an rms error function of the model and measured responses under different hand actions, namely, fingers pull, push only, grip only, and combined push and grip. The results show that the responses predicted from both models agree reasonably well with the measured data in terms of distributed as well total impedance magnitude and phase. The variations in the identified model parameters under different hand actions are further discussed in view of the biological system behavior. The proposed models are considered to serve as useful tools for design and assessment of vibration isolation methods, and for developing a hand–arm simulator for vibration analysis of power tools.

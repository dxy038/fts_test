This paper discusses the influence of conditional attributes on decision attribute, presents an order of conditional attributes and a method of searching key conditional attributes to decision by rough set theory. Considering the limited bandwidth in mobile computing environment, we describe a method of information measurement of the rule set of selected key attributes. And considering the balance between the number and the information of the rules, we provide a definition of the objective function of drawing rules and discuss its properties. Those contributions may provide some help for rule reduction and mobile decision support.

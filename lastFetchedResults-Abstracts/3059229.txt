The objective is to obtain a 3D realistic dynamic model of a virtual walking animal. The word biomimetism is used here because nature is taken as the example that achieved this complex task. This includes not only the geometric parameters but also a choice of locomotion control. The goals are: enhance the legged robotic locomotion and its modelling, obtain the gait of disappeared animals by modifying parameters from the model, and animate in a realistic way and in real time (as opposed to image by image drawings) virtual animals or personages for animation movies

Truck suspension system could reduce cab vibration as well as road damage. A number of methods are engaged to promote truck performance, such active and semi active control. With the purpose of reducing dynamic tire force, this paper presents a simulation analysis of a semi active suspension control for light-heavy duty truck, the controller scheme known as Ground Semi Active Damping Force Estimator (gSADE). A famous tire force control oriented algorithm for heavy vehicle suspension control known as Groundhook (GRD) also has been studied. Thus, the objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of the gSADE algorithm compared to GRD and passive system. These algorithms are applied to a full light-heavy duty truck models, and the simulation model was developed and simulated using MATLAB Simulink software. Ride test was conducted using random road excitation at three different speeds, and the simulation results of gSADE, GRD and passive system are compared and analyzed. The simulation results showed that the gSADE control is able to reduced tire force significantly compared to GRD control and passive system.

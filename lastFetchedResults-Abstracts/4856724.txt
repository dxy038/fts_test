The Traffic Responsive Intelligent Speed and Headway Adaptation (TRISHA) project investigated the effects of the external application of limits to the performance of individual vehicles from the roadside. The limits considered were maximum speed and minimum headway based on real-time traffic flow information. The objective of such limits would be to promote smoother traffic flow and better control. The project explored the impacts of such systems mainly through detailed modelling of various scenarios

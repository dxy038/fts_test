Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in plasma C reactive protein (CRP) and Serum amyloid A (SAA) levels following 8 weeks of circuit resistance training in obese men. 
Methodology: Twenty six obese men (age; 36.8±7.9 yr, weight; 92.8±10.8 kg, and BMI; 31.5±2.8 kg/m2) voluntarily participated in this study, and were divided into control (n=13) and resistance training (n=13) groups. Subjects in training group performed eight weeks circuit resistance training with 50-85% 1RM (3 days/week). Anthropometrics parameters, as well as plasma levels of CRP and SAA were measured at the baseline and at the end of study.
Results: Eight weeks of resistance training induced significant reduction in body weight, BMI and body fat percentage (P?0.05). Significant reduction in plasma CRP concentration was found in compare with control group (P?0.05). Plasma SAA levels increased in both control and training groups when compared with baseline levels (P?0.05), But there was no significant difference in SAA levels changes between two groups. 
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that circuit resistance training decreases plasma CRP levels, associated with improved in body composition in obese men.

The objective of this article is to present technique elements of Intellectual Properties Cores (IP) and Infrastructure IP (IIP) parameterization for fault-tolerant FPGA-based systems (FTFS). The FTFS IIP parameters classification is discussed and some elements of IIP parameterization technique are observed. Case-study of proposed technique is illustrated for the airborne ice protection system.

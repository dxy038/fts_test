Frame rate up conversion methods that employ motion have been proven to provide better image quality compared to nonmotion based methods. While motion based methods improve the performance of interpolation; artifacts are introduced in the presence of incorrect motion vectors. In this paper, the effect of motion vector errors on the efficiency of motion compensated frame rate up conversion (MC-FRUC) and temporal interpolation filter is analyzed. The problem of MC-FRUC is investigated by combining blocks with different motion vector errors as opposed to equal error assumption. A general expression for temporal interpolation filter is derived. To improve the efficiency of the prediction, it is shown that the interpolator should be able to switch between unidirectional or bidirectional modes based on the motion vector reliability.

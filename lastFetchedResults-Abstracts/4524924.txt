Universities are important sources of new technological knowledge for firms. This study examines cases of new university technology used specifically in new product innovation. Survey data was collected on 66 new product development projects within 52 established companies involving new technology from 26 universities. The companies were sampled from the information and communications technology sector in Canada. A key objective was to understand strategic importance of the new university technology to the firms. This paper presents the rich descriptive data that was obtained from the research model testing to be done at a later date. Data is presented for four main areas: general project information; product and market characteristics; technology transfer issues; and technological/strategic fit. Evidence suggests that new university technology is an importance strategic resource for product innovation and that the technologies are closely associated with the firmÂ´s core competencies. The resulting new products appear to be relatively new to the firm and to the marketplace and considerably enhance customer-perceived value. Firms seem to favour relationships with universities that are in close proximity. Exclusivity rights do not appear to be a dominant feature in the firm-university relationships.

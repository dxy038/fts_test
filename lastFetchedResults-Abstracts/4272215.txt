Although evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are often successfully used for dynamically changing problems, there are only few theoretical results about EAs for dynamic objective functions. Here, the runtime of the (1+1) EA is theoretically analyzed for a dynamic variant of ONEMAX. The main focus lies on determining the degree of change of the fitness function, where the expected runtime of the (1+1) EA rises from polynomial to super-polynomial. The proofs presented show methods of how to rigorously analyze EAs on dynamically changing objective functions

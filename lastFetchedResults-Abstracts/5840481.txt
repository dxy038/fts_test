Objective of this paper is to design an intelligent rolling stock safety system on an embedded device which could provide a way for railway transport to avoid dangerous situations, examine the algorithms used in artificial immune systems and ways how they can be used together and provide data for each one other. The authors review analysis methods used to detect, predict and control undesirable rolling stock travel conditions.

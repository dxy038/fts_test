In this paper, the synchronization of a nonlinear network with time-varying coupling delay is investigated via distributed impulsive control. Our objective is to design the distributed impulsive controller with minimum coupling strength such that the nonlinear network with coupling delay is globally exponentially synchronous. Some sufficient conditions have been derived based on Lyapunov-Razumikhin method in terms of matrix inequalities. An example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.

Design optimisation techniques for power electronic converters have been the subject of numerous research studies for the past 15 years. Accurate modelling is the most important task in the optimisation, and, because the nature of optimisation problem demands evaluating an objective function numerous times, fast and simplified modelling techniques are required. The objective of this study is to categorise and analyse the previous studies related to modelling techniques incorporated in design optimisation of power electronic converters. Common trends in modelling and optimisation of power electronic converters are analysed and suggestions for future research in this field will be presented.

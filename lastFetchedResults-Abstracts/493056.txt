This paper presents the effect of various parameters on deformation characteristics of a 17-m .
reinforced wall under seismic conditions with consideration of large strains. The foundation soi I strength
parameters (angle of internal friction and cohesion) and reinforcing elements (length and stiffness) are
varied to investigate their effects on horizontal facing deformation and vertical displacement of the wall
toe. The main objective of this research is to investigate the optimized performance of such (high) walls
under seismic conditions. Numerical 2-D plane-strain analysis with a finite difference scheme using
FLAC-2D is performed to achieve the objectives. A variable amplitude harmonic wave with a 3-Hz
frequency is applied to the wall foundation. The results show that an improved foundation soil properties
of suitable shear strength and steel reinforcement belts with proper length (with respect to the wall
height), the wall deformations are significantly reduced and the wall performance under seismic
conditions is improved.

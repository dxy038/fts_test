Objectives: Falls are well known to be associated with adverse health outcomes, especially when
complicated by fracture. Falls are more common in people who are frail and readily related to several items in the
frailty phenotype. Less is known about the relationship between falls and frailty defined as deficit accumulation.
Our objective was to investigate the relationship between falls, fractures, and frailty based on deficit
accumulation. Design: Representative cohort study, with 8 year follow-up. Setting: The Beijing Longitudinal
Study of Aging (BLSA). Participants: 3,257 Chinese people aged 55+ years at baseline. Measurements: A
frailty index (FI) was constructed using 33 health deficits, but excluding falls and fractures. The rates of falls,
fractures and death as a function of age and the FI were analyzed. Multivariable models evaluated the
relationships between frailty and the risk of recurrent falls, fractures, and mortality adjusting for age, sex, and
education. Self or informant reported fall and fracture data were verified against participantsâ€™ health records.
Results: Of 3,257 participants at baseline (1992), 360 people (11.1%) reported a history of falls, and 238 (7.3%)
reported fractures. By eight years, 1,155 people had died (35.3%). The FI was associated with an increased risk
of recurrent falls (OR=1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.34-1.76), fractures (OR=1.07; 95% CI=0.94-1.22),
and death (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.41-1.60). The FI showed a significant effect on mortality in a multivariate Cox
regression model (Hazard Rate=1.29, 95% CI=1.25-1.33). When adjusted for the FI, neither falls nor fractures
were associated with mortality. Conclusion: Falls and fractures were common in older Chinese adults, and
associated with frailty. Only frailty was independently associated with death

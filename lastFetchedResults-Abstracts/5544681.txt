The national airspace security mission objective is to prevent or counter attacks on air vehicles, including attempts to use aircraft as weapons. Execution of this mission requires coordination and collaboration by both civil and military government agencies as well as the private sector, with tightly choreographed activities from a number of independent organizations in multiple locations. However, there is not yet an accepted multi-agency collaboration framework. The elements needed to support such a framework are proposed in this paper, the result of a MITRE Sponsored Research (MSR) project. It addresses the multiple characteristics of joint crisis management collaboration: unrelated organizations, non-collocation, and time sensitivity.

This paper focuses on nano-scale analysis of mechanical properties of polymer and carbon nanotubes (CNT) embedded MEMS devices using the probe tip of the atomic force microscope (AFM). The mechanical properties of surfaces of layered materials were investigated by using nanoindentation produced with tips of an AFM. Experiment results indicated the bending characteristics of the device and could also indicate the YoungÂ´s modulus of the CNT embedded microstructure. Our objective is to investigate the change in nano-scale mechanical properties and piezoresistivity of bulk carbon nanotubes with the application of local probe manipulation

Ecosystem models are routinely used to estimate net primary production (NPP) from the stand to global scales. Complex ecosystem models, implemented at small scales (&lt; 10 km2), are impractical at global scales and, therefore, require simplifying logic based on key ecological first principles and model drivers derived from remotely sensed data. There is a need for an improved understanding of the factors that influence the variability of NPP model estimates at different scales so we can improve the accuracy of NPP estimates at the global scale. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of using leaf area index (LAI) and three different aggregated land cover classification products–two factors derived from remotely sensed data and strongly affect NPP estimates–in a light use efficiency (LUE) model to estimate NPP in a heterogeneous temperate forest landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. Three separate land cover classifications were derived from three different remote sensors with spatial resolutions of 15, 30, and 1000 m. Average modeled net primary production (NPP) ranged from 402 gC m− 2 year− 1 (15 m data) to 431 gC m− 2 year− 1 (1000 m data), for a maximum difference of 7%. Almost 50% of the difference was attributed each to LAI estimates and land cover classifications between the fine and coarse scale NPP estimate. Results from this study suggest that ecosystem models that use biome-level land cover classifications with associated LUE coefficients may be used to model NPP in heterogeneous land cover areas dominated by cover types with similar NPP. However, more research is needed to examine scaling errors in other heterogeneous areas and NPP errors associated with deriving LAI estimates.

One of the most powerful ways to meet customers' requirements is Quality Function Development (QFD), but this method does not provide optimal solution to select service qualitative characteristic so It would seem that compilation the mathematical programming techniques with QFD is effective in this context.The purpose of this study is to identify the customers' demands according to SERVQUAL model and to find the optimal solution by use of QFD and zero-one goal programming.
The objective function includes: maximize the relationship between service quality characteristics  and customers' demands, minimizing the cost of service quality characteristics,  maximize the extensibility  and creation  potential of Service and This limits includes: the limitation of overall priorities of the service quality characteristics, limitation of resources allocated by the agency and limitations are extensibility and creation  potential of Service quality.

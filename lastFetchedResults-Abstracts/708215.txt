Objective
To describe time to electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition, identify factors associated with timely acquisition, and evaluate the influence of time to ECG on adverse clinical outcomes.
Methods
We measured the door-to-ECG time for emergency department patients enrolled in prospective chest pain registry. Clinical outcomes were defined as occurrence of myocardial infarction or death within 30 days of the visit.
Results
Among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 34% and 40.9% of patients with nonâ€“ST-elevation ACS and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), respectively, had an ECG performed within 10 minutes of arrival. A delay in ECG acquisition was only associated with an increase risk of clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI at 30 days (odds ratio, 3.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-14.72; P = .04).
Conclusion
Approximately one third of patients with ACS received an ECG within 10 minutes. A prolonged door-to-ECG time was associated with an increased risk of clinical outcomes only in patients with STEMI.

In clinical situations, the objective evaluation of somatic sensations is expected without a patientÂ´s subjective opinions to reduce social problems such as those related to lawsuits for nerve injuries and malingering. In this study, the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) using the mechanical stimulations of the tactile sensation was measured and analyzed in spatiotemporal domains. The spatial resolution of SEP maps was improved by application of cortical dipole layer imaging. The experimentally obtained results suggest that the spatiotemporal distributions of the SEPs reflect the differences for positions, strengths, and patterns of somatosensory stimulations.

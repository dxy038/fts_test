Voltage sag is a common power system disruption, usually associated by power system failures. Therefore the accurate detection of voltage sag event is vital issue for mitigation and voltage sag analysis. This paper presents a new method based on phase-space technique for fast voltage fluctuation (sag/swell) detection. The control strategy is built on phase-space, which has the ability to track the amplitude of the voltage sag in actual time. The main objective of the proposed technique is to accurately detect the occurred voltage sag and force the compensating device to inject required voltage to improve the line voltage to the pre-fault level. Static compensator (STATCOM) as a compensating device has been proposed for network stability improvement and power quality. It is simply connected in parallel to the electric network and it has numerous advantages for electrical grids. The main aim of this study is to improve network stability; power factor, power transfer ranking and able to avoid some disturbances such as swells and sags. Another significant element for STATCOM effectiveness in voltage sag mitigation is the simulation results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed controller and voltage sag detection technique and sag detection algorithm to be utilized in the STATCOM.

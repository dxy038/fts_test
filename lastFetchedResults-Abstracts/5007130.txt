This paper presents an approach for designing coordinated controllers of power system stabilizers (PSSs) and FACTS devices stabilizers for enhancing small-disturbance stability. The control co-ordination problem is formulated as a constrained optimization with eigenvalue-based objective function without any need for the linear approximation by which the sensitivities of eigenvalues of state matrix to controller parameters are formed. The eigenvalue-eigenvector equations are used as the equality constraints in the optimization. The controller parameters bounds are formulated as the inequality constraints. Simulation results show that the controller design approach is able to provide better damping and small-disturbance stability performance

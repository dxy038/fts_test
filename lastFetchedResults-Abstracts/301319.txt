The objective of this study was to analyze the morpho quantitative behaviour of duodenum myenteric neurons of Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), aged 21, 60, 90, 210, 345 and 428 days, using wholemount preparations of the muscular tunica obtained by dissecting the intestinal tunica for neuronal revealing, through the Giemsa non-histochemical and Myosin-V immunohistochemical techniques. The neurons were quantified in 80 microscopic fields (14.832 mm2) for each animal and neuronal cell body morphometry was carried out on 100 neurons/rat. Duodenal samples were submitted to histological routine processing, stained by hematoxylin–eosin method in order to perform morphometric analysis of the muscular tunica. An increase in the length of the small intestine was observed up to the age of 60 days, which was maintained up to 210 days, with a reduction in this parameter from 345 days. Muscular tunica thickness was maintained independently of the animal age. During the course of the study, there was a reduction in the mean neuron population in both techniques used. However, in all of the ages evaluated, the use of the Myosin-V technique lead to a reduced mean number of neurons compared to the Giemsa method. The cellular profile morphometry revealed, with both techniques, the predominance of smaller neurons in young animals, and bigger neurons in animals from higher age groups. It was concluded that advanced age is a determinant factor in the number reduction of myenteric neurons, with maintenance of the intrinsic intestinal innervation by the remaining neurons and that the use of the Giemsa non-histochemical technique showed itself more adequate to determine the total neuronal population.

Background: In order to alleviate the pain after abdominal surgery we can use noninvasive therapy such as massage instead of invasive one.
Objective: To determine the effect of massage on pain intensity after abdominal surgery. Design: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial. Control group received two times massage within 24 to 72 hours after abdominal surgery (twice a day). But the trial group did not receive massage. The intensity of pain was measured by use of visual analogue scale and then the result of two groups were compared.
Sample: 140 women who undergone hysterectomy and cholecystectomy operation were selected consecutively and randomly assigned to one of the trial (without massage) or control (with massage) group (70 in each).
Result: There was a significant difference between the intensity of pain before and after each massage and between two groups. This difference also indicated a reduction of pain intensity from first to fourth turns. The result also showed that reduction of pain was not related to age. previous surgery and the frequency of pain relief medications. Conclusion: The result of this study indicated that noninvasive interventions Such as massage can be used for pain alleviation instead of invasive one.

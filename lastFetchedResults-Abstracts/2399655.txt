Objective
al tooth erosion is increasingly observed among adults and frequently associated with dentin sensitivity (DS). This study evaluated the effectiveness on DS of a biomimetic mineralization system (BIMIN) in comparison to the current standard treatment (GlumaÂ® Desensitizer, Gluma).
s
s single-blind, 2-arm study, 40 patients with confirmed cervical DS were randomized to either the test group or the positive control group. A Visual-Analog-Scale (VAS) was used to assess DS following stimulation of the exposed dentin with a 2-s air blast. Assessments were made at baseline (pre-treatment), 2 days, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, and 12 months after treatment. Two-stage replicas were obtained from the treated teeth and gold sputtered at baseline, and 2 days, 3 and 12 months after treatment. Surface topography of the treated cervical lesions and occlusion of dentinal tubules were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
s
reatments led to a statistically significant reduction (P &lt; 0.0001) in DS that persisted over the entire 12-month observation period. Differences in DS between the treatments were not statistically significant. SEM photomicrographs demonstrated that a mineral layer concealed the dentinal tubules in the test group. In contrast, numerous dentinal tubules remained visible in cervical defects that were treated with Gluma.
icance
imetic mineralization kit was successfully used to treat patients exhibiting DS. The effect was similar to using Gluma, and was likely the result of the deposition of an enamel-like layer on the exposed cervical dentin.

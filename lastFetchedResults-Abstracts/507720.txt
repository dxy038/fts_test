OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common medical problems worldwide. Approximately 18% of persons over 65 years old are diabetic. WHO estimates that the prevalence rate of diabetes (4% in 1995) will increase to 5.6% in 2025.
Diabetic foot problems are potentially the most preventable long–term complication for diabetes.
The purpose of this study was to test the utility of the Health Belief Model (HBM) in understanding and predicating the intention of diabetic patients in prevention of their foot lesions and amputations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross–sectional study was carried out on 100 diabetic patients in Yazd. The data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire in four sections. All of data were collected by direct interview and in basis of constructs of Health Belief Model (HBM). The data were analyzed by SPSS.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between mean grade scores of HBM and period of disease (P  >  0.05). There was significant difference between perceived severity, perceived benefits and barriers and level of education of patients (P  <  0.000). There was no significant difference between the foot care and period of disease (P  >  0.05). The mean grade scores of knowledge, constructs of HBM and practice of participants about foot care was as follows: Mean grade score of knowledge 4.87 out of 12, perceived susceptibility 12.33 out of 20, perceived severity 14.56 out of 20, perceived threat 26.88 out of 40, perceived benefits 13.33 out of 20, perceived barriers 12.08 out of 20 and mean grade score of practice in foot care was 3.81 out of 10.  
DISCUSSION: The findings of this study showed that higher mean grade scores of knowledge and constructs of HBM resulted in better foot care by the patients. So our results and results of many other studies carried out on HBM, revealed that HBM constructs may change and improve behavior in participants.

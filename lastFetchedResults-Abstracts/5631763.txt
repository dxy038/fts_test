A simple mathematical model for cancer chemotherapy from the literature is given by an optimal control problem over a finite horizon with control constraint and dynamics given by a bilinear system. We describe some aspects of its synthesis of optimal controls for the cases of an L<sub>1</sub>- or L<sub>2</sub>-objective in the control. In the first case optimal controls are bang-bang while a saturated smooth control is optimal for the quadratic objective

This paper proceeds with economic unit dispatch method and makes research on reasonable coping strategies of the wind power accommodation problem. <sup>1</sup> In order to accommodate more wind power in unit dispatch, while also takes into account the security and reliability standards of power system operation as well as the economic requirement, 3 optimization models of unit commitment are proposed from different aspects: discarded wind power, unit operational cost and system risk. A multi-objective optimization model is also proposed to integrate the 3 aspects. Quantum-behaved PSO algorithm and fuzzy multi-objective model are both used to solve these models. The above mentioned models and algorithms are applied to the calculation of a 10 unitsÂ´ case, result analysis showed the modeling method of this paper pointed out a good way in unit commitment considering wind power accommodation.

This article discusses numerical simulations of thin film bulk acoustic wave resonators. FBAR simulation with 1D analytical model permits to quickly determine resonator layers thickness that correspond to the objective resonant frequency. 3D finite element method permits to investigate the effect of the electrode shape on the spurious modes that are present in the electrical impedance. In order to reduce or to suppress those modes, solutions have to be investigated.

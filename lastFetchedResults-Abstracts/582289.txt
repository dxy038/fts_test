The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of real exchange rate volatility on export of agricultural sector in Iran over period of 1974-2007. For this purpose, first, the exchange rate volatility index was estimated using EGARCH(0,1) and then, in an econometric model, the effect of exchange rate volatility index on export of agricultural sector was determined. The results of Saikkonen and Lutkepohl co-integration test showed that there was at least one co-integration vector between variables of the model. The results of co-integration vector estimation using the FMOLS approach indicated that exchange rate volatility had a significant negative effect on export of agricultural sector. Also, the empirical results showed that, in the long- run, the world GDP and Iranâ€™s GDP variables had significant positive and the export price index had a negative effect on agricultural export. Based on the empirical results, in order to increase agricultural export, adopting policies to decrease the exchange rate volatility was recommended.

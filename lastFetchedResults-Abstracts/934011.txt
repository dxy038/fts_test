Todayâ€™s environmental issues along with tough regulations and business matters force the manufacturers to pay more attention to the reverse supply chain conceptand manufacturers focus on finding solutions for recovery, reusable, reprocessing, scrap and recycling materials. Activities of reverse supply chain include flow of returned products, from finalized customer to upward flow of commercial or manufacturers or suppliers. In this research, distributionconsidersas an effective factors of reverse supply chain that are continuously in uncertain  and probability condition, therefore it must be designed a model that responses to customers needs with least delay time and high flexibility and low cost of supply chain.
Finally, the results of multi objective mathematic model with different goals increasing profitability, decreasing cost and travel times and distance. Reverse supply chain problem because of being in NP-Hard problems unable to be solved   by Gradient methods then we have to use the other methods just like as Genetic Algorithm for optimizing distribution in reverse supply chain.

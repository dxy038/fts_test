of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran were selected by stratified
random sampling. In order to measure the social health of the employees,
Keyes social health questionnaire was used. This questionnaire measured five
social health components- social cohesion, social prosperity, social acceptance,
participation and social adaptation. The data analysis was conducted using
Non-parametric correlation (c2) and Kendallâ€™s test by SPSS 20 with the significance
level of 0.05.
Results: Most of the participants (51.7%) had medium social health, and 17.8%
had low social health. There was a significant correlation between social health
and gender, education and accommodations (p  <  0.05); but no significant relationship
was found between social health and age, marital and employment
status.
Conclusion: Health system will have a good performance if the issues and
needs of employees are considered in designing and managing it. The results

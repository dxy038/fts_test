The objective of our research was to determine, using model studies, changes in anthocyanin concentrations in solutions of red cabbage preparation during storage, in relation to pH, time and temperature of storage, oxygen availability, and ascorbic acid concentration. Pigment degradation increased with increasing pH, storage time and temperature. The addition of ascorbic acid and oxygen availability also contributed to the decomposition of anthocyanins. Pigment concentration was affected most by storage time and temperature. However, colour parameters were affected most by pH and the concentration of ascorbic acid.

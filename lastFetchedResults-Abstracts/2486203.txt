One to one semi-structured interviews were continued until a level of information saturationwas reached and no new themes were emerging. Each  woman's believe about IUD and her reasons for not using IUD as a contraceptive method was asked by interviewer. Also all participants were asked about the official (leaflets, health care  professionals, books and school) and unofficial (personal narratives recounted by friends and relatives) sources of their information. Eleven interviews were conducted in total.

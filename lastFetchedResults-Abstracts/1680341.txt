The thermochemical dissociation of CO2 and H2O from reactive SnO nanopowders is studied via thermogravimetry analysis. SnO is first produced by solar thermal dissociation of SnO2 using concentrated solar radiation as the high-temperature energy source. The process targets the production of CO and H2 in separate reactions using SnO as the oxygen carrier and the syngas can be further processed to various synthetic liquid fuels. The global process thus converts and upgrades H2O and captured CO2 feedstock into solar chemical fuels from high-temperature solar heat only, since the intermediate oxide is not consumed but recycled in the overall process. The objective of the study was the kinetic characterization of the H2O and CO2 reduction reactions using reactive SnO nanopowders synthesized in a high-temperature solar chemical reactor. SnO conversion up to 88% was measured during H2O reduction at 973 K and an activation energy of 51 ± 7 kJ/mol was identified in the temperature range of 798-923 K. Regarding CO2 reduction, a higher temperature was required to reach similar SnO conversion (88% at 1073 K) and the activation energy was found to be 88 ± 7 kJ/mol in the range of 973-1173 K with a CO2 reaction order of 0.96. The SnO conversion and the reaction rate were improved when increasing the temperature or the reacting gas mole fraction. Using active SnO nanopowders thus allowed for efficient and rapid fuel production kinetics from H2O and CO2.

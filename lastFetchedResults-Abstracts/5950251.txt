Temporal Petri nets are used to represent the external functionality of the Petri net models. The objective is to present a systematic approach to the construction of functional abstractions of a class of Petri net models which represent typical components of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). Place transition Petri nets are used as the specification language. The structure of the generic models of the primary components of FMSs and properties of the corresponding functional abstractions are discussed. Temporal Petri nets are introduced and the application of some of the structural techniques to the construction of functional abstractions is discussed. A method for systematic construction of functional abstractions is proposed. This method is used to construct the functional abstraction of the Petri net model of the machining station

Shear-wave velocity ( ) is an important parameter used for site characterization in geotechnical engineering. However, dispersion curve inversion is challenging for most inversion methods due to its high non-linearity and mix-determined trait. In order to overcome these problems, in this study, a joint inversion strategy is proposed based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The seismic data considered for designing the objects are the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve and seismic refraction travel time. For joint inversion, the objective functions are combined into a single function. The proposed algorithm is tested on two synthetic datasets, and also on an experimental dataset. The synthetic models demonstrate that the joint inversion of Rayleigh wave and travel time return a more accurate estimation of VS in comparison with the single inversion Rayleigh wave dispersion curves. To prove the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it in a sample site in the city of Tabriz located in the NW of Iran. For a real dataset, we use refraction microtremor (ReMi) as a passive method for getting the Rayleigh wave dispersion curves. Using the PSO joint inversion, a three-layer subsurface model was delineated.The results obtained for the synthetic datasets and field dataset show that the proposed joint inversion method significantly reduces the uncertainties in the inverted models, and improves the revelation of boundaries.

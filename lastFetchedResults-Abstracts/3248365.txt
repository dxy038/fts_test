We propose a new evolutionary algorithm (EA) for single-objective 0/1 knapsack problem, which uses a single variation operator called masked mutation. The proposed EA outperforms the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm for 0/1 knapsack problem, which is shown to outperform Genetic Algorithms for 0/1 knapsack problem. The proposed EA generates profits that are equal to or nearly equal to that produced by the classical approximation algorithm for 0/1 knapsack problem.

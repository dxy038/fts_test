Salesperson's performance is one of the hot topics in marketing. In this study researchers provide a model for identification of factors affect three different types of salesperson's performance (behavioral, sales present, and objective). The model was tested with SEM approach by application of LISREL 8.5. A sample encompass 165 salespeopl from food industry were used for data gathering. Final results showed that job involvement has the greatest effect on objective performance and working hard has the greatest effect on sales present and behavioral performance. Results also revealed that objectives ales performance is a function of sales present and behavioral performance. This study indicated that for explanting effects of job perceptions (involvement, conflict and satisfaction) it is important to assume working hard as a mediator variable.

The objective of this paper is to find ways to determine the splitting surface to calm down angles swing to prevent collapse of the whole system. First, generators of the disturbed power system is set in several groups according to the prediction of the critical unstable mode of electric power system in this paper. The hookup of electric power system is turned to non-directed graph with weighted nodes. The node groups with unstable generators to be separated are searched by method of graph theory in order that each group is with minimized unbalanced electric power and the branches to be cut off constitute the splitting surfaces. The New England power system with 10 generators and 39 nodes are adopted to verify the proposed method, the following simulations show that the rotor angles swinging of each subsystem is soon calmed down if the system is islanded according the determined splitting surface

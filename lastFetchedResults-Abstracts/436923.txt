We describe the case of 6-day-old baby girl with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, aortic atresia, hypoplastic aortic arch, and patent ductus arteriosus. She underwent Starnes procedure combined with the Norwood procedure. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated good left ventricular function, reduced size of the right ventricle, and an unobstructed aortic arch. She was discharged and is currently awaiting a bidirectional Glenn operation.

Multi-objective extension group decision-making is a new tool which integrates matter-element extension, group decision-making and multi-objective optimization. This paper studies multi-objective conversion and standardization, extension association optimization under entropy and the extension decision-making space under preference of the group decision-making; as a result, comparison and selection of objects in changing environment can be made, and systematic decisionmaking problems of multi-objective conversion and multiproject optimization in multi-objective decision-making can be solved, thus improving the accuracy and the reliability of group decision-making.

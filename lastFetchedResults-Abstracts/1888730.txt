Background
logical status may be an important predictor of outcome and patient satisfaction after treatment for rotator cuff disease. Few prior studies have considered these factors. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress and its effect on self-assessed pain, disability, and health-related quality of life in patients scheduled for rotator cuff repair.
als and methods
essed 107 consecutive patients preoperatively using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); visual analog scale pain score; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scale; Korean Shoulder Scale (KSS); and World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale, Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Preoperative demographic, clinical, and radiologic parameters were also evaluated.
s
 patients, 28 (26.2%) had depression and 25 (23.4%) had anxiety. The HADS depression score was positively correlated with the visual analog scale pain score (P = .048) and negatively correlated with the ASES, KSS, and WHOQOL-BREF scores (P = .005, P = .004, and P &lt; .0001, respectively). The HADS anxiety score was negatively correlated with the ASES, KSS, and WHOQOL-BREF scores (P = .034, P = .037, and P &lt; .0001, respectively). On multivariate analysis with a linear regression model, the HADS depression score was an independent predictor of ASES, KSS, and WHOQOL-BREF scores (P = .02, P = .005, and P = .001, respectively).
sion
sion and anxiety had a negative impact on self-assessed outcome measurements in patients scheduled for rotator cuff repair. Depression was a strong predictor of functional disability and health-related quality of life. Our results suggest that preoperative psychological status may influence postoperative outcome after rotator cuff repair and thus is an essential part of preoperative assessment.

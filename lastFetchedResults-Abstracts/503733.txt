BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Stent fracture (SF), in peripheral vessels and although in coronary arteries has been reported. Very late and after one year stent thrombosis in drug eluting stent (DES) is a rare phenomenon and its most frequent cause is discontinuation of clopidogrel. Considering SF and stent thrombosis occurring together could result in lethal cardiac events; its recognition has considerable importance. This report presents a case of stent fracture and very late stent thrombosis.

CASE: In this report a 59-year-old male patient was presented for whom coronary angiography and angioplasty were performed. We put a stent for him. While he was in good condition until 15 months after angioplasty, he was suddenly presented with chest pain and cardiac arrest and was admitted in the hospital. His life was saved with DC shock. Repeat coronary angiography was performed for him which showed SF accompanied by thrombosis as the cause of acute myocardial infarction.

CONCLUSION: Stent thrombosis may occur lately after DES and although it is rare, one of its causes is SF and the clinical presentation is usually dangerous and lethal.

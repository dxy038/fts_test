The development of transportation networks is a major challenge for companies providing transportation. In fact they have to provide a high quality of service raised in term of comfort, regularity and punctuality with increasingly demanding users primarily in cases of emergency. CISIT (The International Campus on Safety and Intermodality in Transportation) has the objective to realize an optimal management of multimodal chains. In this context we find our project This paper presents an interactive, effective and intelligent regulation support system (RSS). The objective is to regulate a disturbed multimodal transport network by assisting the regulators in the evaluation and the choice of the most efficient decision. In our approach the traffic regulation is obtained thanks to communication, collaboration and negotiation between heterogeneous agents who are able to detect perturbations, analyze, propose and evaluate solutions using choquet integral.

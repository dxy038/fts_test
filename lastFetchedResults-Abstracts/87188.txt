The objective of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) is produced locally in the bovine corpus luteum (CL) and whether NO mediates prostaglandin F2(alpha) (PGF2(alpha))-induced regression of the bovine CL in vivo. The local production of NO was determined in early I, early II, mid, late, and regressed stages of CL by determining NADPH-d activity and the presence of inducible and endothelial NO synthase immunolabeling. To determine whether inhibition of NO production counteracts the PGF2(alpha)-induced regression of the CL, saline (10 ml/h; n = 10) or a nonselective NOS inhibitor (N(alpha)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester dihydrochloride [L-NAME]; 400 mg/h; n = 9) was infused for 2 h on Day 15 of the estrous cycle into the aorta abdominalis of Holstein/Polish Black and White heifers. After 30 min of infusion, saline or cloprostenol, an analogue of PGF2(alpha) (aPGF2(alpha); 100 µg) was injected into the aorta abdominalis of animals infused with saline or L-NAME. NADPH-diaphorase activity was present in bovine CL, with the highest activity at mid and late luteal stages (P < 0.05). Inducible and endothelial NO synthases were observed with the strongest immunolabeling in the late CL (P < 0.05). Injection of aPGF2(alpha) increased nitrite/nitrate concentrations (P < 0.01) and inhibited P4 secretion (P < 0.05) in heifers that were infused with saline. Infusion of L-NAME stimulated P4 secretion (P < 0.05) and concomitantly inhibited plasma concentrations of nitrite/nitrate (P < 0.05). Concentrations of P4 in heifers infused with L-NAME and injected with aPGF2(alpha) were higher (P < 0.05) than in animals injected only with aPGF2(alpha). The PGF2(alpha) analogue shortened the cycle length compared with that of saline (17.5 ± 0.22 days vs. 21.5 ± 0.65 days P < 0.05). LNAME blocked the luteolytic action of the aPGF2(alpha) (22.6 ± 1.07 days vs. 17.5 ± 0.22 days, P < 0.05). These results suggest that NO is produced in the bovine CL. NO inhibits luteal steroidogenesis and it may be one of the components of an autocrine/paracrine luteolytic cascade induced by PGF2(alpha).

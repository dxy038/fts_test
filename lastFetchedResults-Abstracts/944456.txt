To investigate the effects of aerosol pollen on human health, we carried out a time-series analysis of daily general practitioner consultations for allergic rhinitis (AR) in Beijing. The objective of this study was to assess the possible effects of pollen on clinic visits for allergic rhinitis in Beijing during the pollen season. We found a strong association between the concentration of pollen in ambient air and the number of consultations for allergic rhinitis. Females had significantly more outpatient visits than males when the levels of pollen increased. Young people (20â€“60 years old) had had significantly more outpatient visits than older people (over 60 years old) when the levels of pollen increased. After adjusting for air pollutants, the relative risks of pollen on daily number of outpatient for AR were increased.

Every day there is a power cut from the Grid around 3 to 4 hours and this force to use Diesel generators in ISM Dhanbad. ISM Dhanbad is located in Jharkhand state in India and around 7000 students and faculties are in ISM premises. Around 1.4Tonne/day food and kitchen waste generates in ISM campus and 4.9 kwh/m<sup>2</sup>/d annual average solar radiation is available in Dhanbad. In this paper optimal design of grid connected rooftop Solar PV with mechanical solar tracking system and BARCÂ´s NISARGUNA food waste biogas plant is proposed. Diesel generators are added to insure the uninterrupted power supply and no any power storage system considered. The main objective is to utilize the renewable energy resources and also decrease the as much as operating time of diesel generator and minimize the cost function. In order to achieve this, electrical energy production by PV solar panels with fixed axis, single axis horizontal tracking, dual axis tracking modules are compared. The technical and economic analysis was done to figure out the size and cost of energy for different types of resources combination and optimized cost of this hybrid energy system. The optimal design, economic analysis, DG running period, sensitive analysis, Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and simulation is done by HOMER.

The role of the structural properties of large scale systems for the synthesis of feasible control schemes is investigated in this paper. The feasibility of considering a state variable as an output (control objective) of a system is expressed via the concepts of multi-input connectability and structural functional controllability. It is shown, that these concepts can be formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems and efficient algorithms are presented for the determination of the above notions as well as for accessability and structural controllability. Two examples illustrate the concepts and the proposed approach.

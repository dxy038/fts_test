We address the sequencing of requests in an automated storage/retrieval system with dedicated storage. We consider the block sequencing approach, where a set of storage and retrieval requests is given beforehand and no new requests come in during operation. The objective for this static problem is to find a route of minimal total travel time in which all storage and retrieval requests may be performed. The problem of sequencing a list of retrievals is equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and thus NP-hard in general. We show that the special case of sequencing under the dedicated storage policy can be solved in polynomial time. The results apply to systems with arbitrary positions of the input and output stations. This generalizes the models in the literature, where only combined input/output stations are considered. Furthermore we identify a single command area in the rack. At the end we evaluate the model against heuristic procedures.

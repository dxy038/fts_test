Background: Various plants are used in traditional medicine to increase fertility and to affect fetus gender.
Objective: The effects of chicory roots and fennel and dill seeds water extracts on fertility rate and neonate gender in rats were studied.
Methods: 184 Wistar rats weighing 230-250 g in 4 groups each comprising 23 males and 23 females kept separate from each other were used. Water without extract was gavaged to the control group and chicory, fennel and dill extracts were gavaged at the doses of 45, 100 and 100 mg/kg respectively to each of the other 3 groups for 5 weeks. During the fifth week, each male rat was put close to one female rat in a separate cage to mate. The number of parturitions and number and gender of neonates were determined later.
Results: The number of parturient rats and the total number of neonates in the fennel group were increased very significantly compared to the control group and other groups (?2 = 18.65, p  <  0.01), but the number of male and female neonates in the fennel group and the number of parturient rats, total number of neonates and number of male and female neonates in the chicory and dill groups did not differ significantly from the control group (p  >  0.05).
Conclusion: Fennel increases fertility rate and neonates number in rats, but chicory and dill do not have such effects. None of the plants affect the neonates' gender in rats.

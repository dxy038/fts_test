A control optimization technique using the continuous adjoint of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations is implemented for aeroacoustic optimization of plane jet flows. The purpose of the adjoint equations is to provide sensitivity information, which is afterwards used in a gradient-based minimization of a prescribed cost functional, designed to describe the far-field sound pressure level (SPL). The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the ability to reduce the sound in the near far-field of plane jets. Furthermore, as the continuous adjoint approach can become inaccurate, due to inconsistencies between the continuous and the discretized system, the accuracy of the continuous adjoint approach is investigated. The considered cases exhibit a nozzle exit Reynolds number of Rejet = ρujetD/μ = 2000 and a Mach number of Mjet = 0.9, performed using two-dimensional direct numerical simulation and three-dimensional large-eddy simulation, respectively. A comparison of the obtained gradient via adjoint and finite differences is presented and it is shown, that in order to obtain reliable gradient directions, the length of the optimization time needs to be restricted. Furthermore, a receding horizon optimization for the two-dimensional plane jet simulation is used to obtain a sound reduction over much longer time intervals. The influence of different formulations of the viscosity in the adjoint equations is finally investigated.

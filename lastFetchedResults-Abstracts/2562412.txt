BACKGROUND: Camel and sheep have high disperse and tolerance in tropical regions. But different results of harsh condition tolerance ability of them have been reported.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the heat stress tolerance in camel and sheep by evaluating changes in blood serum metabolites and to report and compare the serum biochemical profile of sheep and camel during long heat stress of warm summer.
METHODS: In this experiment, blood metabolites of camel and sheep were taken and compared with each other in four consecutive months during warm months (high summer).
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the values of urea, glucose, total protein, albumin, phosphors, calcium, ALT, ALP, uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, total bilirubin, and LDH of sheep and camels. Overall urea, glucose, total protein, albumin, phosphors, and calcium values were significantly higher in camels compared to sheep (p<0.01). Oppositely, sheep had significant higher values for uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, total bilirubin, and LDH (p<0.01). However AST and creatinine were not significantly different between sheep and camels.
CONCLUSIONS: Sheep sensitivity to heat stress was appeared in increasing in uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, total bilirubin, and LDH values compared to camel; so as it might be told sheep had more lipolysis-pattern during heat stress; their high blood LDH and total bilirubin were signs of red blood cell rupture or liver damage; and significant higher blood uric acid value in sheep makes them susceptive to a kidney problem such as gout.

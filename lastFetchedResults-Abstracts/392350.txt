Objective: The purpose of this study was to reveal movements of individual structures of the larynx during swallowing. Methods: Subjects were 7 healthy adults, aged 24 to 32 years (average 27 years), who had no organic or functional disease of the pharynx and larynx and 2 adults with unilateral recurrent nerve palsy, aged 49 and 60 years, respectively. We used the Toshiba IIDR system, which is composed of an X-ray TV system and a digital image managing circuit. One-fifth diluted Omnipark 300 was used as contrast medium (lohexol), with 15 cc for each swallow. The mask image for subtraction was designated as the frame before laryngeal elevation during swallowing for subtraction. We obtained the images for observation and analysis after subtracting the mask image from continuously obtained images. These images were captured into a personal computer at 30 frames per s and thereafter frame-by-frame observation and analysis were performed by means of NIH image 1.56. Results: We observed that the vocal folds underwent a series of movements during swallowing. (1) They adduct slowly and do not ascend; (2) then begin to ascend and continue adducting; whereby (3) they abduct for a moment while ascending. (4) Again, they adduct and achieve closure. (5) While maintaining closure, vocal folds elevate further to reach their maximal elevation; and (6) begin to abduct rapidly while maintaining maximal elevation. Finally, (7) they begin to descend and undergo repeated irregular abduction and adduction while descending. In examining the relationship between closure and opening at levels of the vocal fold and false vocal fold, we found that closure at the false vocal fold level precedes that at the vocal fold level and that opening at the vocal fold level precedes that at the level of the false vocal fold. Conclusion: Closure of the false vocal fold level appears important in the protection of the lower respiratory tract during swallowing.

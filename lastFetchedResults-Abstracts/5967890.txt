The advanced research in robotics scientific discipline has produced a paradigm shift from the classical robot manipulator used only in industrial environment to the modern mobile robot viewed as an every day life ldquopartnerrdquo. This first objective of this paper is to offer a short but comprehensive history of the paradigm shifts that triggered the industrial robotics research advancements. The short list of paradigm shifts that are to be discussed include: computer integrated manufacturing and engineering systems (C.I.M.E. - 1976), flexible manufacturing systems (FMS - psila80), lean manufacturing (psila90), agile manufacturing, fractal and/or holonic manufacturing systems (psila90), intelligent manufacturing systems (2000). The second objective is to discuss generic design principles and architecture guidelines for the development of a complex robotic system. These include collaborative robotics, artificial intelligence, human-robot interaction, multi-agent systems, service oriented architecture.

In this paper, we develop a vision based formation control of quad-rotor UAVs using a monocular camera. A Lyapunov based approach is used to derive the controller. The objective of the controller for the follower UAV is to keep the leader vehicle at a desired bearing angle in its field-of-view. Also a desired fixed distance is maintained by using the size of the UAV as seen the image plane of the camera. Two cases of leader-follower formation are considered: (1) linear formation and (2) triangular formation. Supporting simulation results are included.

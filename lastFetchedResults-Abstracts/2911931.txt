In a tight money market the ongoing exponential increase of word power pole condemnation rates and pole replacement costs requires the revision of present approaches to the management of power pole resources. The author presents the new purely objective pole inspection method incorporating an advanced computerised hydraulic equipment technology. This fundamentally nondestructive test technique pinpoints weak poles which are below the required strength and provides a definite proof check for safe poles thus improving dramatically the safety of the distribution network and reducing the pole replacement costs to an almost absolute minimum. It is envisaged that the application of the new method will provide at least a million dollar savings per annum for a medium size power utility

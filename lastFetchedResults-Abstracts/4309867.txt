This paper deals with a multi-user downlink MIMO-OFDM scheme with perfect channel knowledge at both the transmit and receive sides. The objective is to optimize the average BER while fulfilling each userÂ´s rate and satisfying a global transmit power constraint. Space division multiple access (SDMA) is investigated and three new iterative schemes are proposed to compute the linear pre-decoders. The results exhibit, inter alia, that orthogonalizing the channels does not lead to the best results.

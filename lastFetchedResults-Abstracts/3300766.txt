We consider the problem of admitting sets of, possibly heterogenous, virtual machines (VMs) with stochastic resource demands onto physical machines (PMs) in a Cloud environment. The objective is to achieve a specified quality-of-service related to the probability of resource over-utilization in an uncertain loading condition, while minimizing the rejection probability of VM requests. We introduce a method which relies on approximating the probability distribution of the total resource demand on PMs and estimating the probability of over-utilization. We compare our method to two simple admission policies: admission based on maximum demand and admission based on average demand. We investigate the efficiency of the results of using our method on a simulated Cloud environment where we analyze the effects of various parameters (commitment factor, coefficient of variation etc.) on the solution for highly variate demands.

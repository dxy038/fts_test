Objective to optimize the isolation condition of Epidermal Cell Protoplasts within the Allium cepa L. Methods According to orthogonal experiment design L<sub>25</sub>(5<sup>6</sup>) of enzyme, osmotic pressure stabilizer(D-Mannitol), pH, enzymolysis time, we got the optimal isolation condition by the number of protoplasts. Results The optimal isolation condition is showed in results: enzymolysis time 2h, pH 5.5, D-Mannitol 0.6 mol/L, 1.5% cellulose and 0.1% pectolyase and 0.1%BSA, temperature 28&#176;C. It also means that optimal isolation condition is D<sub>5</sub>B<sub>3</sub>C<sub>4</sub>A<sub>2</sub>. Conclusion The optimal isolation condition is viable.

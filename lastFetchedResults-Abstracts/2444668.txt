Inroduction & Objective: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide including Iran. Several studies have demonstrated anti-cancer and apoptotic properties of phycobili proteins from different strains of cyanobacteria phycocyanin. For the first time the aim of this study was to investigate anti-cancer effects of Anabaena sp.ISC55 phycocyanin and to compare with paclitaxel, on breast cancer 4T1cell line. 
Materials and Methods: After culturing cyanobacteria, phycocyanin was specifically extracted. 4T1 breast cancer cells were cultured. Colony forming assay was performed and cytotoxicity of different concentrations (250- 200- 175-150- 125-100- 75-50- 25-20- 15-10)mg/ml of phycocyanin and paclitaxel was tested by MTT assay and adhesion test after 24 hours incubation with cultured cells. The effects of these concentrations on the morphological features of cells was evaluated under inverted microscope. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test as post hoc. 
Results:The results indicate an increase in anti-cancer properties phycocyanin in high concentrations by increasing apoptosis with a significance level of P  < 0.001. 
Conclusion: According to the results, Anabaena sp.ISC55 phycocyanin has dose dependent anti-cancer properties.

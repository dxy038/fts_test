The main objective of this research is to investigate how the somatotopic representation of motor cortex changes along no-use of affected facial muscles. We use Bell´s palsy patients who has degenerated peripheral lesion and muscle paralysis. Using MR imaging technology and electromyography, we compared the functional activity and connectivity of BOLD signal and the cortical thickness on the relevant motor cortex. We found less functional activities, fewer functional connectivity, and thinner cortical thickness in the relevant brain ROI to the muscle contraction, which is showing a negative neuroplasticity. Then it could be speculated that this negative plasticity might induce the poor prognosis of muscle paralysis in Bell´s palsy.

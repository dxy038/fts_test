This paper presents an evolutionary system identification method for an electrical system where the friction existing in the motor used for positioning the antenna of a spacecraft is estimated. Here the system identification problem is formulated as an optimization task where the objective is to find a model and a set of parameters that minimize the prediction error between the plant output and the model output. GA is used to find unknown characteristic friction of the motor working in a spacecraft from the system input and output data which are available from the spacecraft telemetry. The overall system is implemented using SIMULINK.

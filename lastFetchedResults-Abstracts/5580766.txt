This keynote address covers methods employed to design highly reliable microsystems intended to build smart medical devices such as sensors and microstimulators. Advanced circuit techniques are used to make low-power low-voltage high reliability interfaces dedicated to wirelessly power up and bidirectional exchange various types of data with implantable devices. Special attention is paid to power management issues, inductive power links, bidirectional data links, recording of ENGs, and remote measurement of electrodes-tissues interfaces. A global view of typical micro-devices will be given and case studies related to bladder control using dual selective and permanent stimulation, and intracortical micro-stimulation to create adequate vision for the blind will be presented.

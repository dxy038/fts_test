Abstract
Introduction: Primary dysmenorrhea is common in women during reproductive age.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of acupressure on sixth spleen point (SP6) on relief of primary dysmenorrhea.
Methods: This study is a clinical trial. Students with primary dysmenorrheal living in dormitory were studied during three menstrual cycles. Pain intensity was measured on the first cycle without intervention. Subjects were divided into two parallel groups (pressure on SP6 and placebo groups), using a randomized block design with odds ratio of 1:1 based on the intensity of pain. In the second and third cycles, pressure was exerted by the samples. Pain intensity was compared with the visual analogue scale before and after intervention. Samples, person dividing the groups, data analyzer were blinded to study groups. At the end data related to 30 students in experiment group and 32 students in control group were analyzed. T test, chi-square, Friedman, Mann-Whitney and ordinal regression were used to compare the pain severity in experiment and control groups. 
results: Pain severity up to 3 hours after giving pressure on SP6 (p < 0.004) and four hours after giving pressure on control point (p < 0.001) was decreased compared to before intervention. There was no difference observed pain in groups before and after intervention. 
Conclusion: Since pain severity was less in both groups after intervention, more studies are recommended.

The aluminum/steel structural transition joints are widely used in shipbuilding industry due to the advantages of joining these two materials with important weight savings while exploiting their best properties. The research objective is the evaluation of process feasibility to laser weld structural transition joints to overcome manufacturing limitations of traditional TIG/MIG welding. This study presents results achieved during as-simulated laser welding by imposing severe thermal cycles to specimen obtained from structural transition joints with time periods longer than those normally recorded during laser welding. Metallurgical and mechanical characterization of heat treated specimen is performed to evaluate the influence of the thermal cycles on final joint properties.

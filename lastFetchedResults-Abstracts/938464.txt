A central objective of the LOIS Community Research Programme was to provide estimates of the land]ocean flux
of chemical species from the LOIS study area. In the absence of detailed information on the concentration of most
of the dissolved and particulate-associated chemical constituents, it has proved necessary to make use of the
relatively infrequent samples collected in the UK Harmonised Monitoring Scheme, in order to estimate chemical
fluxes for the LOIS rivers. In these circumstances, standard procedures may provide unreliable results, and a new
approach has been developed to derive improved estimates of chemical flux from the LOIS study area. This approach
is based on the generation of detailed synthetic time series of concentration, which are used to estimate the likely
errors associated with different flux calculation procedures, especially those resulting from differences in the timing
of chemographs and hydrographs during storm events. The approach was applied on a river by river and determinand
by determinand basis to identify and to employ the best methods for computing fluxes of 45 chemical determinands
from the LOIS study area during the period 1992]1996.

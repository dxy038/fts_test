In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based cognitive radio (CR) networks, where we try to maximize the system energy-efficiency under the consideration of many practical limitations, such as transmission power budget of the CR system, interference threshold of primary users and traffic demands of secondary users. Our general objective formulation leads to a challenging mixed integer programming problem that is hard to solve. To make it computationally tractable, we employ a time-sharing method to transform it into a non-linear fractional programming problem, which can be further converted into an equivalent convex optimization problem by using its hypogragh form. Based on these transformations, it is possible to obtain (near) optimal solution by standard optimization technique. However, the complexity of the standard technique is too high for this real-time optimization task. By exploiting the structure of the problem extensively, we develop an efficient barrier method to work out the (near) optimal solution with a reasonable complexity, significantly better than the standard technique. Numerical results show that our proposal can maximize the energy efficiency of the CR system, whilst the proposed algorithm performs quickly and stably.

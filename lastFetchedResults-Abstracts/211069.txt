Objective: Evaluation of the effect of home based graded walking exercise program on glycemic control and BMI in overweight type 2 diabetes patients.
Methods:
Design: Prospective Clinical Trial.
Subjects: overweight and obese individuals both sexes having type 2 diabetes between age group of 40-60 years.
Procedure: The research was under taken on the assigned control groups or experiments group through convenient sampling to collect base line data, while both the groups were advised to continue with standard diet and medication as prescribed by the physicians, subjects in study group underwent a supervised orientation to the aerobic walking exercise program including warm-up and cool down there after, they were asked to continue the same at home for a period of three months duration .The duration of exercise was 20 to 25 min / session initially and progressed to 30 to 45 min/ session over a period of time, 4 to 5 times / Week, and at intensity of 4- 5 on Borg’s scale RPE (Modified). Patients in study group were given log books to be maintained to ensure the regularity and adherence to the exercise regime.
Results: 21 patients in control group and 28 patients in study group completed the study duration. Study Group: n=28 (12 males, 16 females) mean Age: 50.03 ± 4.21 years. Control Group: n=21(13 males, 8 females) mean age=51±4.73 years. Results were compared between groups and within group using paired t test and unpaired t test. There was significant increase in the blood sugar levels and glycosylated hemoglobin in control group while significant reductions in study group was noted.
Conclusion: The home-based graded aerobic exercise improved the glycemic control, in obese type 2 diabetes patients as compared to control group.

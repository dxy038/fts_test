Objective: The Harmonic Scalpel (HS) (Johnson & Johnson K.K.) is a surgical tool that allows cutting and coagulation using ultrasonic mechanical vibrations. Its use in the field of otolaryngology has recently been attracting interest. In this study we applied the HS on the inferior nasal concha using a sword shaped blade (‘KATANA’). Methods: Subjects were 20 patients with intractable, perennial allergies that resisted conservative therapy. Subjective symptoms were evaluated as one of five stages, ‘symptoms disappeared’ ‘markedly improved’, ‘improved’, ‘unchanged’, and ‘aggravated’. Results: At the 12th week, 18 patients (90%) with nasal congestion, 16 (80%) with nasal discharge, and 15 (75%) with sneezing had shown at least ‘markedly improved’. Conclusion: Based on the improvement in subjective symptoms, local and histopathological findings, the HS is an effective surgical modality for these cases. We believe the HS is a safe and useful tool for nasal surgery.

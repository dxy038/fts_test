Objective
udy aimed to investigate placebo effects on gastric motility and to examine possible autonomic mediating mechanisms.
s
en healthy volunteers received a placebo pill on three occasions together with the verbal suggestion that it would stimulate, relax, or not affect gastric activity. Electrogastrogram, electrocardiogram, and electrodermal activity recordings were conducted for 30 min prior to and following intervention.
s
nt frequency of the gastric slow wave decreased in the stimulant condition, and increased in the relaxant condition, the difference among conditions being significant. No differential effects of the interventions on cardiac interbeat intervals, heart rate variability, and skin conductance levels were observed.
sion
h relaxant and stimulant placebo interventions modulated gastric motility independently from changes in general autonomic activity.

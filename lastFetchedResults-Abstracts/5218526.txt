The objective of this paper is present the voice evaluation codification using a real-time voice training system, with tactile and visual feedback based on a game, to be used by deaf people for learning of fundamental frequency. The system consist in a microcontrolled signal generator and a Matlab&#174; language routine. The signal generator is programmed using serial communication to activate a vibrotactile device. Fifty-three deaf volunteers were evaluated, in three sessions each, using five transform functions: LinearMod, Logarithmic, Quadratic, Cubic and Linear. The pitch value was evaluated, related to the target pitch established in the start of the session, personal characteristics of the volunteers (age and the sex) were considered. The obtained results show that there are not significant differences in the performance between the used transform functions.

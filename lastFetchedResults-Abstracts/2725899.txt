The China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) superconducting tokamak is a national scientific research project of China with plasma major and minor radii of 5.7 and 1.6 m, respectively. The magnetic field in the center of plasma at a radius of R = 5.7 m is 5.0 T. The major objective of the project is to build a fusion engineering tokamak reactor with fusion power within the range of 50-200 MW and should be self-sufficient by blanket. Sixteen toroidal field (TF) superconducting coils of CFETR have been arrayed toroidally and are made up of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn superconductor. The maximum magnetic field of the TF coil is 10.8 T under the operation current of 67.4 kA. The TF coil should have strong stability margin under the condition of high field and strain. This paper discusses the design parameters, electromagnetic distribution, structure, and thermal and stability analysis of the TF superconducting magnet for CFETR.

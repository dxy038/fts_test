This paper presents an intelligent control scheme which utilizes a single neuron PID controller to an experimental propeller setup called the twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS). The control objective is to make the TRMS move quickly and accurately to the desired attitudes. The pitch angle and the azimuth angle in the conditions of decoupled and cross-coupled between vertical and horizontal axes are considered. It is difficult to design a suitable controller because of the influence between two axes and nonlinear movement. For easy demonstrate the movement on the vertical plane and horizontal plane separately, the TRMS is decoupled first by the main rotor and tail rotor. After successful simulations in decoupled condition, the more difficult simulations of cross-coupled condition are performed. Simulation results show that the new approach can improve the tracking performance.

The application of reliability centered maintenance (RCM) in a system is a success into the decrease of the component failure rate and the improvement of the system reliability. One of the major activities in the RCM program is to create a simple initiation table with sufficient data which could easily be used in relative softwareÂ´s. This paper is intended to illustrate the way to create a simple and suitable RCM input data for an electrical distribution system which consists of the RCM initiation structure, the information support of RCM initiation table, the indicators evaluation and the intrinsic objective of RCM strategies implementation to an electric distribution networks. This study contains a brief presentation of the software used for RCM initiation, administration and indications assessment used for RCM strategy implementation to electric distribution network components. The proposed approach is applied to a distribution test system and the results are presented and discussed.

This paper presents the results of a series of investigations made with different sizes of walls constructed with ceramic pieces, with steel reinforcement set on mortar beds.
The produced volumetric changes are analyzed, per periods that vary between five and six months, from the construction of the walls; such are exposed to relative humidity of 95% ± 2% and 40% ± 2%. The collaboration of these reinforcement will be studied, being constructed test prisms with and without reinforcement.
The objective of the work is to find intervals of variation of the deformations, considering the relative humidity and the collaboration of these reinforcements, with the purpose of establishing recommendations for the design of the joints, so that the stresses that are generated do not produce fissures and cracks in the masonry.

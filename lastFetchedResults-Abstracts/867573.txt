Assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) is one of the well-known NP-hard layout planning problems for
mass production systems. Many exact solution approaches have been developed, including 0â€“1 integer
programming model, branch and bound algorithm, dynamic programming model, etc.; however, all optimal
approaches are computationally inefficient in solving large-scale problems, which makes heuristic
approaches a necessity in practice. In this paper we propose a new efficient heuristic, based on a recent
bidirectional approach and the famous critical path method (CPM) widely used in project management,
to resolve the issue of task assignment for ALBP. An example is given for illustration, and numerical
results of sample problems selected from the literature are also given to show the effectiveness of the
proposed heuristic.

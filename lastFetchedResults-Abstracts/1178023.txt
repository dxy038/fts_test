Very metal-deficient stars that exhibit enhancements of their carbon abundances are of crucial importance for understanding a number of issues – the nature of stellar evolution among the first generations of stars, the shape of the Initial Mass Function, and the relationship between carbon enhancement and neutron-capture processes, in particular the astrophysical s-process. One recent discovery from objective-prism surveys dedicated to the discovery of metal-deficient stars is that the frequency of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars increases with declining metallicity, reaching roughly 25% for [Fe/H] < −2.5.

In order to explore this phenomenon in greater detail we have obtained medium-resolution (2 Å) spectroscopy for about 350 of the 413 objects in the Christlieb et al. catalog of carbon-rich stars, selected from the Hamburg/ESO objective prism survey on the basis of their carbon-enhancement, rather than metal deficiency. Based on these spectra, and near-IR JHK photometry from the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, we obtain estimates of [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] for most of the stars in this sample, along with reasonably accurate determinations of their radial velocities. Of particular importance, we find that the upper envelope of carbon enhancement observed for these stars is nearly constant, at [C/H] ∼ −1.0, over the metallicity range −4.0 < [Fe/H] < −2.0; this same level of [C/H] applies to the most iron-deficent star yet discovered, HE 0107-5240, at [Fe/H] = -5.3.

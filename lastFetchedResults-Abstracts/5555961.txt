In this paper we present a text-independent automatic speaker verification system that works in the compressed domain using GSM AMR coded speech. While traditional approaches process LPC-based cepstral coefficients extracted from LPC related bitstream coefficients, our objective is to study the feasibility of a system that directly processes the raw bitstream transmitted over a digital communication network. In a text-independent closet-set task, with a database of 100 speakers, the proposed system achieves an EER equal to 5.93%, 4.41% and 3.80% for 10, 20 and 30 second long test speech segments respectively.

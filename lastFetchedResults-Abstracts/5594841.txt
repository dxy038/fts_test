Analytical parameter multi-objective design approach is extended to nonlinear systems applications through a combination with controlled Lyapunov function. The potential benefits of this combined approach are on two fronts. From the control perspective, the CLF guarantees the stability. From the performance perspective, the cost functions adopted from AMPOS will help to address multi-objectives, and the optimization process may lead to better design. A nonlinear benchmark problem is then used to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Introduction: The premenstrual syndrome is characterised by Physical and Psychological symptoms apearing regularly during the week prior to menstruation and disappearing within a few days of its onset, causing disruption to occuptional, family and personal functioning. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Hypericum is useful in releving the symtoms of premenstrual syndrome, but as yet there has been no clinical investingation of this.
Objective: To compare the efficacy of Hypericum with placebo to treat the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.
Methods: A double blind, placebo controlled, randomised design was used in the clinical study. 70 Students of Tehran University with premenstrual syndrome who were in otherwise good Physical and mental health, completed Daily symptom Ratings for two cycles. Then participants devided were in two groups (active 35, Placebo 35) and took Hypericum or placebo for two complete menstrual cycles (2 30 drops for 7 days before menstruation).
Results: Hypericum obtained a mean reduction of %46.45, in symptoms and placebo %18.1. There were significant reductions in all symptoms between two groups. (p=0.000) Treatment was well tolerated and there was not any discontinuation or complication with Hypericum. Conclusion: Hypericum treats premenstrual syndrome, and offers a therapy limited to the luteal phase for at least two cycles.

Given the need for interpretive traditions and the decisive role of Imam Sadiq (a.s.) in presenting these narrations, taking cognizance of the interpretive method of this honorable Imam will highly contribute to the development of interpretation, particularly among the Shiite researchers and interpreters. In this paper, the interpretive methods of Imam Sadiq (a.s.) have been investigated on the basis of an applied approach. To fulfill this objective, nearly most of the interpretive traditions of Imam Ja'far ibn-Muhammad (a.s.) had to be examined which, in turn, was a laborious task. The-Quran-through-Quran interpretation method, the-Quran-through-sunnah interpretation method, literal interpretation, jary (applicability) and tatbiq (comparison) are among the issues tackled in this paper.

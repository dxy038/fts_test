Due to their nature, vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as jamming attack. The objective of a jammer is to interfere with legitimate wireless communications, and to degrade the overall QoS of the network. In this paper, we propose a model to detect a particular class of jamming attack, in which the jammer transmits only when valid radio activity is signaled from its radio hardware. This detection model is based upon the measurement of error distribution.

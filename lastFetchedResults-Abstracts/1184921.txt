The objective of this study is to assess the effects of soil–structure interaction on the response of seismically isolated bridge piers founded on a shallow soil stratum overlying a rigid bedrock and to develop a method that considers soil–structure interaction and can be easily applied to the preliminary design of bridges. The relative importance of several parameters of the bridge-isolators-soil system is examined. Cases in which soil–structure interaction needs to be incorporated in seismically isolated bridge design are identified and ways to take advantage of soil–structure interaction in order to enhance the safety level and reduce design costs are recommended.

This paper addresses predictive control of constrained LPV systems. The objective is to optimize nominal performance while guaranteeing robust stability and constraint satisfaction. The latter goal is achieved by exploiting invariant sets and a receding horizon optimization procedure which provides a nonlinear correction to the nominal gain scheduled linear feedback. Feasibility domains for the gain scheduled and predictive controller are evaluated.

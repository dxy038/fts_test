The main objective of this paper is to determine the
potential and electric-field distributions along a typical ceramic
extremely-high-voltage post insulator covered with atmospheric ice
during a melting period. Commercial software, Coulomb 3D, based
on the boundary element method (BEM), was used for all of the
three-dimensional modeling and simulations. It was demonstrated
that the BEM is well suited for evaluating the effect of ice shedding
on the potential and electric-field distributions along an ice-covered
insulator during a melting period. The results obtained show that
the length and number of ice free zones, also called air gaps, are the
major parameters that affect the applied voltage distribution along
an ice-covered insulator. The meanelectric field per arcing distance,
affected mainly bythe air-gap lengths, can provide a goodindication
of the presence of partial arcing along the different air gaps.

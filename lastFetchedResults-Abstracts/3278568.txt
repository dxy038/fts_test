Principles to determine dielectric constant and loss tangent measurement using Agilent 85070E Dielectric Probe Kit 200 MHz to 50 GHz technique is presented in this paper. The experiment objective was to measure the dielectric constant and loss tangent of Leucaena Leucocephala (Local Malaysian name Petai Belalang) material that laminated by Polypropylene Polymer. The Fabricated proposed boards were studied in the frequency range of 2.2 to 3.3 GHz since later this board will be used in ISM band application that occupied 2.45 GHz frequency spectrum. The parameter composition of proposed board on this paper was focused only one density composition that is 70% of polypropylene and 30% of leucaena leucocephala filler wood. The overall moisture content of the filler was maintained less than 5%. The proposed board were only be analyzed in term of filler particle size of 100&#956;M, 150&#956;M, 200&#956;M and 500&#956;M. All proposed board with different particle size were analyzed and compared with fabrication of 100% of polypropylene board, Teflon and commercial FR4 material board to find the best potential and all the board were thoroughly been analyzed in a room temperature of 26 degree Celsiusand humidity about 30% to 50% at relativehumidityand all result obtained were form as data and graph analysis.

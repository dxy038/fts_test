ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the problems in midwifery is labor induction in the cases in whom the termination of pregnancy is necessary. Thus, the methods for cervical ripening and labor induction have always been considered. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intramuscular dexamethasone on onset of labor in postdate pregnancy.
METHODS: This single-blind, randomized clinical trial study was performed on 100 nulliparous women who referred to Amir Al Momenin hospital in Ahvaz. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Single dose of intramuscular dexamethasone (8 mg) was administered to study group 12 h before induction. The controls were given 2 cc of normal saline at the same interval. 
FINDINGS: A significant difference was not seen between two groups according to age, demographic characteristics, initial Bishop score, first and fifth minute Apgar score and meconium. Mean of Bishop score after injection in study and control groups was 7.23±1.32 and 2.98±0.89, respectively (p < 0001). The mean time interval of induction to the onset of active phase in study and control groups was 3.1±0.68 h and 4.2±1.3 h, respectively (p=0.001). 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that intramuscular dexamethasone by improving Bishop score causes the onset of labor pains in postdate pregnancies.

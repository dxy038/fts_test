The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the thermal performance of diverse wood-based panels in small-scale test cells of 1 m × 1 m × 1 m of internal volume. The thermal evaluations took place under the climatic conditions of Curitiba, Brazil (latitude 25.5°S, elevation 917 m above sea level), which is characterized by a subtropical climate with high daily and annual amplitudes of the air temperature. The research comprised of the following steps: (1) heat flux measurements through each panel configuration; (2) indoor temperature measurements under summer and winter climatic conditions. Reference material for indoor temperature comparisons was a prototype made with ordinary ceramic bricks, plastered on both sides. Air temperature measurements were carried out with data-loggers, heat flux plates were attached to an exposed north facade of each test cell, while incoming solar radiation was measured with an experimental solarimeter.

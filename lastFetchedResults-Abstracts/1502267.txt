This paper presents a comprehensive review of all significant research applying computational optimisation to sustainable building design problems. A summary of common heuristic optimisation algorithms is given, covering direct search, evolutionary methods and other bio-inspired algorithms. The main summary table covers 74 works that focus on the application of these methods to different fields of sustainable building design. Key fields are reviewed in detail: envelope design, including constructions and form; configuration and control of building systems; renewable energy generation; and holistic optimisations of several areas simultaneously, with particular focus on residential and retrofit. Improvements to the way optimisation is applied are also covered, including platforms and frameworks, algorithmic comparisons and developments, use of meta-models and incorporation of uncertainty. Trends, including the rise of multi-objective optimisation, are analysed graphically. Likely future developments are discussed.

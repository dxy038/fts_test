To examine reliability of test, the test was performed on 15 individuals again two weeks after the initial test and the Pearson correlation was assessed.

Results: There are significant differences between mean scores of right and left ears (P<0.001). Content Validity Ratio was 0.8-1 for every item. Pearson correlation was 0.83 for test-retest (P<0.001). Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha and Intra Class Correlation (ICC) was 0.81 and 0.84 for internal correlation between scores of lists of test. The result showed that there is significant correlation between the lists.

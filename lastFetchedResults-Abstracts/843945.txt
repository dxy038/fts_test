An impulsive Cohen–Grossberg-type bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with distributed delays is studied. Some new sufficient conditions are established for the existence and global exponential stability of a unique equilibrium without strict conditions imposed on self regulation functions. The approaches are based on Laypunov–Kravsovskii functional and homeomorphism theory. When our results are applied to the BAM neural networks, our results generalize some previously known results. It is believed that these results are significant and useful for the design and applications of Cohen–Grossberg-type bidirectional associative memory networks.

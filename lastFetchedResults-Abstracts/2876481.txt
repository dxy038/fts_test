The objective of this project of is to develop a fault detection technique for MOSFETÂ´s open circuit faults in voltage source inverter (VSI)-fed induction motor drives. This consist the analysis of the control signals and the line-to-line voltage levels during the switching time of MOSFET, under both healthy and faulty conditions which requires line-to-line voltage measurement, which provides information about switching states. The fault detection scheme is achieved by a simple hardware and it can be included in the existing inverter system. It not only detects the accurate single and multiple faults diagnosis but also minimizes the fault detection time.

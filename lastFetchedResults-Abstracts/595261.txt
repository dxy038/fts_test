Objective: To analyze the change of intraocular pressure (IOP) brought about by trabeculectomy and to analyze any further changes in intraocular pressure after trabeculectomy during three months follow-up Material and Methods: Patients who presented to eye department of Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar and were diagnosed as primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and selected for trabeculectomy were included in the study, from 1998 to 2001. History, examination and relevant investigations were performed. All cases oftrabeculectomy were analyzed and the follow up period was three months.Results: The total number ofpatients included for trabeculectomy was 44 and the total trabeculectomies performed were 50 as in six cases, bilateral operations were done. Out of44patients, 34 (77.2%0) were male and 10 (22.8%) were female. The age ofthe patients ranged from 43 to 80 years. The pre-operative intra ocular pressure ranged from 12 to 60 mm ofmercury. The lower ranged intra ocular pressure was those cases ofprimary open angle glaucoma that were on maximum medical treatment. The post-operative intra ocular pressure was recorded on 1st and 15th post-operative days, one month after surgery and three months after trabeculectomy. The mean intra ocular pressure on 1st and15th post-operative days, one month and 3 months after surgery was 10.2, 9.8, 12.55 and 10.7 mm ofmercury respectively. Overall 92% cases were declared as complete success. Conclusion: Trabeculctomy is a safe and effective procedure for primary open angle glaucoma.

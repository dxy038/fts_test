The use of multiple sensors for target acquisitions provides both redundant and complementary coverage of the target observation space. To effectively utilize the sensor suite and to reduce the number of operator tasks, a high level of automation is required. An expert system is used to control the sensor suite. The expert system acts as an interface between the operator and the multisensor system. The sensors and their modes of operation are selected by the expert system. The mode selections are dependent upon the operator objective, the environment, and the physical and logical constraints of the system. The goal is to achieve the operator objective while maintaining maximum effective usage of the overall sensor suite.

Rapid development of electric cars has raised a problem of charging batteries of them. As for the owner of the charging machines, how to make the charging jobsÂ´ schedule more efficient and more profitable is worthy of concern. Both cost related goals and operation related goals are expected to be satisfied simultaneously. This paper considered a single-machine charging job scheduling problem and proposed a fuzzy goal programming method to get an optimized cost and operational result by considering the different charging cost brought by Time-of-use price mechanism and the characteristic of batteries, which affects the charging process time, charging efficiency and charging unit power consumption. In the proposed method, a fuzzy relation model is developed to deal with the multi-objective situation to satisfy various goals, by considering the importance relation between goals. The intention of the decision maker is satisfied well. The decision maker can control the parameter to balance the emphasis on goals or on relations according to variety of manage policy. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper focuses on the optimal design of surface permanent magnet synchronous motors. A comparison between Hooke Jeeves method and genetic algorithm is presented. The mathematical model of motor is an analytical model based on the equivalent magnetic circuit considering magnetic saturation. The objective function is a global cost function that could be balanced, between initial active material cost or their total weight and motor efficiency, by choosing adequate weighting factors.

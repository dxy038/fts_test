Study objective: To determine the half-life of methanol in methanol-poisoned patients who are treated with ethanol but not with hemodialysis.

Design: Case series. Setting: University Hospital, University of Manitoba. Participants: Three methanol-poisoned patients treated with ethanol but not with hemodialysis and three similar patients identified by a literature review. Results: Plots of terminal concentration versus time data were inconsistent with zero-order kinetics and were adequately explained by an apparent first-order process. The median half-life of methanol in these patients was 43.1 hours, with a range of 30.3 to 52.0 hours. Conclusion: Because of the significantly increased risk of toxicity and complications during ethanol monotherapy, we suggest that hemodialysis be considered for methanol-poisoned patients who are treated with ethanol infusion.

In this paper, we study the problem of regenerator site (RS) selection and regenerator placement for mixed line rate optical networks (MLR-RSSRP). The objective is to minimize the total costs of RSs and regenerators for a given set of requests whose routing is flexible. We first provide the problem definition of MLR-RSSRP, and then formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). Based on a two step approach (ordering of the requests and routing of the requests), several heuristic algorithms are proposed. Numerical results show that our proposed heuristic algorithms achieve results that are very close to those of the ILP for small scale problems, and that our proposed heuristics can solve large scale problems very well.

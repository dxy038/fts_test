This paper presents a simple iterative carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) criterion for interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink systems, without using specific training sequences. The proposed estimator iteratively searches for correct CFO vector by minimizing the objective function using a first-order Taylor series approximation of the CFO vector with the one initially given. However, the proposed estimator not only can estimate CFOs, but also has less computational load. Several computer simulation results are provided for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed blind estimator.

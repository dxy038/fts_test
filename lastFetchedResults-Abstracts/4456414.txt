The objective of this research is to operate a radio-controlled car (RC car) by using Thai voice commands. The research was conducted by sending a userÂ´s voice commands to a computer machine, and then the computer converted the voice commands into digital signal. After that, the digital signal was converted into a radio wave commands. Finally, an RC car operated based on the radio wave commands. The experiment was conducted on the RC car with five Thai voice commands, which were: 1) Stop, 2) Forward, 3) Backward, 4) Turn Left, and 5) Turn Right. The experimental precisions are 98.2%, 93.0% and 44.2% in a quiet room, an office room and a noisy room, respectively.

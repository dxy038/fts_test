Airport gate assignment is to appoint a gate for the arrival or leave flight based on flights in-formation, assigning the airport gate with high efficiency and reason is a key task among the airport ground busy works. Assigning the airport gate problem is a multi-objective optimization problem, this paper is based on the literature No. 1, which gives out a multi-objective mathematic model of airport gate assignment, according as the fact of airport confirming different right for different optimized objective, and gives out there arithmetics for the multi-objective mathematic. Simulation result shows the validity of this model and algorithm.

An electric vehicle (EV) quick charging station using pulse frequency current control technique is developed in this paper. The current source modular converter configuration is used to perform the charging pulses with both positive and negative pulse to achieve time required for an EV which is less than 30 minutes. The positive pulse charge permits the high peak current charge: this will lead to quick charging mode; whereas, the idle state can control battery temperature rise. The frequency used for pulse charge technique can be varied depending on the type and condition of a battery. The use of current source converter can offer the inherit fault tolerance capability and bidirectional power flow. PSIM 9.0.3 is utilized for simulation study and the 50 kW prototype is developed to validate the proposed notion. The simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed pulse frequency charging technique requires about 16 minutes to fully charge battery from 20% of SOC at 80% of SOC. The temperature rise of pulse frequency charging technique is less than 4 &#176;C:these can lead to quicker charge and longer battery lifetime. The results suggest that the proposed technique can be applied for an electric vehicle quick charger station.

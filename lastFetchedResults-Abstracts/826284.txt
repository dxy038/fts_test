Fuel shuffling optimization procedures are proposed for the Hoger Onderwijs Reactor (HOR) in Delft, The Netherlands, a 2MWth swimming-pool type research reactor. These procedures are based on the multiple cyclic interchange approach, according to which the search for the reload pattern associated with the highest objective function value can be thought of as divided in multiple stages. The transition from the initial to the final stage is characterized by an increase in the degree of locality of the search procedure. The general idea is that, during the first stages, the ‘elite’ cluster containing the group of best patterns must be located, after which the solution space is sampled in a more and more local sense to find the local optimum in this cluster. The transition(s) from global search behaviour to local search behaviour can be either prompt, by defining strictly separate search regimes, or gradual by introducing stochastic acceptance tests. The possible objectives and the safety and operation constraints, as well as the optimization procedure, are discussed, followed by some optimization results for the HOR.

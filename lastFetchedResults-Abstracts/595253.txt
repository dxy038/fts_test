Objective: To compare the induction characteristics of two different concentrations of propofol i.e. 1% and 2% in children undergoing eye surgeries.Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional comparative study 100 consecutive patients of ASA status 1 and II coming for elective eye surgeries were divided into two groups of 50 each. Group A were given propofol 1% while patients in Group B were given propofol 2% for induction of anaesthesia and were maintained with 1% isoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Induction characteristics i.e. loss of consciousness or onset time of anaesthesia, pain on injection, spontaneous or purposeless movements, spasm just after intubation and conditions of intubation were assessed and compared in two groups. Student't test and chi- square test were applied.Results: Loss of consciousness was more rapid with propofol 2% compared with propofol 1% (40s Vs 48s; P = 0.02). Pain on injection occurred in 5(10%) and 10 (20%) patients (P = 0.09) after propofol 1% and 2% respectively. Spontaneous movements during induction occurred in 8 (16%) and 12 (24%) patients (P=0.18); satisfactory intubation was done in 40 (80%) and 45 (90%) patients (P=0.19), while spasm just after intubation was noticed in 1 ( 2%) and 3 patients (6% ), receiving propofol 1% and 2% respectively. Haemodynamic changes were not different in the two groups.Conclusions: Propofol 1% and propofol 2% are equally effective and safe for induction of anaesthesia in children undergoing eye surgeries.

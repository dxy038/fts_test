Objective: Determining the survival curve characteristics of two cancerous cells
of interest based on a common and a novel MTT assay method after exposing them
to ionizing radiation.
Method: A common and a novel MTT assay method were used and compared for
obtaining the F10B16 melanoma and 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma survivals after
exposing them to ionizing radiation from a Co-60 machine. To obtain the survival
parameters of the cells based on the common method, the cells were inoculated in
96-well plates. After irradiating the plates, the MTT assay was performed over the
following days for a period of 8 days. Thereafter, the survival fraction was calculated
from a simple equation for every day from which the best day was selected. To
acquire the cells’ survival parameters based on the novel method, extensive experiments
were performed on a large number of samples. Then, the MTT assay was done
in every day following various experimental treatments to acquire the exponential
growth. Finally, the cells’ survivals were determined by measuring the space between
relevant growing curves.
Results: At low doses ( < 4Gy) the two MTT assay methods indicated the same results.
However, at higher doses there were significant differences among the findings.
Conclusion: Both of the MTT methods indicated that the cells’ responses are dependent
on the dose levels used. Although the implementation of the common MTT
assay method is simpler, the novel method seems to show more precise and reliable
results at all levels of radiation doses.

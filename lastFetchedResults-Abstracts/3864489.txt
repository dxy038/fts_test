This paper determines the intelligible crosstalk performance of analog multichannel subscriber carrier systems. Using a 0.1 percent probability of intelligible crosstalk objective, the calculations determine that the equal level far-end crosstalk loss must exceed 55.6 dB. Based on crosstalk measurements of in-service cables in South Central Bell, it is shown that only a small fraction of the pairs fail the crosstalk objective. Hence, it is concluded that multichannel analog subscriber carrier systems can be applied without any cable crosstalk constraints.

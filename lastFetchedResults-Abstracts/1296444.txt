In recent years optimal placement of distributed generators system has been designed considering the reliability and loss reduction. In this paper a powerfull algorithm used to optimization the objective function variables. The objective function consist of maximum power loss reduction, reliability improvement, voltage profile, DG size and cost of the DG installation proper sizing and position of hybrid photovoltaic/Wind distributed generators are ardently necessary. So the constriction of optimization problem is reliable load supplying and minimum cost. According to this difinition, 20-bus network located in Meshkinshahr has been investigated. The result of optimization shows that loss reduction in the network with DG installation is more than the netwok without DG installation.

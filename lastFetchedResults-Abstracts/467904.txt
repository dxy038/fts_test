OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to present information about open surgical biopsy. It is hoped that this will be helpful when reviewing information about core needle biopsy. STUDY DESIGN: Review of 461 open surgical biopsies for nonpalpable mammographic abnormalities was performed. All patients were managed by the Women's Health Center of Logansport. Core needle biopsy data came from the literature. RESULTS: Open surgical biopsy compared favorably to core needle biopsy with regard to accuracy, cost, patient convenience, recovery, adequacy of specimen, identification of primary site, and cosmetics. CONCLUSION: Despite core needle biopsy marketing, open surgical biopsy has its advantages and should not be relegated to the museum. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:1245-50.)

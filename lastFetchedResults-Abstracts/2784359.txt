The study of the inherent secrecy capacity of wireless networks of random topologies is currently of great interest to the communication and information theory communities. Indeed, a good amount of work exists on the secrecy analysis of random networks, the majority of which relies on Poisson point processes to model the spatial distribution of devices. It has been recently demonstrated, however, that Mate&#769;rn hard-core point processes-rather than Poisson point processes-are better suited to characterize the random location of users and base stations of cellular systems. In this letter, we therefore offer an analysis of the secrecy outage of random networks under the Mate&#769;rn hard-core point process model, with the objective of shedding some light on the security limitations/capabilities inherent encountered in cellular systems.

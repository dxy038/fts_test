The authors report experimental results of a scheme for controlling multiple manipulator systems. The control objective was to steer the payload to track a preplanned trajectory while controlling the interaction forces and the load distribution among the manipulators. The scheme was implemented on a planar SCARA-type dual-manipulator system. The hardware configuration of the experimental system is described. Experimental data are presented to demonstrate various aspects of the system performance including trajectory tracking control, load distribution, interaction force control, and robustness to model mismatch

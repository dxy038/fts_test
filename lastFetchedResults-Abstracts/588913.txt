Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are orexigenic peptides localized in arcuate nucleus (ARN) of the hypothalamus in ewe. Effects of NPY in stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion are stated in some mammals. The objective of the present study was to investigate level of AgRP expression in ARN of the hypothalamus in the estrus and diestrus phases in ewe. Six ewes were divided into estrous and diestrous groups (n=3) and the number of neurons that expressing the AgRP in the ARN of each group was estimated by using immunohistochemistry method. Without considering the different parts of ARN (rostral, middle, and caudal), the number of AgRP immunoreactive neurons in the estrus phase (63.55±14.37) was more than diestrus phase (31.22±6.34) (P=0.05). This finding indirectly showed that AgRP, may have an important stimulator role in the expression of LH and is reproductive axis in ewe.

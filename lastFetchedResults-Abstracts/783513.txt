The objective of the study was to provide
further information related to newly described
parasomnia variant, Sexual Behaviour in Sleep (SBS,
sexsomnia). Previous studies dealt with selected
population, typically middle-aged males, featuring
extensive medico-legal exposure. At the same time, an
anecdotal evidence suggested higher involvement of
younger population, and skew towards balance between
genders comparable to those seen in other non-
Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep parasomnias.
The epidemiological information regarding this condition
is still virtually non-existent. In order to sample
this difficult-to-reach population, a 28-item Internet
survey was posted on the sexsomnia reference site
and the link was also sent to prospective respondents
(mostly registered visitors to this site). The respondents
were able to complete the survey anonymously,
which resulted in a need for the screening of bogus
and duplicate results. At the end, a total of 219 validated
responses were collected and analysed. The
results showed greater representation of females (31%
of the total number), and wider age distribution
(mean age of 30.4 years). The respondents typically
reported multiple sexsomnia episodes, in most cases
precipitated by body contact, stress and fatigue. Relatively
small number of respondents reported
involvement of legal authorities (8.6% of males and
3% of females) and participation of minors in their
sexsomnia (6% of the total sample). In spite of known
limitations of such surveys, the study provided much
needed insight into this complex nocturnal behaviour.
It confirmed the anecdotal evidence about the gender
and age distribution, and provided information on
some key features, such as precipitating factors, type
of behaviour, medication use, personal medical history
and medico-legal aspects

The objective of the paper is to assess the use of fractal dimension as a discriminator in Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) images for different forest and crop patterns. In this study, a kernel of pre-defined size has been moved on a single band image and the corresponding fractal dimension is found using the triangular prism surface area method. The measured dimension is used as a classification factor and applied over the kernel. A preliminary study is performed using IRS LISS II Band-4 data. The results are motivating and significant improvement has been obtained in this procedure for the case of a homogeneous pattern

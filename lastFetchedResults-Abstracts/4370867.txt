This paper presents the 4 kbit/s speech coding candidate submitted by AT&amp;T, Conexant, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Matsushita, and NTT for the ITU-T 4 kbit/s selection phase. The algorithm was developed jointly based on the qualification version of Conexant. This paper focuses on the development carried out during the collaboration in order to narrow the gap to the requirements in an attempt to provide toll quality at 4 kbit/s. This objective is currently being verified in independent subjective tests coordinated by ITU-T and carried out in multiple languages. Subjective tests carried out during the development indicate that the collaboration work has been successful in improving the quality, and that meeting a majority of the requirements in the extensive selection phase test is a realistic goal

This paper reports progress in current work having the objective of determining channel impairment mitigation requirements for IMT 2000-type systems using urban vehicular mobile radio channels in microcellular configurations. The maximum data rates that can be supported without channel protection are estimated and improvements that would result from employing a RAKE receiver on the measured channels are reported

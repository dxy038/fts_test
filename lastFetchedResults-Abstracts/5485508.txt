For the past few years, wireless networks have played bigger role in connecting people. Demand for it services has increased tremendously. In order to provide better services and choices for high-speed internet access and multimedia service for business and residential customer, IEEE has come out with new solution. Started on 2001, IEEE 802.16 working group was developing the IEEE 802.16 standards for wireless Metropolitan Area Networks. Their objective and forecast are to provide broadband wireless last-miles access in a Metropolitan Area Network, easy to deploy and giving high speed data rate and large covering area. To fulfil this objective, a good scheduling system can boost the performance of Wireless network. In this work, a detailed simulation study from the Base Station to Subscriber station (downlink) is carried out for comparing 2 different schedulers in terms of their performance. The simulation is carried out via the NCTUns simulator.

This paper addresses the potential of the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) for self-quantification through recording and analysis of brain activity. From the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal it is possible to quantify and investigate brain activity, allowing, for example, a measure of engagement with tasks to be derived, states of relaxation or anxiety to be determined, or levels of alertness to be assessed. This can be of particular use in areas such as immersive education, where an objective measure of task engagement would be of value. As such it may be possible to measure engagement but also to identify people who may not be able to engage fully, such as people with dyslexia.

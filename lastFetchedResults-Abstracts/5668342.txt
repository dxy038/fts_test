In this paper, a new method for solving the multiobjective optimization problems is proposed, which changes the multiobjective optimization problems to problems of solving nonlinear equations that can be solved by the methods of solving nonlinear equations such as reference [7]. Because usually there are much Pareto optimal solution for multiobjective optimization problems. Some constraints on an objective function can be used as a prior information to constrain this equations in order to get distribution of Pareto optimal solutions of this nonlinear equations, and some Pareto optimal solutions are got by the method given in this paper. To show effectiveness of this method, the simulations of some examples are carried out by the proposed method. As a result, this indicates that the proposed method is very useful.

We introduce a new type of a model for an ad hoc network: M<sup>2</sup>ANET. The new model differentiates between terminal nodes and transmission nodes in a network. The sole objective of the network is to facilitate transmission between the terminal nodes using the transmission nodes. Compared with a fully connected networks, the new model shows a better performance. We evaluate the utilizations of standard routing algorithms AODV and DSR in M<sup>2</sup>ANETs under different normalized node density conditions.

Combined subjective and objective nutritional assessment was performed on admission in 127 patients with oral and maxillofacial malignancies. On the basis of the nutritional assessment result, three typical nutritional parameters-body weight (BW) (X1), mid-upper-arm circumference (MAC) (X2), and hand grip strength (HGS) (X3) were used to establish a new nutritiona1 assessment method that was developed by a computer-based disricminant analysis. The established model was as follows: Y1=−126+1.09X1+1.34X2+0.23X3; Y2=−95.63+0.96X1+1.17X2+0.19X3. In the model Y1 was regarded as good nutrition and Y2 as malnutrition. The larger value of Y stood for the patient's nutritional status (i.e. Y1>Y2, well nourished; Y1<Y2, malnourished). The new nutritional assessment correlates well with the combined subjective and objective nutritional assessment with a total agreement rate of 88.2%. With its simplicity and accuracy, the new nutritional assessment deserves a wide application in clinical situation.

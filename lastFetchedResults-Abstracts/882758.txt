In recent decades, the evolution trend in social, economic and cultural context and geographical foundation deference's have been  caused to creation of a special kind of spatial system in human settlement. Development spatial imbalances have caused disruption of spatial system of settlement and the rapid growth of some cities. The main objective of this study was to analyze the development of Fars province cities in the period 1380 to 1390 and determination of spatial inequalities development. In this research we used statistical techniques of numerical taxonomy, Williamson and regression coefficient, to show the level of development in the Fars province cities, with 6 main criteria and 52 sub criteria. During the statistical period, the developed cities had decreased and unexpanded towns have increased. The results show that the main development reason for the difference between the cities is due to lack of distribution in agriculture and education indicators.

We report our experimental results on high voltage normally-off GaN MOS channel HEMTs (MOSC-HEMT) on silicon substrates with best specific on-resistance (R<sub>on,sp</sub>) of 4 m&#937;-cm<sup>2</sup> and breakdown voltage (BV) of 840V. The switching performance of the device was evaluated by SPICE simulations of a buck-boost converter and showed a system efficiency of 10% higher than that using a commercial GaN HEMT. A bidirectional switch consisted two GaN MOSC-HEMTs were also demonstrated.

Most of the multimedia applications require strict QoS guarantee during the communication between a single source and multiple destinations. This gives rise to the need for an efficient QoS multicast routing strategy. Determination of such QoS-based optimal multicast routes basically leads to a multi-objective optimization problem, which is computationally intractable in polynomial time due to the uncertainty of resources in high-performance networks. This paper describes a network model for researching the routing problem and we propose a new multicast tree selection algorithm based on genetic algorithms to simultaneously optimize multipl- e QoS parameters. Based on QoS constrains such as delay, delay jitter, bandwidth and packet loss metrics this paper describes a network model suitable for investigating the routing problem and presents a multicast routing algorithm with multiple QoS constraints based on GA and TS hybrid strategy. This algorithm takes advantage of GA and TS and overcomes the shortcomings of GA used in solving the multicast routing problem with multiple QoS constraints-poor climbing ability and immature convergence. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find a better solution, fast convergence speed and high reliability. It can meet the real-time requirement in multimedia communication networks. The scalability and the performance of the algorithm with increasing number of network nodes are also quite encouraging.

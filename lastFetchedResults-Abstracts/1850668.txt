Objective: In this article we provide evidence of a significant spontaneous humoral response in cancer patients. Methods: A panel of tumor-associated antigens, previously identified through serological screening of phage-displayed cDNA libraries from solid human tumors, breast carcinoma cell lines and human testis by employing breast cancer patient sera, was used in this study to survey sera from 182 patients with known disease histories and clinical stages. Results: This analysis reveals a statistically significant association between tumor disease and presence in peripheral blood of IgG antibodies against four autoantigens. One of these antigens (D7-1) is particularly interesting in that the antibody response against it grows with cancer progression from stages I through IV, with an incidence of 13.2, 13.5, 18.2 and 27%, respectively. The significance of this stage-dependent increase in the incidence is confirmed by the Mantelâ€“Haenszel Chi-squared test (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data confirm association between breast cancer diagnosis of patients and presence in their peripheral blood of antibodies against several autoantigens identified by phage display.

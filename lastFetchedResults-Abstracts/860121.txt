The goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of different regularization techniques for an inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP): the estimation of the initial condition. The inverse problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem, and a regularization term is added to the objective function with the help of a regularization parameter. Three classes of regularization methods have been considered: Tikhonov regularization, maximum entropy principle, and truncated singular value decomposition. Concerning the entrop√≠c methodology, two new techniques are introduced and good results were obtained using synthetic data corrupted with noise. The Morozov's discrepancy principle is used to find out the regularization parameter.

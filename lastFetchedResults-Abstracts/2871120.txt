Cooperative targets assignment of multiple Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) is the basis and key issue of multi-UCAVs cooperative combat. The kill probability is taken into consideration in cooperative targets assignment problem, for which a multi-objective MIP model is proposed. The objectives include minimizing the number of launch points taking part in a mission and minimizing the launch time range. An improved efficacy coefficient method is developed to transform the problem to a single-objective MILP model. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

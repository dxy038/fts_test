Objective
rpose of this study was to investigate whether α-galactosidase activity is present in whole and glandular saliva and whether α-galactosidase activity depends on blood type and secretor status.

e first experiments, 30 healthy participants (15 men, 15 women; mean age, 24.2 ± 1.5 years) who were 10 A, 10 B, and 10 O blood type subjects were included. α-Galactosidase activity in unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) was assayed by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Total protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. The secretor status of the blood group antigens was determined by immunoblotting. α-Galactosidase activity in UWS according to gender, blood type, secretor status, sample clarification, and buffer was investigated. Daily variations of α-galactosidase activity and α-galactosidase isozyme activity were also investigated. For the second experiments, 10 healthy blood type B participants (5 men, 5 women; mean age, 27.0 ± 2.7 years) were enrolled. α-Galactosidase activity in whole and glandular saliva was investigated.
s
ctosidase activity was detected in UWS and was mainly isozyme A activity. There was no difference in α-galactosidase activity according to gender, blood type, and secretor status. α-Galactosidase activity in UWS was higher in unclarified samples than in clarified ones and showed wide daily variations. α-Galactosidase activity in whole saliva was significantly higher than that in glandular saliva.
sions
ctosidase activity which is mainly isozyme A activity was detected in human whole and glandular saliva. α-Galactosidase activity in UWS did not differ according to blood type and secretor status.

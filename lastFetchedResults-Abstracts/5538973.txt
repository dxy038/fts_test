This study´s objective is to assess the performance of the common Prim and the Kruskal of the minimum spanning tree in building up super metric space. We proposed the use of complexity analysis and experimental methods to assess these two methods. After the analysis of the sample data of Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index daily from the second half of 2005 to the second half of 2007, The results showed that when the number of shares is less than 100, judging from the space complexity, Kruskal algorithm is relatively superior to Prim algorithm; however, when the number of shares is greater than 100, from the time complexity´s aspect, Prim algorithm is more superior. This study´s conclusion indicates that matrix of Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 stock the inter-continental distance formed by the edge map more, so Prim better than Kruskal.

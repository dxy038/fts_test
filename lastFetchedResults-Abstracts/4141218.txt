The challenge of the smart grid is formidable, and fully explaining all the nuances is beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, what makes a grid smart, or at least different from the grid of today, is the fact that it must deliver both energy and information.

Energy will be generated both at traditional generation facilities as well as in local or distributed generation facilities. Information covering every aspect of electricity from generation to consumption will also be conveyed.

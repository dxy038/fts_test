The ac¸aı´ fruit industrial processing produces a
large amount of waste, mainly seeds and fibers, which is a
serious environmental and public health problem. The
objective of this work was to use these fibers to obtain
composites with natural rubber from different clones. The
effect of the addition of ac¸aı´ fibers and the type of clone were
investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under
inert and oxidative atmospheres, differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), water sorption, and mechanical properties.
The ac¸aı´ fibers exhibited a thermal behavior comparable to
other natural fibers industrially used in polymeric composites.
The addition of the fibers did not influence the thermal
stability of the composites. There was no significant effect of
the type of clone and the addition of the fiber on the glass
transition temperature, which was approximately -59  C
for all samples. Water sorption behavior of the compounds
and of the composites was similar to that of the other materials
with natural rubber that are reported in the literature.
The promising performance of the composites with ac¸aı´
fibers opens a new area of use for such fibers

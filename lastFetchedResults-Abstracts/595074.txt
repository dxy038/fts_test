Objective; This study was done to evaluate the status of tear film in patient having pterygium and to find any correlation between pterygium and dry eyes.Material and Methods: A prospective study on the correlation of pterygium and dry eyes was done in the Department of Ophthalmology, D.H.Q Teaching Hospital, D.I. Khan, from 1st Aug 2001 to 31st July 2002. Ach patient had a complete ophthalmological examination and all information were recorded in a specially designed proforma. Status of the precorneal tear film, marginal tear film meniscus, tear film break up time (BUT) were noted. Schirmer test was also performed.Results: We examined 120 patients , having 170 pterygia. 95 (79.16%) were males and 25 ( 20.84 % ) were females. Male to female ratio was 3.8-1. 63 (52.5% ) were having normal marginal tear film meniscus, 45 (37.5%) were having decreased marginal tear film meniscus and 12 (10%) were having severe tear film abnormalities with a concave marginal tear film meniscus. Tear film break up time was also decreased with a mean of 6 seconds and a range of 3 - 14 seconds. Schirmer test was also performed, and it was also decreased with a mean of 5.70 mm and a range of 3 - 14 mm.Conclusion: Patients with decreased teary production are more prone to the damaging effects of U-V rays in the sun light. There is a positive correlation between dry eyes and pterygium. Patients with pterygium are having decreased tear production, decreased Tear film break up time and decreased Schirmer test value.

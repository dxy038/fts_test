Background and Objective: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal proliferation of immature myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. Multiple genetic and environmental factors have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of AML. Cytochromes, such as cytochrome P450 are among detoxifying enzymes whose aberrant expression can make individuals susceptible to a variety of cancers and leukemias including AML. The aim of this study was to evaluate the G15631T, CYP2B6 subfamily of cytochrome P450 gene with susceptibility to AML in some AML patients and normal individuals.

Materials and Method: We enrolled 76 AML patients and 80 normal individuals as the control group for the study of G15631 T polymorphism of CYP2B6 gene. This polymorphism was lified by PCR using specific primers. The PCR products were digested by Bsr I enzyme and Electrophoresed on Agarose gel.

Results: The frequency of G15631T polymorphism was significantly higher in patients (55%) than the control group (31%). The risk of AML (with CI = 95%) in patients with GT genotype was 1.95 fold more than individuals with the same genotype in the control group. The TT genotype was found in 4 patients with AML, but in none of the individuals in control group.

Conclusion: The results show that there is a direct relationship between G15631T, CYP2B6 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to acute myeloid leukemia in some patients in our study population. However, further studies on larger populations are recommended.

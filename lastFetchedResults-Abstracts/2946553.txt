The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) is the premier space technology experiment of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). The primary objective of the experiment is to collect and analyze data on target and backgrounds phenomenology using three multi-spectral (ultraviolet, visible, infrared) imaging sensor subsystems. The MSX program made an early investment in a well-organized Data Management System to ensure full exploitation of the unique data collected during the life of the program. The requirements-driven design features a distributed processing concept and a dual data flow path to provide quality data to researchers as quickly as possible while ensuring traceability in understanding the data and sensor characteristics. Data quality and traceability goals are achieved through the application of a formal, disciplined data processing development and certification methodology that includes an in-depth technical evaluation and approval process as well as careful configuration management of the software and algorithms used to verify and calibrate the data. The MSX data is carefully catalogued and archived at the BMDO Backgrounds Data Center (BDC) to provide a legacy to future programs. The MSX Data Release Policy determines how the non-MSX community can access the available data products

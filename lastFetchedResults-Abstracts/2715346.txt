The optimization behavior of the self-adaptation (SA) evolution strategy (ES) with intermediate multi-recombination [(&#956;/&#956;<sub>I</sub>, &#955;)-&#963;SA-ES] using isotropic mutations is investigated on convex-quadratic functions (referred to as ellipsoid model). An asymptotically exact quadratic progress rate formula is derived. This is used to model the dynamical ES system by a set of difference equations. The solutions of this system are used to analytically calculate the optimal learning parameter &#964;. The theoretical results are compared and validated by comparison with real (&#956;/&#956;<sub>I</sub>, &#955;)-&#963;SA-ES runs on two ellipsoid test model cases. The theoretical results clearly indicate that using a model-independent learning parameter &#964; leads to suboptimal performance of the (&#956;/&#956;I, &#955;)-&#963;SA-ES on objective functions with changing local condition numbers as often encountered in practical problems with complex fitness landscapes.

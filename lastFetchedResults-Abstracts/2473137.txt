Objective
Febrile seizure is the most common neurologic problem in children between
3 months to 5 years old. Two to five percent of children aged less than five yr
old will experience it at least one time. This type of seizure is age dependent
and its recurrence rate is about 33% overalls and 50% in children less than one
yr old.
The prophylactic treatment is still controversial, so we conducted a randomized
controlled clinical trial to find out the effectiveness of continuous phenobarbital
versus intermittent diazepam for febrile seizure.
Materials & Methods
This clinical trial was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Neurology,
Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran between March 2008 and
October 2010. All children from 6 month to 5 yr old referred to Amirkola
Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Babol, Iran were enrolled in the study. Children with
febrile seizure that had indication for prophylaxis but did not receive any
prophylaxis previously were enrolled in the study. For prophylactic anti
convulsion therapy, patients were divided randomly in two groups. One
group received continuous phenobarbital and another treated with intermittent
diazepam whenever the children experienced an episode of febrile illness for
up to one year after their last convulsion.
Results
Of all 145 studied cases, the recurrent rate in children under prophylaxis with
diazepam was 11/71 and in phenobarbital group was 17/74. There was no
significant difference in the recurrence rate in both groups.
Conclusion
There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of phenobarbital and
diazepam in prevention of recurrent in febrile seizure and we think that in
respect of lower complication rate in diazepam administration, it cloud be
better choice than phenobarbital.

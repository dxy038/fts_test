To control the free floating spacecraft in outer space, this paper builds a model of free floating sphere movement under the action or multi-thrusters, and uses genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the path and position in different control phases by using a combination of thrusters. In each phase, it makes the control target as the fitness function of GA to search the best solution, then uses this combination to move the sphere to an objective position and stabilizes it in the objective state. Contrasted to the traditional optimal control method, this control method is much simple and does not need a complicated algorithmic analysis, but can achieve a much effective result.

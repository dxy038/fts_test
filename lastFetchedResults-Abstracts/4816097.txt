A new algorithm for Land Aerosol property and Bidirectional reflectance Inversion by Time Series technique (LABITS) is presented and applied to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR) data over China. Based on the assumptions that the surface bidirectional reflective property are not varying during one day and aerosol characteristics are constant in 0.1&#176; &#215; 0.1&#176; window, we inverse the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters. Preliminary AOD validation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data shows that the correlation coefficient, R<sup>2</sup>, is 0.79, the root-mean-square error, RMSE, is 0.13 and the uncertainty is &#916;&#964;= &#177;0.05 &#177; 0.20&#916;. Comparing with MODIS AOD product, it is found that both the AOD results are consistent very well. The R<sup>2</sup> is 0.80 and RMSE is 0.10. The algorithm is flexible and appropriate for aerosol retrieval over both dark and bright land surface. It is potential to retrieve long term global AOD over land from NOAA AVHRR data since 1980s and to study aerosol climatology and global climate change well.

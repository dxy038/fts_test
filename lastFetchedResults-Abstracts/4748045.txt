This paper is devoted to subjective and objective tests of image quality. The images were processed using different compressing algorithms (JPEG, KLT, Lura-wavelet) with compression ratio up to 100. After decompression they were tested on the quality changes. At first the subjective image quality test (DSCQS) was used. Then the objective quality test using the metric based on the human visual system was applied. Finally, a discussion of the results is presented.

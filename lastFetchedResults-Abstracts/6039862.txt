Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are specialized hybrid electric vehicles that have the potential to obtain enough energy for average daily commuting from batteries. These batteries would be charged from the power grid and would thus allow for a reduction in the overall petroleum consumption. To implement the plug-in function, a single phase bidirectional AC-DC converter interfacing with the grid is essential. The implementation of a bidirectional AC-DC converter can allow for battery recharge from the grid, battery energy injection to the AC grid, and battery energy for AC power stabilization. In this paper, the basic requirements and specifications for PHEV bidirectional AC-DC converter designs are presented. Generally, there are two types of topologies used for PHEVs: an independent topology and a combination topology that utilizes the drive motorpsilas inverter. Evaluations of the two converter topologies are analyzed in detail. The combination topology analysis is emphasized because it has more advantages in PHEVs, in respect to savings in cost, volume and weight.

Power systems for telecommunications are designed to work safely and with a high level of reliability in environmental conditions of vibrations, earthquake, temperature and high altitude and humidity. They are also designed to sustain shock during handling and transportation. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the power system mechanical design for reliability compliance to seismic and drop test requirements. The finite element analysis (FEA) of the earthquake and drop tests simulate the NEBS GR 063 test conditions and verifies the test requirements. The paper discusses the rationale for computational simulations and describes in detail the FEA simulation approaches. A case study of a power system illustrates the best practice for FEA modeling to obtain accurate prediction of the mechanical response. The simulation results are discussed and compared with the test results. To reduce the risk of having the design invalidated by NEBS tests, the paper emphasize the need to qualify the FEA model before the prototype is tested. At this stage of product development, any test failure delays the product lunch and increases the design cost.

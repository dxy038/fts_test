Background and Objective: Alleviation of serum glucose level and lipid profile in diabetic patients using herbal medications is of great importance. In the present study, the effect of oral consumption of olive leaves on serum glucose level and lipid profile was investigated. 
Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including control, control under treatment, diabetic and diabetic under treatment. A single dose of streptozocin (60 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes in rats. The two groups under treatment were fed with olive leaves powder mixed with the standard food at a ratio of 6.25% for 6 weeks. Serum glucose level and lipids profile were measured before, and at 3rd and 6th weeks after the treatment. 
Results: In diabetic rats under the treatment with olive leaves, serum glucose level was significantly lower at 6th week as compared to the diabetic rats without treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant decrease regarding triglyceride (p < 0.05) and total cholesterol (p < 0.01) in diabetic group under treatment with olive leaves as compared to diabetic rats without treatment. Also, treatment with olive leaves led to significant improvement of HDL (p < 0.05) and LDL (p < 0.01) as compared to untreated rats. 
Conclusion: Oral consumption of olive leaves in experimental model of diabetes had hypoglycemic effect and exerts some beneficial changes in lipid profile

This paper presents a multi-objective optimal design of an Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet generator, AFPM, suitable for use in direct-driven wind generator systems. The optimal generator design must achieve maximum torque-to-weight ratio and maximum efficiency. An Electromagnetic solution is used to gather the data necessary for the optimization stage, and the search for the optimum solution was achieved by using a fuzzy logic rule base algorithm.

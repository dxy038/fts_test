The objective of this study was to measure the effect of feeding two total mixed rations (TMRs), differing in their roughage
content and in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility, on the physiological response and energy balance of lactating cows. The
partitioning of metabolizable energy intake (MEI) between heat production (HP) and retained energy (RE) of cows held under
hot weather conditions and external evaporative cooling was measured. In all, 42 lactating cows were divided into two similar
sub-groups, each of 21 animals, and were fed either a control (CON) ration containing 18% roughage neutral detergent fiber
(NDF) or an experimental (EXP) TMR containing 12% roughage NDF and used soy hulls as partial wheat silage replacer. The
in vitro DM digestibility of the CON and EXP TMR was 75.3% and 78.6%, respectively (P,0.05). All cows were cooled by
evaporative cooling for 2 adaptation weeks plus 6 experimental weeks under hot weather conditions. The EXP diet reduced
rectal temperature and respiratory rate of the cows while increasing their DM intake (DMI) from 23.1 to 24.7 kg/cow per day,
milk yield from 41.9 to 44.2 kg and yield of energy-corrected milk from 38.7 to 39.7 kg, as compared with the CON group.
Cows fed the EXP TMR had increased RE in milk and body tissue, as compared with the CON group, but the diets had no
effect on the measured HP that was maintained constant (130.4 v. 130.8 MJ/cow per day) in the two groups. The measured
MEI (MEI5RE1HP) and the efficiency of MEI utilization for RE production were also similar in the two dietary groups.

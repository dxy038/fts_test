Technology is constantly improving to solve human problems more easily. Adoption of Information technology in agriculture seems to be on the rise as agribusiness managers increasingly discover the need and consequently see the value of these technologies. An open architecture frame work for intelligent system can be develop[ed] for fruits that can allow to quality analysis behalf on color appearance. In this research paper three different logics are proposed and combined in single algorithm/program, which can perform action for quality analysis on fruit using digital images of particular/same dimensions, according the objective of this research. In this proposed research work size, shape, hardness, softness, day light, day temperature, colorization plays a key role using non-destructive methods and techniques. The proposed work is implemented in image processing to determine quality i.e. un ripe, partial ripe, ripe or over ripe (bad fruit), according the appearance of color level estimation further which involve image analysis, visual examination and inspection of color. which can support to manufacture different edible products according to their category level.

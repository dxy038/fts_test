This paper presents a fuzzy PID control scheme with a real-valued genetic algorithm (RGA) to a setpoint control problem. The objective of this paper is to control a twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS) to move quickly and accurately to the desired attitudes, both the pitch angle and the azimuth angle in a cross-coupled condition. A fuzzy compensator is applied to the PID controller. The proposed control structure includes four PID controllers with independent inputs in 2-DOF. In order to reduce total error and control energy, all parameters of the controller are obtained by a RGA with the system performance index as a fitness function. The system performance index utilized the integral of time multiplied by the square error criterion (ITSE) to build a suitable fitness function in the RGA. A new method for RGA to solve more than 10 parameters in the control scheme is investigated. For real-time control, Xilinx Spartan II SP200 FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is employed to construct a hardware-in-the-loop system through writing VHDL on this FPGA.

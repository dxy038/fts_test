The first stage of development of a new kind of objective three-channel colorimeter is shown, namely the development of the principle of its working, which will allow to construct an inexpensive and accurate colorimeter which is well suited to industrial production. By using two photodiodes in each channel simultaneously, a simple and accurate set-up of three-channel colorimeter is possible

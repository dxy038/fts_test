Objective: Human papillomaviruses are present in up to 64.3% of patients’ sperm. The objectives were (1) to determine human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid effects on sperm deoxyribonucleic acid integrity and (2) to assess human papillomavirus differential effects on the sperm cell. Study Design: Two-layer colloid washed sperm were exposed to E6-E7 deoxyribonucleic acid fragments generated from human papillomavirus types 16, 18, 31, 33, 6/11, or control (DQA1) for 24 hours. The motility parameters were measured and analyzed. Pilot studies were performed to develop a fixed sperm comet assay to assess deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation. Results: Significant sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation occurred after exposure to deoxyribonucleic acid of human papillomavirus types 16 and 31. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid fragment size was not a factor. Human papillomavirus types 18, 33, and 6/11 did not compromise sperm deoxyribonucleic acid integrity. Washed sperm motility was higher in the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid except for type 6/11. Amplitude of head displacement was lower for human papillomavirus types 16 and 6/11. Sperm linearity was increased for all human papillomavirus types except type 18. Conclusion: Human papillomavirus type 16 and 31 deoxyribonucleic acid caused deoxyribonucleic acid breakages characteristic of apoptotic but not necrotic sperm. The data suggest that these human papillomavirus types may adversely affect subsequent embryonic development after fertilization. Sperm deoxyribonucleic acid appears to resist human papillomavirus types 18, 33, and 6/11 or repairing mechanisms occurred. Although enhanced motility was found in human papillomavirus–exposed sperm, important velocity parameters were decreased, suggesting impaired sperm function. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1068-70.)

In this paper, we propose an efficient de-interlacing method for H.264-coded video sequences with different resolutions. In our proposed method, using the syntax elements (SEs) in the H.264 bitstreams, two new strategies are delivered to improve the de-interlacing quality. The first strategy is based on the intra mode to improve the quality of the regions with skewed edges. The second strategy is based on the inter mode to refine the quality of de-interlaced videos as well as alleviate the error propagation side effect. Experimental results on popular test video sequences with the resolutions of common international format (CIF), quarter CIF (QCIF), standard-definition (SD), and full high-definition (HD) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed de-interlacing method in terms of both the objective video quality measure and subjective visual effect when compared with the state-of-the-art method by Dong and Ngan.

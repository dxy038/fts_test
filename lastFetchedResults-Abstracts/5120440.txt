In the framework of multi-objective control, this paper presents a mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> dynamic output feedback control strategy to the network remote control system with measurement data missing and control data missing. Via matrix inequality method, the sufficient for existence of the dynamic output feedback controller, guaranteeing the closed-loop system has H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>infin</sub> performance simultaneously, is given. A novel arithmetic is put forward to optimize the controller performance via SLPMM (sequentially linear programming matrix method). A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design approach.

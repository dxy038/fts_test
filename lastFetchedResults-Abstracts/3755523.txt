There has recently been considerable attention given to bidirectional transmission over the same optical fiber. One of the impairments associated with this type of system is receiver sensitivity degradation due to reflected power. This paper presents an analysis of this impairment and compares it with experimental results. It is shown that for a certain class of systems relatively large reflections can be tolerated for a small sacrifice in system range.

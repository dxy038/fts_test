This paper discusses passenger service in an elevator system in a high-rise commercial building. For the elevator system´s up-peak traffic conditions, we have established multi-objective programming model to determine elevator´s partition running. Then, using the genetic algorithm to solve the multi-objective programming model, which can be optimized to elevator´s running program. Finally, a number of examples of quantitative analysis are made in this paper.

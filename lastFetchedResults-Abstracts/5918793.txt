The objective of this study is to optimize crash-box so as to improve low-speed crash energy absorption. For this purpose, a vehicle finite element (FE) model was established and validated by the acceleration curve of the back seat in 100% front impact and 40% offset impact. According to the RCAR rule, the simulation at low-speed impact of 16km/h was carried out to evaluate the crashworthiness of the car. Based on the simulation results, a crash-box was designed and the parameter study was carried out to improve the energy absorption of bumper and crash box by using the orthogonal experiment design and the overall balance method. The results showed that the improved frontal structures can be good to meet the requirement of RCAR regulations.

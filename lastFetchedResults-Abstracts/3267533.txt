Optimization and control strategies are necessary to keep wastewater treatment plants operating in the best possible conditions with the minimum consumption of energy. In this paper static and dynamic set point optimization strategies to improve the operation of the plant in order to achieve the economically optimal conditions are studied. Different objective function formulations are compared and the overall performance of the plant operating in a rain weather scenario is evaluated to determine the most adequate operation strategy.

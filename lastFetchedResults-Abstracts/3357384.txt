The main objective of this paper is to generate electrical power from renewable energy systems like wind and solar with the help of Hybrid Asymmetrical Multi Level Inverter (HASMLI). In this paper, a nine level HASMLI is proposed with modified PWM technique for reduction of switching losses. When HASMLI is operated in PWM mode it gives high value of total harmonic distortion (THD) which is mainly due to unequal pulses in the each stage of multilevel output. To avoid this, a special PWM technique is used in HASMLI. It uses only symmetric part of inverter is operated in PWM mode and remaining Asymmetric part of inverter is operated in square wave mode. Hence forth this proposed PWM operation which uses more number of low frequency switches gives the better and decreases the cost of the Multi level inverter and increases the reliability of the inverter.

There is a noticeable lack of fatigue data on plant fibre composites (PFCs) which seriously limits their prospective use in fatigue critical components. The objective of this manuscript is to provide a complete set of fatigue data on vacuum infused aligned PFCs. S–N lifetime diagrams have been constructed to investigate the effect of (i) plant fibre type/quality, (ii) fibre content, (iii) textile architecture, and (iv) stress ratio, on PFC cyclic loading behaviour. At each stage, the fatigue performance of PFCs is compared to that of E-glass/polyester (GFRP) composites. A comprehensive constant-life diagram has been generated to facilitate life prediction of PFC components.While plant fibre type and quality, textile architecture and composite fibre content have a significant impact on the static properties, they have little impact on the material fatigue strength coefficient b (which dictates the slope of the S–N curve). In essence, higher static properties are a sign of superior fatigue loading capacities throughout their lifetime. Increasing stress ratios lead to improved fatigue performance in PFCs. Fracture mechanisms and modes are the same for composites made from three different bast fibres, but depend on fibre content, textile architecture and stress ratios. Although the absolute fatigue performance of GFRPs is far superior to PFCs, it is a revelation to find that fatigue strength degradation rates are lower in PFCs than in GFRP.

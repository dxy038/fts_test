Ultrawideband impulse radio systems have several features of interest for multiuser communications in severe multipath environments, such as those often encountered in mobile and indoor wireless networks. We investigate blind adaptive channel estimation algorithms for system identification on impulse radio channels. In particular, we explore algorithms based on higher-order statistics, as opposed to conventional second-order algorithms. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that this approach to channel estimation is preferable for impulse radio systems. Simulations verify the advantage of using higher-order algorithms, regardless of whether or not the channel impulse response corresponds to a minimum phase system.

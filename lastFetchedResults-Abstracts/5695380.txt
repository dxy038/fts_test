The authors consider the robust stability problem for a class of uncertain distributed parameter systems where the characteristic equations involve a polytope <e1>P</e1> of quasipolynomials. Given a stability region <e1>D</e1> in the complex plane, the objective is to find a constructive technique for verifying whether all roots of every quasipolynomial in <e1>P</e1> belong to <e1>D</e1> (that is, to verify the <e1>D</e1>-stability of <e1>P</e1>). The first result is that, under a certain assumption on the stability region <e1>D</e1>, <e1>P</e1> is <e1>D</e1>-stable if and only if the edges of <e1>P</e1> are <e1>D</e1>-stable. Hence the <e1>D</e1>-stability problem of a high dimensional polytope is reduced to the <e1>D</e1>-stability problem of a finite number of pairwise convex combinations of vertices. The second result gives effective graphical tests for checking the <e1>D</e1>-stability of a polytope of quasipolynomials when the set <e1>D</e1> is any open left half plane. The graphical test is based on the frequency-response plots of some transfer functions associated with the vertices

Method: In this research, first, the efficiency of an economic entity is measured by using Data Envelopment Analysis. Next, the managerial ability has been calculated by Demerjian et al. presented model for 26 companies over 2004-2013. In order to calculate the managerial ability, and examine its effect on the capital structure, the panel data regression model along with the DEA Frontier and EViews Version 7 Softwares have been used.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of gas atmosphere, refrigerated storage time, and endpoint temperature on internal cooked color of injection-enhanced pork chops. Enhanced chops were packaged in 0.36% CO/20.34% CO2 (CO-MAP), 80% O2/20% CO2 (HO-MAP), or PVC-overwrapped (PVC-OW; controls), stored at 4 °C for 0, 12, 19 or 26 days, displayed for 2 days then cooked to six endpoint temperatures (54, 60, 63, 71, 77, and 82 °C). L∗, a∗, and b∗ values, hue angle and chroma were determined on the internal cut surface of cooked chops. Chops packaged in CO-MAP had the highest a∗ values; a∗ value began increasing on day 14. The lowest hue angles occurred in chops cooked to lower endpoint temperatures. Chops in CO-MAP had lower hue angles and higher chroma than those in HO-MAP and PVC-OW. Above 71 °C, hue angle and chroma increased. Overall, CO-MAP packaged chops stored for longer time periods then cooked to lower endpoint temperatures appeared reddest. HO-MAP packaged chops were less red, did not change over time, and appeared more well done at lower endpoint temperatures than those in other gas atmospheres. CO-MAP packaged chops retained redness even after cooking at 82 °C.

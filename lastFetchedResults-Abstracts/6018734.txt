The optimization of national air route network (ARN) has become an effective method to improve the safety and efficiency of air transportation. The Crossing Waypoints Optimization (CWO) problem is the crucial problem in the design of the ARN. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model for the CWO problem to minimize both airlines cost and flight conflicts. Meanwhile, the corresponding algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is adopted to solve the optimization model. The application to redesign trunk route network of China shows the proposed methodology validity and effectiveness by comparison with the existing ARN.

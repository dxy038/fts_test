Objective: To review some of the recently proposed improvements and the corresponding apparent issues in the field of biochemical markers of cardiac damage.
Conclusions: The continuous development of new analytical tools for the biochemical evaluation of patients with suspected myocardial injury brings without doubt new challenges of careful technological evaluation, implementation, and standardization but it may also provide a unique opportunity to markedly enhance our diagnostic performance in the clinical setting of acute coronary syndrome.

Objective: Diabetes mellitus is the common endocrine disorder and one of its complications is nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Trigonella foneum-graecum leaf aqueous-ethanolic extract on the kidney structure in the diabetic rats using stereological methods.

Subjects and Methods: Thirty two male Wistar Rats (140 Â± 25 g), were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=8), including control, control + extract, diabetic and diabetic + extract groups. Experimental diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg b.w). Diabetic + extract and control + extract groups were treated with Trigonella foenum-graecum extract (175 mg/rat/day) for 30 days. Then the rats were anesthetized and left kidney was taken out and fixed. 4Mm sections and H&E staining were also carried out. The mean volume of kidney, cortex, medulla and total mean volume of glomeruli were obtained using stereological methods. Then the results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA/Tukey test and were considered significantly different at p<0.05 level.

Results: The totals mean volume of kidney and cortex was the same in control, control + extract and diabetic + extract groups. A significant reduction was found in volume of kidney and cortex in control + extract group when compared with control ones (p<0.01). The mean volume of glomeruli was significantly increased in diabetic groups in comparing with control rats (p<0.05). Body weight was significantly reduced in diabetic groups when compared with control ones (p< 0.001).

Conclusion: The results showed that Trigonella foenum-graecum leaf extract can affect some histopathological changes in nephropathy in experimental diabetes in the rats. However, prudently, more studies for understanding the underlying protective mechanisms of this plant is needed.

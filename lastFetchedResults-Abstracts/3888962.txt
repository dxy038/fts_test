The matrix converters, which are direct power electronic converters, are able to provide important benefits such as bidirectional power flow, sinusoidal input currents with adjustable displacement angle, and a great potential for size reduction. Still, two major disadvantages exist: a lower than unity voltage transfer ratio and high sensitivity to power grid disturbances. Many solutions to provide continuous operation of adjustable speed drives (ASDs) during power grid disturbances have been proposed, but they are all applied to DC-link ASD. In this paper, a new solution to provide limited ride-through operation is presented with a matrix converter using a scalar controlled induction motor for a duration of hundreds of milliseconds, without any hardware modification. During the ride-through operation, the drive is not able to develop torque or to control the motor flux. By recovering the necessary power to feed the control hardware of the matrix converter, it is able to keep the ASD operating. When normal grid conditions are reestablished, the matrix converter is able to accelerate the motor from nonzero speed and flux by initializing the modulator with the estimated frequency and the initial angle of the reference output voltage vector. The maximum duration of the ride-through operation depends on the initial motor flux, speed level, rotor time constant, load torque, and inertia. This method is verified on a laboratory setup with a matrix converter

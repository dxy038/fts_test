Two control schemes, called extended hybrid control and extended impedance control respectively, are developed for assuring the compliant motion of redundant manipulators. In the two control schemes, the basic compliant motion task is accomplished while the redundancy is utilized to realize some additional constraints which optimize any user-defined objective functions. Further, real-time implementations are given and some experimental results on a 3-DOF planar redundant manipulator are also presented to illustrate the two proposed schemes and demonstrate their capabilities for optimizing various objective functions

The control strategy of the DC-to-DC switching converters is studied to obtain the switching regulators with zero-voltage regulation. A novel control strategy, the function control, is presented for the DC-to-DC switching converters to achieve this objective. The control law and the corresponding feedback are derived directly from the equations governing the switching converters. With the function control strategy presented in the paper, the switching regulators become robust, i.e., the output is independent of the disturbances from either the supply voltage or the load and exhibits other desirable advantages. The strategy is applicable to all the four basic PWM converters, i.e., buck, boost, buck-boost, and Cuk. The analysis is confirmed by experiments and computer simulations

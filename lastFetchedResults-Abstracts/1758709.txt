Objective
m of this study was to describe the rates of enrollment in tobacco dependence treatment among smoking adults who accepted a fax referral from health care providers at a children's hospital, and to examine smoker characteristics associated with enrollment.
s
ary analysis of the state-sponsored fax referral and treatment program data on all referrals from Arkansas Children's Hospital in 2005 to 2007 was conducted. Enrollment was defined as attendance at 1 or more counseling sessions within 1 year of referral. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify demographic and tobacco-related characteristics associated with enrollment versus nonenrollment in a treatment program among those contacted by the program.
s
 749 faxed referrals to the program, 157 (21.0%) enrolled in a treatment program and received 1 or more treatment sessions; 505 were contacted by the program, and of these, 147 (29%) enrolled. Women were more likely to enroll than men (odds ratio [OR] 1.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09–3.01). Whites were twice as likely to enroll than African Americans (OR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.28–4.33). Older age (OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.06) and higher self-efficacy scores (OR 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02–1.26) increased the likelihood of enrollment.
sions
imately 1 in 5 smokers who accepted a fax referral enrolled in and received intensive treatment services for tobacco dependence. Thus, innovative approaches are needed to increase enrollment among younger, African American, and male smokers.

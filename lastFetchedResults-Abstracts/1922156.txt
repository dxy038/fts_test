The objective of this study was to show that plant sterols in tablet form provide additional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering for patients on statin therapy. Dispersible phytosterol tablets were tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial. Twenty-six patients who were following the American Heart Association Heart Healthy Diet and on long-term statin therapy were studied for 9 weeks. After 3 weeks of placebo treatment, the subjects were randomized to receive either 1.8 g of soy stanols or placebo for 6 weeks in addition to their usual statin regimen. Stanol tablets reduced LDL cholesterol 9.1% (p = 0.007) or 12.2 mg/dl. Total cholesterol was reduced by 12.9 mg/dl (p = 0.03). A strong inverse correlation (rs = âˆ’0.82, p = 0.0007) was found between the baseline LDL cholesterol and the percent change in LDL cholesterol observed after stanol treatment. The additional LDL cholesterol lowering with stanol/lecithin tablets provided a potential adjunctive therapy for patients who have not reached their target LDL cholesterol goal during statin therapy.

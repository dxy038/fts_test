Two basic tools are used in our approach. Firstly, temporal Petri nets provide elegant models for timed systems. The obtained models are general, including any structure type such as synchronizations and conflicts. Secondly, timed automata constitute a formal framework for proofs with the objective of performance evaluation and the synthesis of the control laws. These topics correspond to our current research with an application in the domain of manufacturing lines without intermediate buffers

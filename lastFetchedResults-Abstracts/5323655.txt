In this study we investigated the depth penetration of teeth by using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser. The objective is to identify the parameter of depth penetration of teeth by penetrating the carbon dioxide laser using experimental procedure. Twenty molars teeth samples were sectioned perpendicularly using CO<sub>2</sub> laser radiations at wavelength of 10.6pm at different power intensities of 10.15 W, 11.33 W, 12.05 W, 12.45 Wand 13.35 W with exposure time in range of 40 s to 420 s with increment of 20 s. After being exposed to the CO<sub>2</sub> laser beams, the length of teeth were then measured using digital vernier caliper. From the observations, the relationship between depth penetration and power intensity of laser beam and exposure time are almost linear. The depth penetration increased with increasing power intensity of laser beam and exposure time.

This paper examines testing methods and devices for sending data to line protection devices using the synchronous digital hierarchical (SDH) protocol. The paper has arisen as a result of cooperation between the Institute of Power Engineering and the Polish Power Electrical Utility Operator (PSE). The main objective of the tests was to investigate the possibilities of using already installed or new SDH telecommunication devices in power system protection systems. A range of protection functionality tests was considered along with SDH devices tests that focused on certain conditions and possible problems that may occur during normal operating conditions.

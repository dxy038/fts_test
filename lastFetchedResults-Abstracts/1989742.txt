The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) on the antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of muscadine grape skins (cvs. Noble and Alachua). ABA was applied on grapes during and after veraison. Average berry weight, total soluble solids (0Brix) and pH of the juice from both cultivars were not affected by the ABA treatment. Antioxidant capacity was enhanced by 38% and 18% in treated Noble at the first and second sampling, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed a significant increase in individual anthocyanins in treated Noble grapes at both sampling times. However, increase in the content of ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol was observed at first sampling only. No effects of ABA treatment were seen in Alachua grapes. Our results indicate that exogenous application of ABA enhances the antioxidant capacity, anthocyanins and phenolic content of muscadine grapes but these effects may vary depending upon the cultivar.

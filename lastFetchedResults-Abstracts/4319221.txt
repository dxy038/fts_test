Future offshore wind farms will have large power ratings and will be situated much further offshore than current projects. An outstanding issue to be solved is long distance transmission of bulk, fluctuant and widely dispersed wind power to onshore AC grid. The objective of this paper is to explain why multi-terminal VSC HVDC is believed to be the most suitable transmission network for this offshore application, and present an overview of its key technologies state of the art and different obstacles that still exist at present.

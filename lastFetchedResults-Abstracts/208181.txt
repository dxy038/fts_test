Background: Leishman Denovani is an obligatory intracellular parasite that is seen
such as Leishmanbody or Amustigote in intra reticolo- endothelial system.
Leishmanenios is seen as sporadic- endemic or epidemic in many places in the world.
In Iran in Fars state and west Azarbayjan is endemic and in other places are in sporadic
form and is found in rural areas.
Case report: A four year-old girl was admitted with visceral Leishmaniasis and
Subsequently developed peritoneal tuberculosis. The patient who lived in Dashte-
Moghan, complained of abdominal pain and distention and weight loss from 1.5 years
ago. The titre of IFA test for leishmansis was 1280
1
. Leishman body was seen in bone
marrow aspiration specimen. Bone marrow culture for leishmania was negative. The
specimen of acsities fluid revealed sero- fibrino- purulent exudate with lymphocyic
dominancy (over 90%). No response to classic lishmanisis treatment had been started
unless the patient treated with anti tuberculoid regimen.
Conclusion: The function of the T- helper (Tht) lymphocytes will decrease in Kala-azar
disease. This is why there is no skin reaction to Manteaux (PPD) diagnostic test the
patient. The patient have been suffering from long-term malnutrition with its
consequent immune defect. There was no evidences of cure in our patient during classic
Kala-azar therapy. After she received anti tuberculosis therapy she revealed clinical
improvement with Glucantim regimen as well.

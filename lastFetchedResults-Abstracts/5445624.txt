In this paper, we apply an optimization method inspired on the chemical reactions to find the gain constants involved in the tracking controller for the dynamic model of an unicycle mobile robot. This tracking controller integrates a kinematic and a torque controller based on fuzzy logic theory. The search of these constants was made previously using genetic algorithms. The objective of this paper is to introduce the new optimization algorithm based on the chemical paradigm and compare it with the results obtained by previous optimization techniques.

Study Objective:  To determine antibody titers to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) among previously vaccinated emergency physicians and to assess the degree of compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) postvaccination guidelines. Methods:  A descriptive analysis was performed of anti-HBsAg titer determinations and vaccination surveys among a self-selected group of emergency physicians attending the annual scientific assembly of the American College of Emergency Physicians in 1995, 1996, or 1997. Results:  Of 943 participants, titer levels were found to be protective in 768 (81%), borderline in 45 (5%), and nonreactive in 130 (14%). A total of 337 participants (36%) had not obtained postvaccination titer determinations, as advised by the CDC. More than 50% reported an occupational exposure to blood products within the previous 2 years. Conclusion:  Despite their high risk for exposure to blood products, many previously vaccinated emergency physicians were not in compliance with CDC postvaccination guidelines.

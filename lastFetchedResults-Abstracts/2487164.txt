Availability of job opportunities post and prior to graduation is one of the major concerns of students of Arabic Language and Literature. Creating the course of Arabic journalistic texts translation skills training and establishing the translation workshop in collaboration with academic centers (universities) and centers of future employment (News agencies, radio and television, newspapers and magazines) can familiarize students with the atmosphere of these centers and also strengthen their skills in this field. In this paper, we tried to explain the importance of Arabic journalistic texts translation skills training, and also to present a practical plan for “translation workshop” course along with related class topics. Some of the relevant experiences of “Fars News Agency” were also mentioned to achieve our objective. Implementation of “translation workshop” plan in collaboration with universities and “Fars News Agency”, and holding courses of “translator – journalist” can be a small step in removing the obstacles of employment for students of Arabic Language and Literature.

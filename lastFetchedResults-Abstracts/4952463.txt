In this paper, we propose a simple decentralized frequency-domain resource allocation strategy combined with uplink power optimization for Long Term Evolution (LTE) femtocell base stations (FBSs). We consider femtocells as an underlay network that reuse the existing macrocell spectral bands. The objective of this work is to maximize the uplink throughput of femtocell user equipments (FUEs) without causing performance degradation to macrocell user equipments (MUEs). System-level simulations are carried out to investigate the power optimization problem by extensive search over the power control (PC) parameter space. Based on the parameters selection, the FUEs uplink throughput is evaluated using the resource allocation scheme which roughly separates the macro- and femtocell users in frequency by imposing different allocation probabilities on different parts of the spectrum. Results show a significant FUE throughput improvement compared with an uniform allocation scheme.

The objective of call admission control is to keep the network load moderate to achieve a performance objective associated with quality of services. In asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, the cell loss rate is more sensitive to offered load than the queueing delay. Therefore, call admission control in ATM networks should be cell loss rate sensitive. The author proposes and evaluates a call admission control method which can be applied to the priority control case. The proposed method is suitable for real time operation even in a multimedia case, because the amount of calculation for call admission control is reduced considerably compared to conventional techniques and does not increase in the multimedia case. The method uses a probability density function for the number of cells transferred from multiplexed cells and uses recursive equations in estimating cell loss rate

Soft computing refers to a collection of computational techniques which study, model, and analyze very complex phenomena: those for which more conventional methods have not yielded low cost, analytic, and complete solutions. Soft Computing provides flexible information processing capability for representation and evaluation of various real life ambiguous and uncertain situations. The paper discusses how soft computing is a pertinent for Performance Appraisal. Performance Appraisal can be Objective as well as Subjective. Performance Appraisal is vague, uncertain and imprecise which may not result into fair decision. The paper proposes neuro-fuzzy approach for performance appraisal that removes any psychological elements that may have a negative bearing on unbiased evaluation. Fuzzy logic handles the vagueness and uncertainty that is observed in evaluation parameters and artificial neural network learns decision making from available data and experience to provide unbiased decision.

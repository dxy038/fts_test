A useful application of the convolution operator norm is the problem of actuator saturation. The L<sub>2</sub>&#8594;L<sub>&#8734; </sub> convolution operator norm is induced by energy and peak-excursion type signal norms. If a bound is known for the energy of the disturbance, this norm can be used to bound state amplitude or actuator excursion (saturation). The objective of this paper is to develop a fixed-structure technique for synthesizing controllers that are optimal with respect to three of these norms as applied to the closed-loop system

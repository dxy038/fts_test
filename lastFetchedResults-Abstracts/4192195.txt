A typical image formation model for super-resolution (SR) introduces blurring, aliasing, and added noise. The enhancement itself may also introduce ringing. In this paper, we use subjective tests to assess the visual quality of SR-enhanced images. We then examine how well some existing objective quality metrics can characterize the observed subjective quality. Even full-reference metrics like MSE and SSIM do not always capture visual quality of SR images with and without residual aliasing.

Objective The aim of this study was to explore the clinical value of the combination of prior knowledge of physicians and texture features for differentiation of malignant from benign solitary pulmonary nodules(SPNs) and mass lesions based on 18F-FDG PET/CT. Methods 143 patients with known solitary pulmonary nodule or mass were enrolled in the study. All the patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT examination. Two physicians judged the benign and malignant lesions of lung and the skewness, Angular Second Moment(ASM) and coarseness of PET/CT fusion images were measured. All patients were verified by pathological results or follow-up imagings after treatments.Results 106 patients were found to have malignant tumors and 37 patients were found with benign lesions.The sensitivity of prior knowledge, texture feature and combination of the two methods for diagnosis of pulmonary lesions were 88.7, 84.9, and 96.2%,respectively. Conclusion The result implies that combined texture feature of PET/ CT images may has potential to discriminate benign and malignant lesions and make up for deficiencies in individual parameters,and that the combination of the two methods generates better discrimination results than using one modality alone and plays a positive role for discrimination between benign and malignant lesions at present situation.

The productivity of upland rice in Japan as well as in the world is low and unstable owing to scarce and unpredictable rainfall. The objective of this study was to examine whether agronomic methods could enhance grain yield of upland rice. Four field experiments were conducted from 2001 to 2003 in Nishitokyo, Japan, under upland conditions with different water supplies, in order to quantify the effects of deep tillage combined with deep placement of manure (50-cm depth), straw mulch (6 t ha−1), or their combinations on the growth and grain yield of rice. Mulch kept surface soil moisture higher than without mulch even at reproductive stage, and it increased yield to the greatest extent under the most favourable conditions with much rainfall before heading (i.e., 2003). Deep tillage with deep placement of manure induced deep root proliferation and higher nitrogen uptake, increasing biomass production, and panicle number, and consequently grain yield was enhanced under the two lowest yielding environments with less rainfall before heading. Rice plants with deep tillage with deep manure application without mulch tended to have lower leaf water potential and higher diffusion resistance during drought, and negative effects on grain filling and harvest index in some experiments compared with the control. When deep tillage with deep placement of manure was combined with mulching in two experiments in 2002 and 2003, grain yield always enhanced compared with the control (P &lt; 0.10, 6.0 t ha−1 versus 5.4 t ha−1 on average), suggesting their synergetic mechanisms for yield increase and stabilization. The results showed that deep tillage or mulching can improve grain yield of rice under drought-prone rainfed upland conditions in a temperate climate on an Andosol, and their combination had more consistent and greater positive effects.

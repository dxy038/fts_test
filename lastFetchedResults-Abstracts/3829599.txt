A computerized radiographic method is described for assessing scoliosis. Three radiographs of the spine are exposed using a specially constructed device to fix the positions of the films and the patient. Computer-generated color graphics displays are utilized to present objective and subjective information to the user. The system was validated by using phantoms and it is currently implemented in the clinic, where it is being used to obtain reconstructions of the spine and other spinal data.

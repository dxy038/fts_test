An objective formulation of the impulse testing procedure is proposed based on models for winding response as well as fault models. Experimental validation of the fault models for breakdown and partial discharge (PD) is provided. A new adaptive filtering approach is proposed for analysis during impulse tests. The procedure is validated with experimental investigation on a 10 section lumped parameter network.

In this paper, a joint content-event model for indexing multimedia data is proposed. The event part of the model follows a number of formal principles to represent several aspects of real-life events, whereas the content part is used to describe the decomposition of any type of multimedia data to content segments. In contrast to other event models for multimedia indexing, the proposed model treats events as first class entities and provides a referencing mechanism to link real-life event elements with content segments at multiple granularity levels. This referencing mechanism has been defined with the objective to facilitate the automatic enrichment of event elements with information extracted by automatic analysis of content segments, enabling event-centric multimedia indexing in large-scale multimedia collections.

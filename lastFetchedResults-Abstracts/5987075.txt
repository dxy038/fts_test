Presents a way of systemic knowledge modelling representing objective medical image knowledge and compression for picture archiving and communication. A novel encoder model is proposed such that high compression ratio and acceptable visual perception are achieved. The developed knowledge-base system is designed to deal with selecting the suitable structure for the encoder model such that the above criteria are realized

According to the characteristics of Power Distribution Network based on PTN, this paper presented its businesses performance indexes of three-layer structure system and established the comprehensive evaluation model, using the entropy method and the relative comparison method, which combined subjective and objective factors together and calculated the comprehensive evaluation value of the network business performance. By using OPNET simulation and examples to prove that the mathematical model in performance evaluation of the Power Distribution Network is feasible, and it will provide a basis for business performance evaluation after the large-scale network construction.

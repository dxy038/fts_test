This paper describes a distributed particle swarm optimisation algorithm (PSO) based on peer-to-peer computer networks. A number of modifications are made to the more traditional synchronous PSO algorithm to allow for fully decentralised, scalable and fault-tolerent operation. The modified algorithm uses staggered propagation of objective-space knowledge between sub-swarms to eliminate the need for a centralised data store. Analytical test functions are used to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and its variations in comparison with a basic synchronous PSO implementation. The results clearly show the feasibility of decentralised particle swarm optimisation.

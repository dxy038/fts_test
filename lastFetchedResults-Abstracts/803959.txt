Secure communication requires message authentication. In this paper we address the problem of how to authenticate quantum information sent through a quantum channel between two communicating parties. Specifically, our objective is to determine whether one elementary quantum message (a qubit) can be authenticated with a quantum key of minimum length (another qubit). We show that this is not possible.

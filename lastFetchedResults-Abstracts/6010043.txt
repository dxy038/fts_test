Within this era of VLSI circuits, testability is truly a very crucial issue. To generate a test set for a given circuit, choice of an algorithm within a number of existing test generation algorithms to apply is bound to vary from circuit to circuit. Some objective quantitative measures are used in making such choice. Such measures are so important to the analysis of algorithms that become the subject of this work

Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects of gadolinum
on pneumotoxic effects of styrene in rats as an experimental model.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study a total number of 40 adult male Sprague
Dawley rats that weighed 200 ± 13 g were randomly divided into five groups: i. styrene (St,
N=10), ii. styrene+gadolinium chloride (GdCl3, N=10), iii. control (N=10), iv. GdCl3 (N=5) and v.
normal saline (Nor.Sal, as a solvent of GdCl3, N=5). Normal saline, as a sham control group,
was otherwise treated identically. Rats from the experimental groups were exposed to St in an
exposure chamber for 6 days/week, 4 hours/day for up to 3 weeks. At the end of the experiment,
rats from all groups were killed by deep anesthesia. Their lungs were removed, then
fixed in formalin and weighed. Tissue samples were processed routinely and sections stained
by the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) methods. We measured
the thicknesses of the respiratory epithelia and interalveolar septa. Obtained data were analyzed
by ANOVA, the Tukey test and the paired t test.
Results: Shedding of apical cytoplasm in the bronchiole was a prominent feature of the
St group. PAS staining revealed histochemical changes in goblet cells in the epithelium
of the St group. While there were no significant changes in lung weights and respiratory
epithelial thicknesses between all studied groups, statistical analysis showed a significant
alteration in the thickness of interalveolar septa in the St and St+GdCl3 group compared
to the control groups (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Styrene induced structural and histochemical changes in bronchiole,
interalveolar septa and alveolar organization in the rats’ lungs. Gadolinium appeared
to partially reduce the toxic effects of styrene on the lungs.

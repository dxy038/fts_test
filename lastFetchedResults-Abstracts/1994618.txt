Most of the researches who have thought on Time from the Islamic, Peripatetic, and Sadraian point of view, have concentrated on the relationship between motion and Time. This concentration perhaps caused the other faces of this sophisticated and ancient metaphysical problem be neglected. One of the most important of them is the subjectivity or objectivity of the time.
This paper wants to review the answer of Mulla Sadra’s philosophical thought to this important question. So at first I try to explain the distinction between ‘Date’ and ‘Tense’ as two separated concepts of the time. Then, I will show that the Ibn Sina and his Muslim followers’ understanding of time, is based on the first concept (Date), and on the other side, the Muslim theologians (like Ash’arites) have a similar concept.
So in The Final Step of this research, it will be shown that on the principles of Mulla Sadra’s thaught we can consider Time as a completely mental factor, so it has not been derived from any objective matter, like the ‘motion’. But we accept that this conclusion would be denied by the most followers of Mulla Sadra.

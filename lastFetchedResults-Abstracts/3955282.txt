An efficient bidirectional arbitrated decision feedback (BAD) equalizer is presented in single-carrier block transmission system in the two-ray multipath fading channels, where the output from the bidirectional equalizers are combined together directly using maximal ratio combining (MRC) rule to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) before demodulation. The computational complexity of the BAD equalizer presented is linear with the channel length, which is the same as conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and is significantly lower than that of conventional BAD equalizer as well as the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. While the performance of the new scheme depends on the specific channel characteristics, it is shown by simulation results that the performance of the new BAD can surpass the one of DFE dramatically in the minimum or non-minimum phase Two-ray multipath fading channels.

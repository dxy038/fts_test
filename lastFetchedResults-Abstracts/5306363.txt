The main objective of this paper is to explore the applicability of a new procedure to the decision process of information systems selection, the major aspect of which is tackling the uncertainty and imprecision of data, while using the risk as a trade-off measure to prioritize alternative systems. The new procedure consists in a modification of the analytic hierarchy process, where the imprecise decision-makerÂ´s judgments are represented as fuzzy numbers. A non-linear optimization method is applied, which derives crisp weights from inconsistent and consistent fuzzy comparison matrices. The weights of the risk factors are then used in an aggregation procedure for selecting the best alternative system.

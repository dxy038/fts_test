In this paper, we propose a novel spatial error concealment algorithm based on adaptive linear predictor. The predictor automatically tunes its order and support shape according to local contexts. The optimal order is determined using Bayesian Index Criterion (BIC). The order-adaptive predictor is able to recover more important features or structures. Simulation results show that compared to the state-of-the-art error concealment algorithms, the proposed method gives better reconstruction performance in terms of objective and subjective evaluations.

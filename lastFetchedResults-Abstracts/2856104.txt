In this paper, a hybrid proactive-adaptive communication strategy for quasi-decentralized MPC of nonlinear process networks is presented. The objective is to enforce the desired closed-loop stability and performance properties while reducing the cross communication between the different subsystems. The local MPC controllers are initially designed based on sampled-data distributed bounded Lyapunov-based controllers, and their closed-loop stability and performance properties are characterized in terms of local (subsystem-specific) and global (plant-wide) thresholds. A hybrid communication strategy with a proactive and adaptive components is then devised to meet the control and communication objectives at the local and plant-wide levels. In both components, each subsystem uses the stability and performance thresholds to forecast the future evolution of the state and then decide whether to establish or suspend communication with the rest of the plant. A simulated chemical process network is used to illustrate the implementation of the developed approach.

Objective: We analyzed the correlation between taste functions and clinical features in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). Methods: Sixty-three patients were divided into two groups: group A consisting of patients with primary or secondary SS of the European classification, and group B consisting of non-SS complaining of dry eye and mouth. Results: Eighteen percent of the group A patients and 11% of the group B patients complained of taste disorders. Electrogustometric examination detected taste disorders in 27% of the group A patients and 38% of the group B patients, while the filter paper disc method showed taste disorders in 30% of group A and 40% of group B. In group A, unstimulated and stimulated salivary flows were correlated with the ability to discriminate taste analyzed by the filter paper disc method, but not with the taste electrogustometric threshold. Serum zinc concentration was not significantly correlated with taste disorders in either group. Conclusion: Our findings showed that SS patients presented taste disorders less frequently than previously reported, and we speculated that taste disorder found in SS patients were due to the salivary flow deficiency that might prevent substances from reaching the taste buds.

Objective: We sought to evaluate whether vaginal pH has an effect on the relative efficacy of misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction. Study Design: Thirty-seven gravid women with an unfavorable cervix and indication for labor induction were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, observational study. Baseline assessments of cervicovaginal pH and Bishop score were made at the time of enrollment by an independent examiner. All patients received 50 μg misoprostol intravaginally every 6 hours for 12 hours. After the initial 12 hours of preinduction, a repeat Bishop score assessment was made by the same initial examiner. Patients not in active labor at 12 hours were placed on a standardized oxytocin induction regimen. Labor was managed by the on-call obstetric team, who remained blinded to pH assessment. Clinical outcomes were evaluated. Statistical analyses were made by the Student t test, the Fisher exact test, and linear regression analysis. Results: Average initial vaginal pH was 4.8 ± 0.5 (range, 3.5-7.0) for the study cohort. No significant differences were noted between those patients with low vaginal pH (≤4.5) compared with those with high pH vaginal (>4.5) with respect to maternal age, parity, gestational age, or initial Bishop score. Similarly, Bishop score change over preinduction interval (5.6 vs 4.9), time to active labor (16.3 vs 17.1 hours), time to complete dilatation (20.0 vs 19.9 hours), and time to delivery (21.0 vs 21.6 hours) were not significantly different between the low and high pH groups, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed no significant association between vaginal pH and Bishop score change during preinduction interval, time to active labor, time to complete dilatation, or time to delivery. Conclusion: Vaginal pH does not appear to influence the efficacy of intravaginally administered misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:1616-9.)

The purpose was to determine the clinical value of a multiparametric objective voice evaluation protocol including acoustic and aerodynamic parameters measured mainly on a sustained /a/. This was done by comparison with perceptual analysis of continuous speech by a jury composed of 6 experienced listeners. Voice samples (continuous speech) from 63 male patients with dysphonia and 21 control subjects with normal voices were recorded and assesed by a jury of listeners. The jury was instructed to classify voice samples according to the G (overall dysphonia) component of the GRBAS score on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 for normal to 3 for severe dysphonia. Objective parameters were recorded on an EVAآ® workstation. As usual with this type of system, parameters were measured mainly on a sustained /a/. Measured parameters included fundamental frequency (F0), intensity, jitter, shimmer, signal-to-noise ratio, Lyapunov coefficient (LC), oral airflow (OAF), maximum phonatory time (MPT), and vocal range (range). Estimated subglottic pressure (ESGP) was determined on a series of /pa/. Discriminant analysis was performed to detect correlation between jury classification and combinations of parameters. Results showed that a nonlinear combination of only six parameters (range, LC, ESGP, MPT, signal-to-noise ratio, and F0) allowed 86% concordance with jury classification. Discussion deals with the relative importance of the different objective parameters for discriminant analysis. Special emphasis is placed on two measurements rarely made in routine clinical workup, i.e., estimated subglottic pressure and Lyapunov coefficient.

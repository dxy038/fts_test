An automatic two-dimensional finite-element grid generator, which would greatly assist in improving preprocessing operations, and geometry handling, for electromagnetic field computations is presented. The algorithm developed iteratively triangulates a set of points, defining a field region, into optimal finite-element meshes. The mathematical procedures used in developing the algorithm is based on the concept of Delaunay triangulation and variational principles. The main objective of this algorithm is to efficiently reconstruct complicated field regions in terms of a set of points, known to the user, and generate optimal finite-element grids. The algorithm would also assist in preparing the geometrical and material characteristic-field regions to obtain numerical solutions. The algorithm is executed interactively

In this paper, a modified teachingâ€“learning based optimization algorithm is analyzed to solve the multi-objective optimal power flow problem considering the total fuel cost and total emission of the units. The modified phase of the optimization algorithm utilizes a self-adapting wavelet mutation strategy. Moreover, a fuzzy clustering technique is proposed to avoid extremely large repository size besides a smart population selection for the next iteration. These techniques make the algorithm searching a larger space to find the optimal solutions while speed of the convergence remains good. The IEEE 30-Bus and 57-Bus systems are used to illustrate performance of the proposed algorithm and results are compared with those in literatures. It is verified that the proposed approach has better performance over other techniques.

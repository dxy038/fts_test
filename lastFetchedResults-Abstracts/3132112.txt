The paper presents an algorithm for generating capacity adequacy study for the reliability test system IEEE RTS. based on Monte Carlo simulation-state sampling technique. The Monte Carlo simulation procedure treats the problem as a series of &#194;&#191;real&#194;&#191; experiments, whose outcomes depend on the operating characteristics of the components and of the system. The reliability indices are then estimated by observing the experiment. The paper presents some results for the generating system in the IEEE RTS. The objective of this paper is to present reliability indices and to illustrate how the Monte Carlo method can be used to provide a physical insight in the random behaviour of the generating system.

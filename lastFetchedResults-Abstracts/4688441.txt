To form a highly efficient, coordinated and comprehensive transportation system, the key work is the development and construction of strong comprehensive transport corridor, and merits of passenger transport structure within a comprehensive transport corridor is directly related to the full play of overall corridor capacity and efficiency. This paper analyzes the ideas of passenger transport structure optimization within comprehensive transport corridor using bi-level planning strategies. And then a bi-level multi-objective programming model is established in this paper, in which the upper level takes the builders and governmentÂ´s concern into account, such as system efficiency, transport capacity, capital investment. The lower level is a network equilibrium model based on a generalized cost function, while corridor saturation entropy index is introduced in the response function. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to efficiently solve this NP-hard model. Finally, numerical implementations based on Beijing-Shanghai corridor are carried out to account for the performance of our model and algorithm.

The objective of this study was to design a viable business model for commercially deploying a telerehabilitation service innovation in the R&amp;D deployment phase. In the paper the business model engineering approach used to conceptualize the deployment of this telerehabilitation service is described, analyzed and evaluated. An iterative, multi-method and combined qualitative and quantitative action design approach was used for developing the business model and related value network of the telerehabilitation service. Insights from surveys, desk research, expert interviews, workshops and quantitative modeling were combined to engineer the business model and consequently refine it in three design cycles.

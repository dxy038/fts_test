Cooperative relaying technology among secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is shown to yield a significant performance improvement, such as improving spectrum utilization as well as system fairness in CRN. This paper investigates the problem of the relay selection and resource allocation in a downlink OFDMA cognitive relay network. The objective of this optimization problem is to maximize both system throughput and system fairness, which is achieved through our proposed non-transferable utility coalition graph game algorithm (NTU-CGGA). In this algorithm, the SUs with more available channels can help SUs with less available channels to improve their utility in terms of the throughput and fairness by forming a directed tree graph. The coalition graph is formatted according to spectrum availability and traffic demands of SUs by using merge-split rule. So it can effectively exploit both space and frequency diversity of the system. Simulation results show that, NTU-CGGA significantly improves system throughput while not reducing the fairness level, which has a better performance comparing with other existing algorithms.

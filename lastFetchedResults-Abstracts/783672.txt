Background There has been an increase
in the number of systematic reviews of diagnostic
tests, which has resulted in the introduction of two
checklists: statement for reporting of diagnostic
accuracy (STARD) and quality assessment of diagnostic
accuracy studies (QUADAS). Objective To
examine the validity and usefulness of QUADAS when
applied to diagnostic accuracy studies using psychometric
instruments and to examine the quality in
reporting of these studies during practical application
of the checklist. Method Two reviewers independently
rated the quality of 54 studies using QUADAS.
The proportion of agreement was used to assess
overall agreement and individual agreement of
QUADAS items between reviewers. Results The
overall agreement between the two reviewers for all
QUADAS items combined was 85.7%. The proportion
of agreement between reviewers for each item ranged
from just over 57–100% and was over 80% for 8 of the
items. The poorest agreement was associated with the
items for selection criteria, indeterminate results and
withdrawals. None of the studies adequately reported
all relevant information to enable all QUADAS item to
be scored as ‘yes’. Conclusion Overall QUADAS was
relatively easy to use and appears to be an acceptable
tool for appraising the quality of diagnostic accuracy
studies using psychometric instruments. The application
of QUADAS was hampered by the poor quality
of reporting encountered.

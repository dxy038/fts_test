The control of double star asynchronous machine (DSAM ) has a double objective; better control of torque and minimization of the non sequential currents amplitude. A variable structure control type appear to answer to these two criteria thanks to the combination of the advantages of the space vector PWM control and the sliding mode control. Therefore, the goal of the SVPWM control is to synthesize the (&#945;&#946;) voltage vectors to satisfy the machineÂ´s torque control requirements, and, at the same time, to maintain the average volt-seconds on the (xy) plane to be zero during every sampling interval by combining the signs of the sliding surfaces and the position &#952; of the reference frame.

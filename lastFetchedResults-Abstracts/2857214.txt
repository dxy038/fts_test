The need for measuring the sound quality in VOIP environment is a basic requirement of modern multimedia communication systems due to technical, commercial and legislative reasons. Measuring the sound quality using objective methods is not standardized up till now. Expected measurement results should be in correlation with subjective tests of sound quality. The usage of application for measurement of acoustic qualities of the space is explored, with an emphasis on evaluating speech intelligibility as the main parameter. In this work we present measurement method and influence of codec choice on different hardware platforms. Objectively measured small differences showed possibility to evaluate the sound quality of voice internet protocol.

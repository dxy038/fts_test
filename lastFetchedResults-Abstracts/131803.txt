The objective of the present paper is to determine the factor(s) involved in the death of metaphor, or better said, .lexicalization of metaphorical concepts. To achieve the objective, attempts have been made to provide the readers with definitions proposed by scholars. Furthermore, the writer describes the manner in which metaphor is formed, drawing a distinction between "dead" and "live" metaphors, showing how a live metaphor turns into a lexical polysemy entering dictionaries.

Objective. The validity of assessing balance in gait by measuring balance in standing is questionable. Better methods for measuring balance during walking are therefore needed.

Design. It is suggested that the individual will demonstrate adequate postural control by moving a reference point near the body centre of mass (CoM) smoothly towards an intentional goal, even though movements of the extremities show variability consistent with a changing environment.

Background. In spite of an increased interest in variability as a prerequisite for motor control, gait analysis methods focus, to a large extent, on symmetry and repeatability of movements in stereotyped settings.

Methods. Acceleration of a reference point over the lumbar spine is registered during walking by a portable, triaxial accelerometry system.

Results. A quadratic relation between acceleration root mean square (RMS) and walking speed is demonstrated, and a second degree polynomial can therefore be computed as a curve estimate, if acceleration RMS representing at least three walking speeds are available.

Conclusions. The relation between acceleration over a reference point on the trunk and walking speed can be compared between trials and also when walking speeds are self-selected. Calibration procedures and testing of the instrument for precision and accuracy in a mechanical testing jig are described in a companion article.

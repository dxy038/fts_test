A fuzzy goal programming based approach is taken to solve an extended multi-objective mathematical linear programming model to handle two important problems in cellular manufacturing systems simultaneously: Cell formation and layout design. The advantages of proposed model are considering the machine&#194;&#191;s costs, inter-cell, intra-cell (forward and backward) material handling, operation sequence and resource constraints in machine capacity. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed model, an example has been selected and computational results are presented.

Background and Objective: Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and active lifestyle is known as an important factor for health in all ages. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence regular physical activity of female high school students in Hamadan using BASNEF model.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, while using cluster random sampling method, 622 female students from six high schools were voluntarily entered into the study. A demographic questionnaire, IPAQ and constructs of BASNEF model were used to collect the data. Validity and reliability of scales were assessed with a panel of experts and Cronbach's alpha. To analyze the data, Chi-square, ANOVA, T-test and correlation were used.
Results: 46.2% of the students had low physical activity, 28 percent of them had moderate and 25.8 % had severe physical activity. Grade of education, level of mother’s education and previous physical activity had significant correlation with student’s physical activity (p <  0.05). The attitude toward behavior, behavioral intentions and enabling factors statistically associated with physical activity status (p = 0.01). Subjective norms were effective on physical activity via behavioral intention (p  <  0.001).
Conclusion: Low rate of female students’ physical activity in Hamadan calls for an intervention based on models and theories of behavior change to promote and maintain physical activity.

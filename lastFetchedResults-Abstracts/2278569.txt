Polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be added to forage based diets rich in tannins for ruminant feeding because it binds to tannins and thus prevent the formation of potentially indigestible tanninâ€“protein complexes. The objective of this work was to determine the in vitro biodegradation (mineralization, i.e., complete breakdown of PEG to CO2) rate of PEG. 14C-Polyethylene glycol (14C-PEG) was added to three different tropical soils (a sandy clay loam soil, SaCL; a sandy clay soil, SaC; and a sandy loam soil, SaL) and was incubated in Bartha flasks. Free PEG and PEG bound to tannins from a tannin rich local shrub were incubated under aerobic conditions for up to 70 days. The biodegradation assay monitored the 14CO2 evolved after degradation of the labelled PEG in the soils. After incubation, the amount of 14CO2 evolved from the 14C-PEG application was low. Higher PEG mineralization values were found for the soils with higher organic matter contents (20.1 and 18.6 g organic matter/kg for SaCL and SaC, respectively) than for the SaL soil (11.9 g organic matter/kg) (P &lt; 0.05). The extent of mineralization of PEG after 70 days of incubation in the soil was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) when it was added as bound to the browse tannin than in the free form (0.040 and 0.079, respectively).

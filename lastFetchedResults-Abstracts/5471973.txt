In this paper we solve the problem of linear precoding for the downlink in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The transmitter and the receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas and each user may receive multiple data streams. Our objective is to jointly optimize the power allocation and transmit-receive filters for all users. We develop the optimization for two different criteria: (1) minimizing the total transmitted power while satisfying SINR constraints and (2) minimizing the sum mean squared error given a total power budget. We take advantage of the duality between the uplink and downlink to derive the solution.

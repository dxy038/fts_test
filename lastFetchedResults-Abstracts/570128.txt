Introduction & Objective: Relationship between overweight being and obese with metabolic risk factors of the cardiovascular disease in adolescent boy considering the variety and irregular motional patterns, has attracted the researchers' attention. The aim of this study was to investigate biochemical and anthropometrical risk factors of the cardiovascular system, daily physical activity (steps/day) and aerobic capacity of overweight and normal weight adolescent boys. 
Materials & Methods: Fifty six adolescent boys were recruited in two groups; over weight-obese as a risk receptive group (n=28) and normal weight (n=28). Blood lipids, daily steps (physical activity volume), body composition and aerobic capacity were measured with standard methods.
Results: TG, TC, LDL-C and VLDL–C concentrations and TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C in the normal weight individuals were significantly lower than the overweight subjects (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005 respectively). The Aerobic capacity of normal weight was better than overweight-obese ones (P < 0.001). The Mean of Daily steps of overweight group (12617±868 steps/day) was significantly lower than normal weight group(14941±1159 steps/day)(P < 0.001).
Conclusion: It seems that living an active life (14941±1159 step day) can reduce biochemical and anthropometrical risk factors of the cardiovascular disease.

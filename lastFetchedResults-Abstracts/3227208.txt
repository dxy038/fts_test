Microgrid becomes one of the key spot in research on distributed energy system. Since the definition of the microgrid is paradigm by the first time, investigation in this area is growing continuously and there are numerous research projects in this moment over the world. The main objective of this paper is to make a comprehensive survey focused on the power quality improvement in microgrid. The increased infiltration of nonlinear loads and power electronic interfaced distribution generation systems creates power quality issues in the distributed power system. Whereas major power quality problems are voltage unbalance, frequency regulation and harmonic elimination are discussed.

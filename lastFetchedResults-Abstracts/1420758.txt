Dovetail joints between fan blades and the disk of turbine engines are subjected to fretting. The objective of this research is to realize wear prediction by computational methods. The goal is obviously the estimation of wear kinetics, but also to obtain worn surfaces, and permit the manufacturer to realize complementary design analyses with worn surfaces. A wear law developed for titanium alloy and based on the friction dissipated energy is used. A computational method based on a three scale analysis is presented. The originality consists of coupling a semi-analytical (SA) contact solver with the FE method for the structural behavior, allowing a fine discretization of the contact zone. Contact computations are fast enough to realize cyclic wear computations. Results for the blade/disk system are exhibited.

This paper presents a methodology for energy planning in individualized plants with electrical validation. The objective is to accommodate the energy dispatches from each system generation plant to the electrical constraints of the transmission network. For this purpose, a step by step algorithm is proposed, based on the iterative solution of electrical validation and energy optimization problems using the Optimal Power Flow tool (OPF). If the individualized generation decisions do not meet the flow limit constraints of the transmission lines, new constraints are generated for the energy problem to modify the plant dispatches. A case study involving the Brazilian system proves the effectiveness of the proposed constraint for electrical validation.

The objective of the advanced launch system (ALS) program is to develop a family of launch vehicles which provides a substantial improvement in reliability, operability, and economy over existing systems. This requires that autopilot design and verification procedures be of minimum sensitivity to recurring costs while providing adequate, but not necessarily optimal, vehicle performance. One approach to accomplishing this task, namely, the utilization of advanced control design and analysis techniques, is considered. It is shown that the techniques, which represent a cross-section of developments in control theory, attempt to solve the ALS control problem in one of two ways: given increased knowledge of the launch vehicle and its environment, through greater model fidelity and additional sensor data; and autopilot design in the presence of quantified model/disturbance uncertainties and less stringent sensing requirements. It is concluded that the methods are promising and cost effective.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The advent of microelectronics has made possible a wide range complex equipment to be used within a limited space. In such systems, coaxial cables are used as interconnects in closely spaced bundles. These conditions dictate that particular attention has to be paid to the interference caused by electromagnetic coupling between the cables so that improvements achieved by the use of high performance equipment are not nullified. Because of the mechanical constraints, however, the coaxial cables have to be flexible and hence employ braided outer conductors, which contain a large number of small diamond shaped holes which permit the TEM wave inside to couple outside and vice-versa. The objective of this work is to apply a new crosstalk model to describe this field coupling caused by the leakage from coaxial cables.

Background: With increasing numbers of long-term survivors after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD), postoperative quality of life (QOL) has become a great concern. However, few reports are available on data of the postoperative changes in QOL after PPPD.

Methods: A total of 20 patients were studied regarding QOL before and at short term (within 2 months), intermediate term (6 months), and long term (1 year) after PPPD, using a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 13 physical and 10 psychosocial items. The medical records were also reviewed to evaluate objective nutritional status. Factors predicting delayed recovery of QOL were examined at intermediate term by univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results: Overall and physical QOL scores returned to the preoperative level at intermediate term after PPPD, showing parallel changes with the objective nutritional status. However, the scores of psychosocial condition, which reflected the patientâ€™s mental health, remained low even at long term. QOL scores at intermediate term in patients with pancreatic carcinoma were significantly lower than those with other diseases. Univariate analysis showed that preoperative body weight loss, impaired preoperative pancreatic exocrine function, long operative time, intraoperative radiotherapy, pancreatic carcinoma, and postoperative diarrhea were factors predicting the delayed recovery of QOL. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative pancreatic exocrine function significantly affected the delayed recovery of QOL.

Conclusions: Preoperative supplement of pancreatic enzymes together with perioperative mental care would improve QOL at long term after PPPD.

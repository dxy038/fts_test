Background: Tonsils and adenoids are involved in both local immunity and immune surveillance for the development of immune defense mechanisms. A number of investigators have found decreased immunoglobulin levels after adenotonsillectomy while others have failed to find significant changes. The effects of adenotonsillectomy on the cellular immunity of children have not been investigated extensively. Objective: To observe the change in humeral and cellular immune systems before and after operation in patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Methods: The study comprised 102 patients; all of the patients underwent adenotonsillectomy. The levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were measured for humoral immunity and the percent of CD7 and CD19 positive cells were determined in blood samples taken from these patients 24 hours before operation and also 2 and 8 weeks after the operation. The results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The present study shows that the serum level of IgA would rise few weeks after the operation. Changes in the IgM and IgG level were not statistically significant postoperatively. In addition, no significant change was detected in B lymphocyte count before and after adenotonsillectomy. In our study, there was a slight decrease in the T lymphocyte count in the early stage of post operation, which returned to normal preoperative value after 8 weeks. Conclusion: Several immune system parameters maintain its normal status several weeks after adenotonsillectomy

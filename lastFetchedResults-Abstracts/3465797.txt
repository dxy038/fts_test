A large amount of research is currently focusing on the issue of the adaptive control of the quality-of-service (QoS) provided to multimedia applications in heterogeneous wireless systems. In this paper, the authors aim at contributing to this issue by proposing a mechanism that exploits user profiling techniques and suitable QoS mapping functions to introduce the soft QoS idea into a wireless multimedia scenario. The research objective is a QoS control architecture, which enables the continuous convergence between the actual user preferences and expectations and the resource constraints of the underlying wireless system. The proposed architecture operates between the system and the application layer. This allows it to achieve the intended results, by means of an effective dynamic reconfiguration of the applications and the contemporary renegotiation of the wireless resources.

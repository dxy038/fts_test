Color image quantization is a process of selecting a set of colors to display an image with some representative colors, this without noticeable perceived difference. Whatever the matter we deal with; (1) the definition of a relevant quantization process, or (2) the evaluation of the possible errors linked to this quantization, the problem remains the same: the definition of an objective criterion which takes into account the perceptual aspect of the degradation observation between an original image and its quantized representation. In this paper we deal with the problem of the quantization errors evaluation in taking into account two new criteria: the LSE measure and the SCAP measure. Knowing that at least these new evaluation criteria will be used in quantization techniques in order to minimize the possible degradations that would be perceived

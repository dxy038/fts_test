Background: In the industrial world, almost everyone is unavoidably exposed to ambient electromagnetic field (EMF) generated from various technical and household appliances. 
Objective: Controversy exists about the effects of EMF on various tissues of the living bodies. Uterus play an important role in reproductive and the effects of EMF on its tissue is worthy of investigation. 
Methods: In order to examine this, 40 rat were selected and kept for one weeks in quarantine and 20 rats subdivided to two groups were exposed to 50 Hz (non-ionizing radiation) for 6 weeks, one of this exposed group received 0.7 g/kg Ocimum basilicum, other experimental group just received 0.7 g/kg Ocimum basilicum, The materials were processed and observed apoptosis under a light microscope. 
Results: In the experimental rats apoptotic cells showed significantly increased in emf groups, but in exposed group that received Ocimum basilicum ,apoptotic cells were decreased (p<0.05). 
Conclusion: As exposure to EMF may result in pathological changes then lead to sub fertility and infertility, Since in our study 0.7 g/kg Ocimum basilicum have significantly Preventive effect on uterus cells damages by reducing number of Apoptotic cells, so it seems that using it can be effective for treatment in emf exposed Rat.

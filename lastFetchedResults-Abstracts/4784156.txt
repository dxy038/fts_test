Assessment of Object Oriented Software Design Quality has been an important issue among researchers in Software Engineering discipline. In this paper, we propose an approach for determining the design quality of Object Oriented Software System. The approach makes use of a set of UML diagrams created during the design phase of the development process. Design metrics are fetched from the UML diagrams using a parser developed by us and design quality is assessed using a Hierarchical Model of Software Design Quality. To validate the design quality, we compute the product quality for the same software that corresponds to the UML design diagrams using available tools METRIC 1.3.4, JHAWK and Team In a Box. The objective is to establish a correspondence between design quality and product quality of Object Oriented Software. For this purpose, we have chosen priory known three software of Low, Medium and High quality. This is a work under progress, though; the substantial task has already been completed.

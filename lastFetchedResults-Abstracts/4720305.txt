In this paper, we provide the biomechanical model of human upper limb we have designed and applied to the three-dimensional left human arm reconstructed from the visible human imaging dataset. This model includes the mechanical properties for bones, joints and muscles lines of action. This work has been done as a part of the European Esprit Project CHARM. Its objective is to develop a comprehensive human animation resource model allowing the dynamic simulation of complex musculoskeletal systems, including finite element deformation of soft-tissues and muscular contraction. In our approach, simplifications have been done so as to ensure the feasibility of the project while preserving the biomechanical validity of the model.

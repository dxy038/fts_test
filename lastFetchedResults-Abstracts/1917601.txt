AbstractPurpose
erative intravesical chemotherapy following transurethral resection of bladder tumor has been underused despite level 1 evidence supporting its performance. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the economic and humanistic consequences associated with preventable recurrences in patients initially diagnosed with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.
als and methods
population based estimates of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer incidence, a 2-year model was developed to estimate the number of preventable recurrences in eligible patients untreated with perioperative intravesical chemotherapy. Therapy utilization rates were obtained from a retrospective database analysis and a chart review study of 1,010 patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Recurrence rates of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer were obtained from a randomized clinical trial comparing transurethral resection of bladder tumor with or without perioperative mitomycin C. Costs were estimated using prevailing Medicare reimbursement rates. Quality adjusted life-year estimates and disutilities for complications were obtained from the literature.
s
del estimated that 7,827 bladder recurrences could be avoided if all patients received immediate intravesical chemotherapy. It estimated an economic savings of $3,847 per avoidable recurrence, resulting in an aggregate savings of $30.1 million. The model also estimated that 1,025 quality adjusted life-years are lost every 2 years due to preventable recurrences, resulting in 0.13 quality adjusted life-years (48 quality adjusted days) lost per avoidable recurrence. This translates into 0.02 quality adjusted life-years (8.1 quality adjusted days) lost per patient not receiving immediate intravesical chemotherapy.
sions
r use of immediate intravesical chemotherapy in the United States has the potential to substantially decrease the economic and humanistic burdens of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.

The main objective of this study was demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the Home Care Activity Desk (HCAD) system in a home setting. The study was partly a randomized control trial study in which HCAD is compared to usual care. The patients using the HCAD system show during the month of treatment significant improvements on the individual tasks measured by the execution time. The overall results of the HCAD system concerning clinical effectiveness are positive. The HCAD system for chronic Stroke, TBI and MS patients is shown to be at least as effective as usual care.

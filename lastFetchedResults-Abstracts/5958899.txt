The objective of functional safety is the development of a system with insignificant risk potential. For that purpose, all risk reduction measures have to be considered early in development. This requires a close collaboration of different engineering disciplines in order to specify a comprehensive safety concept. The international functional safety standard ISO 26262 has to be considered for the development of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles, which additionally provides a basic framework to consider also non-E/E measures. This paper proposes (1) a methodology for examining the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment and (2) a workflow for the elaboration of an integrated safety concept with respect to different kinds of safety measures. One main lesson learned was that the consideration of all kinds of risk reduction measures in the concept phase improves the understanding of the overall safety of a system and that involving various fields of expertise enables the development of a clear safety concept.

Recent research has shown that software small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are a very important cog in the gears of the world economy and comprise of about 99.2% of the companies in the world . In India, about 99% software companies are SMEs and about 15% of them develop software products . As per a study, about 40% of new software products fail in the market . The basic objective was to understand the fundamental reasons for the failure and propose a better model for making the products successful. To realize the objective, the authors have analyzed data of eight projects from five SMEs developing software products to understand the process related issues. As a result of the study, an evolutionary process model was developed and implemented in two SMEs. In this paper, we discuss the proposed model, results and experiences. The model proposed will help the companies to develop software products with better quality, limited manpower, reduced cost and time to market.

Objective
To evaluate the incidence of urinary tract injury due to hysterectomy for benign disease.
Study design
Patients were enrolled prospectively from 3 sites. All patients undergoing abdominal, vaginal, or laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign disease underwent diagnostic cystourethroscopy.
Results
Four hundred seventy-one patients participated. Ninety-six percent (24/25) of urinary tract injuries were detected intraoperatively. There were 8 cases of ureteral injury (1.7%) and 17 cases of bladder injury (3.6%). Ureteral injury was associated with concurrent prolapse surgery (7.3% vs 1.2%; P = .025). Bladder injury was associated with concurrent anti-incontinence procedures (12.5% vs 3.1%; P = .049). Abdominal hysterectomy was associated with a higher incidence of ureteral injury (2.2% vs 1.2%) but this was not significant. Only 12.5% of ureteral injuries and 35.3% of bladder injuries were detected before cystoscopy.
Conclusion
The incidence of urinary tract injury during hysterectomy is 4.8%. Surgery for prolapse or incontinence increases the risk. Routine use of cystoscopy during hysterectomy should be considered.

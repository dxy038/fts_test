We consider a point-to-point wireless link with automatic repeat request (ARQ) based packet transmission where both the transmitter and receiver nodes are energy harvesting (EHNs). Transmitter EHN has access to low-grade channel state information (CSI) as it is implicitly obtained from ARQ feedback. Furthermore, signal processing tasks such as sampling and decoding at the receiver EHN can be interrupted if there is insufficient energy in the battery that cause loss of packet and wastage of harvested energy both at the transmitter and receiver EHNs. We propose selective sampling (SS) scheme where only part of the transmitted packet is sampled and stored depending on the receiver nodes stored energy. SS information (SSI) is then fed back to the transmitter. Packet decoding is not performed until full packet is constructed. Hence, we modify the conventional ARQ messages, i.e., ACK/NAK by adding few more bits to carry additional SSI as well. Another objective is to find the optimal power allocation policy to adapt to the low-grade CSI and SSI available at the transmitter such that harvested energy can be utilized efficiently especially at the receiver. Furthermore, using a decision-theoretic framework, we propose greedy power allocation scheme to evaluate the performance of the proposed retransmission scheme. In numerical examples, we illustrate that our proposed scheme has lower average packet transmission time and packet drop probability (PDP) compared to the equal power allocation and greedy power allocation with conventional retransmission scheme.

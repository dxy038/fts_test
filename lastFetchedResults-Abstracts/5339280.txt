The objective of this paper is to present a novel bi-directional three-phase rectifier without using DC-link current sensor. Therefore, the off-shelf DC/AC stage can be used to realize such bi-directional rectifier with only slight modification to the control software. This feature provides the possibility of building a back-to-back AC/DC/AC system using two identical hardware modules. An experimental system is set up to verify the presented rectifier. It is shown that the THD of current is less than 5% and the harmonic contents meet the IEEE 61000-3-2. The experimental results fully confirm the algorithm and implementation

We proposed a novel scheme for frequency quadrupling using a Sagnac loop employing polarization manipulation and a single travelling-wave LN intensity modulator (IM) depending on the velocity mismatch phenomenon. The bidirectional Faraday rotator (BFR) is equivalent to a TE-TM modes converter incorporated in the loop, which is composed of circular connected optical circulators and 90&#176; Faraday mirrors. The undesired sideband is suppressed by properly control the state of polarization (SOP) and the modulation index of the IM. A frequency quadrupled microwave signal is generated with an unwanted harmonic suppression ratio of 27.5 dB.

The research paper covered the 3 by 3 odd orientation array antenna (OOAA) design and fabrication by using Leucaena leucochephala bio-composite substrate material. The objective of the paper was to utilize and design off centered orientation feed array antenna with circular BalUn and dual matching stub to control the impedance mismatch issue onto the bio-composite substrate with the mixture of 70% stem wood Leucaena leucochephala at 40 mesh and 30% of polypropylene polymer act as laminator and noted as PB7030 substrate. The PB7030 reported constant on all dielectric constant (&#949;r = 3.02) and loss Tangent (Tan &#948; = 0.0082) value for the WLAN 2.4GHz applications. The overall result show some good agreement between simulation and fabricated result (Gain =7.15dBi, VSWR=1.01, S11=-34.34dB and Bandwidth = 0.201GHz). All comparison result between simulation and fabricated antenna analyzed and displayed in the form of data and graph.

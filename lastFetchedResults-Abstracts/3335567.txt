In this work, the concept of sensor management is introduced and stochastic dynamic programming based resource allocation approach is proposed to track multi target. The core of this approach is to use Lagrange relaxation for decreasing the state space dimension. By this approximation, the overall problem is separated into components instead of using joint Markov model to optimize large scale stochastic control problem. The aim of this study is to adaptively allocate radar resources in an optimal way in order to maintain track qualities for multi-target case. Time scale is divided into two levels that are called as micro management and macro management. During this work, we deal with macro management part that aims to construct a policy which is optimal for a given objective function under the resource constraints. In this work, some rule based techniques are added into simulation. The performance of algorithm is analyzed on the average number of update decision and average number of target drops in time horizon.

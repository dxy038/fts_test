Background: Laurus nobilis is a small tree, especial to Mediterranean regions that its leaves are used as flavoring agents in food. Now, this plant is cultivated in Iran and many parts of the world.
Objective: In this research, the effects of different distillation methods on essential oil yield and composition of Laurus nobilis leaves was studied. 
Methods: The fresh leaves of Laurus nobilis L., cultivated in National Botanical of Iran were collected at July 2009. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation, hydrosteam distillation and direct steam distillation from the leaves of Laurus nobilis. The oils were analyzed by capillary GC (UFM) and GC-MS. 
Results: The oils were obtained at yields of 2.53%, 2.45% and 1.63% by hydro, hydrosteam and direct steam distillation, respectively. Twenty-five components were identified in the oil of Laurus nobilis obtained by different extraction methods, including 1,8-cineol (47.3, 37.8, 47.7 %), sabinene (11.1, 12.3, 12.2 %) and ?-terpinyl acetate (12.9, 19.3, 12.9 %) by hydro, hydrosteam and direct steam distillation, respectively. 
Conlusion: Statistical analysis showed significant difference between oil yield (w/w) of hydro-distillation method (2.53%) compared to steam distillation (1.63 %). Significant difference was observed between 1,8-cineol and ?-terpinyl acetate percentage in the oils obtained by different distillation methods.

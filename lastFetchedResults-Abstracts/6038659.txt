The planning and scheduling problem of distributed guidance system (DGS) is investigated. A distributed planning and scheduling approach for DGS is proposed based on negotiation of Multiple Agent System (MAS). A distributed architecture of MAS for DGS is designed, and the functions of agents for different layers are presented elaborately. A contract-net-based coordinate protocol between launching agent and guidance agents is proposed. A priority based strategy is designed to select the bid mission and the bid approach based on dynamic task insertion. The appropriate evaluation strategy and corresponding objective function are given. Aiming at some dynamic observation situations, corresponding dynamic mission conversion processes are designed.

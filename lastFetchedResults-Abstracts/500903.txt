Background: ?-lactamase is an enzyme that can inactivate ?–Lactam family antibiotics. High prevalence of ?-lactamase producer bacteria on the staff hands, due to antibiotic resistance and nosocomial infection in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of ?-lactamase positive bacteria and antibiogram pattern in bacterial flora isolated from staff hands of the Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan.
Materials and Method: This laboratory research was performed during of 2005-2007 in Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan. According to statistical formula, we randomly selected 80 samples from staff hands. Staff hand samples collected with finger print method. Bacterial identification was performed with microbiological methods and ?–lactamase production was performed with Acidometric method and antibiogram pattern was performed with Kirby Bauer method.
Results: According to the acidometric test results of 80 isolated staff hands, 61.85% of strains produce ?–lactamase. Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were the most important producers respectively (70.83%, 64.72% and 50%). According to antibiogram test results, penicillin and vancomycin had the highest and lowest resistance. 
Conclusion: High frequency of ?–lactamase in bacterial survey represents colonization of bacteria in staff hands; may be due to facility transmission ?–lactamase plasmid genes in bacteria. We suggest better hand washing in hospitals and prescription of ?–lactame antibiotics was based only on antibiogram results. [ZJRMS, 2011; 13(7):44-49]

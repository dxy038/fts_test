ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Infertility is an individual and a social problem that affects the infertile couple's life and family functioning and may expose them to mental disorders or stress. The aim of this study was to compare the depression and life quality of fertile women and those who suffer from infertility and frequent abortions. 
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, 30 participants with at least 3 year infertility, 30 participants with at least 2 frequent abortions from medical centers clients and 30 fertile participants who were available in Kerman city, Iran in the first half of the year 2012 were chosen. Data was gathered by using Beck depression and the quality of life questionnaires, the lowest achieved score was 12 for quality of life and 5 for depression and the highest achieved score for quality of life was 48 and for depression was 61. Then gathered data was compared.  
FINDINGS: Depression in women with frequent abortions (36.70±14.28) was more than infertile (24.07±6.16) and fertile women (15.90±11.13). Also life quality of fertile women (34.67±7.02) was more than women with frequent abortions (23.03±7.53) and infertile women (21.23±7.05). There was a significant difference among these groups in two indicators (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that women suffering from infertility and frequent abortions have higher depression score and lower quality of life score than infertile women.

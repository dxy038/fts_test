This paper studies chaos synchronization of three coupled chaos systems with ring connection. New generic criteria of global chaos synchronization are proposed respectively according to the way of coupling (unidirectional or bidirectional). As an example, The criteria are successfully applied to three coupled identical Lorenz systems. Numerical simulation are shown for demonstration.

In this paper, the transaction costs will be added to the entropy optimization models including Mean-Entropy model and Mean-Cross-Entropy model, which make the models more rational and objective. The empirical study is done in twenty stocks of Shanghai A Share Stock Exchange to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the two models.

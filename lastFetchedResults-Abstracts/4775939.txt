TodayÂ´s enterprises concentrate on rendering services, and adopting these services stress upon quality. Attributes pertaining to quality are the main focus of these services. One such factor contributing much towards quality is reusability. Reusability can be thought of in all services including business services. Enterprise business process are broken into business tasks, and converted into business services respectively. Making business services to be reusable is one way to obtain quality in them. Reusability evolved from object oriented systems to component based systems and recently into service oriented systems. What level of reusability and to which extent? paved a need to measure these non-functional attributes of quality. The objective of this paper is to explore the research opportunities in Service reusability of SOA systems. A detailed review is done towards the works on reusability. We have proposed a methodology which is to be adopted to address the research problem.

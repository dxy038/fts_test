This paper proposes a novel three-phase bidirectional rectifier for motor load. According to the motorÂ´s operational status, it can draw on power form grid as a power factor correction rectifier or feedback power to grid as inverter. In both cases, the currents are sinusoidal and the power factor of grid is unit. The controller is implemented with simple analog components, so it is simple and reliable. A 6KW simulotion model and experimental prototype were buit to verify the correctness and feasibility of theory. The results of simulation and experiment proved the correctness and feasibility. The rectifier has the advantage of bidirectional power flowing, unit power factor,simple simple, high performance, high reliability, so it provides an excellent solution for AC-DC convertor of motor driver, and has important value for engineering application.

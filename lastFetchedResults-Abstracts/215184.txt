The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence
of genital C. trachomatis infection in asymptomatic women by using highly
sensitive nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in urine sample.
Materials and Methods: One hundred-forty asymptomatic women were
randomly selected from those who attended gynecology out patient department
of Hazraat e Rasool Hospital inTehran. First catch urine specimen were collected
from all the participants . DNA extraction was performed by means of High
Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (HPPTP) according to the manufacture's
instructions. Extracted DNA was tested by omp1 gene based nested-PCR,
using sets of primers to amplify C. trachomatis omp1 gene. Visualization
of a 1027 bp fragment from omp1 gene in agarose gel electrophoresis was
considered as a positive result.
Results: In total , 140 urines were tested for determination of C. trachomatis
infection. C. trachomatis omp-1 was detected in 22.1% of cases (31/140). The
overall prevalence rates of C. trachomatis in the urine sample as determined by
omp1 based nested-PtlR were 4.3% in group I (age, <25 years), 12.1% in group
II (age, 25-34 years), 5.0% in group III (age, 35-44 years) and 0.7% in group IV
(>44 years). The highest prevalence of C. trachomatis infection (12.1%) was
seen in women aged 25-34 years. This finding was not statistically significant
(p=O.710). Also, there was not relation between C. trachomatis infection and
some probable risk factors such as young age Â«25 years), STO history and
missing use of barrier contraceptive in this study.
Conclusion: The prevalence of C.trachomatis infection in the women not
seeking health care warrants more comprehensive study using high sensitive
omp1 based nested- PCR to identify and treat a large number of infected
women in Iran.

It is a well known fact that vibration is one of the most important loading condition in electronic systems. This study deals with dynamic analysis of a printed circuit board (PCB) with a component on it under vibratory loading. The objective of the study is to develop an analytical model for common PCB configurations and electronic components on them in order to predict dynamics of the assembly under vibratory loading, and thus to study the effects of component location. As an application, in this paper an analytical model of a simply supported PCB with a component is presented. The validity of the two degree of freedom analytical model is demonstrated by comparing numerical results for random vibration input with those of a finite element model.

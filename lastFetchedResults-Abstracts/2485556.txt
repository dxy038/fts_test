Objective : Fever in pregnancy is a common clinical problem which increases risk of morbidity of the mother and fetus. We studied the variable medical complications of pregnant women suffering from fever and the possible fetal complications.
Materials and Methods: 183 pregnant women with fever were studied prospectively. Necessary investigations to detect the underlying cause were performed. Patients with fever due to septic abortions and blood transfusions were excluded. Maternal complications and adverse perinatal outcomes in terms preterm delivery, perinatal death, low birth weight and low Apgar score at 5 minutes after birth were recorded. Frequency of occurrence of maternal complications was compared according to their age, parity and period of gestation.

Results: Malaria was found to be the leading cause of pyrexia among pregnant mothers (35%). Both maternal and fetal complications were highest when malaria was the cause of fever. Low birth weight was the most common adverse pregnancy outcome and there were 4 perinatal deaths. No statistical association was present between age, parity or period of gestation and frequency of occurrence of maternal complications in antepartum febrile illness.

Conclusion â€“ Our study depicts that a wide range of maternal medical complications as well as fetal and neonatal complications occur due to pyrexia in pregnancy from various etiologies.

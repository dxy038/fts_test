This paper presents a novel error concealment method for video decoding system. The proposed algorithm adaptively combines the spatial interpolation and the temporal prediction technique based on block variance and interframe correlation, to recover the lost data. The adaptive function depends on the scene change detection, motion distance and spatial information from the nearby blocks of the previous and current frames to determine the weighting of the spatial interpolation and the temporal compensation. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve well subjective and quantitative results, and outperforms all the others against which are compared. Even if the scene changes in the videos, this algorithm also can efficiently recover the damaged blocks for Intra(I), Predictive(P), and Bidirectional (B) frames.

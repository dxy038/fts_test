Raw starch has been used in recent years as a direct substrate for enzyme digestion in the production of fermentation products. The objective of this study was to examine the differences between the residual raw starch produced after partial hydrolysis with these enzymes and compare the enzyme treated and native material. In order to examine the porous starch granules produced due to partial hydrolysis, they were examined calorimetrically using DSC. A structural analysis was also made using SEM.

The pseudoerror method based on amplitude threshold variation is applied to differential detection of QPSK (quaternary phase-shift keying), OQPSK (offset QPSK), DUOMSK (duobinary minimum-shift keying), and MSK signals. The objective of this differential-detection estimation was to reduce the simulation time required for bit-error-rate estimation relative to the Monte Carlo method. The gain in simulation time obtained in this way was shown in a specific case to be on the order of 5.5 and 8.7 for amplitude thresholds of 10 and 15%. The small approximation error values of the order of 0.1 to 0.4 dB obtained with these thresholds lead to the conclusion that the method gives very good results, permitting performance estimates for bit error rates smaller than 10<sup>-4</sup>

Objective: To assess relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 
I radiation relative to 
Co
gamma rays in glioblastoma spheroid cells. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, glioblastoma spheroid cells were
exposed to 
131
I radiation and 
Co gamma rays. Radiation induced DNA damage was
evaluated by alkaline comet assay. Samples of spheroid cells were treated by radiation
from 
131
60
I for four different periods of time to find the dose-response equation. Spheroid
cells were also exposed by 200 cGy of 
Co gamma rays as reference radiation to induce
DNA damage as endpoint. 
Results: Resulted RBE of 
131
60
I radiation relative to 
Co gamma rays in 100 Âµm giloblastoma
spheroid cells was equal to 1.16.
Conclusion: The finding of this study suggests that 
60
I photons and electrons can be more
effective than 
60
131
Co gamma rays to produce DNA damage in glioblastoma spheroid cells.

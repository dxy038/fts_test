Introduction: Vaginalatresia can be congenital or acquired. Absence of a functional vagina can lead to primary or secondary amenorrhea and haematometra.

Objective: Survey the Amnion Graft in Treatment of Congenital Absence of the Vagina.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 14 cases of vaginal agenesis between 1997 until 2008 years were analyzed. The amnion membrane of elective cesarean section was kept in new space using a 20ml syringe covered by sponge or elastic band as a mould. Patients with vaginal agenesis underwent vaginoplasty using amniotic membrane grafts according to Frank method.

Result: Twelve patients had Mayer-von-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS) and others (2) had vaginal agenesis with normal functional uterus. All patients were between 20 and 26 years old. Regular menstrual periods were observed in two patients that had normal uterus one month after operation. The follow-up pelvic ultrasonography was normal. After operation one of the 14 patients (7.1%) developed vaginal stenosis; that were corrected with sexual intercourse. All of married patients were satisfied of sexual function. The incidences of urologic abnormalities were (21.4%): congenital horseshoe kidney found in two patients and one patient had only one kidney. Stenosis of the vagina was reported in one patient. All patients achieved a good outcome Conclusion: Using amniotic membrane as an allograft for vaginal reconstruction showed very good outcome with a resultant good caliber new vagina.

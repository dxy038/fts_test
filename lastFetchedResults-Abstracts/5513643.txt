Given a distributed network of processors represented by an undirected graph <e1>G</e1>=(<e1>V</e1>, <e1>E</e1>) and a file size <e1>k</e1>, the problem of distributing an arbitrary file <e1>w</e1> of <e1>k</e1> bits among all nodes of the network <e1>G</e1> is considered. Memory devices are to be assigned to the node of <e1>G</e1> such that, by accessing the memory of its own and of its adjacent nodes, each node can reconstruct the contents of <e1>w</e1>. The objective is to minimize the total size memory in the network. A file distribution scheme that realizes this objective for <e1>k</e1>&#8811;log &#916;<sub>G</sub>, where &#916;<sub>G</sub>, stands for the maximum degree in <e1>G</e1>, is presented. For this range of <e1>k</e1>, the total size of memory required by the suggested scheme approaches an integer programming lower bound on that size

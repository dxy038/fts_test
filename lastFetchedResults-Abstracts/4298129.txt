This work study the symbol phase synchronizer of mixed loop. This synchronizer is composed by a previous tuning filter followed of a carrier Phase Lock Loop (CPLL). The tuning filter is an open loop but the CPLL is a closed loop. The tuning filter is equal for all the synchronizers, but the CPLL has four types namely the analog, the hybrid, the combinational and the sequential.The objective is to study the four synchronizers and evaluate the output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus the input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

Volume holographic imaging(VHI)system is a new method that using volume holographic lens in 3-D imaging. The field diffracted by the volume holographic lens is measured to obtain the specific information that is required about the optical field. This paper considers two simple implementations using holograms recorded with spherical and plane beams. We derive the point-spread function (PSF) of these systems using volume diffraction theory and use the PSF to estimate depth resolution. Furthermore, we show that appropriately designed objective optics can significantly improve the depth resolution or the working distance of plane-wave reference holographic imaging systems. Increase VHI systems in the application of three-dimensional imaging of the depth resolution, can reproduce the true three-dimensional objects, to improve the recognition of three-dimensional objects.

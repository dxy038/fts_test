Objective
tudy aimed to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) and their socio-demographic correlates in both the urban and rural areas of Beijing, China.
s
l of 4767 adults were randomly selected and interviewed in Beijing using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected during the interviews.
s
erall 12-month prevalence of MDE was 3.2%; 2.8% and 3.8% for men and women, respectively. The overall lifetime prevalence of MDE was 5.3%; 4.4% and 6.3% for men and women, respectively. Being older than 25Â years of age was independently associated with increased risk of MDE. Sixteen point three percent of the subjects with lifetime MDE attempted suicide while the rate of suicide attempts was only 0.2% in subjects without MDE. The percentage of subjects with MDE who received any type of treatment from medical practitioners was 33.1%; of them, only 5.4% sought help from mental health professionals.
sions
al epidemiologic surveys are needed to further explore the prevalence of MDE in China. The low percentage of subjects treated for MDE constitutes a major public health problem that should be urgently addressed.

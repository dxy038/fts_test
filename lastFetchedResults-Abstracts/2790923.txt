Code division multiple access (CDMA) is one of the promising techniques in cellular mobile communications system used for radio accessing and personal communication systems. Besides several practical advantages, CDMA suffers with multiuser interference, limiting the spectral efficiency drastically. There are various optimal and suboptimal multi user detection techniques in CDMA to overcome this problem. These MUDs identify the desired users signal but the interference signal is high and there is a chance of loosing the signal. By considering these drawbacks, we propose a MUD technique using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The main objective of this technique is to detect the desired user signal with less interference ratio. An elliptic curve based key is generated and encoded the user signals before transmission. A BPSK technique is used for modulating the signals. The decoder decodes the desired user information and neglects the undesired user information. The performance comparison shows that this technique has better performance than the existing methods.

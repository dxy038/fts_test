The objective of this study was to illustrate the correlation between the physical properties and nanostructure of gelatins made of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) skins. The gelatin samples were first pretreated with sodium hydroxide, acetic acid, or water, and then extracted with hot water before the measurement. Physical properties including the yield of protein, viscosity and textural properties were determined on gelatins obtained with different pretreatment conditions. The acid pretreatment group showed the highest gel strength and protein yield, and a reasonable viscosity. The water pretreatment group showed the lowest values for all of the physical properties. Four samples including water, 0.1 M acid and 0.25 and 1.0 M alkaline-pretreated groupsâ€™ nanostructures were then studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images showed that the acid-pretreated gelatin was composed of sponge-like aggregates, while the others showed separated individual aggregates. Annular pores were only found in the alkaline pretreatment group. There was no significant correlation between the diameters of the spherical aggregates and the physical properties; however, the different AFM patterns may relate to the gelatin's physical properties.

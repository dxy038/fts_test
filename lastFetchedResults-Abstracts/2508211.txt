Charcoal is becoming an alternative source of energy to traditional fossil fuels
such as coal and coke. In theoretical studies, some types of biomass have been identied
as alternative sources of fuel to coke. The use of charcoal for sintering applications has
been evaluated in separate experiments in the world. These experiments indicate that
charcoal can replace a portion of the coke breeze (approximately 20-30%). The aim of this
thermodynamic study was to evaluate the possibilities of charcoal utilization in iron-ore
sintering process. Thermodynamic analysis has shown that the main factors determining
the composition and properties of sinter are chemical composition of input materials
(including fuels), thermodynamics of fuels burning, and oxidation potential of the gaseous
phase (CO2/CO ratio). The main objective of this work was to determine the eects of
coke substitution by charcoal in the laboratory sintering process with respect to combustion
eciency and sinter quality. The coke substitution and energy requirement provided by
charcoal was in range of 8 to 86%. The use of charcoal fuel resulted in a decrease in sintering
time and the replacement of coke with charcoal may lead to increase in sinter productivity.
Overall, the results from the laboratory scale tests suggest that replacement of coke breeze
energy with an equivalent amount of energy from charcoal in the iron-ore sintering process
is possible and has no negative in
uence on technological and ecological parameters

Self-Management systems are the main objective of Autonomic Computing (AC), and it is needed to increase the running systemÂ´s reliability, stability, and performance. This field needs to investigate some issues related to complex systems such as, self-awareness system, when and where an error state occurs, knowledge for system stabilization, analyze the problem, healing plan with different solutions for adaptation without the need for human intervention. This paper focuses on self-healing which is the most important component of Autonomic Computing. Self-healing is a technique that aims to detect, analyze, and repair existing faults within the system. All of these phases are accomplished in real-time system. In this approach, the system is capable of performing a reconfiguration action in order to recover from a permanent fault. Moreover, self-healing system should have the ability to modify its own behavior in response to changes within the environment. Recursive neural network has been proposed and used to solve the main challenges of self-healing, such as monitoring, interpretation, resolution, and adaptation.

The aim of this study is to investigate visualization concepts by eliciting users´ experience when using university campus maps. A pragmatic paradigm was applied to elicit subjective view of users´ perception and aggregate their personal constructs in a more general, objective context. The methodological approach taken in this study was a mixed-method approach, in the form of repertory grid technique to elicit a list of factors when using a campus map. Thirteen usefulness factors of visualization were derived using thematic analysis. A triangulation between these factors and Principal Component Analysis results was conducted to provide more holistic classifications. This study offers important insights by adopting an uncommon paradigm in generating valuable data concerning the perceived characteristics of visualization based on users´ perception.

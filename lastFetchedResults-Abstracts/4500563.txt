This paper presents CiClops, which is a virtual laboratory for performing experiments, using computational intelligence (CI) algorithms that scale over multiple workstations. Additionally, the paper introduces CIlib, which is an open source library of CI algorithms, currently containing mostly particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms. The main purpose of CiClops is to specify CI algorithms to solve optimization problems, to schedule execution of large numbers of simulations on a cluster of workstations, and to archive all empirical data for analysis. The objective of this paper is to launch both CiClops and CIlib, and to emphasize to the CI (most specifically the swarm intelligence) research community the advantages of using these tools.

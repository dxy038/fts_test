Background and Objective: In recent years there are growing concerns about the decrease of male reproductive health by different factors. So, present study was aimed to determine the effects of caffeine consumption during gestation oil development of histomorphometric structure of testis in Wistar rats offspring.

Subjects and Methods: Pregnant female Wistar rats in treatment groups received low and high doses (26 and 45 mg/kg) of caffeine during gestation via drinking water. At 1, 30, 60 and 90 days after birth, body weight of male offsprings were measured, serum testosterone levels analyzed and the testis were removed, their weights recorded and were fixed in Bourn's solution. Following tissue processing, 5-6Mm sections were prepared, then, at different stages of postnatal development the volumes of testis were estimated by Cavellieri method and structure of seminiferous tubules analyzed quantitatively.

Results: The results showed significant (p<0.05) decreases in mean weight of pups, weight and absolute volume of testis in high dose treatment group in comparison with control group. Also, loss of spermatogenesis as increase of spermatogenic cells distribution, decreases of spermatgenic cell layers and germinal epithelium height and vacuolated germinal epithelium were seen in treatment groups. Mean diameter of seminiferous tubules decreased significantly (p<0.05) at 30 and 90 days of age in high dose treatment group. Moreover, serum testosterone levels at 60 and 90 days of age decreased significantly (p<0.05) in high dose treatment group. Conclusion: Present study indicates that caffeine consumption during gestation can reduce testicular parameters during postnatal development in male offspring Wistar rats.

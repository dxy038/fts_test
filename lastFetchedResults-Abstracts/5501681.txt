This paper presents a real case study which includes measurement and computation of noise levels on telephone cables due to harmonics in nearby power lines. The objective of the study is to find the most efficient and economic mitigation measures to reduce the noise levels. A circuit model has been built and induced noise levels computed. Computation results are compared with the measurement data and they are in general agreement. Mitigation measures are proposed and will be examined in the second phase of the study

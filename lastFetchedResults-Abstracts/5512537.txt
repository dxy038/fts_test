We investigate a scenario characterized by a decentralized architecture where nodes can communicate the one each other, and whose position is modeled using an homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Signal-level-based power control (SLPC) is supposed to be applied. The objective of this investigation is the derivation of the main statistics (i.e. probability and cumulative density functions) of channel gain, transmitted power and received power in power controlled decentralized wireless networks.

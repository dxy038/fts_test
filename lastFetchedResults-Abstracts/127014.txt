Agricultural production inherently incorporate risk. En the processes of decision making risk is on of the most important factors on the adoption of new technology. The main objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of different factors on the production risk of irrigated and rainfed cumin in Khorasan province using generalised stochastic formulation and cross section data for 1378-79. The results indicated that the application of improved seeds decrease the production risk of irrigated and rainfed cumin, the fertilizer has an negative effect on production risk of irrigated cumin and the effect of tillage cost is negative on the production risk of rainfed cumin.

This paper presents appearance-based face identification algorithm by means of synthetic linear filters. The objective of our research is to construct facial descriptor in the form of linear filter, which should produce high and low outputs for intra- and inter-class recognition problem correspondingly. This filter can be synthesized from 2.5 D sparse mesh derived from a given set of images of a person. As ever the filter is created it is then used as facial descriptor, i.e. serves as personal ID for face identification.

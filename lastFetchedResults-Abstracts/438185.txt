Renal cell carcinoma occasionally invades the inferior vena cava and rarely extends to the right atrium. However, despite the frequency of venous extension, it is unusual to recognize patients with massive pulmonary tumor embolus clinically. We describe a 60-year-old man who underwent pulmonary tumor embolectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass combined with profound hypothermia and intermittent low-flow perfusion. The patient is currently alive and well without implantation metastasis 6 months after the operation.

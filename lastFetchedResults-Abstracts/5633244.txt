The main objective of this paper is to develop software model for reliability analysis using Availability Based Tariff (ABT) method for state grids to maintain the reliability and quality of the power system. For maintaining the grid discipline Availability Based Tariff (ABT) method has been followed. It is the frequency linked tariff system. ABT has three part tariff system such as fixed charge, variable charge and unscheduled interchange (UI) charges. The UI charges are depends upon the deviations in the grid frequency of the power system. The proposed software based ABT method is used to analyze the reliability of grid, and it is implemented by using visual basic and MS-excel.

The Engineering Department of the University of Tokushima Graduate School conduct this study to investigate traffic signals with a localizing function (that indicates the location of the traffic signal device) for visually-impaired persons, as the study project leader. We at the Traffic Management and Control Division, Traffic Department, Tokushima Prefectural Police, intend to actively support this study, including providing expertise for operation of traffic signals and a field for experimental operation, as a member of the project team. The objective of this study is to examine traffic signal devices with a localizing function to help visually-impaired persons cross streets safely, with a view towards the spread of these devices in Japan and international standardization of audible traffic signal devices. These investigational devices, imported from Germany by Tokushima University, feature various functions, such as auditory localization, acoustic signals (mechanical sounds), tactile pulse signals, and adjustment of sound levels according to the level of ambient noise. Since the existing Japanese audible traffic signal devices do not have such functions, this study is intended to investigate the convenience of the German devices and the problems they may cause pedestrians and residents of adjacent properties. The devices will be attached to audible traffic signal devices presently in use in Tokushima Prefecture, for a one-year experimental operation, launched in April 1999, to investigate their suitability to actual traffic conditions in Japan

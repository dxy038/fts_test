We have developed a cliff robot that is capable of descending a cliff and autonomously navigating to way-points on the cliff wall. This aggressive mobility system consists of an ensemble of three tethered robots, which cooperate under tight coordinated control and collective state estimation. The distributed task is described as a behavior network, which consists of a network of controllers spread across the robots and which interact through communication links to achieve a collective control objective. Fielded experimental results show that the cliff robot is capable of navigating to designated way-points on a cliff wall using the proposed control scheme.

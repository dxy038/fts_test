A design methodology for oversampled analog-to-digital converter decimation filters is presented. The methodology tackles the finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter design problem by formulating a quadratic programming problem that minimizes the integral of the aliased noise subject to the passband and stopband constraints. The approach offers a design whose response is optimized to meet arbitrary quantization noise power spectral density and anti-alias requirements. Because the projected Hessian matrix of the objective function is positive definite, the quadratic function has a unique minimum. The methodology is applied to design filters for different requirements and the performance is compared to conventional approaches

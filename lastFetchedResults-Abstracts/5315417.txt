In this paper, we propose to extend the topology of Chord to a bidirectional graph to provide a super-peer based lookup algorithm and a scalable broadcast search support. We consider routing algorithms for a bidirectional variant of Chord network and show how the resulting structure extends the search region and provides an efficient resource lookup service at a very little additional cost.

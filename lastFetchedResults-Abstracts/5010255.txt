This paper proposes a new type of Information/Communication system or Inquiry System to support the investigation by large groups (e.g. thousands of people) of complex topics about which many diverse and opposing views are held. The objective of this system is the production, integration, and synthesis of diverse views in a manner in which: (a) all participants can come to respect and understand the differences caused by diverse values and interests of the contributing population, and (b) there can be a movement towards consensus on at least some of the issues involved. Controversies related to Pervasive Information Technology are used as an example, and challenges to participation raised by the "digital divide" are discussed.

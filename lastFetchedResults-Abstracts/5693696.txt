We consider a traffic light controlled intersection. First we construct a model that describes the evolution of the queue lengths (as continuous variables) in each lane. Next, we discuss how optimal and suboptimal traffic light switching schemes (with possibly variable cycle lengths) for this system can be determined. We also show that for a special class of objective functions suboptimal traffic light switching schemes can be computed very efficiently

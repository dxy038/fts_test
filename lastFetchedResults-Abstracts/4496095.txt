In this paper, we have analyzed the performances of two designed algorithms which are an integral part of our research to formulate more energy efficient Code Dissemination Protocol for Multihop Wireless Sensor Network to provide the facility of reprogramming in order to support energy efficient over-the-air software updates in sensor, to set new functionalities or features, patch errors in the software after deployment &amp; to set some parameters as per new requirements. It enables the sensor nodes to self-reprogram so that they can adapt to changing tasks and evolving environments. In this research we have tried to addresses the energy optimization issue. The objective behind designing the Adaptive Duty Cycle Scheduling Algorithm is to minimize energy consumption &amp; reduce end-to-end delay for variable traffic load in the network and the objective to design the Attribute Based Efficient Data Delivery with Selective Approach is differentiated message delivery to achieve data reliability through the attribute based data flooding in multihop WSN &amp; Sleep schedule techniques to minimize energy consumption through node selection.

We consider the problem of joint admission control and resource allocation in a secondary code-division network coexisting with a narrow-band primary system. Our objective is to find the maximum number of admitted secondary links and then find the optimal transmitting powers and code sequences of those secondary links such that the total energy consumption of the secondary network is minimized subject to the conditions that primary interference temperature constraints, secondary Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints and secondary peak power constraints are all satisfied. This is an NP-hard optimization problem which motivates the development of efficient suboptimal algorithms. We propose a novel iterative algorithm to solve this problem in a computationally efficient manner. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides excellent solutions that result in large admitted percentage of secondary links and high energy efficiency.

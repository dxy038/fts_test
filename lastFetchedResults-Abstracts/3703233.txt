An approach for optimum effectiveness improvement of subsystem equipment by the option tradeoff analysis process is discussed. The objective is to generate more effectiveness ideas in furthering tradeoff procedures for subsystem design improvement. Two hypothetical spacecraft subsystems are used to illustrate the results. A sequence of block diagrams, tabulations, and graphs is presented to reflect these results. Although only two subsystems are shown, it is apparent that this method could be applied to others. This study provides insight into a more effective approach in conducting a trade study.

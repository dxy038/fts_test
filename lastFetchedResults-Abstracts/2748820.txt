We present simulation of nonparaxial waves in multiple reflecting structures, using a recently proposed bidirectional method based on a finite difference split-step nonparaxial scheme. Simulation of finite beams in volume Bragg gratings, through high reflection coatings and tilted fiber Bragg gratings are presented. Comparisons are made with experimental, analytical, and other numerical methods to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. The method is noniterative and the propagation matrices are evaluated analytically making it computationally very efficient. The method has very high accuracy for modeling reflection of nonparaxial beams and can simulate large longitudinal index discontinuities efficiently without using special modifications.

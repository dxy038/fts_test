A new GPR(ground penetrating radar) imaging algorithm based on CS(compressive sensing) technique is presented in this paper. It aims at imaging of targets located in unknown subsurface environment. Firstly, a compound objective vector is constructed, including both unknown targets vector and unknown dielectric parameter of background environment. Secondly, the scattering and imaging model is formed based on GPR electromagnetic scattering principle and CS framework. Thirdly, the compound objective vector is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Experimental results of GPR simulation data show the effectiveness of this algorithm.

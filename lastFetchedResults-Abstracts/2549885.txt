Many supply chain problems involve optimization of various conflicting objectives. This paper formulates a green supply chain network throughout a two-stage mixed integer linear problem with uncertain demand and stochastic environmental respects level. The first objective function of the proposed model considers minimization of supply chain costs while the second objective function minimizes CO2 emission level. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) approach is used to deal with the demand uncertainty in supply chain network in addition to the scenario based approach that is employed to deal with the stochastic level of CO2 emission. The implementation of the proposed model has been demonstrated using some randomly selected numbers and the results are analyzed accordingly.

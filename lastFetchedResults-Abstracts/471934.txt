This study examined the effects of hostility on blood pressure (BP) during the early morning hours before awakening and several hours afterward. Our objective was to determine whether the pattern of BP change and the slope of the morning BP surge were related to hostility. The subjects were 32 patients with a history of Stage 1 hypertension. The morning surge in BP was derived from ambulatory BP monitoring of sleeping and waking hours, which were averaged per subject and centered around the wake-up hour. The periods used were 3 h before and 3 h after awakening. Only systolic blood pressure (SBP) is being reported on in this paper as this is the primary measure found relevant to the morning surge phenomenon. Hostility was assessed by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (total score). The results revealed significant differences between low and high hostility subjects for overall levels of sleep SBP: 120 ± 11.4 mm Hg for low hostility and 131.3 ± 14.9 mm Hg for high hostility subjects (P = .02). Low hostility subjects showed a steep rise in SBP from sleeping to waking while high hostility subjects had almost reached their post-sleep level of SBP in the hours immediately before waking up (P = .03). These data indicate that individual differences in hostility are related to different patterns of BP during sleep and the early morning hours, a period of the day that has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular incidents. The data also suggest the need for further study of the significance of hostility and other personality traits and the relationship of these traits to the mechanisms of the morning surge and the risk of cardiovascular events.

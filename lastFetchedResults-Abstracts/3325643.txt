The originality of this paper consists in proposing a model that can be used to simulate the manner in which companies interoperate in cooperative supply chain networks. The objective is to develop a model that enables the analysis of the impact of business interoperability on the performance of cooperative supply chain networks. The analysis of the impact is based on the agent-based simulation method. To test the proposed theoretical model, an application scenario regarding a reverse supply chain network is presented.

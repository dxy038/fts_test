Objective This study aimed to ascertain whether disasters
at sea had an enduring traumatic effect on psychological
functioning, accident proneness, and on their interest to
continue working at sea.
Method Crew members of selected sea-disasters were
contacted. The chosen disasters were of differing severity
and in some cases fatalities had occurred. The disasters had
taken place on average 8 years previously. Those who
agreed to participate were interviewed in a semi-structured
interview. They also answered the CIDI; DIS; GHQ-30;
IES, and PTSS-10. One hundred-and-twelve seamen who
had been in disasters were compared with a comparison
group consisting of 59 peers who had not been in a disaster.
Results Survivors of fatal disasters experienced more
long-lasting negative effects than did others where lives
were not lost. They had more frequently unpleasant intrusive
thoughts on the IES (p\0.01) compared with their
peers. On the DIS, they also more frequently experienced
heightened arousal (p\0.001), sleep problems (p\0.01),
and nightmares (p\0.01). The duration of PTSD symptoms
from the time of the disaster was on average
18 months. Over 33% of the disaster group had experienced
some PTSD symptoms within the past 12 months.
Disaster survivors had not quit seamanship as frequently as
non-disaster seamen.
Conclusion The most severe and long-lasting symptoms
were found among those who had been in disasters where
one or more crew members had perished. Loss of life in
disasters therefore seems significant in the process of creating
or extending the endurance of symptoms of psychological
vulnerability

Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is widely used gasoline oxygenate which has been recognized as a hazardous material with high risk of carcinogenesis by EPA ad RCRA. MTBE can contaminate groundwater and soil through leaking from oil products tanks in fuel farms or gas stations. Porous soils can be used to adsorb contaminants such as MTBE. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of porous soils for MTBE removal from drinking water, as well as, to determine equilibrium and kinetic parameters which describe the MTBE adsorption from water on porous soil. Besides, effects of pore structure of adsorbent on the adsorption of MTBE are considered. In this research, MTBE adsorption tests have been done utilizing GC. Then, partitioning coefficient (K<sub>d</sub>) and the empirical constant (n) have been obtained trough linear and Freundlich adsorption isotherm. Results show that porous soils have high potential of adsorption of MTBE solved in drinking water so that K<sub>d</sub> and n are 0.0116 mg/g and 1.19 (mg/g).(mg/l)<sup>(-1/n)</sup>, respectively.

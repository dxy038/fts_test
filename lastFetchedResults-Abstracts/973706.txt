Water and soil pollution by heavy metals is a serious threat to environment and human health. Therefore finding an effective method for removing heavy metals from water is very important. Removal of heavy metals from water by adsorption method has increasingly received much attention in recent years because it is simple relatively low-cost and effective method. The main objective of this research is to investigate the possibility of removing Cu(II) from aqueous solution using modified tea waste with magnetite nanoparticles. Consequently, modified tea waste with magnetite nanoparticles were prepared and characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of various parameters, such as contact time, pH, Cu concentration and adsorbent dosage were studied. The adsorption isotherm data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich equation. The results indicated that the sorption data can be represented by both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, and the Langmuir adsorption capacity, was found to be 22.4 mgg?1. The results indicated that Cu(II) adsorption increased with increasing solution pH. Maximum removal of Cu(II) was obtained at pH=5.5. The results also showed the adsorption were decreased by increasing of initial Cu(II) concentration. An increase in adsorbent dosage increased the removal of Cu(II). The results also revealed that modified tea waste with magnetite nanoparticles can be an attractive option for metal removal from contaminated water.

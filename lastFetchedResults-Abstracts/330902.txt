Objective
The purpose of the present study was to analyze the influence of debonding force location in shear bond strength testing of orthodontic brackets in vitro.
Methods

Ninety extracted permanent bovine mandibular incisors were randomly divided into 3 groups of 30 specimens each. Teeth were bonded with stainless steel orthodontic brackets. Enamel surfaces were etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 30 s and bonded with a composite adhesive. Debonding force measurements were performed with a universal testing machine. Location of the debonding force was: bracket base (group A), ligature groove (group B), occlusal bracket wings (group C).
Results

Mean shear bond strength measurements were as follows: 22.70(4.23) MPa (group A), 11.52(2.74) MPa (group B), 9.44(2.96) MPa (group C). Analysis of variance indicated that there were significant differences in shear bond strength. Post-hoc Tukey tests showed that bond strength measurements of group A were significantly different from those of groups B and C. The adhesive remnant index also showed significant differences and ranged from a mean of 1.53 in group A to a mean of 2.10 in group C.
Significance

Debonding force location had a significant influence on shear bond strength measurements and bond failure pattern, indicating that this parameter needs to be taken into consideration for interstudy comparison of in vitro results.

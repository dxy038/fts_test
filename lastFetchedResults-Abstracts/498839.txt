Background and Objective: Discipline is the esprit, basis and foundation of obedience, optimal work, behaviorist capability and visible sign of respect observed based on sustainable agreements between organization and personnel. The agreements may have either generated from requests and desires of the contract parties or in the light of regulations, habits and customs after discussion about them or even without any discussion which can be either written or oral. Anyway, the agreements require some sort of discipline. Discipline in armed forces of every country, including police, is always considered to be one of the concerns of high level commanders and managers. Materials and Methods: The present research reviews and measures the impact of organizational culture on institutionalization of discipline among IRI Police University (IRIPU) cadets. The data was gathered through a questionnaire from 352 senior boy and girl police cadets at associate diploma or bachelor degree levels in IRIPU, and 81 Field Training Officers (FTOs) ranging from detachment to brigade level in 2008. In addition, 19 experts working for IRI police training centers and 24 training experts working for Imam Ali University were evaluated through interview. The developed questionnaires, while measuring the impact of the above-mentioned factors, dealt with the status of discipline in IRIPU. The achieved data is analyzed through one-tailed and two-tailed t Test and variance.

Findings: The achieved results indicate that organizational culture is so effective from cadets and commanders' viewpoints in institutionalizing discipline among students. Supreme leader's view and views of scholars such as Robins, Shine, Weiner, Stanley Davis, Schulz, Queen and McCrery are used to crosscheck the research findings. Finally, some recommendations are introduced to bring them to practice.

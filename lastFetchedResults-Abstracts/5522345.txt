The Crew Escape Technologies (CREST) program is an effort to expand the envelope of safe escape from aircraft in an open ejection seat system. The program provides for the development of a prototype ejection seat system to be tested on the high-speed sled facility at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, in late 1989. These tests for the CREST program were performed on the dynamic environment simulator, a three-axis man-rated centrifuge. The test objective was to evaluate three CREST candidate harnesses against the standard PCU-15/P harness. Initial test results are presented

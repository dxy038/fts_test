The objective of this study was to determine the phenotypic characteristics
of KPC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii
isolates. A case report study was performed at a tertiary burn care centre in
Tehran, Iran. Nine isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter
baumannii from a hospitalized case were isolated. The identity of isolates was
confirmed and their antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. Eight out
of nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were
resistant to Imipenem. Three out of 8 imipenem resistant isolates were also
positive for KPC test. Findings of this study highlight the importance of
implementation of an effective infection control strategy in order to prevent
and reduce the emergence and spread of gram negative Carbapenemaseproducing
organisms in Iran.

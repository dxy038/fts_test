The viability of distributed control restoration using digital cross-connect systems (DCS) depends on its capability for restoring services within specified time requirements, and its economics for providing restoration compared to other alternatives. The authors report a Bellcore study for the impact of the DCS architecture on distributed restoration. This study concludes that currently proposed distributed control DCS self-healing schemes may not meet the 2 second restoration objective for large metropolitan local exchange carrierÂ´s networks, regardless of the distributed algorithm used, if the present DCS system architecture which uses serial message processing and serial path cross-connection remains unchanged. They also discuss several DCS architecture enhancement options, including a parallel processing/cross-connect DCS architecture, which may improve the service restoration time

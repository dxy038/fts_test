The wide variety and the socio-economic and dietary importance of traditional fermented milk products of Ethiopia are discussed in this paper. Information on the microbiology of these products is sparse and has relevance to those organisms associated with spoilage and to those considered desirable for fermentation. There is a clear need to improve the production of African foods and beverages [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 18 (1993) 85]. The objective of this review was to document traditional technology used and information on the microbiology of the products, and to identify various constraints to the development and commercialisation of fermented milk products. Thereby the major problems and potential areas for improvement are pointed out. Ergo, the most important traditional product resembles yoghurt and, as the other traditional products, is prepared by “spontaneous” fermentation, commonly initiated by either “back slopping” or by repeated use of the same utensil. Other products include traditional fermented curd or ititu, traditional butter or kibe, neter kibe or traditional ghee, ayib resembling cottage cheese, arrera or defatted buttermilk and augat or traditional whey.

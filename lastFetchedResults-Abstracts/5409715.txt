We present a call routing application for complex problem solving tasks. Up to date work on call routing has been mainly dealing with call-type classification. In this paper we take call routing further: Initial call classification is done in parallel with a robust statistical Spoken Language Understanding module. This is followed by a dialogue to elicit further task-relevant details from the user before passing on the call. The dialogue capability also allows us to obtain clarifications of the initial classifier guess. Based on an evaluation, we show that conducting a dialogue significantly improves upon call routing based on call classification alone. We present both subjective and objective evaluation results of the system according to standard metrics on real users.

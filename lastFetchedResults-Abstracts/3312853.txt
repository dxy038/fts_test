Web services describe the standardized way of integrating the web based applications using XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI. A service oriented application is developed by composing suitable services available in the registry. Monitoring of the services is enabled using Apache Jmeter, in which the load and the invocation time for each service is specified which in turn helps to simulate the response time of the services. If the services are probably expected to violate the contract, then services with the same functionality are identified to reconfigure the application without affecting the base code. This paper proposes to use the AO4BPEL technique to change the BPEL workflow at runtime and bypass the services. Towards this objective, the proposed aspect based reconfiguration framework has been tested on a prototype SOA based application in the domain of e-Shopping.

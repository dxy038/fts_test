This paper presents an approach to search robust optimal solutions with the concept of degree of robustness in multi-objective optimization problems. The definition of the degree of robustness is used in the calculation of the mean effective objective function(f<sup>eff</sup>(X)) and in the evolutionary process, degree of robustness is considered as a factor to select robust solutions which can meet the demand for better robustness. Some simulation results are shown to prove that this approach can control the distribution of objective value and help system improve robustness by finding solutions with better robustness. Also, the decision maker(DM) can modulate some robust parameters according to the actual robust demands which makes this approach have more practical significance.

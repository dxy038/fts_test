By introducing the traditional method of making train plan, the paper points out its deficiencies. While maximizing passengerpsilas travel convenience coefficient and minimizing the operatorpsilas net cost and the transferring passengerpsilas waiting time are the three planning objectives of the model, we develop a multiobjective decision model of train plan for passenger-dedicated line and solve it by genetic algorithm. At last, an empirical study on train plan for Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan passenger-dedicated line is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The case study shows that a relatively optimal departure time of the trains can be generated under the constraint of the objective functions.

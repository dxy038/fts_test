Spherical aberration arising from deviations of the thickness of an optical disc substrate from a nominal value can be compensated to a great extent by illuminating the scanning objective lens with a slightly convergent or divergent beam. The optimum conjugate change and the amount and type of residual aberration are calculated analytically for an objective lens that satisfies Abbe's sine condition. The aberration sensitivity is decreased by a factor of 25 for numerical aperture values of approximately 0.85, and the residual aberrations consist mainly of the first higher-order Zernike spherical aberration term A60. The Wasserman-WolfVaskas method is used to design biaspheric objective lenses that satisfy a ray condition that interpolates between the Abbe and the Herschel conditions. Requirements for coma by field use allow for only small deviations from the Abbe condition, making the analytical theory a good approximation for any objective lens used in practice.

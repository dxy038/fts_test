Background and Objective: Utilization of ionizing radiation in some surgery operations (especially orthopedic operations) is inevitable. One of the main occupational hazards of physicians and other personnel could be radiation exposure risks. This study aimed to evaluate the exposure doses received by operating room personnel in such surgery operations.
Materials and Methods: 30 personnel of operation room in university affiliated hospitals of Hamadan city (excluding physicians and nurses) were studied as they received radiation doses. 3 TLD (thermoluminescent dosimeters) chips were fixed on the apron of each staff member. To estimate the high risk examinations, staff members also completed a questionnaire about the type and number of the radiological examinations that they had participated.
Results: Minimum and maximum level of doses received by the participants were between 0.24 and 0.56 mSv in a four month period. Therefore, amount of annual doses received by the personnel would be between 0.73 and 1.7 mSv, respectively (without reduction of background radiation). As the accuracy of TL dosimeters is normally about 0.1 mSv; therefore, it can be claimed that the received doses by the personnel was very low and comparable with background radiation.
Conclusion: The results indicated that the radiation doses received by operating room personnel were very low. They were less than maximum predicted doses reported by the International Commission of Radiation Protection. However, the use of dose recording systems for awareness about absorbed doses beyond permitted limits is necessary.

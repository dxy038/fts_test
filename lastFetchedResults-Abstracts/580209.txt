Objective: This study investigated the effects of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and conditioned medium injection on cell infiltration in the brains of an experimental C57BL/6 mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Methods: EAE was induced with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (35-55 peptides) in 20 mice. MSCs were obtained from the adipose tissue of C57BL/6 mice and cultured with Eagleâ€™s minimum essential medium/alpha medium (DMEM) after removal of non-adherent cells. After 2 to 3 passages, 15 days after induction of EAE, 4 groups (n=5) of C57BL/6 mice were treated as follows: i) MSCs were injected intraperitoneally, ii) MSCs were injected intravenously, iii) conditioned medium was administrated intraperitoneally, and iv) the control group received no treatment. After day 60, the mice brains were removed and the effect of adipose-tissue MSCs and administration of conditioned medium was investigated.
Results: Leukocyte infiltration and clinical scores were significantly reduced in animals that received MSC and conditioned medium compared to untreated animals. Body weight increased significantly in the treated groups compared to the control group. Percentage of survival also increased in the animals that received MSCs and conditioned medium as compared to the control group.
Conclusion: MSCs had immunomodulatory and neurogenerative functions which reduced leukocyte infiltration and improved clinical scores in the EAE animals that received MSC and conditioned medium compared to untreated animals with EAE.

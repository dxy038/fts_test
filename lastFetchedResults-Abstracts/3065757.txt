In this paper, we provide an objective sensor performance evaluation approach to automatically carry out the sensor evaluation task in a multi-sensor system for video surveillance. That is, given a set of sensors monitoring the same area, the proposed technique estimates the accuracy of each sensor in detecting a given target. This measure depends on the conditions under which the sensor is operating and is computed per sensor and per target at every time instant. In this way, data coming from the different sensors may be weighted accordingly and fused. Promising experimental results are presented on real video sequences.

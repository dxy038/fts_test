The objective of this work was to study various
aspects of liquid and solid state diffusion bonding of
cylindrical samples of WC (with 6% Co) and commercially
pure nickel (99.5%) produced by direct bonding and
brazing using a 25 lm thick 70Cu 30Zn (wt%) alloy as
joining element. Joining experiments were carried out on
WC/Ni and WC/Cu Zn/Ni combinations at temperature of
980  C using 1, 15, 25 and 35 min holding times in argon
(Ar). The results show that it is possible to create a successful
joint at temperature and times used. Joining
occurred by the formation of a diffusion zone. The joining
interface is feasible because it presents a homogeneous
interface with no several interfacial cracking and porosity.
In both combinations, it can be observed a diffusion of
cobalt decreasing in the direction of the metal, as well as,
the diffusion of nickel decreasing in the direction of the
ceramic.

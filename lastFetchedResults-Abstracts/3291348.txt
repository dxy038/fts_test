In the current practice of medicine, histopathological examinations are some of the most important tools for clinical diagnoses of a large group of diseases. To help pathologists and to reduce the subjectivity level, it has been proposed that computer-aided procedures be used to provide objective results. The first step of these procedures is the segmentation of the tissue image. In our research, we try to detect nuclei, glands and surface epithelium in Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stained colon tissue samples. This paper focuses on the identification of epithelial cell nuclei.

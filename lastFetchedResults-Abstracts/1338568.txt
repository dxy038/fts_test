Frozen semen provides several advantages to the breeder relative to fresh or cooled semen. However, some stallions are undesirable candidates for semen freezing due to poor post-thaw motility or longevity caused by membrane damage, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress during cryopreservation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of post-thaw addition of pentoxifylline, caffeine, or taurine on sperm motility and longevity in equine frozen semen. Pentoxifylline, caffeine, or taurine was incorporated immediately into thawing frozen semen from nine warmblood stallions. Spermatozoa motility and longevity parameters were recorded and analyzed for each additive and for an untreated control. Of the three additives, only pentoxifylline improved total and progressive semen motility relative to that of untreated control. Pentoxifylline also increased semen curvilinear velocity, average path velocity, and straight line velocity relative to those of caffeine, taurine, or control. Semen treated with pentoxifylline also showed greater longevity relative to that of caffeine- or taurine-treated or untreated semen. Taurine improved linearity in comparison to that of semen treated with pentoxifylline, caffeine, or control but did not improve other parameters. Pentoxifylline may be useful in enhancing the quality of equine frozen semen and therefore improving its fertility. Additional studies are warranted that examine the effect of these additives on the conception rate. Pentoxifylline can be used to increase motility and longevity of equine frozen semen and theoretically increase probability of conception and overall breeding success rates.

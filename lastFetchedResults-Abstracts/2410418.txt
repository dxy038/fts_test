Objective: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the second leading causes of death in Iran. One of the most important steps in the prevention of traffic-related trauma and its consequences is gaining insight into the epidemiology of injuries. We conducted this study to describe the characteristics of RTIs and to find strategies for its prevention.
Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study on consecutive road traffic trauma patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) of the second largest trauma center in the northeast of Iran, during July to September 2013. Demographic characteristics, type of vehicle, and injured area of the body were documented for each patient.
Results: Of 666 included patients, 562 (84.4%) were male and 104 (15.6%) were female, with a mean age of 28.89 Â± 16.62 years. Most of the patients were uneducated. The highest frequency of RTIs was related to motorcyclists with an attributed risk of RTIs for motorcycles at 75.8%. The most common traumatized area was head, face, and lower extremities.
Conclusion: The largest number of traumatized patients was among motorcyclists and uneducated population underscores the importance of public training about motorcycle usage and security and increase social awareness about reasons behind traffic law.

Multi-project environment is quite common in modern day, and the decentralized multi-project scheduling problem has been a hot research direction since last decade. Compared with centralized multi-project problem, decentralized multi-project problem has new characteristics in these fields such as decision maker, decision mode, and decision objective. Existing research works most focus on one particular issue of the problem, and has not formed a generally accepted definition and classification for the problem. In this paper, we propose the definition of decentralized multi-project scheduling problem and analyze the characteristics, and then propose the research framework based on the analysis. We map and locate some existing works in this research framework. At last give a short conclusion.

Phased-mission system is a kind of broad exist complex system. It has important reference value to research the reliability optimization of this kind of system. For reliability optimization problem of standby phased-mission systems, a method adopts modular fault tree and modular BDD to describe structure of standby system is proposed. The reliability compute method of standby sub-system in phased-mission systems is given, and put forward reliability compute model of the whole standby phased-mission systems. Based on this, taken mini-cost as objective to build reliability optimization model of standby phased-mission system, and use particle swarm optimization to solve the model. The case validates the model´s rationality and the arithmetic´s validity.

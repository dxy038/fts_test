A new formation control methodology modelled by a virtual tendon-driven system using the tensegrity structures is presented. The objective of the work is to regulate the formation of unmanned vehicles within the communications bandwidth and perform point-to-point manoeuvring tasks. The reaction control forces that are experienced by vehicles in the formation are determined by the admissible tendon forces in tensegrity. A control law is designed to stabilize the interspacing between the vehicles in the presence of disturbances by making the combined use of string and spring characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of maintaining the formation and avoiding inter-vehicle collisions. Formation shape changing is also performed by varying the relative parameters between the vehicles.

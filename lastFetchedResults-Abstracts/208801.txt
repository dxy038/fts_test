Background: The presence of pathogenic microorganisms in aviculture threatens the health of
fowl and humans. Thyme (Zataria multiflora Boiss), sweet marjoram (Origanum majorana),
savory (Satureja hortensis) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globules) are Iranian herbal medicines
that are used in folk medicines.
Objective: The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of these oils
separately and in combination against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Aspergillus
niger and Aspergillus flavus in vitro condition.
Methods: The antimicrobial activity of essential oils against different isolates of
microorganisms was evaluated by disc diffusion and macro broth dilution assays.
Results: The results showed that the antimicrobial activity of thyme, sweet marjoram and
savory oils against different bacteria and fungi were more than the eucalyptus oil. When
ethanol was used as a solvent in comparison with dimethyl sulfoxide, the antimicrobial activity
of oils was increased. The type of solvent creates meaningful discrepancy on effectiveness of oils
(p<0.001). In disc diffusion method, the fungi were sensitive than bacteria and A. niger was
more sensitive than A. flavus. The sensitivity of bacteria was dependent to the type of bacteria
and essential oil and the oils showed inhibitory effect against fungi and the fungicidal effect of
oils were weaker than bactericidal effect.
Conclusion: The antimicrobial activities of effective oils were related to thymol and carvacrol
components in respect. Due to limitations in usage of chemical compounds in poultry and food
industries, the essential oils look to be appropriate alternatives for some disinfectants to control
the human and animal diseases in the future.

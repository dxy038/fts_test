The intuitionistic fuzzy set has been applied to game theory very
rarely since it was introduced by Atanassov in 1983. The aim of this paper is
to develop an effective methodology for solving matrix games with payoffs of
Atanassov’s triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs). In this methodology,
the concepts and ranking order relations of Atanassov’s TIFNs are defined.
A pair of bi-objective linear programming models for matrix games with
payoffs of Atanassov’s TIFNs is derived from two auxiliary Atanassov’s intuitionistic
fuzzy programming models based on the ranking order relations of
Atanassov’s TIFNs defined in this paper. An effective methodology based on
the weighted average method is developed to determine optimal strategies for
two players. The proposed method in this paper is illustrated with a numerical
example of the market share competition problem.

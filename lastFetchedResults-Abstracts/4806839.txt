The objective of the study is to explore the impact of IOS appropriation on supply chain collaboration and collaborative advantage. Reliable and valid instruments of these constructs were developed through rigorous empirical analysis including structured interviews, Q-sort, and a large-scale study. Data were collected through a Web survey of U.S. manufacturing firms in various industries. The path analytical results indicate that IOS appropriation strongly supports supply chain collaboration, which in turn affects collaborative advantage.

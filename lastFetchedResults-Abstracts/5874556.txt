The paper aimed at studying on the development strategy and analysis model in developing low-slope hilly land in Metropolitan suburbs. Based on the establishment of macro strategy model and micro-technical model, this research made use of qualitative analysis (regional study) and quantitative analysis (GIS and AHP) to integrate the two models. The macro strategy model included four aspects: regional environmental characteristics, specialized functional requirements in metropolitan area, space development structure type and regional ecological patterns. The micro-technical model included three aspects: suitability of land use planning, feasibility of building design and engineering Economy. With the analysis of the two models, the final development program can be determined. The paper concludes that the Multi-objective decision method developed in this paper can effectively improve the comprehensiveness, exactness and scientificalness in the low slope hilly land development program in Metropolitan Suburbs.

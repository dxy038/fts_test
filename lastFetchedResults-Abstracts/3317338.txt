In this paper, a sliding mode implementation of a Proportional Integral Derivative PID controller is proposed. The objective of the controller designed is to control a DC-DC buck converter to track a desired set point voltage. The complexity of this controller arises from the fact that the only information available to the controller is the measured error. The buck converter inductance and capacitance are also unknown but their product is available to the designer.

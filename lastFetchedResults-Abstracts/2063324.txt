The linear differential scattering coefficients at 60 keV have been measured for GaAs, p-Si and n-Si semiconductors at seven angles ranging from 60° to 120° at intervals of 10°. The results have been compared with relativistic and non-relativistic theoretical values. The objective of this work is to seek evidence whether there is a relationship between the LDSC and the scattering angle. The LDSCs have been measured with energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) for wafers as GaAs, n- and p-type Si. This is the first time the LDSCs have been measured at &lt;100 keV energies, so there is no comparable findings reported in the literature.

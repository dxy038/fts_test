This paper discusses the possibility of- and need for-tracking workforce on construction jobsites using video cameras. An evaluation of algorithms and their associated results is presented. The principal objective of this paper is to test and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking workers from statically placed and dynamically moving cameras. This paper also reviews existing techniques to monitor workforce and describes areas where this work might be useful in engineering applications. The main difficulties associated with tracking on a construction site is the significant amount of visual clutter, the changing photometric visual content throughout the course of a day, and the presence of occluding and moving obstacles. The tracking of workers within the field of view of the camera will involve four tracking techniques, density mean-shift, Bayesian segmentation, active contours, and graph-cuts. Typical construction site video will be processed using the proposed algorithms and analyzed to determine the most appropriate tracking method for the video presented.

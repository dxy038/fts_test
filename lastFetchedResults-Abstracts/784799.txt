Objective: To determine the impact of dental prosthetic condition on food consumption, risk of
malnutrition and follow-up 4-year mortality risk in elderly Taiwanese. Design and setting: Analyzing the data
sets of the 1999 and 2003 “Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan”, a longitudinal cohort
study. Participants: A national probability sample of 2766 men and women 65 years of age or older.
Measurements: Self-reported intake frequencies of major food categories, masticatory ability, food consumption,
and the risk of malnutrition assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment (short-form) stratified by dental
prosthetic condition. Cox regression was used to compare follow-up mortality risk. Results: Non-denture wearers
and removable-denture wearers had poorer masticatory ability and greater nutritional risk and consumed fruits
and vegetable less often compared to fixed-denture wearers. Removable-denture wearers also had lower selfperceived
nutritional status and BMI compared to fixed-denture wearers. Survival analysis showed that nondenture
wearers and removable-denture wearers had lower follow-up 4-year survival. Cox regression analysis
showed that removable-denture wearers had increased follow-up 4-year mortality risk compared to fixed-denture
wearers adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related factors. Conclusions: Based on data of a
national sample of a longitudinal cohort study, dental prosthetic condition is a significant factor of nutritional
health in the elderly. It can affect food pattern and the risk of malnutrition and mortality of elderly persons.
Dental care should be an important part of geriatric health promotion program and fixed-denture is a preferred
choice over removable-denture

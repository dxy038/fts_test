Real-time video streaming over the Internet requires robust delivery mechanisms with low overhead. Traditional error control schemes are not attractive because they either add redundant information that may worsen network traffic, or rely solely on the inadequate capability of the decoder to do error concealment. As sophisticated concealment techniques cannot be employed in a real-time software playback scheme, we propose a simple yet efficient transformation-based error concealment algorithm. The algorithm applies a linear transformation to the original video signals, with the objective of minimizing the mean squared error if missing information were restored by simple averaging at the destination. We also describe two strategies to cope with error propagations in temporal differentially coded frames. Experimental results show that our proposed transformation-based reconstruction algorithm performs well in real Internet tests

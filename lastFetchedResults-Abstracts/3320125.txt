Demand Side Management (DSM) aims to benefit the consumer economically without taking into consideration the losses incurred during inefficient working of generating unit while supplying demand. This paper primarily focuses on generation and distribution parts of the grid. The multiple objectives that are opted for load scheduling are reduction in the electricity cost for the user and maximization of load factor benefitting the user as well as utility. Simulation results show that multi-objective approach proves advantageous in efficient and reliable operation of generating unit while supplying economically affordable electricity to the consumers. Extensive comparison between single objective and multi-objective approach is carried out, which is further justified with two-step and five-step tariff model.

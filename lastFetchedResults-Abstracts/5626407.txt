This paper is based on a project combining solar and geothermal energies used for heating an individual home located in a mountainous region of southern France (Saint-Pierre Dels Forcats town). A solar field composed of 10 thermal solar collectors, with a total area of 21.25 m<sup>2</sup> increases the borehole (one hundred meters of depth) temperature. A heat pump extracts the heat energy to restore it to the home with a heating floor of 100 m<sup>2</sup>. The project objective is to develop a control on the global system to realize financial and energy savings (thermal and electric). This paper presents (i) the study of the process (data acquisition and energy analysis) and (ii) the first results of the modeling and the control strategy that will be developed.

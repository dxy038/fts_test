The objective of this paper is to present an accurate and reliable mathematical model which has been developed to determine the strength of magnetic field density in the vicinity of high voltage powerlines. The model has been developed based on measuring the strength of magnetic field around 220 kV powerlines. The accuracy of the model has also been tested in this study

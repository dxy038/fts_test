In this paper, we have developed an advanced averaged model, based on few easily obtainable parameters, to estimate the dissipated power in the different circuit devices of power electronic systems. The main advantages of the proposed averaged model are the taking into account of the nonlinear effects of power devices and stray inductance (DC loop inductance) effect on switching characteristic. Hence a more correct expression of switching losses in the power semiconductors will be proposed. The proposed model (operating in CCM and DCM conduction mode) can be applied to bidirectional converters and allows the electrothermal simulations of the power electronic system. A simple technique to evaluate the different static and dynamic parameters of the devices, from manufacturers data sheets or experimentally, is presented

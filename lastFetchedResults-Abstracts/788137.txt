The aim of this paper is to present Cabri-graph, a system intended for students and researchers using graph theoric concepts. The objective of Cabri-graph is to alow any user to perform on his computer the same manipulations or computations on a graph that he can do on a sheet of paper, as easily as possible. Using computer instead of sheet of paper increases correctness of the computations, facilitates recording the work, and allows manipulation of graphs with higher size and order.

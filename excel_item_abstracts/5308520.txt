This paper presents a newly developed nonlinear digital current mode control (NDCMC) scheme for single-phase full-bridge power converter system. The proposed NDCMC scheme uses the samples of a set of instantaneous feedback signals to implement a pulse-by-pulse current-programmed control strategy in software to achieve the fastest control-to-output response with minimum current ripple. A DSP-based PWM power converter control system is constructed to implement the proposed control scheme. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control method can achieve good dynamic response

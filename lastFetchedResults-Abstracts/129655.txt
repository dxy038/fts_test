The objective of the present paper is to examine the possibility of trade and trade potentials of exportable agricultural goods to four regional economic formations including the {Persian} Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Group 8 of Islamic Countries (D-8), Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) and the European Union (EU) during the period of 1993-97. The general results of this research indicate that the members of the European Union have potentially higher consumption demands in all selected agricultural products. In addition, with regard to the indicators of "potentially high import capacity", "unused percentages of capacities", and "appropriate demand 'growth during the study period", some member countries of the concerned regional economic organisations are proper target markets for 10 selected exportable agricultural products of Iran.
Policy recommendations advocate that firstly, preferential tariffs be imposed on Iran target markets of selective agricultural goods. Secondly, further to quantity improvements, the quality of agricultural products, in particular health standards and regulatory measures of EU should be compiled. Market making efforts such as participating in specialised trade fairs, advertising and acquiescence to the international standards should be strictly applied.

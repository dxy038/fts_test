Objective: To investigate the association of serum lipoproein(a) elevation with left ventricular hypertrophy(LVH) and hypertention(HTN) in patients with end-stage renal failure under regular hemodialysis .Material and Methods: Sixty-one patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), undergoing maintenance hemodialysis treatment were studied. Serum lipoprotein (a) measured by enzyme immuno assay (ELISA) test. For all patients echocardiography for left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction were performed. Hypertensive patients stratified into no hypertention, stage one to three HTN and LVH categorized to normal, mild, moderate and severe hypertrophy.Results: Total patients were 61(F=23 M=38), consisting of 50 non diabetic hemodialysis patients (F=20 M=30) and 11 diabetic hemodialysis patients (F=3 M=8). Mean±SD of LP(a) of total patients were 58.5±19mg/dl.Mean±SD of LP(a) of diabetic group and nondiabetic group were 62±12.3 mg/dl and 57.7±20 mg/dl respectively.Significant positive correlation between presence of chest pain and diabetes mellitus was seen .There was a positive relation between stages of LVH and stages of HTN. A significant positive correlation between presence of chest pain and stages of LVH was demostrated. Also significant linear inverse correlation of serum Lp(a) with the percent of LV ejection fraction and positive correlation of serum LP(a) with stages of HTN were found . Significant correlation between stages of LVH with serum LP(a) was found too.Conclusion: In hemodialysis patients the relationship of serum lipoprotein(a) with left ventricular hyperthrophy and ejection fraction and also with hypertention accelerate the cardiovascular disease in there patients , needs more attention.

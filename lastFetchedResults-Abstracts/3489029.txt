The ArmyÂ´s Pulse Power For Future Combat System (FCS) Army Technology Objective (ATO) program is developing the high-voltage pulse power components required to allow for the integration of revolutionary survivability and lethality in ground combat vehicles. This paper will describe recent advances in high energy density (HED) biaxially-oriented poly-propylene (BOPP) capacitors. Intermediate energy storage for many pulse power loads is achieved through the use of high energy-density thin-film capacitors, currently utilizing BOPP as the dielectric film of choice. Recent advances in HED BOPP capacitors over the last decade have resulted in the energy density more than doubling from ~0.5 J/cc in the early 1990s to ~1.2 J/cc in the 2003-2004 timeframe while still possessing reasonable direct current (dc) life and shot life. Further research has resulted in HED capacitors with energy densities of 2.0 J/cc at reduced shot and dc life levels which are candidates for applications in which the number of shots are not critical to the application. Current research and development efforts through SAIC and Advance Capacitor Inc/ICAR (ACI/ICAR) are being pursued with the goal of developing &gt;1.8 J/cc while maintaining reasonable dc and shot life. In addition, efforts are also ongoing to develop exceptionally long dc-life HED capacitors

In this article the design of a prototype of an Intelligent Transmitter of Field (ITF) is presented. The objective of the work is approaching the engineering students, in the area of Automatic Control, to the functional and technological challenges intrinsic to this type of implementations. Aspects like power consumption of the electronic circuits, energy supply through the wires of communication of the transmitter, the coexistence in these wires of analogical signals of measurement and digital signals of communication, etc., are essential to get the foreseen objective. The article seeks, also, to contribute to a didactic solution for a problem that has been one of the main challenges in instrumentation field.

This work presents a design-based validation and calibration scheme for the Global Burned Area 2000 (GBA2000) products. The objective of such a scheme is to assess the margins of uncertainty associated with the burned area products and to estimate calibration coefficients needed to convert burned pixel counts into areal estimates. As the validation of GBA2000 was performed long after 2000, and given the fact that burned areas are a predominantly nonpermanent land cover change, the reference data are obtained from a set of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus high-resolution remotely sensed data. A stratified sampling scheme is presented, specifically designed for the retrospective validation of burned area data; the scheme is based on combining information from two low-resolution burned area products (GBA2000 itself and Globscar). The resulting stratification has been applied to the whole global GBA2000 dataset, and preliminary validation results are reported for Africa. The conclusions highlight the limits of a retrospective validation exercise, and summarize some of the open issues in the validation of global burned area maps

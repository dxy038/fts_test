Abstract
Background
The present study was conducted to perceive the role-model nursing instructors’ experience in
terms of professional challenges and identification of occupational concerns in the education of
nursing students. Nursing instructors have a critical and decisive role in the training of skilled
and specialized manpower and subsequent growth and development of the communities. So,
the present study was conducted to address the role model nursing instructor’s experience in
terms of professional challenges of nursing students’ education.
Methods
The present qualitative study was carried out using the inductive thematic analysis method and
the objective-based sampling. Data were collected until saturation, using three focus-group
discussions (n=22) and two individual interviews with nursing instructors, as well as eight
semi-structured face-to-face interviews with role-model instructors from five nursing faculties
of the universities in Tehran.
Results
The three main themes were extracted, indicating the occupational challenges perceived by the
instructors as follows: “Inefficient education-research system,” “Inappropriate professional
position,” and “Ineffective interpersonal interactions”.
Conclusion
Regarding the concerns of successful model instructors, professional development, prevention
of job dissatisfaction, and implementation of role modeling strategies are recommended to be
emphasized. Taken together, reducing the clinical training-associated problems in order to
modify the education-research system was recognized as the main professional concern of the
role-model nursing instructors.

Summary form only given, as follows. As an efficient method in producing a high-quality plasma in the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, PLD is one of the best methods in depositing thin films, especially in depositing metal oxide thin films. In this work, an excimer laser is used to ablate an Al doped ZnO target (2wt %) and deposit the thin films on glass substrates at different substrate temperatures (room temperature, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 /spl deg/C, respectively). Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), a contactless optical method sensitive to surface and interface built-in electric fields, is applied to study Al doped ZnO thin films. The objective of this research is to use SE for the determination of the samplesÂ´ physical properties, such as refractive indices, the thickness of the thin films, and band gap energies of the thin films deposited at different temperatures.

Objective
jective was to compare the physiochemical properties and erosion potentials between beverages available in the UK and the US.
s
ysiochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity and fluoride concentration) and erosion potential on enamel surfaces of beverages available in the UK were compared to similar beverages from the US. Enamel windows were exposed to beverages for 25 h. Teeth were sectioned through the windows, and lesion depths were defined as the average distance between the original tooth structure and the base of demineralization.
s
 was lower in UK apple juice, orange juice, Diet Pepsi® and Sprite Zero® (p &lt; 0.05), and higher in UK orange soda and diet orange soda than in similar US beverages (p &lt; 0.05). Titratable acidities were higher in UK apple juice, orange juice, orange soda, diet orange soda and Sprite® (p &lt; 0.01), and lower in UK Sunny D® than in the US counterpart (p &lt; 0.001). Fluoride concentrations were lower in UK apple juice, orange juice, Coke®, and Diet Coke®, Sprite® and Sprite Zero® (p &lt; 0.001), and higher in UK orange soda, diet orange soda, Pepsi® and Diet Pepsi® than in their US counterparts (p &lt; 0.001). Lesion depths were higher in UK apple juice, orange juice, Diet Coke®, Sprite® and Sprite Zero® than in their US counterparts (p &lt; 0.05). Lesion depths were associated with pH (p = 0.010) and country of origin (p = 0.002).
sions
similar laboratory conditions, the physiochemical properties and erosion potentials on enamel surfaces differed between some, but not all, beverages available in the UK and the US.

A computationally-efficient procedure for multi-objective design of antenna structures is presented. Our approach exploits the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) working with a fast antenna surrogate model obtained with kriging interpolation of coarse-discretization simulation data. Response correction techniques are subsequently applied to refine the designs obtained by MOEA. Our methodology allows us to obtain-at a low computational cost-a set of designs corresponding to various trade-offs between the antenna size and the refection coefficient. Two illustration examples are considered: (i) an UWB monocone with two objectives being reduction of the antenna size and minimization of the antenna reflection coefficient in the bandwidth of interest, and (ii) a planar Yagi antenna with the objectives being an increase of the end-fire gain and minimization of the reflection coefficient, both in the bandwidth of interest.

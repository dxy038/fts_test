The sensors in sensor networks have limited energy and thus energy preserving techniques are important but in many cases like war zone the time for complete a task is more important than energy and in large-scale sensor networks, redundant communication between sensor nodes is necessary to propagate data in a large monitoring region. The main objective of this paper is to efficiently disseminate information gathered by individual sensor nodes to all the sensor nodes in the network, we use techniques that consider both time and power consumption and when we need to transfer to the sink. Our protocol can adapt to LEACH routing protocol easily. We modified SPIN protocol with clustering advantages for saving time and name our new protocol Cluster-Based SPIN or CBS. We compare our new protocol with other possible approaches and we show that our protocol saves more time and energy than others.

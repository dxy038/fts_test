A disaster is a deviation from planned or expected behavior or a course of event that endangers or adversely affects people, property, or the environment. This paper proposes a realtime accident prevention system combining signal processing and zigbee technique, that gets triggered by rash driving. The objective is to detect speed patterns in the driverÂ´s driving and alert the guard if certain patterns repeatedly occur. Several patterns are identified which are linked to irresponsible driving. The fluctuations in acceleration and deceleration for a period of time is measured by a sensor attached to the accelerator and the footbrake. This sensor gives inputs to the microcontroller kit, based on the amount of pressure on the accelerator / brake. The microcontroller in the system ascertains the traffic conditions, based on these variations in speed. Once the driving pattern matches the pre-defined pattern of rash driving in heavy or low traffic region, an alarm is sent to the driver along with the speed recommended. If the vehicle continues to travel in the same manner as before, an Zbee module in a Zigbee network sends an alert, giving details of the vehicle, the date and time of violation to the nearest control room. This will allow early response and rescue of accidents.

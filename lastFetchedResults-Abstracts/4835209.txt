Many methods exist for the diagnostics of dielectric materials. Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy falls into the range of modern non-destructive measuring methods. The subject of this paper is combined dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in time and frequency domain. The focus of interest is the experimental measurement of test dielectric samples and its interpretation with the objective to determine the best metering configuration for future applications in diagnostics and to analyze the physical origin of the dielectric spectra obtained.

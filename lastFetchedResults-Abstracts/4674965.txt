In this paper, we propose new controls for a simple intersection based on new information and communication system for intelligent vehicles. These controls are performed to take into account all vehicle arrivals individually. Hence, we consider that there is no traffic light planned by the city and vehicles negotiate their time of access between them or through an intelligent device embedded in the intersection. The intersection is modelled as a resource shared between vehicles of roads. Intersection control becomes to determine the best access order to the intersection for all vehicles which are approaching it. The objective is to evacuate all vehicles as soon as possible. This paper shows that negotiation between vehicles by means of well adapted approaches is efficient to improve traffic control at a simple intersection.

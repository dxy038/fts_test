Organizations have been relying on collaboration for productivity improvement and knowledge sharing. The first step to foster collaboration in organizations is to make it explicit. With this aim, the Collaboration Maturity Model (CollabMM) was proposed and evaluated. The lessons learned during model applications in previous work pointed out the need to review both the model and its evaluation instruments. A literature review also showed some improvement opportunities. Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop a roadmap to highlight the main opportunities of evolution in CollabMM. These opportunities will compose our research agenda in this topic and guide future work.

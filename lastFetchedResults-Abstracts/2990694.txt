We present the study of the behavior of an homogeneous linear array of two neural oscillators, with the objective of determining the characteristics of the oscillatory state of the circuit, as well as the effect of some of the parameters of the circuit on the oscillatory behavior. We show the different responses that can be obtained from this kind of circuits

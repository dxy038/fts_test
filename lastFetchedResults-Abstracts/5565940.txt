This paper presents a new approach for estimating in real-time the parameters of the advection-diffusion equation that describes the propagation of an instantaneously released gas. A mobile robot equipped with an appropriate sensing device collects measurements in order to estimate the parameters of this equation. The selection of the set of locations where chemical concentration measurements should be recorded, is performed in real-time with the objective of maximizing the accuracy of the parameter estimates and reducing the time to convergence of this estimation problem. Simulation results are presented that validate the described approach, which has significantly lower computational requirements compared to alternative motion strategies based on exhaustive global search.

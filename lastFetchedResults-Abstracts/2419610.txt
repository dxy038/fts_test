This paper introduces a robust searching hybrid evolutionary algorithm to solve the multi-objective Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR). The main objective of the DFR is to minimize the real power loss, deviation of the nodes’ voltage, the number of switching operations, and balance the loads on the feeders. Because of the fact that the objectives are different and no commensurable, it is difficult to solve the problem by conventional approaches that may optimize a single objective. This paper presents a new approach based on norm3 for the DFR problem. In the proposed method, the objective functions are considered as a vector and the aim is to maximize the distance (norm2) between the objective function vector and the worst objective function vector while the constraints are met. Since the proposed DFR is a multi objective and non-differentiable optimization problem, a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on the combination of the Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) and the Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO), called DPSO–HBMO, is implied to solve it. The results of the proposed reconfiguration method are compared with the solutions obtained by other approaches, the original DPSO and HBMO over different distribution test systems.

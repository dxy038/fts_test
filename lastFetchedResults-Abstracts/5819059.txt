Objective: To study the application of Chinese herbs (Ligustrum lucidum) monomer oleanolic acid on Alzheimer´s disease (AD) model mice cognitive learning ability, and E2 in vivo, Ach, TSH, interferon levels, and to explore the relationship among them. Methods:18 24-week-old mice (rapidly aging SMP8) were randomly divided into oleanolic acid group, the placebo group and SMP8 control group, and the other 6 selected mice as a homologous normal aging SAMR1 control group, the use of irrigation stomach after 4 weeks of drug intervention methods for water maze test(Morris maze) and biochemical testing of serum E2, Ach, TSH, IFN-concentration changes. Results: Oleanolic acid can effectively improve the Cognitive learning ability of the SMP8 mice, and impact the levels of E2, Ach, TSH, interferon (P 0.05). Conclusion: Oleanolic acid can be adjusted SAMP8 mice E2, Ach, TSH, interferon levels, and improve Alzheimer´s mice cognitive learning ability, to achieve the prevention and treatment of senile dementia of the results.

A novel objective method for measuring the quality of video is proposed. This method is based on calculation mutual information between frame from original sequence and corresponding frame from test sequence. It was tested on the `CarphoneÂ´ video at QCIF resolution (176 &#215; 144 pixels) coded in H.264 and compared with commonly used objective methods for measuring video quality (such as Video Quality Metric (VQM), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)) and one distance metric (Minkowski-form distance). Results show that our method correlates with standardized method and distance metric, so it is possible to replace more complex method with our simpler method.

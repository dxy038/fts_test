Objective: To date, several scaffolds have been fabricated for application in bone tissue
repair. However, there remains a need for synthesis of scaffolds with better mechanical
properties, which can be applied to defects in weight-bearing bones. We constructed a
composite ceramic bioscaffold of hydroxyapatite-alumina and silicon carbide (HA-Al2O3-
SiC) to take advantage of the mechanical properties of this combination and show that it
supports osteoblast-like cell attachment and growth.
Materials and Methods: Ceramic composite microporous scaffolds were synthesized
using an organic template (commercial polyurethane sponge with an open, interconnected
microporosity). Osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2) were then cultured on the scaffold and
their growth pattern and viability were compared with those cultured in cell culture-treated
flasks. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to assess cell attachment and
migration.
Results: The fabricated scaffold shows fairly uniform pore morphologies. Cell growth
and viability studies show that the scaffold is able to support osteoblast attachment and
growth. However, SEM images indicated that the cells do not spread optimally on the
scaffold surfaces.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that that a ceramic hydroxyapatite-alumina and silicon
carbide composite scaffold is a viable option for bone tissue repair. However, its surface
properties should be optimized to maximise the attachment of osteoblasts

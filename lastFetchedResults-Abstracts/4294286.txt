Error detection and correction is critical to accurate data transmission, storage and retrieval. Error correction coding (ECC) has been a crucial part of data transmission or storage. In high-reliability applications, the single error correction and double error detections (SEC-DED) Hamming code may not provide adequate protection against burst errors. This makes multiple-error correction (MEC) highly desirable. This paper proposed a novel approach to improving burst errors correction capability of the extended Hamming Code, with the target objective of minimizing the redundancy, while retaining code rate as maximum as possible. Design algorithms of Hamming encoding and decoding are proposed in this paper, and the simplicity and ease of their implementations are demonstrated with example.

In the sequel, we consider the fuzzy job-shop problem, which is a variation of the job-shop problem where duration of tasks may be uncertain and where due-date constraints are allowed to be flexible. Uncertain durations are modeled using triangular fuzzy numbers, and due-date constraints are fuzzy sets with decreasing membership functions expressing a flexible threshold ldquoless than.rdquo Also, the objective function is built using fuzzy decision-making theory. We propose the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to find solutions to this problem. Our aim is to provide a semantics for this type of problems and use this semantics in a methodology to analyze, evaluate, and, therefore, compare solutions. Finally, we present the results obtained using the GA and evaluate them using the proposed methodology.

The major objective of cultivation is to produce maximum amount of seeds. During the year, the farmers are not cultivating same type of seeds. They plant different corn in different month within a year. If the information related to proper time within year of corn plantation is available before time, the planners of the state in various fields find it easy to perform their work in various fields related to them. The growth of plant dependent on environment parameters like nature of soil, temperature (maximum and minimum), humidity (maximum and minimum) and rainfall, soil moisture, sun rays etc. The nature of soil is overall West Bengal, India, morel less same. But other parameters vary from place to place. In this paper, an effort has been made to predict the suitable time period within a year for mustard plant by considering the total effect of maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall, maximum and minimum humidity, soil moisture, and sun sine using the method of factor analysis and principal component analysis.

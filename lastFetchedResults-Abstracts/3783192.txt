Models to represent substation feed area, feeder voltage drop, feeder load distribution, cost of losses in the feeders and transformers are formuleted in terms of the variable system parameters. Based on these models, objective functions are defined which are employed in arriving at optimal substation size, feeder loading limits and conductor sizes. The technique suggested greatly reduces the computational time and effort compared to the methods presently in vogue. The optimal splutions, obtained for typical Secondary and primary distribution systems using the proposed technique are presented. To bring out toe efficiency of the proposed technique, the computational requirements for the proposed method along with the simulation techniques are discussed. The proposed method is highly promising, since it is very fast, simple and easy to program.

Present study attempts to model and optimize the complex electrical discharge machining (EDM) process using soft computing techniques. Artificial neural network (ANN) with back propagation algorithm is used to model the process. As the output parameters are conflicting in nature so there is no single combination of cutting parameters, which provides the best machining performance. A multi-objective optimization method, non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm-II is used to optimize the process. Experiments have been carried out over a wide range of machining conditions for training and verification of the model. Testing results demonstrate that the model is suitable for predicting the response parameters. A pareto-optimal set has been predicted in this work.

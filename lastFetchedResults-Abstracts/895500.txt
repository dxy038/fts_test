Herein a 46 year-old man is presented with intolerable severe pain of right
shoulder radiating to right arm and fourth and fifth fingers. He had a history of
right upper lobectomy due to complicated tuberculosis eight years ago. Based
on the findings of clinical examination and computed tomography imaging,
diagnosis of Pancoast tumor of the right chest apex was confirmed. However,
Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) under computed tomography (CT) guidance was
not conclusive. By performing a limited thoracotomy, multiple biopsy
specimens were obtained from the mass and destroyed ribs for histopathologic
examination which consequently confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell
carcinoma. Eventually, the patient was referred to the radiotherapy ward for
treatment of Pancoast tumor.

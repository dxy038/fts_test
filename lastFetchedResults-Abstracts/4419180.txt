Recent advances in wireless communications have led to the development of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). It has attracted the interest of both industrial and academic communities due to its potential in reducing accidents and saving lives. In VANETs, vehicles can communicate with each other to exchange traffic and road information. One of the challenges in VANETs is to determine the location of a vehicle in the network. In this paper, we propose an intelligent localization method, which is based on fuzzy logic and neighbors´ location information. The main objective of our proposed method is to estimate the location of a vehicle by utilizing the location information of its neighboring vehicles. To achieve accurate localization, we model vehicles´ weights using fuzzy logic system, which utilizes the distance and heading information in order to obtain the weight values. By assigning weights to neighboring vehicles´ coordinates, we expand the concept of centroid localization (CL). We evaluate our proposed method via simulation and compare its performance against CL. Results obtained from the simulation are promising and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in varying traffic densities.

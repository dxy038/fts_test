Dynamic programming is applicable to routing problems where the objective is to find the route between two points which will minimize some cost function. Although the computational procedure to find the solution to routing problems is more complex than for the majority of dynamic programming problems, solution algorithms are available and can be readily applied. Such an algorithm is presented; and, as an example of routing problems that are readily handled by dynamic programming, the route which minimizes the cost of constructing a pipeline between Fostoria, Ohio, and Columbus, Ohio, is determined.

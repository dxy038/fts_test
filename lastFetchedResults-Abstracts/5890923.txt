The dynamic model of a dump truck lifting mechanism is established based on the dynamic analysis method of multibody systems in the ADAMS software. The simulation results are compared with those of the benchmark vehicle, and a variable model is established. With the maximal elevating force factor and the fluctuation factor of oil pressure being the objective, optimal design is achieved and the lifting performance of the lifting mechanism is greatly improved.

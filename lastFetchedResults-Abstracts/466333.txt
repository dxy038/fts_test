Objective: We investigated maternal versus fetal genetic causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia by assessing concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic female co-twins, between female partners of male monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, and between female twins and partners of their male co-twins in dizygotic opposite-sex pairs. Study Design: Two large birth cohorts of volunteer Australian female twin pairs (N = 1504 pairs and N = 858 pairs) were screened and interviewed, and available medical and hospital records were obtained and reviewed where indicated, with diagnoses assigned according to predetermined criteria. Results: With strict diagnostic criteria used for preeclampsia and eclampsia, no concordant female twin pairs were found. Collapsing diagnoses of definite, probable, or possible preeclampsia or eclampsia resulted in very low genetic recurrence risk estimates. Conclusion: Results from these two cohorts of female twin pairs do not support clear, solely maternal genetic influences on preeclampsia and eclampsia. Numbers of parous female partners of male twins were too low for conclusions to be drawn regarding paternal transmission. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:374-81.)

In near future, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) will replace conventional vehicles. Considering the bidirectional nature of PHEVs, this paper proposes a Housing Peak Shaving Algorithm (HPSA) for housing composed of a PHEV. In addition to prohibiting the electricity subscription overruns caused by PHEV charging, HPSA reduces subscribed power. The application of this algorithm at a group of housing forming a low voltage residential electric grid will help to minimize the aging rate of MV/LV transformer and to respect the standard related the voltage quality of the energy supplied. Thus, HPSA can be assimilated to both Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) concepts.

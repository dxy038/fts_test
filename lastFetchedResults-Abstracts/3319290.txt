At reduced bit rates, the audio compression affects transient parts of signals, which results in pre-echo and loss of attack character. We propose in this paper an attacks restoration method based on the correction of the temporal envelope of the decoded signal, using a small set of coefficients transmitted through an auxiliary channel. The proposed approach is evaluated for single and multiple coding-decoding, using objective perceptual measures. The experimental results for MP3 and AAC coding exhibits an efficient restoration of the attacks and a significant improvement of the audio quality.

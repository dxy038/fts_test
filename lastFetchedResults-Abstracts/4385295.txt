In this brief, a cooperative control system with data-driven biointelligent controller is proposed. First, the neuroendocrine ultrashort feedback controller (NUC) is adopted to replace the conventional controller for better control performance. Since building the NUC requires an accurate model of the plant, a data-driven approach for the NUC (DNUC) inspired by the virtual reference feedback tuning algorithm is designed. Then, a cooperative control system based on real-time monitoring data of all the related devices is proposed. The system is able to provide an optimal control on a certain performance objective via information exchange, optimization calculation, and cooperative control. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulation experiment on wet spinning spinneret draw ratio control process of polyacrylonitrile-base fiber is conducted. Simulation results show that the proposed DNUC is a well-performed controller without requiring any knowledge of the plant. The control performance of spinneret draw ratio is able to cooperatively response to and effectively regulate against disturbances in all related devices.

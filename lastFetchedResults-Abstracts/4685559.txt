Distributed applications and services requiring the transfer of large amounts of data have been developed and deployed world wide. The best effort model of the Internet cannot provide these applications with the so much needed quality of service guarantees, making necessary the development of file transfer scheduling techniques, which optimize the usage of network resources. In this paper we consider the high multiplicity scheduling of file transfers over multiple classes of paths with the objective of minimizing the makespan, when the files have divisible sizes. We also consider another objective, that of maximizing the total profit, in the context of some special types of mutual exclusion constraints (tree and clique constraint graphs).

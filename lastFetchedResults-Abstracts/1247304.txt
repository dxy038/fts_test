The navy ship power system is an independent system with focused power generation, transmission and load units. In this system, harmonic currents are injected into power system because of a large number of non-linear loads such as propulsion system, automatic guns fire control system, and switching converters and cause many problems. In this paper, a shunt hybrid active power filter designed by simulation of non-linear and harmonic loads in various section of warship power system. In order to optimize the filter, two main objects were considered, including total harmonic distortion (THD) minimization and hybrid filter cost reduction.  Passive parameter optimized by multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The result showed that the optimized hybrid power filter has a large effect on eliminating the harmonic and reducing the THD from %43.31 to %4.17. Hence, the military ship power system standards are satisfied. Moreover, the power factor was increased from %64.8 to %97.6. This research emphasizes the importance of using of harmonic filter in sensitive systems such as warship power system which has size and weight limitation as well as high reliability requirement.

We describe the first attempt to define an absolute energy efficiency figure that can be applied to any data network or ICT device to provide an understanding of its absolute energy efficiency. The resulting equation can be used as an objective comparative tool to assist in comparing the energy-efficiency performances of equivalently functional systems. More importantly, it also gives a guide as to how much more energy efficiency should theoretically be able to be squeezed out of a system. We describe how our absolute energy efficiency figure can be applied within a networking context to achieve optimised carbon footprint resource allocation. Based on DijkstraÂ´s algorithm for open shortest path first (OSPF) traffic engineering, we show how additional ldquogreenrdquo control bits can be added to the latest internet protocol (IP) standard to achieve scalable and enhanced-functionality solutions in the problem of carbonfootprint minimization. Our techniques find generic application.

Due to the proliferation of technologies and services related with wireless sensor network, various sensor network applications are being appeared on the stage and a lot of sensor network testing technologies are being studied. However, most of testing systems or testbeds have objective for test and evaluation of sensor network protocols. For testing sensors and evaluating signal processing algorithms, it is necessary to develop a testbed for those purposes and especially, for monitoring the high speed sensing data. This paper proposes and implements a wireless sensor network testbed for controlling sensors, getting and managing the real-time sensing data on the remote sites.

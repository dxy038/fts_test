Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders which affects married couples frequently.The present study aims to explain the role of family processes, social support and demographic factors in marital satisfaction of women with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
Method: In this cross-sectional study, 188 women with MDD were
randomly selected among the patients who visited Bozorgmehr Clinic of
Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. The sample selection was carried
out through structured psychiatric interviews based on DSM-TV-TR
criteria. Data were collected using Index of Marital Satisfaction (IMS),
Family Process Scale (FPS) and Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire
(NSSQ).The Mann Whitney U, Multivariate and ANOVA tests were used
to analyze the data.
Results: No relationship was observed between age, educational level,
age difference of couples and number of children with family processes
and marital satisfaction (p?0.05). The patients with low educational level
reported less social support (p?0.05).Marital satisfaction and family
coherence were lower when the husband had a psychiatric disorder
(P?0.01). The family processes (family coherence, problem-solving skills,
communication skills and religious beliefs) and social support positively
predicted marital satisfaction, while the husband's psychiatric disorders
negatively predicted marital satisfaction.
Conclusion: The findings highlight the significance of family processes, social support and husband's psychiatric disorders in marital satisfaction of women with MDD.

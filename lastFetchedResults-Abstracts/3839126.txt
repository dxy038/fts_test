This article presents the ERD Working GroupÂ´s collective judgment with respect to the long-term potential of nanoscale memory and logic devices to replace silicon-based CMOS logic or baseline memory technology. It does not judge their potential to supplement or complement CMOS. The intent is thus prescriptive, not prescriptive: to provide a technically grounded, objective benchmark for emerging research memory and logic devices.

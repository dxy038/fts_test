This paper presents a study of performance evaluation of cement-based mortars incorporating very fine aggregates from recycled concrete. A series of standardized tests were performed during the experimental programme with the objective of improving the performance of the mortars in terms of strength, water absorption, shrinkage, and water permeability. The research results were very positive since some of the properties of most modified mortars improved, showing that it is feasible to use up to 15% of recycled concrete fines in mortar composition.

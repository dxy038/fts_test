This paper presents a mathematical optimization methodology to placement of switches in power distribution systems. The primary objective is to minimize the total cost of reliability with consideration of achieving high-distribution reliability levels. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is adopted to determine (i) the number of sectionalizing switches and (ii) the locations of the switches. The introduction of DGs based on island operation mode is also considered is this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is examined on a reliability test system. The presented results indicate that the proposed methodology is provided a global optimum solution for the switch placement problem while the reliability, capital investment and annual operation and maintenance costs are considered.

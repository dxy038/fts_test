The objective of this paper is to provide a more current and better understanding
of expenditure patterns of the variety of consumption products and services for various
groups of Malaysian society. The analysis focuses on differences in consumption across
age groups, and identifies factors that affect the level of total expenditure as well as
expenditure on specific consumption commodities. Estimates for income elasticities are
computed to identify expenditure items as either luxuries or necessities. Differences with
regard to an item being considered a necessity or a luxury are observed between urbanites

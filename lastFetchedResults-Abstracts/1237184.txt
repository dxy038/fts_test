Queuing systems play important role on modeling and interpreting different issues such as information technology, transportation, supply change management, and traffic control at industrial and non-industrial systems in current world. One of more complex but applicable forms in queuing systems, is queue networks which are important in order to establish proper system and optimize them. So, available approaches deal with to analyze situations or decide optimal size of system’s variables only base on one goal, while it is logical to consider various goals for determining optimal system, thus optimizing base on this, leads to system being more realistic. Therefore in this paper, we offer one multi-objective optimization approach base on desirability function in order to solve queue network’s problems. Another important intended concept in proposed approach, is making robust process which refers to low sensitivity of goals to uncontrollable variables (noise factors). Features of proposed approaches were mapped through giving numerical examples.

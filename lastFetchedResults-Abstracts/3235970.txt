In the present paper, new modeling approach is developed to improve the electrical behavior of the submicron Dual-Material-gate (DM) Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)-MESFETs for analog applications. The electrical parameters such as transconductance, output conductance, current-voltage characteristics and drain to source resistance of the device have been determined and analytical expressions have been developed. The developed models are used to elaborate the objective functions. Analog electrical parameters are also built for the three points sampled from the different locations of the Pareto space, and an interpretation is presented for the Pareto relation between the small signal device behavior and the design parameters. Hence, the developed approach is explored to search for optimal dimensional and electrical parameters to get better electrical performance for analog circuit applications. The proposed models have been validated using 2-D numerical simulations (SILVACO).

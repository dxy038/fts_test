A description is given of an interactive computer package for evaluating the risk level of a power system and for scheduling the preventive maintenance of the systemÂ´s generating units. The risk is evaluated via the loss-of-load probability (LOLP). The objective function of the maintenance scheduling is the minimization of the annual system risk. Exact LOLP calculation using the capacity outage probability table and approximate calculation routines based on the cumulants method are incorporated as options of the package. The maintenance can be scheduled using three different approaches: levelize reserve, levelize effective reserve, and levelize incremental risk. The effective reserve and the incremental risk of a unit are probabilistic quantities. An example of an approximate model of the Hellenic power system is included

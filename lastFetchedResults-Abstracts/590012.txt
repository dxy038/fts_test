The present paper deals with the study of relationship between social factors and teachersâ€™ job burnout in Ghorveh town. The survey method and questionnaire was used to collect data. Statistical population consists of all teachers (1491) of three levels (primary, secondary and high schools) in 1389 (2011), from which 317 subjects selected as the sample by stratified sampling. 
In this study burnout includes three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced efficiency. Based on the results, the size of social network has no effect on the rate of job burnout however, a significant and reversed relationship exists between social network variety and job burnout (emotional exhaustion and inefficiency). Mental participation has a relation with the dimension of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and objective participation relate with reduced efficiency. There is a reversed and significant correlation between organizational support and burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) variables.
Organizational justice and relative deprivation variables have reversed and significant correlation with the dimensions of emotional exhaustion, and social status variable has reversed and significant relation with three dimensions of job burnout. The results of this research about contextual variables indicate that the rate of burnout (reduced efficacy) of primary teachers is less than secondary and high school teachers, and depersonalization of teachers whose level of education is low is more than others. There is reversed relationship between years of teaching with burnout (reduced efficacy).

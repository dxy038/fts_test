Background: Diabetes mellitus type 2 with dyslipidemia is a common disease. Previous studies suggest that chemical constituent present in pinus eldarica (P. eldarica) nut posesess antioxidant properties and positively affect glucose metabolism. However blood glucose and cholesterol lowering effects of  P. eldarica nut have not been studied so far.
Objective: The present study was undertaken to explore the possiblility of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypercholesterolemic effects of the P. eldarica nut extract in hypercholesterolemic diabetic rats.
Methods: Sixty male wistar rats six months of age from central animal house of the institute of medicinal plants were selected. 10 rats were kept as normal group and diabetes was induced in the remaining rats by intraperitonial injection of 120 mg/kg aloxan monohydrate. After one week the diabetic rats with fasting blood glucose between 180 to 250 mg/kg were assigned to 5 groups of 10 rats each and were fed on hypercholesterolemic diet. One group was kept as control group (untreated diabetic rats) and P. eldarica nut extract in doses of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg was gavaged daily to the remaining rats. After one month, the fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined in all groups.
Results: The results indicate that fasting blood glucose in 200 and 400 mg/kg P. eldarica nut extract treated groups significantly decreased (P=0.000 and P=0.000) and fasting blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not change significantly compared with control group.
Conclusion: P. eldarica nut extract lowers blood glucose level withought affecting blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels in hypercholesterolemic diabetic rats.

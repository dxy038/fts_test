The emerging wireless relay networks (WRNs) are expected to provide significant improvement on throughput and extension of coverage area for next-generation wireless systems. We study an optimization problem for multihop link scheduling with bandwidth and delay guarantees over WRNs. Our optimization problem is investigated under a more general interference model with a generic objective. The objective can be based on various kinds of performance indexes (e.g., throughput, fairness, and capacity), which can be determined by service providers. Through our theoretical analysis, the intractability and inapproximability of the optimization problem are shown. Due to the intractable computational complexity, we present efficient algorithms to provide a reasonable small approximation factor against any optimal solution even for a worst-case input. Furthermore, some experimental results indicate that our algorithms yield near-optimal performance in the average case.

As multimedia services become more widespread, there is a need for standardized methods for assessment of the quality perceived by the end user. ITU-T SG12 has been at the forefront in defining and validating subjective and objective quality assessment methods for many years and has issued many recommendations in this area. Subjective assessment remains the definitive methodology but objective methods are now becoming mature enough to provide very accurate results, especially for voice, and much more convenient to implement. However, currently available objective quality estimation methods can require a lot of computational resources, which makes them difficult, or even impossible, to be deployed operationally in a large network. Attention in SG12 is now heavily focused on lightweight models based on parametric or bit stream input, which enable large-scale real-time QoE assessment in a network. These models have a potential to simultaneously monitor many, or even all, of the audiovisual sessions in a network.

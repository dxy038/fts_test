One of the most significant obstacles in a developing country is related to non-productive investments or delay on
productivity of construction projects. Following the development in the business world, the challenges for handling
the businesses toward productivity raised rapidly. Construction industry plays an important role in the foundation of
economy everywhere. Therefore, to lead the projects through the challenges, a proper leadership and a competent
construction manager are essential. The evaluation of competency might be more accurate by different variables.
The psychological factors are one of the most effective variables within evaluation suggested by many scholars. The
purpose of this study is to develop a predictor variable to recognize the competent construction manager based on
their “Big Five” traits as one of the variables predicting a successful Construction Manager (CM). In other words,
the objective of this article is to determine the relation between the “Big Five” traits of CMs and the competency
level. Two different Questionnaires were employed to collect data and support the objective of this paper. The first
group was to evaluate and measure the competency level and the second one to evaluate “Big Five” traits of the
respondents. According to correlation and regression analysis in SPSS software on the data collected, a meaningful
relationship was acquired between CMs’ competency level and their “Big Five” traits test. By the result of the
survey, the projects’ authorities can consider CMs’ “Big Five” traits as a predictor variable of CMs competency
level to recognize the competent construction managers before employment.

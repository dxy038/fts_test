The main objective of this work is to investigate service quality of VoIP in wireless communication networks through a simulation study. This paper outlines a simulation framework for VoIP quality, which incorporates wireless links, system performance, and speech quality. There has been a focus on packet voice quality simulation. In the proposed framework, the Gilbert model is used to simulate packet dropping in transportation and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) algorithm is for calculating mean opinion score (MOS) of voice. The results show that packet loss rate, continuous packet loss and active user number have obvious impact on the voice quality

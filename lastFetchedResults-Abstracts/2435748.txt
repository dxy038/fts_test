The inventory routing problem (IRP) in a supply chain (SC) is to determine delivery routes from suppliers to some geographically dispersed retailers and inventory policy for retailers. In the past, the pricing and demand decisions seem ignored and assumed known in most IRP researches. Since the pricing decision affects the demand decision and then both inventory and routing decisions, it should be considered in the IRP simultaneously to achieve the objective of maximal profit in the supply chain. In this paper, a mathematical model for the inventory routing and pricing problem (IRPP) is proposed. Since the solution for this model is an NP (non-polynomial) problem, a heuristic method, tabu search adopting different neighborhood search approaches, is used to obtain the optimal solution. The proposed heuristic method was compared with two other methods considering the IRPP separately. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is better than the two other methods in terms of average profit.

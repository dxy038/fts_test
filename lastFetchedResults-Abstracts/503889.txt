Background and Aim: Reduction of health inequalities is one of the main objectives of health systems. To attain this objective, special methods for measurement of inequalities are required. This study was performed to assess the trends of disparities of death indices in rural areas of Iran`s provinces in a period of 15 years from 1993 to 2008, by use of highest to lowest rate ratio (RR) and index of disparity (IDisp).
Materials and Methods: In this study, we used the data extracted from vital horoscopes or 'Zij' of rural areas in provincial and district areas to study the trend of alterations in disparities of mortality. We estimated the annual index of disparity (IDisp) and highest-to-lowest mortality rate ratio (RR) for every index; and the trend of alterations was studied in a period of 15 years. 
Results: In spite of the regular decreasing trend of mortality indices, the trend of alterations of IDisp for NMR, IMR, and U5MR was irregular at different times. The IDisp for CDR was increasing. The RRs indices had irregular trends. 
Conclusion: In spite of obvious improvement in all indices studied in this country, the trends of alterations in disparities of mortality indices were not desirable. We concluded new policies and programs are required to decrease health disparities between provinces

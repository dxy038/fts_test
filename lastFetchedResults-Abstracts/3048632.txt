Summary form only given. This paper aims at an integrative and innovative approach to curriculum methods of teaching engineering methodology courses. The course is problem driven where industrial case studies are the basis for the introduction of problems, key concepts, and solution methodologies. The objective of developing this educational environment is to bring the complexity of real world decision making to the classroom and to simulate the dynamics and uncertainties of organisational decision making in a classroom setting.

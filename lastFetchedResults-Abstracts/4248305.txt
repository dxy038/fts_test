Drives based on permanent magnet synchronous machines become more and more popular in many industrial applications. In most high-performance applications classical vector control is currently used. While this control method is usually reliable it has some limitations especially in controllers tuning and constraints handling. New control methods like Model Predictive Control become feasible in connection with increasing computational power of controller hardware. The paper deals with enhanced discrete time PMSM model which can be used for efficient predictive control implementation. The other objective of the paper is discussion of prediction horizon length impact on the drive control performance.

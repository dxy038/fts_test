Moving objects passing through a common region should be ordered at the entrance. Usually, a first-come-first-served (FCFS) method is applied. However, FCFS could cause delay propagation among these objects, which could result in substantial total delay. Therefore, we presented an ordering method that minimizes the total delay. Although our method reduced the total delay, it caused some objects to experience significant unfairness. In this paper, we introduced a multi-objective optimization to minimize the total delay considering fairness. The results showed that our method can generate a schedule with less the total delay than that of FCFS without impairing fairness.

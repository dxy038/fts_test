Background and Objective: Maternal mental state is closely related to the fetus. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the relationship between depression and anxiety of pregnant women with neonatal anthropometric indicators (birth weight, height and head circumference).


Materials and Methods: In this crosssectional study with correlational approach, 146 pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy were selected with cluster sling. Data were collected using DASS42 questionnaire and were analyzed with SPSS16 using statistical analysis of Pearson correlation and ANOVA.


Results: The mean age of participants was 28.4plusmn  6.12 years. Their level of depression and anxiety was 50.7% and 70.5% (mild to severe), respectively. Mean and SD of weight were3000plusmn 482.04 gr. Height and head circumference at birth  in neonates were 49.58 plusmn 1.84 cm and   34.19plusmn  1.56cm, respectively. Findings showed that depression and anxiety of pregnant women had a significant negative relationship with birth weight and height (plt 0.01). It means that with an increase in depression and anxiety, there was a decrease in weight and height at birth. No significant relationship was found between maternal depression and anxiety with head circumference at birth (pgt 0.05).


Conclusion: It is recommended that first and second level preventive measurements be undertaken as related to maternal psychological symptoms (depression and anxiety) in order to prevent their intrauterine development and subsequent disorders.

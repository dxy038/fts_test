Objective
To investigate the effects of muscle fatigue induced by low-level isometric jaw-clenching and subsequent glutamate-evoked muscle pain on the exteroceptive suppression (ES) response and resting electromyographic (EMG) activities in human jaw muscles.
Methods
The resting EMG activity and the ESs were recorded before (baseline), after low-level jaw-clenching (Post1), after subsequent glutamate or isotonic saline injections into the left masseter (Post2), and 60 min after the clenching (Post3) in 23 healthy volunteers.
Results
The late ES (ES2) showed more inhibition at Post1 compared with baseline (P < 0.05). It was less inhibited after both types of injections (Post2), and increased at Post3 again (P < 0.05) with no significant difference between the glutamate and isotonic saline sessions. The resting EMG activity increased at Post1 and Post2 (P < 0.05). The glutamate injection further increased the resting EMG activity in the injected muscle (P < 0.01).
Conclusions
Muscle fatigue influences inhibitory reflex pathways in jaw-closing muscles and subsequent acute muscle pain potentiates the local increase in the resting EMG activity of the painful muscle.
Significance
Muscle fatigue which can be observed in patients with oral dysfunctions may interact with nociceptive regulation and influence the clinical presentation of jaw symptoms and function.

An ultrawideband imaging radar was developed. It is a highly mobile, ground-based system capable of 2D and 3D imaging at very close ranges to a synthetic aperture. The radar is fully coherent over two bandwidths (0.1 to 2 GHz and 2 to 18 GHz) and is being used for target and for foliage penetration measurements. The emphasis of the program is to characterize the radar phenomenology associated with the detection and classification of targets in foliage. An important objective is to identify the radar parameters needed by an operational airborne foliage penetration synthetic aperture radar. Polarimetric measurements of 8-ft trihedral corner reflectors deployed in the woods at Lincoln Laboratory were performed during the summer of 1991. Measurements were taken at 0.3-1.0 GHz with a single, linearly polarized log-periodic antenna, and at 1-2 GHz with a dual-polarized quad-ridged horn antenna.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

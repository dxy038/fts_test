Objective The study had two objectives: (i)
to analyse determinants of non-participation in a general
population study of mental disorder in Stockholm,
and (ii) to determine whether associations between
mental disorder and some potential determinants were
different among participants and non-participants in
the study. Methods The study was based on a questionnaire
including potential risk factors for mental disorder
and symptom scales. The study group was a random
sample of the Stockholm County population aged 20â€“64
years (19,742 persons). Replies were obtained from
10,441 participants, i. e. the response rate was 53%. The
symptom scales were used to identify a group with increased
likelihood of mental disorder, screening-positive,
and a group with low likelihood of mental disorder,
screening-negative. Random samples of the screeningpositive
and screening-negative respondents were summoned
for interview concerning psychiatric symptoms.
The database of respondents and non-respondents was
linked to several population registers. Results The participation
was higher in females, among older persons,
married persons, among persons with higher income
and education and among those born in the Nordic
countries. There seemed to be little further risk indicator
based selection to interview participation. The associations
between in-patient psychiatric care and register
variables were strong and similar among participants
and non-participants. Conclusions The occurrence of
mental disorders is likely to be underestimated in studies
with this design and with substantial dropout rates.
However, the study participants can most likely be a base
for generalising risk indicators for, or social consequences
of,mental disorder, to the general population

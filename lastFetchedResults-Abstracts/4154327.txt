This paper concerns an application of a three-phase cage induction machine (IM) as a self-excited generator connected to the AC side of a voltage-source PWM bidirectional inverter. The generator is supposed to be driven by a low-head unregulated shaft hydraulic turbine. The proposed system is intended to be applied in rural plants as a low-cost source of high-quality AC sinusoidal regulated voltage with constant frequency. Simulation results are obtained based on the &#945;&#946;&#947; stationary reference frame model of the IM. The experimental results demonstrated that the system presents satisfactory behavior when feeding AC loads and during the startup of induction motors

Background and Objective: Discovery of genetic changes which contribute to cellular neoplastic and malignant tumor transformation is one of the major aims in oncology researches. The aim of this study was to investigate the DMBA-induced breast cancer in SD rat strains using bioinformatical methods and also to find their homologous regions in human chromosomes.
Materials and Methods: In this research, we used SD rat strains as a suitable model for DMBA-induced breast cancer. We gavaged the rats twice with 10 mg DMBA solved in 0.5 ml sesame oil. After tumors appeared in DMBA-treated rats, they were subjected to histopathology and immunohistochemistery studies, cell culture, metaphase chromosomal preparation, and finally G-banding stain. According to databases, we collected genes in the affected area and prepared a gene list by comparing genome of the rats and human in changed chromosomal segments.
Results: Our data showed numerical and frequent structural changes in different number of chromosomes. For example, we found recurrent gain in chromosomes 3, 4, 8, 12, 17, loss in chromosomes 3, 9, 12 and 15, also deletion in chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 20 and addition in chromosomes 11,15 and 19. Conclusion: According to these chromosomal changes and based on bioinformatics studies we predict that the gQUQsTGFBRS, HACE1, UBR5, CALB2, HPR, LCP1, RRM2B, ABO, ZFHX3, TNFSF11, ABLl, EPSTI1, PRDMl, REG3A, FOXAl and PRKD1, probably may contribute to the development of breast cancer.

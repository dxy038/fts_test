This paper considers the manufacturing scheduling problem. The authors examine a job-shop system in which multiple-operation jobs are scheduled on multiple machines. The routing through the system is specified uniquely for each job. The objective of scheduling is to simultaneously determine the jobs-machine assignment and job sequencing on each machine. Modelling based on Petri net formalism allows the performance of a system of cyclic production processes to be evaluated. The considered problem is specified as a linear programming problem and is solved by a heuristic algorithm.

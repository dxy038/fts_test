The objective of this paper is to propose a reasonable dynamic model of the bridge system for vibration control design. The bridge system is an elastic beam subjected to a moving vehicle. The system includes both spring and link flexibility, and is akin to a flexible-link robot arm with joint flexibility. Some dynamic computer simulation results (i.e. time histories) are presented in the paper. The broad range of problems discussed in this paper will be found useful in civil engineering as well as in mechanical, transport, marine, aviation, and astronautical engineering, for vibratory systems with moving loads.

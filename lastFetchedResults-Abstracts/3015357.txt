In any secure multicasting environment, group management becomes an important aspect for achieving privacy and integrity of the multicast session. In this paper, group management strategy has been proposed to address this objective. The multicast group has been divided into subgroups or hash families, each subgroup contains the nodes that maps to the same hash key that is calculated by a hash function. A ´clue´ has been added to facilitate the join/leave mechanism for members in the group.

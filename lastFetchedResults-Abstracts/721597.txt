Two new pimarane diterpenes, diaportheins A (1) and B (2), were isolated from a culture broth of the fungus Diaporthe sp. BCC 6140. Diaporthein B (2) strongly inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with the MIC value of 3.1 μg/mL, while diaporthein A (1) showed only mild activity (MIC value of 200 μg/mL).

.Woodinhabiting fungi are absorbing the food needs and secondary metabolites from their hosts and are a source of great medical and bioactive elements. This research was conducted for the first time on xylophillous macroscopic fungi of Birch tree species (Betula pendula), located in Siyamarzkoh forests in Golestan province. The two secondary metabolites betulin and betulinic acid with valuable anticancer properties are synthesized in the various species of Birch bark. Due to the fact that the Birch species are under station in Iran and extracting the active compounds from the bark of this tree is the impossible, In order to achieve this objective, identification of  macroscopic fungi which are inhabiting under the bark of this plant, measuring the ability to absorb the active ingredient of betulin and betulinic acid in the fungi detected by using HPLC and also assess the amount of phenols (Folin–Ciocalteurmethod), flavonoids(according to the method of Alcl3colorimetric) and antioxidant activity (by DPPH method) of fungi in different solvents, were conducted .The results showed that two species of fungi were identified including: Hyphodontia paradoxa and Stereum hirsutum that the both species had the ability to absorb the active ingredient from their hosts. The absorption rate of host secondary metabolite, antioxidant properties, phenols and flavonoids were significantly different at the level of 0.01 percent. Amount of total phenol, betulin and betulinic acid in the S. hirsutum had a significant advantage over other fungus. Between the two solvents (methanol and ethanol), there was no significant difference in the amount of phenol and antioxidant properties, while the amount of flavonoid that extracted with ethanol was more than methanol. Based on the results and the presence of secondary metabolites in fungal tissue, they could be introduced as a new source of natural drugs to the society

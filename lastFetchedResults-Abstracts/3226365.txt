Image fusion process merges two images into a single more informative image. Objective image fusion per- formance metrics rely primarily on measuring the amount of information transferred from each source image into the fused image. Objective image fusion metrics have evolved from image processing dissimilarity metrics. Additionally, researchers have developed many additions to image dissimilarity metrics in order to better value the local fusion worthy features in source images. This paper studies the evolution of objective image fusion performance metrics and their subjective and objective validation. It describes how a fusion performance metric evolves starting with image dissimilarity metrics, its realization into image fusion contexts, its localized weighting factors and the validation process.

This paper proposes an online economic optimal operation of combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) and photovoltaic solar (PV) systems, including graphic user interface (GUI) for display of optimal energy flows. In this work, a test system consists of a CCHP system, a PV system, an auxiliary boiler, an absorption chiller, a heat storage tank, and utility grids. The problem has been formulated as a linear program which can be efficiently solved to obtain real-time optimal energy flows. An economic objective function has been built from operating costs of and fuel prices; also, constrains are constructed from operation conditions of each component. The simulation results show that CCHP and PV are able to cooperate under the proposed optimal operation to obtain the minimum operating cost.

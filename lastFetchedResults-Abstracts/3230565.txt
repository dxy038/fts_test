With growing concerns about environmental pollution and a possible energy shortage, great efforts have been taken by the governments around the world to implement renewable energy programs, based mainly on wind power, solar energy, small hydro-electric power, etc. Due to its many advantages such as the improved power quality, high energy efficiency and controllability, etc., the variable speed wind turbine using a double fed induction generator (DFIG) is becoming a popular concept and thus the modeling of the DFIG based wind turbine becomes an interesting research topic. In this paper the steady state analysis and control of double fed induction generator (DFIG) for variable speed wind energy conversion system is studied. The objective is to analyze the performance of DFIG under steady state conditions. Stator oriented flux vector control is employed to achieve the independent control of active and reactive power of the machine. The machine is modeled in vectorized form in a synchronous reference frame. The complete simulation model is developed for such machine under variable speed operation using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment for effectiveness of the study.

The Matrix Pencil (MP) method is a direct data domain method that can be used to estimate direction of arrivals (DOA) of coherent or non-coherent signals from a single snapshot of a uniform linear array (ULA). Recently, many variants of MP method have been proposed including Unitary Matrix Pencil (UMP), Single invariance Beamspace Matrix Pencil (SBMP) and Multiple invariance Beamspace Matrix Pencil(MBMP) methods. The main objective of this paper is to compare these algorithms with respect to computational complexity and estimation accuracy. It is shown through computer simulations that although all these methods give comparable performance in terms of average root mean square error of estimated DOA, there is a significant difference in their computational complexity.

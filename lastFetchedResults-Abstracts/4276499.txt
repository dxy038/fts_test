In this paper, the optimization problem of tuning of lead-lag power system stabilizer (PSS) parameters of a single machine infinite bus power system is considered. Optimal tuning of power system stabilizer parameters using Optimization based linear control design is carried out. The objective of designing PSS is to provide additional damping torque without affecting the synchronizing torque at critical oscillation frequencies. Settling time is considered as a performance criteria for damping of oscillations in this design. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the designed lead-lag power system stabilizer to damp out the oscillation of single machine system and work effectively under various disturbances.

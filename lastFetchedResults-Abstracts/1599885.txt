The aim of this model is to analyse quality management systems from the standpoint of the organization of complex systems introduced by Robert Rosen. The concept that an organized system, under certain conditions, can be modelled as a living system introduces unsuspected tools to analyse its behaviour. The model is oriented towards the understanding of the implications of modifications introduced in laboratories working with a quality organization following the ISO/IEC 17025 standard.

tandard establishes management and technical requirements concerning the documental organization, control of the management and technical records, personnel, equipments, test or calibration methods, etc. The objective of the quality system implementation is to assure the quality of the product, the special consideration being the customerâ€™s satisfaction with all aspects of the service the laboratory offers.

proper use of the quality system tools has an impact on the laboratory activity. The perception of this fact can be negligible at the moment it happens. The model allows us to realize that this alteration always has a negative impact on the customer and it specially affects the continuous improvement that the laboratory must implement.

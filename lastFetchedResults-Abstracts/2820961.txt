The main purpose of this work was to understand property modifications during lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis by using different experimental techniques (thermal analysis methods, x-ray diffraction and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT)). Miscanthus x Giganteus as energy crop and its components (cellulose, holocellulose and lignin) were used as feedstock in this investigation. Pyrolysis tests were carried out in laboratory scale reactors with a slow hating rate of 5 &#176;C/min at three different temperatures 280, 300, 350 &#176;C. The initial samples and their biochar products were investigated with the objective of their effective valorization. X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the presence of mineral classes in the biochars like silicate. Analysis of functional groups showed the progressive decrease of carboxyl groups and the increase of carbonyl during pyrolysis. The greatest change in surface functionality was identified at 300-350 &#176;C.

With the objective of designing a transceiver IC for multi mode operation, the RF requirements for the whole transceiver from antenna to baseband are derived from the UMTS- and GSM-standards. The RF-parameters found for the overall system are broken down to building block level. The boundary conditions for the transceiver IC are defined using specifications of currently available external components. The work presented here focuses mainly on the receiver design, but in case of UMTS-FDD it also takes the interference from the transmitter into account. Multi mode operation of the transceiver can be obtained by re-using most of the building blocks. Others, like front end SAW-filters, can neither be integrated nor re-used.

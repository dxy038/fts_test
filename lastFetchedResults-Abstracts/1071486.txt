Objective: Psychosis has an overall frequency of about 3.84% and is related to neural damages. The sox5 gene, which has an important role in nerve system development, is involved in controlling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. So, this study analysis the sequences of HMG-box and CCDD of sox5 gene in 100 patients afflicted with DSM-IV-TR-Diagnosed psychosis from Tehran. 
Materials & Methods: in this case-control study, samples were provided by non-randomized sampling method. 100 patients whose psychosis had been proved by psychiatric based on DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria were provided from two private clinics in Tehran. We performed blood sampling and then DNA extraction by salting-out method. Based on bioinformatics data obtained from NCBI and Ensemble databases, we split these two domains into five fragments and overall 500 fragments (5 for every sample) were amplified and analyzed with SSCP technique. ABI PRISM sequencing would have carried out if a band shift had been seen. The results of sequencing would have compared with reference human sequence in Ensemble database and if mutation had been proved, controls sequencing would have performed. 
Results: No change in HMG-box and CCDD was observed in research samples with SSCP technique. 
Conclusion: Findings indicate that mutations in HMG-box and CCDD are not a common cause of psychosis.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to minimize antenna coupling by optimally positioning multiple radiators. Initial GA parameters are selected using a simple cylindrical model, and the results are used to optimize antenna placement on a realistic aircraft surface model. A novel aggregate objective function incorporating surface wave coupling, variance of the coupling values, and radiation pattern analysis is used. Multiple computational and experimental data are shown to validate the methodology.

Aim: The objective of the present Article is to find out usage of the Qualitative Research in Social Science.
Method: This Research is conducted with a Documentary method based.
Result: Data are not inherently quantitative, and can be bits and pieces of almost anything. Data can come in the form of words, images, impressions, gestures, or tones which represent real events or reality as it is seen symbolically or sociologically. Qualitative research uses unreconstructed logic to get at what is really real the quality, meaning, context, or image of reality in what people actually do, not what they say they do (as on questionnaires). Unreconstructed logic means that there are no step-by-step rules, that researchers ought not to use prefabricated methods or reconstructed rules, terms, and procedures that try to make their research look clean and neat (as in journal publications). It is therefore difficult to define qualitative research since it doesn't involve the same terminology as ordinary science.

Introduction & Objective: Maternal-fetal  attachment is a term  used to describe the relationship between a pregnant woman and her fetus .Mothers that have high maternal-fetal attachment? display more confidence in  their new role  and show better postpartum adjustment . The present study was conducted to determine the effect of training attachment behaviors on maternal-fetal attachment.
Materials & Methods: This interventional study was conducted on 83 pregnant women selected through purposive sampling from among the population of pregnant women admitted to health centers, and were divided randomly into case and control groups. Data collection instruments included interview checklist, maternal-fetal attachment scale. Participants in the experimental group received an intervention that included four sessions of 2 hours classes weekly, selected maternal-fetal interactive activities and recording them. But controls  received only the routine pregnancy care . Scores of maternal-fetal attachment before and after intervention were compared across the two groups. Data were analyzed by spss 11.
Results: The results indicated that mean score of maternal-fetal attachment before intervention in case and control groups were 3.52?0.5 and 3.45?0.43, and there was not significant difference between them(p=0.78). After intervention these scores were 3.96?0.38 and 3.42?0.41 , that there was significant difference between them(p < .001).
Conclusions: The result indicated that simple interventions such as training maternal-fetal attachment behaviors can increase maternal-fetal attachment and increasing attachment can improve maternal-neonatal relationship and forms the basis for the child s future social, emotional and cognitive development.

This paper describes flexible software for industrial robots. WinRS232ROBOTcontrol and winEthernetROBOTcontrol software were developed to be used in industrial robots. With this software, industrial robots can be integrated in modern production systems, in an easy and efficient way. A Robotic Bar and a Flexible Manufacturing Cell (FMC) were developed with the objective of showing the potentialities of the developed software.

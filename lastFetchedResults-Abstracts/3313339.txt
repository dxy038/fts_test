Good quality lighting promotes better learning. Good quality classroom illumination improves mood, behavior and concentration of students. Lighting contributes to around 20% - 30% of electricity consumption in an academic institute. It is important to cut energy costs as availability of energy is a matter of concern. There should be greater effort to optimize the usage of energy in lighting installations. Energy efficiency in an academic institution does not mean compromising the comfort level of staff and students. The objective of this work is to conduct a lighting energy audit in a class room of academic institution. The results of the audit suggest that there is ample scope for improvement. Lighting energy audit was useful in understanding the lighting level distribution throughout the classroom. It is important to create awareness to optimally use energy in an educational institute. Using energy efficient equipment and use of appropriate controls is the best way to improve the lighting and efficiency in the academic institution. The paybacks of implementing the energy efficiency measures in academic institution are significant both in terms of savings energy and cost.

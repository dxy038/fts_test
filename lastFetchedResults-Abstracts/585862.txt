In this study, the effect of geographical variation on the morphological and anatomical characteristics of beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) in Guilan province were investigated. To meet this objective, five watershed include of Astara, Asalem, Fuman, Chere, Shenrud were selected Forty fully expanded leaves (sunned leaves from the middle part of tree crown) were collected from 40 healthy trees in each populations. Some leaf morphological traits including leaf length, leaf width, petiole length, leaf area, leaf dry mass per unit leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf density, stomatal density, and stomatal pore lenght were measured. The results showed that all measured leaf traits were remarkably different among the populations excluding distance between veins at  P < 0.05. A hierarchical classification (SPSS Version 16) was led to the formation of three major groups: (i) Fuman (ii) Astara & Asalem, and (iii) Chere & Shenrud. Leaf dissimilarities are possibly attributed to the geographical variation, since the majority of the studied leaf traits were statistically (P < 0.05) related to the latitude and edafic factors of the studied populations.

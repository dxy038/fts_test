The primary objective of this paper is to disseminate the results of a gelatin rigidization in-house research program and results of two Air Force research contracts concerning rigidization of structures via micro-encapsulated foam reactants or expandable self-rigidizing honeycomb. The significance of these research efforts is the Air Force will have the capability of automatically rigidizing expandable structures in an aerospace environment. A secondary objective was to show the relationship of these efforts to the overall expandable structure program.

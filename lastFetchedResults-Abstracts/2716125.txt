We report how the impedance presented by a platinum electrode scales with the concentration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We measure the response in various dilutions of PBS with an electrode array as is commonly used in spinal cord stimulator (SCS) implants. We match the parameters of a non-linear electrode-electrolyte interface model to these measurements. We find that the constant phase element of the model scales with approximately the log of concentration, whereas the resistivity is inversely proportional. Using a novel DC measurement technique we show that the onset of Faradaic conduction for a platinum electrode, and thus the safe exposure limit, does not scale with concentration. We compare objective measurements made in saline to those made in the spinal cavity of live sheep. We comment upon the appropriateness of using PBS as a substitute for in-vivo measurements.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To create new developmental tasks, such as motherhood, pregnancy is a critical period for woman. Nowadays, due to the stress of birth, women's desire to cesarean delivery has increased. This research is designed to identify the effect of educational coping skills on labor outcome. 
METHODS: In this interventional study, 64 primiparous women were included in this study by cluster method and were randomly divided into two groups of case and control (32 subjects in each group). The experimental group attended eight coping skills sessions in 18-22 weeks of pregnancy and control group received routine antenatal care. Labor outcome were evaluated and compared in two groups.
FINDINGS: Mean age in case and control groups was 20.25±1.40 and 20.43±1.86 years, respectively. There was a significant difference between two groups in requesting cesarean delivery [ 3 subjects (10%) in case group versus 12 (48%) in control group] (p=0.002). However caesarean rate, low birth weight and preterm neonate in case group were less than control group, but the difference was not significant. 
CONCLUSION: According to the results, childbirth preparation using behavioral-cognitive skill is a suitable method in decreasing childbirth outcomes including requesting cesarean delivery.

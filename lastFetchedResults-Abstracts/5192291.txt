An increasing number of surveys and articles high-light the failure of database servers to keep confidential data really private. Even without considering their vulnerability against external or internal attacks, mere negligences often lead to privacy disasters. The advent of powerful smart portable tokens, combining the security of smart card microcontrollers with the storage capacity of NAND Flash chips, introduces today credible alternatives to the systematic centralization of personal data on servers. Individuals can now store their personal data (e.g., their medical folder) in their own smart tokens, kept under their control, and never disclose in clear their private data to the outside untrusted world. However, this new opportunity of managing and protecting personal data conflicts with the objective of implementing knowledge-based decision making tools on top of centralized data. This paper precisely addresses this issue and proposes to adapt the traditional Generalization privacy mechanism to an environment composed of a large set of tamper-resistant smart portable tokens seldom connected to a highly available but untrusted infrastructure. This conjunction of hypothesis makes the problem fundamentally different from any previously studied privacy-preserving data publishing problem we are aware of.

An EMI filter design procedure for power converters is proposed. Based on a given noise spectrum, information about the converter noise source impedance and design constraints, the design space of the input filter is defined. The design is based on component databases and detailed models of the filter components, including high frequency parasitics, losses, weight, volume, etc.. The design space is mapped onto a performance space in which different filter implementations are evaluated and compared. A multi-objective optimization approach is used to obtain optimal designs w.r.t. a given performance function.

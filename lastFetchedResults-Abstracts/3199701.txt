The objective of this paper is to present the results of a study conducted to examine the potential role and potential benefits of electric vehicle (EV) battery as distributed energy storage resource in a smart grid environment. Using EV battery as a storage device will provide the opportunity to make the electricity grid more reliable especially with large proportion of renewable sources such as solar and wind connected to the grid. Although electric vehicles represent a new demand for electricity during the periods that they need to be charged, but they can play a role as storage device that could supply electric power back to the utilities grid.

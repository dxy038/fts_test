There are two important questions in this survey: First, how determined functions based on innovation system in Nanotechnology program have been proper and the other is what structures and organizations in the country must be established. Method of this survey is descriptive and monitoring. In this survey the objective population is experts in innovation and its system and know about nanotechnology. Due to limitation of finding these people in scientific societies we used census instead of sampling and found 24 cases. It was found how accurate the confirmed programs by the Iranian Nanotechnology Initiative in different areas such as international interactions, leadership and encouraging programs to develop competitive industries, standardisation system and human resource development, etc have been chosen according to functions of innovation system. It was investigated if these findings have been chosen accurate. After evaluation of each function in every program, we returned to the programs and determined if they were strong, average or weak. It was seemed that there are 3 weak (5.6%), 17 strong (32.2%) and 33 average programs (62.2%). So it is included that majority of the programs are not as enough strong and would not cause the development of Nanotechnology in the country.

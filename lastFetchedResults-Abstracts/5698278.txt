This paper reviews some recent results in applying singular perturbation theory to obtain simplified power system models for stability analysis and control design. The topics include synchronous machine modeling, slow coherency and dynamic equivalencing of large power networks, and transient stability analysis using direct methods. The objective is to introduce power system engineers to singular perturbation methods as a tool for providing additional insights into power system dynamics of different time scales and for analytically deriving reduced models.

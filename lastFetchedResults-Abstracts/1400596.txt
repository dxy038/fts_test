Ceramics with composition of Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)0.975Nb0.025O3 prepared from powders obtained by hydrothermal synthesis method were investigated. A microstructure with mean grains sizes of 1–3 μm were found and the apparent density of 7.5–7.6 g/cm3. Dielectric constant and losses have been measured in the range of temperatures (30, 500 °C) with a heating/cooling rate of 0.5 °C/min at frequencies (0.1 Hz, 1 MHz), using impedance spectroscopy method. The transition heat was measured on the small ceramic samples with a differential scanning calorimeter. The permittivity was analysed with phenomenological models for relaxors. Dielectric and piezoelectric constants measured values were used as starting parameters to generate a model of a PZT actuator with ANSYS software package. The model geometry can be modified, after the simulation is performed, in order to achieve the functional objective.

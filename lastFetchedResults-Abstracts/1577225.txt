The estimation of ground radiance and emissivity from Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data is strongly dependent on the atmospheric correction applied to these data. Since such corrections are a function of the atmospheric path between the sensor and ground, correction techniques that do not consider the topographic variations within a scene can introduce appreciable error in the estimation of the atmosphere effects. In this paper, we describe the development and application of a variable-elevation atmospheric correction procedure. Our objective was to incorporate changes in target altitude into a general atmosphere correction strategy. This procedure was tested on a TIMS data set acquired over Mt. Etna, Italy in July 1986. The methodology adopted in this study is based on the use of the LOWTRAN radiative transfer code and a digital elevation model (DEM) registered to the image data. The image data are divided into a series of layers, based on elevation, and a separate atmosphere correction is applied to each layer. Maps of emissivity estimates derived with the variable-elevation approach were compared with geologic maps of the Etna flow fields. Prior to the variable-elevation correction, the emissivity spectra of long lava flows appeared to vary with elevation. Following the variable-elevation correction, many of these spectral artifacts were removed from the emissivity maps. In addition, the variable-elevation correction increased our ability to discriminate individual lava flows.

Objective
 this study is to determine the prognostic value of age, serum alkaline phosphatase, pretreatment PSA level, Gleason score, and number of bone metastasis focuses.
ts and methods
ndred fifty-one patients who had been followed in our clinic between years 1989 and 2006 were investigated retrospectively.
s
esult of this study, it has been detected that serum alkaline phosphatase, Gleason score, and intensity of bone metastasis are important and statistically significant prognostic factors, and affects time to progression and life time. But pretreatment PSA level, and age have been detected not to be effective in predicting time to progression and life time.
sion
atic prostate cancer provides a wide spectrum for risk of death from the disease, and clinicians have long sought methods to predict the outcome accurately in individual patients. In our study, we found that high serum alkaline phosphatase, high Gleason score, and intense bone metastasis (&gt;6) has negative impact on progression and survival.

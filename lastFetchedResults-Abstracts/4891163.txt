DCS-1, a defect classification system for classifying defects on a semiconductor wafers using a builtin fuzzy logic expert system is described. DCS-1 is advantageous over manual classification because it is both objective and fast. Defect classes are defined using DDL (Defect Description Language), a language of fuzzy predicates which was developed for this application. The paper describes a unique approach to fuzzy logic and image processing where fuzzy features are computed using traditional image processing techniques and classifications are decided using fuzzy logic rules

In this paper, an adaptive output feedback control strategy is presented for a class of nonholomic systems in chained form with drift nonlinearity uncertainties. The control law is developed using the systematic strategy combines the input-state-scaling technique with the so-called backstepping techniques. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller for general case of uncertain chained system is developed with a filter of observer gain. A novel switching control strategy is employed to get around the smooth stabilization issue (difficulty) associated with nonholonomic systems when the initial state of system is known. The objective is to design robust nonlinear adaptive output feedback laws such that the closed-loop systems are globally exponentially stable. The simulation example demonstrates the efficiency and robust features of the proposed method.

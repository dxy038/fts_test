In this paper, the improvement of two design components (swarm growing strategy and objective space compression and expansion strategy) from the existing multiple swarms MOPSO, namely DSMOPSO, is presented. In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the impact of the five tuning parameters on its performance through two performance metrics. Simulation results show the improved design is robust with respect to the tuning parameters.

Air mass management is one of major factors affecting the performance of diesel engines, where experimental studies play a significant role in the performance studies. However, the experimental studies are quite expensive and time consuming. Neural network’s (NN) have been used increasingly in a variety of engineering researches. NN based model are generally developed from experimental data. The objective of the study is to investigate the adequacy of neural networks (NN) as a quicker, more secure and more robust method to determine the effects of intercooling process on performance charged diesel engine’s air intake mass flow. In this study, a NN model has been developed configured tested for this purpose. The training and test data is obtained from real experimental work delivered earlier. Further details of development of NN are also demonstrated.

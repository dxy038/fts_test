In this paper we present an adaptive controller for the shunt three phase active power filter, to guarantee a sinusoidal balanced current in the source side, a low harmonic distortion. To accomplish this objective, the shunt active filter is forced to inject the appropriate current to the line. The control technique consists of applying an adaptive non linear control to the exact non linear control to the active filter. By applying a non-linear feedback-linearization technique to the non linear model results in a linear model. Afterwards a model reference adaptive control scheme is proposed for the feedback-linearized system. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, some simulation results employing Simulink/power system block set of Matlab are demonstrated

In this paper, a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) was optimized based on three criteria. The first criterion which is for heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) considers the increase of the whole cycle exergy efficiency as an objective function. The exergy analysis has revealed that drum is a high temperature sensitive part of HRSG with high exergy destruction. Therefore, the second optimization criterion was based on the drum saturated temperature which caused the exergy destruction reduction of this component. The third optimization criterion was based on the cost reduction, the increase of the whole cycle exergy efficiency and the decrease of CO2 emission. To validate the results, the Damavand CCPP data has been used and the results have shown that the whole cycle optimization criterion yields better results in comparison with the other optimization criteria and it causes cost reduction (capital, environmental impacts and exergy destruction costs) as well as the increase of exergy efficiency. The value of CCPP decision parameters is highly dependent on the ambient temperature. Therefore, it is not possible to apply the same value for CCPP at various temperatures. The Genetic algorithm improved the cycle optimized parameters with respect two objectives of CO2 emission and power plant costs reduction.

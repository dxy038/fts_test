Bare copper (Cu) wire is one of the promising materials used in assembly packaging to replace gold wire. As copper is harder compared to gold, the formation of the looping during wire bonding is a concern and challenge especially to ball neck surface condition. Thus, the objective of this paper is to identify the key parameters that are having significant impact on the ball neck surface condition at wire bond and molding process. Evaluations are performed and the result do identified key factors that are having impact to the ball neck surface condition.

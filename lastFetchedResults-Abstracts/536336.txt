The main objective of image enhancement is to process the image so that the result is more suitable than the original image for aspecific application. Image enhancement is a field that is being used in various areas and disciplines. Advances in computers, microcontrollersand DSP boards have opened new horizons to digital image processing, and have opened many avenues to the design and implementation of newinnovative techniques. In this paper we use of knowledge-base (fuzzy expert) systems that are capable of mimicking the behavior of a humanexpert. Fuzzy approach of knowing severity of tumor is essential to determine if there is a need for the biopsy and it gives to user a clear idea ofspread and severity level of tumor. Fuzzy based enhancement of color feature of tumor is an application of fuzzy in the area of color featureextraction for enhancement of a peculiar feature. It has been found that RGB color model is not suitable for enhancement because the colorcomponents are not decoupled

The main topic of the paper is a discussion on how to combine disparate sources of information in the safety assessment of software-based systems. This is based on experience gained through the licensing process of a programmable system in the Swedish nuclear power plant Ringhals, where a guideline for reviewing software in safety-related systems was applied. One lesson learned from this activity is that the approval of a programmable safety critical system, in particular one which is based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf software, is based on a combination of disparate sources of information. This combination of information is made in a diagrammatic framework. An emerging methodology to combine information about disparate evidences in a systematic way is based on Bayesian Belief Networks. The objective is to show the link between basic information and the confidence one can have in a system.

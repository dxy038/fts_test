The results of an investigation of the noise figure and conversion efficiency or erbium-doped fiber amplifiers for unsaturated, moderately saturated, and heavily saturated operation are reported. Quantum-limited 3 dB noise figures result only for small signal operation of low-gain amplifiers. For high gain, partially saturated amplifiers useful as in-line repeaters, bidirectional pumping results in the best combination of noise performance and conversion efficiency while co-propagation of signal and pump produces the best noise performance.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

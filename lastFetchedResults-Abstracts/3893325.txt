In this paper, a novel Zeta-mode three-level ac direct converter is proposed. The converter realizes three-level voltage waveforms before the output filter, which can get a better harmonic spectrum and reduce the bulk of the filter. Compared with two-level ac choppers, voltage stresses of the converter can be lowered. Compared with ac-dc-ac converters with no isolation and low- or middle-frequency isolation, the converter has single power stage and bidirectional power flow. Moreover, compared with buck-mode three-level ac choppers, it can realize buck and boost output voltage. The converter has four operation states in one period of input voltage and three different operation modes in one switching period. To ensure that the converter operates reliably, the noncomplementary control strategy is presented, which can make the converter switch smoothly between different modes in bidirectional power flow. Therefore, the converter is suitable to different kinds of loads. Principle analysis and experiment results of the prototype well verify the advantages of the proposed converter.

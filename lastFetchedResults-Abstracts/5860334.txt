With the change in transmitted load in power system, reactive power varies accordingly, which may result into unacceptable voltage variation. This affects the performance of power system parameters like power loss and power factor. This paper deals with Computer Simulation of 132 / 11 kV Distribution Sub Station using SVC for voltage enhancement. Load Flow Analysis is carried out, considering balanced system during peak load condition, with the voltage enhancement is the main objective. Other objectives are the reduction in power loss and improvement in power factor. Simulation is developed in Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) environment and recorded parameters are compared with Simulation results.

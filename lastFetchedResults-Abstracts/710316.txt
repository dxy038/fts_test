Study Objective
To evaluate the independent relationship between depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and drug resistance self-efficacy, and future intentions to use flunitrazepam.
Design
Cross-sectional survey.
Setting
Community-based family planning clinics.
Participants
865 sexually active women who self-identified as Caucasian, African-American, or Mexican American, denied using flunitrazepam in the last 12 months and reported intentions to use or not use this substance in the next 12 months.
Interventions
None.
Main Outcome Measure
An anonymous self-report measure assessed the patient's intentions to use flunitrazepam in the next 12 months; other lifetime drug use; and standardized measures of depression, self-esteem, and drug resistance self-efficacy. We hypothesized that future potential users of flunitrazepam would exhibit an increased number of depressive symptoms, lowered self-esteem, and limited drug resistance self-efficacy.

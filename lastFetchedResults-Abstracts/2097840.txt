The objective of the study was to develop an assay for bovine IL-10 that could be applied to analyses of immune responses and advance understanding of a variety of diseases of cattle. Recombinant bovine IL-10 (rbo IL-10) was transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells and shown to inhibit the synthesis of IFNγ by bovine cells stimulated with antigen in vitro. Mice were immunised with a plasmid containing a cDNA insert encoding rbo IL-10 and inoculated with rbo IL-10. A number of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were generated that reacted with rbo IL-10 in an ELISA. Some of these mAb neutralised the ability of rbo IL-10 to inhibit IFNγ synthesis by antigen-stimulated bovine cells. A pair of mAb was identified that together could be used to detect both recombinant and natural bovine IL-10 present in supernatant of PBMC stimulated with ConA. A luminescent detection method was applied to the ELISA making it more sensitive. Using this method native IL-10 was detected in supernatants of PBMC, diluted blood and undiluted blood from cattle immunised with Mycobacterium bovis BCG or ovalbumin and incubated in vitro with antigen indicating the applicability of the assay to a number of in vitro culture systems.

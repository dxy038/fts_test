The objective of this paper is to compare two different control structures: the direct power control with space vector modulation (DPC-SVM) and the multi-resonant (MR) current control in a power active filter application, showing their different characteristics and their complementarities. The criteria to choose between both controllers will be mainly the requirements of the application in terms of harmonic distortion correction. The multi-resonant controller is especially adapted for heavily distorted loads, where the requirements of the application justify the complexity of the controller. The DPC-SVM controller is theoretically designed to only handle with sinusoidal waveforms, but if it has a large enough bandwidth it can also work properly with slightly distorted signals, saving computationally complex operations. Simulation and experimental results show that both control structures achieve good performances in slightly distorted active filter applications, showing therefore that for these cases the DPC-SVM is an interesting solution, while it is necessary to use more complex controllers such as the multi-resonant one, in case of heavily distorted applications.

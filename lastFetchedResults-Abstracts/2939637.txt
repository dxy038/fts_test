In this study, the authorsÂ´ overall objective is to identify reliable sources of neural control signals and extract features, such as ground contact and slip information, that may be applied in closed-loop FES systems for restoring voluntary use of paralyzed muscles in humans. The authors present a method of recording cutaneous nerve activity in unrestrained cats walking on a treadmill, and using the electroneurograms (ENGs) to predict the timing of electromyograms (EMGs) recorded simultaneously in various muscles

The objective of the present study is to develop a system that can measure ECG and BCG of a patient on wheelchair moving or pausing and transmit measured signals to a remote server through CDMA (code division multiple access) network. In order to acquire ECG and BCG, the system has an amplifier for each signal, and records the signals on a SD card through an A/D converter. In addition, it is equipped with a 3-axis acceleration sensor to remove physical noises that may happen while driving the wheelchair and the data are also stored in the SD card. Data recorded in the SD card is transmitted to a remote server using a CDMA module (BSM-860s of Bellwave Co.), and if an event takes place in the patient, 48 Kbyte data stored for the last 32 seconds are transmitted to the remote server. It was programmed using C# of Microsoft that ECG, BCG and 3-axis acceleration data transmitted to the server through CDMA network are displayed. In conclusion, this study developed a system that acquires both ECG and BCG simultaneously from patients on wheelchair and, on the happening of an event, transmits the data to a remote server through CDMA network.

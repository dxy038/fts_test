The main objective of this paper is to analyze the statistical wind speed data recorded in Zuwara-Libya during 2007, the wind speed measured at three hub heights of 10m, 30m, and 50m above the ground, wind speeds was taken every 1 minute, were averaged over 10 minutes. The wind speed data set is analyzed using Weibull, Rayleigh, and Gamma distribution. An effort has been made to find out the best fitting distribution of wind speed data, which are evaluated by using two goodness of fit tests, namely, Chi-Squared test, and Kolmgorov-Smirnov test. Root mean square error, and correlation coefficient are also used to determine error and describe the correlation between the observed data and each distribution. From analysis it is concluded that the Weibull distribution gives the best fitting for observed wind speed.

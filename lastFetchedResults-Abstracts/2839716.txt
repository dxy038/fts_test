The paper analyzes the bidirectional power exchange achieved with a multiphase DC/DC converter and the possibilities to switch this type of converter between boost and buck operation modes. In particular, the topology and the waveforms of a two-phase DC/DC bidirectional converter with coupled inductances are presented. The currents ripples for two converters sub types, with uncoupled and coupled inductances, were calculated. The mathematical results for these converters were compared to each other and further with the experimental results.

We report a patient with Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm of tuberculous aetiology, who presented with massive hematemesis and who was successfully managed with transarterial steel coil embolization. Pseudoaneurysms are a rare but potentially fatal complication of tuberculosis and hence early recognition and management of this complication is important. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a GDA pseudoaneurysm resulting from tuberculosis.

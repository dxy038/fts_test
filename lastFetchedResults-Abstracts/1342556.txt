This study investigates the effect of silane coupling agents on the performance of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes on the basis of sol–gel coating method. The surfaces of the RO membranes were chemically modified with four different alkoxysilanes in order to reduce their hydrophilicity. The objective of this study is to superpose hydrophobic polysiloxane layer on the surface of a polyamide TFC RO membrane and to increase the extent of salt rejection by the modified membranes. A commercial composite RO membrane (SWC1) was treated with silane coupling agents in ethanol at three different concentrations: 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% (w/v). The silane coupling agents contain one alkyl or phenyl and three alkoxy groups (e.g., methyltriethoxysilane, octyltriethoxysilane, octadecyltrimethoxysilane and phenyltriethoxysilane). In addition, the effect of alkyl or phenyl group hydrophobicity on the permeability and salt rejection of the modified membrane was examined. The surfaces of the modified membranes were characterized by SEM, AFM, contact angle analyzer, and XPS in order to confirm successful sol–gel methods. The modified membranes showed significantly enhanced salt rejection without a decrease in flux. From the surface analysis results, we can observe the changes in the surface roughness, elemental composition, electron energy, and hydrophilicity.

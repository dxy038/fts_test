In this paper, according to differences in product quality and customer preference for remanufacturing product, based on the objective of maximizing customer satisfaction and firm profits, using by two-way auction transactions game theory, the dynamic pricing model based on customer preferences for remanufacturing products is constructed, and the corresponding conclusions can help the remanufacturing enterprises to determine the price.

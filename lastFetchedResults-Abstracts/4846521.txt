Reliable decentralized stabilization is considered for general multi-channel plants, where the objective is to maintain stability of the closed-loop system when all of decentralized controllers work together and when one of the controllers is extracted due to a failure. A dilated LMI technique is employed for deriving reliable state feedback design, while a version of unknown disturbance observer is used as a decentralized observer for extending the design to output feedback case. Advantages and usefulness of the proposed method are demonstrated through an application to a power system.

Objective
Migraine is known as one of the most disabling types of headache. Among the
variety of theories to explain mechanism of migraine, role of serum magnesium
is of great importance. Serum magnesium, as a pathogenesis factor, was
considerably lower in patients with migraine. We established this study to see if
serum ionized magnesium, not its total serum level, was different in migraineurs
from normal individuals.
Materials & Methods
In this case control study, all participants were recruited from Neurology Clinic
of Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Ninety-six people were entered in the
study, 48 for each of case and control groups. The two groups were matched
by age and sex. Migrainous patients were selected according to the criteria
of International Headache Society. Various characteristics of headache were
recorded based on patients’ report. Controls had no history of migraine or any
significant chronic headaches. Serum ionized magnesium level was measured in
both of the case and control groups and the results were compared to each other.
P value of  < 0.05 was considered as significant.
Results
Case group consisted of 13 males, 35 females, and control group included 14
males, as well as 34 females. Mean age was 33.47± 10.32 yr for case and 30.45
±7.12 yr for control group. Twenty-eight patients described the intensity of their
headaches as moderate; 15 patients had severe and the 5 remainders had only
mild headaches. Mean serum level of ionized Mg was 1.16± 0.08 in case group
and 1.13± 0.11 in control group of no significant difference (P  > 0.05).
Conclusion
Serum ionized magnesium, which is the active form of this ion, was not
significantly different in migraineurs and those without migraine. This may
propose a revision regarding pathogenesis of migraine and question the role of
magnesium in this type of headache.

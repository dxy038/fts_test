This paper deals with the development of a control system for an omnidirectional mobile robot. Our objective, overall control architecture and approach to motion generation are considered. The control system is implemented and tested on the omnidirectional mobile robot and the experimental results obtained are discussed. The operation of the control system is illustrated by a video on the remote control of the mobile robot and the visually-coupled motion of the two robots

Steroid hormones and their receptors are involved as initiators or promoters in prostate carcinogenesis. The intrauterine–perinatal period and maternal estrogen and testosterone levels have been proposed to be of etiologic importance in prostate tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The objective of this study was to analyze genetic polymorphisms in the androgen receptor ARStuI by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) and in the estrogen receptor ER325 by PCR–single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR–SSCP). In our study of 170 prostate cancer patients, ARStuI and ER325 genotypes and their association with disease progression and metastasis were analyzed. Age-adjusted logistic regression analysis indicates the association of ARStuI S1 allele with high-grade tumor (P = 0.033; OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.1–8.3) and the association of ER325 with high-grade tumor (P = 0.003; OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.4–6.4), advanced disease (P = 0.020; OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1–5.1), risk of progression (P = 0.027; OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1–5.7) and the presence of metastatic disease (P = 0.006; OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.4–6.8). In summary, this study has demonstrated androgen receptor (ARStuI) and estrogen receptor (ER325) genetic polymorphisms in prostate cancer patients and its association with disease progression and metastasis. Our results support the hypothesis that genetic factors related to steroid hormone receptors may influence the behavior of human prostate cancer.

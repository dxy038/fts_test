Cellular networks and WLAN are the two popular wireless network structures in current wireless network systems. Cellular networks support seamless coverage and high-speed mobility, while its data bandwidth is limited. On the other hand, WLAN support high bandwidth data transmission with local coverage area and walking-speed mobility. A new wireless architecture combining the advantages of both cellular and WLAN has been the peopleÂ´s objective all along. In this paper, we propose a uniform wireless network architecture (U-WN) trying to achieve this goal, based on the spirit of software defined networking. Specifically, based on our analysis on the characteristics of wireless networks, we propose special designs for SDN architecture and investigate the detailed design of both controller and the nodes in the network. Furthermore, the possible applications and potential directions of U-WN are also discussed, which sheds lights on the opportunities and challenges brought by SDN to current wireless networks. We believe that the U-WN architecture opens new improvement space for wireless networks and our paper moves an important step towards the future wireless networks.

This article presents the realization of a tensegrity-based robot composed of a three-bar symmetric prismlike minimal tensegrity configuration. Statics and kinematics are studied presenting the workspace for the designed robot. After a detailed implementation description of the physical robot, some trajectories within its workspace are analyzed. Although our long-term objective is to provide mobile tensegrity-based robots to the community, this work studies a case in which the robot is anchored to the ground. This provides us with a first insight of how these structures should be actuated and sensed to produce movement.

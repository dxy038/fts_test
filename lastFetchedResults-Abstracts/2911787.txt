Self-oscillating push pull converters are ideally suited for the realisation of a `DC transformerÂ´ where bidirectional power flow and DC voltage transformation at a fixed ratio is required. The major aims of this investigation are to use minimum circuitry and to determine the design criteria for efficient operation. Results on a 1.5 kW prototype indicated that high efficiencies are attainable, and the base drive circuit can be reduced to a minimum number of components, leading to low costs and improved reliability

The objective of this investigation is to examine the effect of substitution of cement with natural pozzolana and marble powder on the rheological and mechanical properties of self-compacting mortar (SCM) and self compacting concrete (SCC). Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) was partially replaced by different percentages of pozzolana and marble powder (10â€“40%). The workability of fresh SCC was measured using slump test, V-funnel flow time test, J-Ring, L-Box and sieve stability tests. Compressive strength was determined on prisms at the ages of 7, 28, 56 and 90 days. The results indicate an improvement in the workability of SCC with the use of pozzolana and marble powder. Compressive strength of binary and ternary SCC decreased with the increase in natural pozzolana and marble dust content, but strength at 28 and 90 days indicate that even with 40% (natural pozzolana + marble powder), suitable strength could be achieved.

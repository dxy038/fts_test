The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of nano SiO2 on longterm water absorption and thickness swelling, humidity coefficient diffusion and thickness swelling rate of wood plastic composite. For this purpose, 60% wood flour, 40% polypropylene, 2 per hundred compound (phc) MAPP in internal mixer (HAAKE) were mixed. Nano SiO2 with 0, 1, 3 and 5 (phc) ratios as a reinforcing was used too. Finally test samples were fabricated by using the injection molding machine. Then longterm water absorption and thickness swelling for 1848 hours according to the ASTM standard on the samples were measured. Humidity coefficient diffusion and thickness swelling rate for closer look longterm water absorption and thickness swelling behavior in wood plastic nanocomposite were calculated too. For ensure to the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl grope of SiO2 nanoparticles with hydroxyl grope of wood flour form Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy tests was used. The results showed that water absorption behavior of nanocomposite is according to Fick&#039;s law, in addition with increasing to SiO2 nanoparticles, longterm water absorption and thickness swelling and humidity coefficient diffusion in wood plastic nanocomposite decreased. The results of infrared spectroscopy showed that hydrogen bond between the nano SiO2 and wood flour confirmed. Statistical analysis showed that after 1848 hours of immersion, nano SiO2 showed a significant effect at a confidence level of 99% on water absorption and thickness swelling, so the sample with 5% silica nanoparticles was chosen as the best treatment.

The main objective of this paper is to discuss new procedures of the isolation of Hyaluronan. Hyaluronic acid can be obtained from human umbilical cord residual, which is obtained from other biopharmaceutical productions. The route involves treatment of human umbilical cord residuals with sodium chloride solution, followed by ammonium quaternary salt solution precipitation; the solid is re-suspended in calcium chloride solution in order to dissociate the hyaluronan ammonium quaternary salt complex followed by ethanol-induced precipitation to give a product. The product was purified four times by chloroform extraction, and characterized by chemical methods such as the Blumenkrantz and Asboe-Hansen uronic technique for uronic acid determination, Elson Morgan qualitative tests for hexosamines, intrinsic viscosity, ion-exchange chromatography, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the product might be used in the formulation of ointment, lotion and cream for the treatment of skin diseases.

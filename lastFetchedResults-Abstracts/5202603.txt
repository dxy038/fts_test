A new kind of induction motor with compound cage rotor(IMCCR) is developed in this paper, in which rotor bar is composed of upper part made of alloy material (conductor of electric and magnetic) and lower part made of cast aluminum. The transient heat conducting process of IMCCR running with discontinuous blocked rotor was studied, in which two different structure rotors were compared analyzed. The transient temperature field was numerically calculated by using the method of coupling electromagnetic field and temperature field, in which the continuous process with application of full voltage during 10s rotor locked, natural cooling during 600s disconnection of motor and during repeated next 10s rotor blocked is simulated. Based on the above, this paper presented the heat conducting process of the stator equivalent windings and change trend of bidirectional heat conducting of parts of stator. Then radial transient heat conducting processes of rotor when blocked and natural cooling were analyzed. At last, the influence of different material conductivity on the temperature distribution near the inner circle of stator was explored, in which the calculated values at the measured points were compared with the tested ones.

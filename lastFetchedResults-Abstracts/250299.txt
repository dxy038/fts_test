In this paper, a coupled model based on finite element method (FEM), boundary element method (BEM)
and scaled boundary FEM (SBFEM) (also referred to as the consistent infinitesimal finite element
cell method) for dynamic response of 2D structures resting on layered soil media is presented. The
SBFEM proposed by Wolf and Song (Finite-element Modelling of Unbounded Media. Wiley: England,
1996) and BEM are used for modelling the dynamic response of the unbounded media (far-field).
The standard FEM is used for modelling the finite region (near-field) and the structure.
In SBFEM, which is a semi-analytical technique, the radiation condition at infinity is satisfied
exactly without requiring the fundamental solution. This method, also eliminates the need for the
discretization of interfaces between different layers. In both SBFEM and BEM, the spatial dimension
is decreased by one. The objective of the development of this coupled model is to combine
advantages of above-mentioned three numerical models to solve various soil–structure interaction (SSI)
problems efficiently and effectively. These three methods are coupled (FE–BE–SBFEM) via substructuring
method, and a computer programme is developed for the harmonic analyses of SSI systems.
The coupled model is established in such a way that, depending upon the problem and far-field
properties, one can choose BEM and/or SBFEM in modelling related far-field region(s). Thus, BEM
and/or SBFEM can be used efficiently in modelling the far-field. The proposed model is applied
to investigate dynamic response of rigid and elastic structures resting on layered soil media. To
assess the proposed SSI model, several problems existing in the literature are chosen and analysed.
The results of the proposed model agree with the results presented in the literature for the chosen
problems. The advantages of the model are demonstrated through these comparisons

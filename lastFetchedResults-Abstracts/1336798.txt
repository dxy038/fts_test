The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of a compounded long-acting progesterone formulation (BioRelease P4 LA 150; BETPHARM, Lexington, KY) containing 150 mg progesterone/ml for pregnancy maintenance in mares after prostaglandin (PG) F2α-induced luteolysis. On day 18 of gestation, mares were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 7/group): (1) saline-treated control (Saline); (2) PGF2α-treated control (PGF); (3) PGF2α- and Regu-Mate-treated (Regu-Mate); and (4) PGF2α- and BioRelease P4 LA 150-treated (BioRelease). On day 18, Saline mares received 1 ml sterile saline IM, whereas PGF, Regu-Mate, and BioRelease mares received 250 μg cloprostenol IM. Beginning on day 18, Regu-Mate mares received 10 ml Regu-Mate orally once daily and BioRelease mares received 10 ml BioRelease P4 LA 150 containing 150 mg/ml progesterone IM once every 7 days; treatments were continued until day 45 or until pregnancy loss occurred. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed every 3 days between days 18 and 45 (or until pregnancy loss). Pregnancy loss was defined as complete absence of a discernible embryonic vesicle as determined with transrectal ultrasonography. Pregnancy loss rates between days 18 and 45 were: Saline, 1/7; PGF, 7/7; Regu-Mate, 1/7; and BioRelease, 0/7. The pregnancy loss rate was higher (P < .01) in PGF2α-treated control mares compared with the other groups. There were no differences (P > .1) in pregnancy loss rates among the saline-treated control, Regu-Mate-treated, and BioRelease P4 LA 150-treated mares. These results indicate that intramuscular administration of BioRelease P4 LA 150 containing a total of 1.5 g progesterone every 7 days provided a sufficient level of progesterone to maintain pregnancy between days 18 and 45 of gestation in mares that lacked an endogenous source of progesterone; therefore, this long-acting formulation of progesterone appears to be an efficacious and suitable alternative to currently available progesterone formulations that require daily administration.

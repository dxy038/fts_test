With the ability of simultaneous transmissions, multi-channel multi-interface wireless mesh networks have emerged with great potential in the improvement of network throughput and performance. Interference has the strongest effect on the available bandwidth of wireless mesh networks, but efficient power control schemes can greatly relieve the interference effect of close-by transmissions. An efficient power control scheme is introduced to achieve this objective. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach and scheme can get better performance than HLF.

Describes a novel, computer-based approach to the objective assessment of the symptoms of Parkinson´s disease. The magnitude of symptoms such as tremor, chorea and hesitation are particularly important in the appropriate administration of drugs, such as L-Dopa, used to improve patients´ motor activities. The method adopted measures the motor control of patients in real time using a commercially available digitising tablet. Vector-based analysis of this data is then performed to obtain an objective measurement of the symptoms under investigation. Results are presented for a population of Parkinson´s patients and compared with results obtained from subjects without any known neurological disorder. It is proposed that this technique is sufficiently sensitive to aid precise administration of medication to Parkinson´s patients throughout the day, and thus to increase the long-term benefits of such drug therapies

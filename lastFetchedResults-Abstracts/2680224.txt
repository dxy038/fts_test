The main objective of this paper is to collect the viewpoints of jurisprudents with the centrality of that of Imam Khomeini about what impairs and harms the correctness of ablution and nullifies it based on the primary and secondary commandments. The necessary data have been collected from books, journals and Internet sources. After explaining the viewpoints of some outstanding jurisprudents, Imam Khomeiniâ€™s viewpoints have been described and analyzed and compared with those of some jurisprudents such as the author of Jawahir. The findings of the research indicate that any error in the particulars and requirements of ablution would nullify the ablution, but in some cases the Lawgiver has ruled that it would not nullify the ablution, such as the rule of washing the entire body in contrast to exempting some parts for which washing is harmful and are washed from over a cover that is called jabirehi; or the rule of release or the moment of release from completing the  ablution and doubt about its particulars which does not nullify the ablution. The study of these impairments which are called impairments (khelal) in jurisprudence and the collection of the viewpoints of jurisprudents in this regard facilitates consultation about this jurisprudential chapter (purity-ablution).

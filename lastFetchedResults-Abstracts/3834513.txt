We present a new and simple iterative equalization scheme for the enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE) wireless system. This scheme can significantly reduce the number of trellis states in a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) equalizer via delayed decision-feedback (DDF) approach. Relying on the mechanism of decision feedback in the DDF trellis, bidirectional processing can be applied to exploit the time diversity of the received signal bursts for a more reliable equalizer output. With mild increase in computational complexity over the more traditional single-directional (Si) DDF turbo equalizer, the bidirectional turbo equalizer can achieve a significant performance gain.

The objective of this study was to evaluate dietary corn distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS), ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC), and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on growth performance, carcass and fat quality, and shelf-life of fresh pork from finishing pigs. Barrows (n = 72) were fed one of eight treatments consisting of two diet sources (corn–soy and corn–soy + 20% DDGS), two levels of RAC (0 and 7.4 ppm), and two levels of CLA (0 and 0.6%) for 28 days. Loins were portioned (n = 3) into one of three storage conditions (fresh, cold, frozen); each followed with seven days of retail display. Feeding RAC improved ADG and G:F (P &lt; 0.05), whereas DDGS decreased belly fat firmness (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary DDGS increased total polyunsaturated fatty acids in jowl and belly samples and increased Iodine Value (IV) (P &lt; 0.05), but addition of CLA decreased IV. Dietary DDGS, RAC, or CLA had minimal impact on pork quality following varied storage methods.

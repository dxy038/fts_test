Objective: This study describes our experiences in reproductive cloning using two different
procedures resulting in birth of the first successfully cloned sheep in Iran and the
Middle-East, nick-named "Royana".
Materials and Methods: Abattoir-derived sheep oocytes were enucleated after in vitro
maturation for 18-20hrs and then reconstructed by ear-derived sheep somatic cells using
two different procedures of renucleation (subzonary, intracytoplasmic), embryo culture (coculture,
sequential medium) and embryo transfer (intra fallopian, intra uterine). Pregnancy
status and fetal development were followed regularly and elective cesarean was inducted
on day 145 of pregnancy. Histopathological and genetical examinations were performed
on either aborted and delivered clones for confirmation different aspects of cloning.
Results: The two procedures were both efficient in producing early and/or advanced
cloned embryos, establishing early and/or advanced stages of pregnancy till delivery. Four
pregnancies were detected; one were failed at early pregnancy, one aborted on day 90,
one was still born and the fourth delivered to a healthy male lamb nick named "Royana".
Conclusion: Many different approaches have been developed for mammalian cloning
which all are judged by their ultimate potency for establishment of successful pregnancies
terminated to healthy/viable clones. As a preliminary study toward establishment of
the technology, this study also successfully examined the competency of two procedures
of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, the overall low efficiency of SCNT indicates
that many different aspects of the technology remain to be dissolved.

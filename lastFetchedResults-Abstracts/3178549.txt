In previous work, an EM-like image reconstruction method for diffuse optical tomography has been presented. Followed with the assumptions and objective function in previous work, total variation regularization method to the reconstruction problem is applied and a new optimization objective function is provided. Fre&#769;chet derivative of the new objective function for absorption coefficient and diffusion coefficient are calculated. Novel iterative formulas are derived according to the Kuhn-Tucker condition. Finally, two dimensional numerical experiment is taken to test the new iterative formulas.

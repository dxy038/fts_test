This paper describes an intelligent vehicle management system, which uses Fuzzy logic to infer, from a set of input variables obtained from the vehicle´s environment, what is the best destination for the vehicle. This is a decentralized implementation, that is, each vehicle is capable of deciding what is the best destination for itself, and also communicate with other vehicles to see if it´s objective is the best one globally. To ensure a good response time from the vehicles, without the need of a powerful and expensive hardware, every vehicle uses a table with the output defuzzified values previously calculated for the inference process, instead of a complete fuzzy engine.

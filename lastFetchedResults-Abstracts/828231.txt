The main objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between social capital and public health for Iran during the period of 1976-2007.  For this purpose, we used the mortality as negative proxy of health and Gini coefficient as negative proxy of social capital. Also for estimate the model we used ARDL approach. 
The results of model estimation reveal that inequity of income distribution has positive and significant effect on mortality. In other words, there is positive and significant relationship between social capital and health. Also there is convergence between variables. With respect to the results of this study, in order to achieve better health status in the community, there distribution of income (Reducing in equalities) seems to be necessary.

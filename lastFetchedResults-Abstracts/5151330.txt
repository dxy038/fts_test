The objective of this research was to compare the seven main functions of ATM banking services from five banks in Thailand. The selection of the five ATM banks was based on the fact that they contained different hierarchical menu structures. In the research, four groups each with 200 participants were separated into two parts. The first group of participants was required to complete a questionnaire in order to identify the seven main tasks of ATM banking, whilst the second group was required to perform the experiment on the ATM simulator. The second group was subdivided into four groups; students, employees, government and state enterprises officers and agriculturists. To compare seven major functions, a simulator of each of the five banksÂ´ ATM machines was developed and then tested in the laboratory environment. Usability was evaluated in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction and the percentage difference. The results suggest that different menu structures will affect the usability of ATM banking. Moreover, the different types of user provide a different score based on usability measurement. Only one bank received the highest score on most of the usability criteria for all the different user groups.

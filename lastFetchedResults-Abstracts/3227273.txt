A Bidirectional Converter Fed Dc-Drive System with fly back Snubber has efficient conversion ratio, high output power, and smooth start-up. A clamping capacitor is used to reduce the voltage spikes caused by the current difference between the low voltage side inductor and leakage inductance of the isolation transformer. A diode and fly back snubber is used as protection circuit. It can reduce the current flowing through the active switches at the current-fed side. A model of 1.5-kW power with low voltage side of 48 V and high voltage side of 360 V has been implemented.

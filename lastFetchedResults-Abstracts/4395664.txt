In this paper, taking the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind power application as a research objective, its fault ride-through (FRT) capability with a flux compensation type fault current limiter (FCL) is investigated. Since this kind of FCL can not only suppress fault current quickly, but also restrain voltage drop effectively, installing the FCL in the stator side of a DFIG can potentially help to enhance the transient performance of the DFIG. For this reason, some related theoretical analyses are conducted, and quantitative simulation verification is carried out through MATLAB/SIMULINK. From the results, owing to the introduction of the FCL, the fault currents flowing through the DFIG can be limited to lower levels, and meanwhile the terminal voltage of the DFIG can be maintained. It is concluded that the FRT capability is availably improved for the wind turbine generator connected to power grid.

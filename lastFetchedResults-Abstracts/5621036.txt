The mathematic model of multi-objective vehicle scheduling problem based on customer satisfaction is proposed firstly, whose two trade-off objective functions are maximizing the customer satisfaction degree and minimizing the transportation cost. Then the hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed and the test result indicates that our algorithm is effective to solve such multi-objective vehicle scheduling problem.

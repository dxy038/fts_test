This paper present a combined field orientation and backstepping control. This method is an elegant approach for nonlinear super twisting sliding-mode control of an induction motor. The objective is to improve the speed control, the rotor flux control and the rejection of load torque disturbances and parameter variations. Simulation results are given to show the performance obtained with this kind of control strategy into account parameters variation.

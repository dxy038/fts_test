A novel multi-objective optimization based particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the global optimization problem for based services selecting in Web services composition technology. This algorithm takes Web services selection as a multi-objective constrained optimization problem with constraints. It introduces multi-objective PSO intelligent theory to optimize multi parameters simultaneously, and produces a set of constraints to meet the Pareto optimal solution. The experiments show that the algorithm is a feasible and efficient method for Web services selection.

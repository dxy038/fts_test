Low-power design looks for low-energy BIST. This paper considers the problem of minimizing the energy required to test a BISTed combinational circuit without modifying the stuck-at fault coverage and with no extra area or delay overhead over the classical LFSR architectures. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, is to analyze the impact of the polynomial and seed selection of the LFSR used as TPG on the energy consumed by the circuit. It is shown that appropriately selecting the seed of the LFSR can lead to an important energy reduction. Second, is to propose a method to significantly decrease the energy consumption of BIST sessions. For this purpose, a heuristic method based on a simulated annealing algorithm is briefly described in this paper. Experimental results using the ISCAS benchmark circuits are reported, showing variations of the weighted switching activity ranging from 147% to 889% according to the seed selected for the LFSR. Note that these results are always obtained with no loss of stuck-at fault coverage

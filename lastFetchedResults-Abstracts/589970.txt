Due to diversity of climates across the world and different conditions of food preservation, amounts of micro-nutrients and macro-nutrients are always subject to uncertainty. The quantity of a nutrient contained in a food can never be precisely determined and a certain value cannot be assigned to it. This uncertainty about numbers and values in medical references causes the decisions on nutrition diets based on confident data to be far from reality. The objective of the current paper is to prepare and prescribe an optimal diet in fuzzy environment. The case study was carried out on hepatitis patients owing to significance of nourishment for these individuals. Taking into account the calorific and protein-rich diet for such patients, the research problem which appears in the form of a fuzzy linear programming problem with two target functions including maximization of daily calorie and protein amounts was modeled and solved using a suitable method. Finally, through implementation of diet in fuzzy environment, acceptable results were achieved because these values are more realistic because of considering all possible states.

The local mechanical signals driving bone formation during repair are not well understood. An algorithm was developed to predict the microstructural adaptation of newly formed trabecular bone to mechanical stimuli utilizing an objective function based on strain energy density (SED) gradient. Bone formation on a collagen sponge implanted in a mechanically-active bone chamber was simulated. Predicted results demonstrating increased trabecular connectivity, thickening, and orientation agree well with experimental observations. The utility of these methods to design mechanically appropriate scaffold architectures is being explored

The author describes the practical implementation of a low-cost, point-to-point, digital system which makes possible the bidirectional transmission of 2048-kb/s or 8448-kb/s data streams over a pair of multimode or single-mode optical fibers. The modular design approach allows the equipment to be configured for a variety of distance requirements and optical wavelengths. Comprehensive supervisory facilities, utilizing a novel method of performance and alarm status transfer between local and remote stations, provide efficient link management

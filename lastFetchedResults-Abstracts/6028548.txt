To improve the performances of the parallel 6-axis force sensor with Stewart platform, the paper plots the indices atlases based on the screw theory and the theory of physical model of the solution space, and summaries the laws how the structure parameters affect the indices. Then, the sizable parallel 6-axis force sensorÂ´s structure parameters are optimized in nonlinear single objective and multi-objective respectively, in order to obtain better performances than that of the initial ones. So, the powerful basis and method are raised for design and optimization of the sizable parallel Stewart platform 6-axis force sensor with general spherical joint.

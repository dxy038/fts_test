Cloud computing has become an promising and popular prototype, by presenting its different popular paradigm as infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service. Now a days there is a challenge of building scalable, available, consistent Cloud Data Stores. In this paper, data partitioning approach such as static and dynamic partitioning are discussed. The main objective of this paper is to bring out the issues in the area of database scalability and to discuss the opportunities open for research work. In this paper, taxonomy of data management in Cloud is proposed. This paper also introduces the design model for partitioning scheme.

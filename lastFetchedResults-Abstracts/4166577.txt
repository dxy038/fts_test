This paper presents a novel adaptive Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for the optimal tuning of fuzzy controlled servo systems characterized by second-order models with an integral component and variable parameters. The objective functions consist of the output sensitivity functions of the sensitivity models defined with respect to the parametric variations of the processes. The proposed adaptive GSA solves the optimization problems resulting in a new generation of Takagi-Sugeno proportional-integral fuzzy controllers (T-S PI-FCs) with a reduced time constant sensitivity. A design method for T-S PI-FCs is then proposed and experimentally validated in the representative case study of the optimal tuning of T-S PI-FCs for the position control system of a servo system.

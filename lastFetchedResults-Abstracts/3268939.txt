To make full use of the damping control capability of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) and simultaneously minimize the detrimental impact on torsional oscillations of DFIGs. A hybrid power modulation PSS (HPM-PSS) combining both reactive power modulation (RPM) and active power modulation (APM) using the same feedback input signal is first proposed. Here the RPM part has the priority as it has little influence on torsional oscillations of DFIGs and APM part is complementary to further increase system damping to the objective value. Then a step by step optimization algorithm is developed to tune HPM-PSS parameters. The effectiveness of HPM-PSS is demonstrated by time-domain simulations and Prony analysis under different operation states and power control modes of the DFIG in a two-area test system.

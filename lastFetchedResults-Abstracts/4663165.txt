The World Wide Web is serving as a leading vehicle for information dissemination by offering information services, such as product information, group interactions, or sales transactions. Three major factors affect the performance and reliability of information services for the Web: the distribution of information which has resulted from the globalization of information systems, the heterogeneity of information sources, and the sourcesÂ´ instability caused by their autonomous evolution. This paper focuses on integrating existing information sources, available via the Web, in the delivery of information services. The primary objective of the paper is to provide mechanisms for structuring and maintaining a domain model for Web applications. These mechanisms are based on conceptual modeling techniques, where concepts are being defined and refined within a meta-data repository through the use of instantiation, generalization and attribution. Also, active databases techniques are exploited to provide robust mechanisms for maintaining a consistent domain model in a rapidly evolving environment, such as the Web.

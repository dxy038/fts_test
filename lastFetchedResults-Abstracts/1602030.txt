In automotive industry, structural optimization for crashworthiness criteria is of special importance in the early design stage. To reduce the vehicle design cycle, metamodeling techniques have become so widespread... In this study, a time-based metamodeling technique is proposed for the vehicle design. The characteristics of the proposed method are the construction of a time-based objective function and establishment of a metamodel by support vector regression (SVR). Compared with other popular metamodel-based optimization methods, the design space of the proposed method is expanded to time domain. Thus, more information and features can be extracted in the expanded time domain. To validate the performance of the time-based metamodeling technique, cylinder impacting and full vehicle frontal collision are optimized by the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has potential capability to solve the crashworthiness vehicle design.

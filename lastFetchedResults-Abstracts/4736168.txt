This paper introduces single shaft micro gas turbine and permanent magnet synchronous machine(PMSM) structure and characteristics, presents a dynamic model of micro gas turbine distributed generation for connected operation base on PWM bidirectional voltage converter. Permanent magnet synchronous machine side and AC side convertersÂ´ control systems are designed, these control schemes can control permanent magnet synchronous machine speed and DC voltage. Simulation results show this model can simulate micro gas turbine dynamic characteristic, whole system can meet load power demand.

In this work, a neural-based approach for inverse problems in the field of electromagnetic devices design is presented. A multilayer perceptron neural network is first trained to solve the analysis problem of the studied system. As a design problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, i.e., starting from the design requirements the optimal values of the design parameters have to be obtained, the input of the neural network will correspond to the design parameters while the output is the objective function of the optimization problem. In this work, a procedure is presented which performs the inversion of the trained neural network when the design requirements are assigned to the output.

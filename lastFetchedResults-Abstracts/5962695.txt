The purpose of this paper is to investigate and characterize the performance of a space-diversity DS-CDMA receiver, consisting of four antennas, in an experimental radio channel. The objective is to compare different signal processing techniques on experimental data and to evaluate their performances in term of diversity and co-channel interference. The antenna array is composed of three printed antennas and one monopole. The chip rate is equal to 12.5 Mchip/s and the spreading factor is fixed to 31. The modulation scheme is BPSK.

In this paper, a mathematical programming model is established for hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem, with the minimum of the makespan as the objective function. Based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, a distributed approach according to the process is presented to solve the global problem. Compared with the references, the experimental results indicate that the distributed approach performs better on improving computing and searching speed and being feasible and effective on global optimum.

The traditional wavelet edge detection algorithm doesnÂ´t ideal processing effects for the salt &amp; pepper noised images. In allusion to this shortcoming, an improved wavelet multi-scale edge detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Morphology is assimilated into the wavelet detection, and an objective data evaluation is given. Compared with the traditional method, the related coefficient of the improved algorithm is higher, and the distortion degree is reduced. It can effectively filter the salt &amp; pepper noise, improve the accuracy of edge detection, and achieve an ideal effect of edge detection.

Objectives. This study sought to investigate the angiographic or intracoronary Doppler variables of stenosis severity that best correlate with the results of dipyridamole echocardiography.

Background. Quantitative coronary angiography and intracoronary Doppler flow velocity assessments are the commonly used techniques for the objective identification of significant coronary artery stenosis.

Methods. Thirty patients with an isolated lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were studied by means of on-line quantitative coronary arteriography, intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements and dipyridamole echocardiography 6 months after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The quantitative arteriographic analyses were performed on-line; post-stenotic Doppler flow velocities were measured at baseline and after adenosine infusion. Angiographic and Doppler measurements were compared with the corresponding dipyridamole echocardiographic dat and analyzed by discriminant analysis.

Results. The dipyridamole echocardiographic response was positive in 11 patients (37%). The best cutoff values for predicting an abnormal echocardiographic response were 1) stenotic flow reserve of 2.8 (p = 0.0001); 2) 59% diameter stenosis (p = 0.0001); 3) minimal lumen diameter of 1.35 mm (p = 0.001); 4) coronary flow reserve of 2.0 (p = 0.0002); and 5) maximal peak velocity of 60 cm/s during hyperemi (p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified stenotic flow reserve as the only independent predictor of ischemi during dipyridamole echocardiography.

Conclusions. Stenotic flow reserve is the variable that best describes the functional significance of an isolated LAD lesion, and  value of 2.8 is the best predictor of  positive dipyridamole echocardiographic response. Furthermore, angiographic variables of stenosis severity relate to echocardiographic test results better than intracoronary Doppler variables.

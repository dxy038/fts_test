The acceptance rate was 80% (n=48) and discontinuation rate was 20%(n=12). In these 12 cases, expulsion of device, pelvic inflammatory disease and no improvement in the condition was seen in 10%(n=6), 3.3%(n=2) and 6.6%(n=4) respectively. At follow up 3.3%(n=8) women had irregular period while 73.3%(n=44) were amenrroheic and13.33%(n=8) women had regular period at the end of one year.

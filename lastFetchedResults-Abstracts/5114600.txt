This paper presents a technique for classifying skin abnormalities using oblique-incidence diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The objective is to provide a non-invasive computer-assisted tool to dermatologists for lowering the number of unnecessary biopsies. A high accuracy of detection (95%) has been obtained.

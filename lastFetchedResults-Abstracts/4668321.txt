This study investigates the infrared radiant characteristics of human acupoints and meridian-like structure by use of infrared thermal imaging. Thirty healthy youth volunteers are studied in our experiment. We find that human acupoints and meridian-like structure can be visualized or revealed in the infrared spectrum range in some of them under natural condition. The infrared radiant tracks of meridian courses over body surface coincide or basically coincide with that of human meridians described by the traditional Chinese medicine textbook. The facts show evidence for the objective existence of acupuncture meridians structure in human body. The results suggest that infrared radiant track along human meridian courses is a normal vital and physiological phenomenon appearing in human being.

In this paper, maximum wind power tracking is achieved without wind measuring. The controller design procedures are split up into two individual steps: i) Determine the objective states from the desired output equation and the constraints related to system equations; ii) determine the control feedback gains by solving a set of LMIs based on Lyapnouv method. By doing so, beneficial control features of high performance, exponential convergency, and smooth control signal can be achieved.

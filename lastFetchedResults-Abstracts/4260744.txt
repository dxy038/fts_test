Fog Computing is a new architecture to migrate some data centerÂ´s tasks to the edge of the server. The fog computing, built on the edge servers, is viewed as a novel architecture that provides the limited computing, storing, and networking services in the distributed way between end devices and the traditional cloud computing Data Centers. It provides the logical intelligence to the end devices and filters the data for Data Centers. The primary objective of fog computing is to ensure the low and predictable latency in the latency-sensitive of Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as the healthcare services. This paper discusses the characteristics of fog computing and services that fog computing can provide in the healthcare system and its prospect.

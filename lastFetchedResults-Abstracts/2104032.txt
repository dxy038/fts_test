The objective of this pilot study was to compare the cytokine profile as well as cell-mediated and antibody responses of foals infected with a low inoculum of virulent Rhodococcus equi resulting in subclinical pneumonia to that of foals infected with a high inoculum resulting in severe clinical pneumonia. The mean (±SD) ratio of post-infection to pre-infection anti-R. equi IgG(T) concentration was significantly (P = 0.002) higher in foals infected with the high inoculum (195 ± 145; range 62–328) compared to foals infected with the low inoculum (3.9 ± 4.5; range 0.5–11). Similarly, mean (±SD) ratio of post-infection to pre-infection IgM concentration was significantly (P = 0.002) higher in foals infected with the high inoculum (12 ± 4.0; range 7.4–14) compared to foals infected with the low inoculum (2.5 ± 1.5; range 1.2–4.7). Proliferative responses to R. equi antigens as well as expression of mRNA for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ in BLN were not significantly different between the two groups. There was a tendency (P = 0.073) towards a higher IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio in the low inoculum group. This study demonstrates that the size of inoculum modulates the IgG subisotype response and possibly the cytokine profile of foals.

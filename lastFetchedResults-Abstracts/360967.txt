Study objective: We investigated the types of patient presentations that cause senior house officers (SHOs) most difficulty during their tenure in emergency departments and report the extent to which such difficulties are related to SHOs' communication problems, stress, or perceived lack of skills or knowledge. Methods: We conducted a questionnaire survey of 171 newly appointed SHOs employed in 27 EDs in the South Thames region of England. Subjects were asked to describe the presentation that gave them greatest difficulty during three subsequent shifts at the end of the first and fourth months of their ED appointment. Results: A total of 132 (77%) and 110 (64%) respondents returned questionnaires at the end of the first and fourth months, respectively; 61% (105) responded to both questionnaires. The respondents described 537 of a possible total of 726 cases (74%). Communication problems caused difficulty in 406 (76%) cases, SHOs' experience of stress in 352 (66%) cases, and a perceived lack of knowledge or skills in 281 (52%) cases. Communication problems and the experience of stress occurred in 141 (26%) cases. Patients presenting with mental or behavioral disorders and symptoms most frequently gave rise to communication problems, perceived lack of skills, and the experience of stress. The difficulties described at the two time periods were very similar indicating that experience alone had little effect on these problems. Conclusion: ED SHOs may benefit from communication skills training, the opportunity to review difficult case presentations, and the alleviation of organizational stress factors.

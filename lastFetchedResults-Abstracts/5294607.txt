An optimization method for the design of constant delay recursive digital filters is presented. The stability problem associated with current recursive-filter optimization algorithms is handled within the objective function which specifies the amplitude and phase characteristics simultaneously. Minimizing this objective function using specific starting points yields filter designs that satisfy arbitrary amplitude and phase specifications to within a preset degree of accuracy

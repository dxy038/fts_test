Interference between near communication links is characterized and investigated in this paper. The conflicting expected features of target uniform (or weighted) illumination and energy confinement for an antenna define an optimal Pareto curve. This tradeoff is quantified for a broadband offset reflector antenna using the multi-objective optimization algorithm of efficient directions. This algorithm is very suitable for this application, since it implicitly applies an optimality condition in its formulation and always improve the solution after one iteration. A radiation discontinuity is ideally desired in the borders of the target region, which is impossible due to physical constraints. This work analyzes how close to this utopian radiation pattern a real antenna can get.

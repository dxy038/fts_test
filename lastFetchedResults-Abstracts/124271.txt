Objective: Recent studies show that increase chromosomal abnormalities observed in children conceived through ICSI is not due to ICSI procedure or technique itself, but rather it due to material used during ICSI procedure. Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of PVP routinely used during ICSI procedure on sperm membrane integrity and sperm chromatin status.
Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 21 semen samples from patients referring to Isfahan Fertility and Infertility Center. Processed semen samples were divided into two portions. Equal volume of PVP 10% was added to one of portion and Ham's F10 was added to the other portion as a control group.
Hypo-Osmotic Swelling Test (HOST), SDS, and SDS+EDTA were carried out on control and the PVP treatment groups at 15, 30, 60 minutes after addition of PVP. Results: The result showed that sperm membrane integrity measured by HOST and sperm chromatin stability measured by SDS test reduces with increase exposure to PVP. However, sperm chromatin decondensation ability evaluated with SDS+EDTA procedure did not show any change with increased exposure to PVP.
Conclusion: This study suggests that during ICSI procedure is best to reduce the exposure time to PVP.

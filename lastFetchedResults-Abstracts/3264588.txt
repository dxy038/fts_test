Emergency load shedding for preventing frequency degradation is an established practice all over the world. The objective of load shedding is to balance load and generation. This paper presents a methodology to develop a reliable load shedding scheme, to prevent black-outs while maintaining stability in power systems with high variability and uncertainty under any abnormal condition. The technique proposes the sequence and conditions of applications of different load shedding schemes and islanding strategies. The effectiveness of the developed scheme was investigated by simulating different abnormal conditions in the power system of Sri Lanka.

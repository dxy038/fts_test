Making construction scheme of deep foundation pit is related to many factors, such as the geotechnical and hydrogeology conditions, the layout of existing buildings, the type of retaining structure as well as main structure, and construction method etc., and is difficulty for choice among multi-schemes and multi-objectives. A case deep foundation pit of an apartment block in Wuhan was studied for decision-making of retaining structures, in which four retaining schemes and eight evaluation factors were discussed, the multi-objective decision matrix is standardized and normalized and Entropy Method model is applied. The method makes the decision-making process more scientific and reasonable.

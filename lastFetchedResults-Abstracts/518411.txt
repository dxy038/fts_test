The paper deals with optimal tuning of a Proportional-Integral- Derivative (PID) controller used in a high performance drilling system for controlling the output obtained and hence to minimize the integral of absolute errors (IAE). The main objective is to obtain a stable, robust and controlled system by tuning the PID controller using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The incurred value is compared with the traditional tuning techniques like Ziegler-Nichols and is proved better. Hence the results establishes that tuning the PID controller using PSO technique gives less overshoot, system is less sluggish and reduces the IAE.

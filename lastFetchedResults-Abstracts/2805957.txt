The paper introduced an audiobook Pingfan de Shijie with plentiful information of emotions. Via the emotion labeling of more than 6000 sentences respectively depending on context and audio, the commonalities and differences of the two layers of annotation were checked from two aspects: whether the sentences are neutral or un-neutral, and which emotional categories these sentences belong to. The results show that the subjective sentences in text layer can be read as neutral speech sentences, while large amount of objective sentences in text layer must be read as effective speech sentences. Finally, the causes to the annotation difference were analyzed and considerations in the process of emotional modeling from text to speech in speech synthesis were raised by this paper.

The main objective of this paper is to enumerate the economic threats of Prophet Mohammad’s era and to derive his conduct in dealing with them. In this paper, adopting an analytical-descriptive method, using library sources, and drawing on Quran and historical verses and sources, we have enumerated the threats of the Prophet’s era as following: the socio-economic sanctions of Shib (Valley of) Abu Talib, the confiscation of Muslims’ properties and assets, the siege of Quraysh and the commercial constraints made on them, the military-economic blockade by the Ahzab, and the threat of making economic sanctions on the part of the Hypocrites. Then, by taking advantage of the grounded-theory qualitative analysis method, the concepts and categories of the Prophet’s conduct in dealing with each of the above-mentioned economic threats are driven. The final model of the Prophet’s conduct includes four main categories and thirty one general concepts, and is focused on achieving these goals: confronting with the threats and creating a situation suitable for immunizing the economy against the economic threats. In this model, the economic strategies and infrastructures and culture-making constitute the necessary condition for confronting with the threats. Also, planning to reach this goal, by making the anticipation, preventing, defending, and confronting with the threat, plays the role of removing the barriers in order to deal with it. These two sets make a chain that leads to confronting with the threat. In the end, we have mentioned some suggestions and policy implications of the conduct of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) for dealing with the current economic threats to the Islamic Republic of Iran.

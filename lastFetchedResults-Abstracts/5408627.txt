Bus is the most popular public transportation mode due to high loading capacity and low infrastructure requirement. Because operation time is long, bus transit system is required to run in a green manner. In this paper a transit fleet replacement model is developed to make vehicle purchase and retirement decisions under environmental and technological constraints. The overall objective is to find cost-minimizing strategies under reduction goals for various pollutants. A case is proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the model can provide strategies for fleet owners or government administrators to deal with the issues of sustainable transit system.

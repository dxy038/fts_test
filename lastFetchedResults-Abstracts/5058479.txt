Hybrid differential evolution is applied to estimate the kinetic model parameters of batch fermentation for ethanol and glycerol production using Saccharomyces diastaticus LORRE 316. In this study, we consider the worst observed error for all experiments as an objective function so that the parameter estimation problem becomes a min-max estimation problem. Several methods have been employed to solve the min-max estimation problem for comparison. The proposed method can use a small population size to obtain a more satisfactory solution as compared from these computations. In order to validate the kinetic model, we have carried out the fedbatch experiments with an optimal feed rate. The experimental data can fit the computed results satisfactorily

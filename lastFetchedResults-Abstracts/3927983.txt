In this paper, the concept and implementation of field-orientation control (FOC) of a doubly excited brushless reluctance machine (DEBRM) for variable-speed drives and generating systems are presented. A stator-flux-orientation scheme is employed to achieve decoupled control of torque and reactive power. A 2 HP DEBRM prototype system with a digital signal processor (DSP)-based controller and a bidirectional power converter is built to verify the theoretical analysis. Computer simulation and laboratory experimental results are shown in excellent agreement

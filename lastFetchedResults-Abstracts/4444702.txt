In the era of ubiquitous service, the new service opportunity is closely related to user. User-centric approach takes into account user context in new service development. However, attempts to apply user context is insufficient to identify opportunities, since the opportunity is at least userÂ´s potential needs, which are not satisfied yet. In response, this paper proposes a &#8220;user-centric service map&#8221; to visualize existing services based on a priori dictionary of potential needs and investigates the vacuum to take concrete shape of the opportunities. At first, a potential needs dictionary is constructed as location, event and objective. Next, the service map is developed based on the evaluation of existing services from Apple App Store for each dimension. Finally, a new service opportunity is identified by analyzing the characteristics of vacuums of the service map and exploring how to satisfy the vacuums using related services for reference.

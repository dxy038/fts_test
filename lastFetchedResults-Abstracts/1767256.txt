The objective of the study was to examine the effects that fluoride ions released from different dental glass ionomer cements may have on titanium. The study included determination of the amounts of released ions and measurement of the color changes on titanium plates cemented with four kinds of commercial glass ionomer cements due to immersion of such “sandwich specimens” in 1% saline (NaCl) solution. The discoloration of titanium in the presence of glass ionomer cements was observed. In addition, for specimens cemented with two of the cements titanium ions were found in the solution after immersion. The results of the present study show that a low concentration of released fluoride ions and other elements from glass ionomer cements may cause aesthetic problems of discoloration of titanium restorations and appliances.

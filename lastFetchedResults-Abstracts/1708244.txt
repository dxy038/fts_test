Recently, joints combining shrink fit with anaerobic adhesives (bonded shrink fitted joint) have been appeared in order to increase the joint strength. This paper deals with stress analysis and strength estimation of the bonded shrink fitted joints in which a ring is fitted at the end of a hollow shaft subjected to torsion. The objective of the paper is to examine the effect of fitted position on the characteristics of the bonded shrink fitted joints. The stress distributions at the interface of the joints are analyzed using axisymmetric theory of elasticity. The effects of outer diameter, height and stiffness of the ring on the interface stress distributions are examined in the numerical calculations. In numerical calculations, it is found that a rupture of adhesive layer initiates from the edge of the interfaces close to the end of the shaft to which a torsional load is applied. Using the interface stress distributions, joint strength was predicted. Furthermore, experiments to measure the joint strength were carried out. The numerical results of the joint strength show more conservative values than the experimental results. In addition, the stress distributions in the present study are compared with those in which a ring is fitted at the middle of a shaft. It is found that the effect of shrink fitted position is negligibly small and the strength of the bonded shrink fitted joints is greater than that of shrink fitted joints without adhesives.

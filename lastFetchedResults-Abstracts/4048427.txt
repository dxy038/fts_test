Objective evaluation results using optometric device to measure accommodative responses in viewing a real object and integral imaging are presented. From the empirical results between the real object and an integrated three-dimensional (3D) image, we find that over 73% of participants keep eyes on the real integrated 3D image instead of a display panel. The results also show the participants do not recognize a mismatch between the accommodative response and the convergence of the eye, which used to be believed as one of the major factors to cause visual fatigue in viewing near-distance integral imaging. Seventy-one normal adult subjects (23 ~ 38 years old) participated in the experiment, and accommodative response measurement results of the real integrated image show a statistically significant concordance with real objects.

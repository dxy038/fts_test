Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) made it possible to perform a number of medical manipulations with reduced patient trauma and better accuracy. Various devices, including tactile sensors, have been developed in recent years to enhance the quality of this procedure. The objective of this paper is to review the latest advancements and challenges in the development of tactile sensing devices designed for surgical applications. In particular, the focus is on palpation and probing devices that can be potentially used in RMIS. In addition, we explore the aspects that should be taken into account when designing tactile sensors for RMIS, incorporating biological inspiration of tactile sensing, features of manual palpation, requirements of RMIS. We provide an overview of recommendations for the development of tactile sensing devices, especially in the context of RMIS.

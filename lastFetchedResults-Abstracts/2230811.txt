Background: Endometriosis is a female health disorder that occurs when cells from the lining of the uterus grow in other areas of the body. The cause of endometriosis is unknown. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate TP53 gene codon 72 polymorphism in women with endometriosis and compared it with healthy samples in Isfahan. Materials and Methods: We undertook a case-control study to examine the possible association of the TP53 gene codon 72 polymorphism with the risk of endometriosis in Isfahan. Ninety whole blood specimens from normal people as controls and ninety endometriosis specimens were analyzed. p53 codon 72 genotypes were identified using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results: Frequency of genotype Arg/Arg (Arginine/Arginine) in the samples of endometriosis was 28.9% and in healthy samples 42.2%. Frequency of genotype Pro/Pro (Proline/Proline) in the samples of endometriosis was 15.6% and in healthy ones. Frequency of heterozygote's Arg/Pro was 55.6% in endometriosis samples and 54.45% in healthy ones 3.3%. By comparing statistical genotype Pro/Pro with two other genotypes in both groups there was a statistical meaningful difference between control group and endometriosis group. [p=0.009, CI=95%, OR=5.34 (1047-19.29)]. Conclusion: Recent research shows that genotype Pro/Pro codon72 exon4 TP53 gene may be one predisposing genetic factor for endometriosis in Isfahan.

Background and Objective: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) is an enzyme which supports the cell membrane against oxidant agents. Acute deficiency of enzyme activity in G-6-PD deficient individuals, due to sensitivity of red blood cells membrane to the oxidative agents, leads to haemolytic anemia. There are some reports showing that diabetic patients are at the risk of G-6-PD deficiency. Thus the object of this clinical study was to investigate the percent of hyperglycemia in individuals who are G-6-PD deficient.

Subjects and Methods: One hudred and forty three patients (men and women in all ages) with G-6-PD deficiency were studied. In order to confirm the G-6-PD deficiency, Butler test was used, and then Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) was determined by enzymatic method. Analytical studies were done by means of descriptive tables and, Pearson correlation tests.

Results: The mean concentration of FBS was 99.35 mg/dl which is within the normal range (70-100mg/dl). In 86 G-6-PD deficient individuals (60.2 %) FBS was within the normal range and in 57 (39.8%) G-6-PD deficient individuals FBS was higher than normal range.(normal range = 70100 mg/dl) The mean FBS in men was not significantly different from women (P=0.7). There is no significant correlation between FBS and age in both sexes.

Conclusion: The results of this study suggest a realation between G-6-PD deficiency and diabetes mellitus; however more researches are required to clarify all aspects of this correlation.

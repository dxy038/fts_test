This paper takes into account the effect of the transfer of power grid operation mode during the study on reactive power optimization control. And it is proposed that a multi-objective reactive power optimization model including transformer stalls, constraints in the operation mode transfer process, the reactor and so on. The iterative algorithm of optimization and power flow calculation is used to calculate it. The case studies validate the proposed algorithm is effective and robust.

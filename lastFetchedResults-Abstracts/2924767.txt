This paper presents the results of a theoretical and experimental study conducted to investigate the influence of varying the size of the air gap of a three-phase five-horsepower induction motor, on the performance and cost optimization of the machine. From an operational point of a view, the main objective of this investigation was to assess the influence of increasing the size of the air gap on the performance characteristics and the parameters of the circuit model of a small three phase machine, with a particular emphasis on the power factor and efficiency of the machine under various operating conditions. From a cost optimization point of view, the objective was to establish a cost minimization method as a function of the size of the air gap, with specific restraints on the power factor, losses and efficiency, as determined by the performance criteria

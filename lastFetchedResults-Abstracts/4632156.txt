Transmission system operators are governed by operational security standards that are applied in real time. During system disturbances, the system operators must rely on the installed protection and control equipment, prior to human intervention. New power electronic solutions bring rapid and repeatable responses to disturbances, which will help system operators to guarantee a stable system. Last year, ALSTOM completed the world´s first competitively bid STATCOM to support the voltage on National Grid´s 400 kV network that supplies London and the Southeast from the north of the UK. It is rated &#177;75 MVAr and forms part of a static VAr system (SVS) with a total rating of 0 to 225 MVAr. This paper describes the reasons for its size, location, its chain-link configuration and gives examples of its operating performance. The paper also describes the features that allow this STATCOM to deliver much more than reactive compensation in support of a wider transmission service objective, as system conditions require

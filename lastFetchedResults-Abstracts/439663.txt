Background. The presence of specific risk factors can increase the postoperative complication rate of pneumonectomy for destroyed lung.

Methods. Our experience in 118 consecutive patients who underwent pneumonectomy for destroyed lung over a 10-year period was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effect of specific risk factors on postoperative complications. The significance of tuberculosis, right pneumonectomy, preoperative empyema, and duration of illness longer than 36 months was examined by univariate analyses.

Results. The most common underlying diseases were nonspecific bronchiectasis (n = 52) and tuberculosis (n = 43). Sixty-day or in-hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 11.9% and 5.9%, respectively. The combined morbidity and mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with preoperative empyema (p < 0.003), tuberculosis (p < 0.03), and right pneumonectomy (p < 0.03). The prevalence of bronchopleural fistula was higher in patients with preoperative empyema (p < 0.02) and patients with tuberculosis (p < 0.03).

Conclusions. The postoperative complication rate of pneumonectomy for destroyed lung is acceptably low. However, it is increased by preoperative empyema, tuberculosis, and right-sided resection.

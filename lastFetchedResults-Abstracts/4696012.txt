Road disaster monitoring and early-warning system (RDMES) plays an important role in reducing road disaster losses and protecting the personal safety of roads. The traditional methods of monitoring and early-warning information dissemination are generally based on server/client model, but the system performance and stability can not be guaranteed when a large amount of real-time data need to be processed or a large number of clients need to access the server. The objective of this paper is to present a new method of monitoring and early-warning information dissemination based on peer-to-peer network (PPRDMES), which can improve the overall stability of the system and reduce dependence on central server. In this paper the data of soil slop in western Changchun was selected as the case study examples. Results show that the proposed method is efficient, stable and reliable.

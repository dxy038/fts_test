Previously, kinetic and kinematic data were collected during a shoulder exercise using an impulse-momentum exercise system. This device utilizes inertial loads created by a weighted shuttle (22.2 N) traveling on a rail system and assimilates repetitive concentric-acceleration and eccentric-deceleration throughout the exercise. In the current study, the objective was to quantify the shoulder joint mechanics resulting from this instrumented exercise system when used as a rehabilitative tool. Inverse dynamic relationships were used to quantify the forces and moments acting on the shoulder joint throughout the exercise. Work and power were also compared between shoulder function and shuttle motion

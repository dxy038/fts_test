This paper mainly deals with task scheduling of multi-satellite parallel test with priority under uncertainty. The robustness of the schedule is so important that it must be considered to avoid delay. On the base of the definition of two robustness measures of a schedule, the problem is formulated into a bi-objective model with objectives of makespan minimization and robustness maximization. Furthermore, an algorithm for robust task scheduling of multi-satellite parallel test is proposed to solve the bi-objective model. The experiment justifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our model and algorithm to solve this problem.

Box trainers equipped with sensors may help in acquiring objective information about a traineeÂ´s performance while performing training tasks with real instruments. The main aim of this study is to investigate the added value of force parameters with respect to commonly used motion and time parameters such as path length, motion volume, and task time. Two new dynamic bimanual positioning tasks were developed that not only requiring adequate motion control but also appropriate force control successful completion. Force and motion data for these tasks were studied for three groups of participants with different experience levels in laparoscopy (i.e., 11 novices, 19 intermediates, and 12 experts). In total, 10 of the 13 parameters showed a significant difference between groups. When the data from the significant motion, time, and force parameters are used for classification, it is possible to identify the skills level of the participants with 100% accuracy. Furthermore, the force parameters of many individuals in the intermediate group exceeded the maximum values in the novice and expert group. The relatively high forces used by the intermediates argue for the inclusion of training and assessment of force application during tissue handling in future laparoscopic skills training programs.

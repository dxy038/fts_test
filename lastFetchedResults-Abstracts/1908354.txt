Objective
ess the feasibility of hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) for large renal masses (stage T2, mean size 9.7 cm) and compare outcomes with a similar cohort undergoing open radical nephrectomy (ORN).
s
andomized comparison of 19 consecutive patients who underwent nephrectomy for renal masses ≥7 cm was performed. The HALN group was compared to the ORN group regarding demographic parameters and perioperative data, including blood loss, operating time, narcotic usage, hematocrit change, return to standard oral intake, length of hospital stay, and complications. Data collected prospectively and statistics used 2-tailed t-test analysis.
s
ts underwent either ORN (mean tumor size 12.3 cm) or HALN (mean tumor size 9.7cm). Tumors up to 14 cm (n = 2) and pT3b, with renal vein thrombosis (n = 2), could be safely excised with HALN. There were no differences between the HALN and ORN groups regarding any demographic parameter. Blood loss, operating time, length of stay, parenteral narcotic use, and time to tolerating regular diet were all less statistically significant in the HALN group as compared to the ORN group (P &lt; 0.05). Tumors &gt;15 cm necessitated ORN.
sions
s technically feasible even for tumors with mean size &gt;9.5 cm. There is a significant advantage to HALN over ORN regarding the intraoperative and postoperative morbidity. Tumors ≥15 cm should, in most cases, be performed with an open approach.

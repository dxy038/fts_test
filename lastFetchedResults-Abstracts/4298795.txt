To scientifically assess the Hi-tech companies´ competitive strength is the premise and foundation of effectively improving their competitiveness. This paper uses the methods of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) and selects the 14 industries´ data from the state taxation investigation jointly carried out by the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration in 2007 as samples. It appraises the Hi-tech companies´ competitiveness from three aspects: asset deployment status, profit-making capability and innovation ability, and in this way, eliminates the assessment s non-objectivity and non-fairness induced by the inadequate objective requisites. This paper improves the scientificalness, rationality and accuracy of the Hi-tech companies´ competitiveness assessment from the aspects both of the model and the index.

The current study centers around a numerical investigation of natural convection heat transfer within a two-dimensional, horizontal annulus that is partially filled with a fluid-saturated porous medium. In addition, the porous sleeve is considered to be press fitted to the inner surface of the outer cylinder. Both cylinders are maintained at constant and uniform temperatures with the inner cylinder being subjected to a relatively higher temperature than the outer one. Moreover, the Forchheimer and Brinkman effects are taken into consideration when simulating the fluid motion inside the porous sleeve. Furthermore, the local thermal equilibrium condition is assumed to be applicable for the current investigation. The working fluid is air while copper is used to represent the solid phase. The porosity is considered to be uniform and constant with ε = 0.9. The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of the porous sleeve on the buoyancy induced flow motion under steady-state condition. Such an effect is studied using the following dimensionless parameters: Pr = 0.05–50, Ra = 102–106 and Da = 10−4–10−6. Also, the study highlights the effect of the dimensionless porous sleeve thickness (b) and thermal conductivity ratio (ks/kf) in the range between 1.1–1.9 and 1–150, respectively.

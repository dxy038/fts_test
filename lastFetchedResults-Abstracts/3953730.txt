Procedures for empirical parameter variation analysis are presented which should be useful in practical programs of design analysis and reliability improvement for electronic circuits. The objective of the technique is to estimate the effect that drifts in component-part parameters will have upon circuit performance. This estimate is obtained by application of formal statistical and/or worst-case analysis methods in conjunction with systematically made circuit ``breadboard´´ measurements and data from component-part test programs. The mathematical basis for the technique is presented, along with a description of methods to simulate part-parameter drifts and other suggestions for conducting the required breadboard measurements.

An improved objective function has been added to the Kernighan-Lin (1970), Fiduccia-Mattheyses (1982) (KLFM) partitioning algorithm. The time complexity of the enhanced KLFM algorithm remains linear in the number of pins, and there is essentially no change in the CPU time requirements. Based on circuit bipartitioning tests with ten industrial circuits, the number of nets cut was reduced by as much as 55% with the new objective function. The average reduction in nets cut was 38%.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

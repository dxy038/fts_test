Background and Aim: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common medical problems in pregnant women. Nutrition plays an important role in the prevention and control of this disease. Some studies have found a relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and food insecurity. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between food insecurity and GDM.

Material and Methods: : This case-control study included 274 pregnant women (137 GDM cases and 137 healthy controls) selected by convenience sampling. Data on the subjectsâ€™ food insecurity, demographic features and physical activity (MET) were collected by interviewing and their heights and weights measured. For the analysis of the data, the Chi-square test, independent sample t-test and multivariate and univariate logistic regression tests were used, the statistical software being SPSS 16.0.

Results: On the whole, 18.2% and 21.9% of the women in the case and control groups suffered from food insecurity, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the case and control groups with regard to a previous history of pregnancy, a family history of diabetes in the first and second degree relatives, and a history of giving birth to a baby weighing over 4 kgs.

Further analysis of the data showed a family history of diabetes mellitus and a low socio-economic status to be independent risk factors for GDB.

Conclusion: No statistically significant difference was observed between food insecurity of the women and gestational diabetes mellitus in this study. Despite this finding, considering that there are associations between food insecurity and other types of diabetes mellitus, we recommend further studies on this subject to be able to either accept or reject the hypothesis on the association between food insecurity and gestational diabetes mellitus.

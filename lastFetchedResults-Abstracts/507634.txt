Introduction and objective: Otomycosis is a fungal infection of external auditory meatus. The acute form of the disease causes secretion and pruritus. The usual prescribed medicines for otomycosis are topical clotrimazole 1%, amphotericin B and otosporin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with isopropyl alcohol and acetic acid for otomycosis.
Materials and methods: In the present study 910 patients examined and those suspected to have otomycosis referred to medical mycology laboratory of Golabchi, Kashan. A questionnaire was also filled for each patient. Both direct and culture examinations were used to confirm otomycosis in the patients. Then the patients were treated with the mixture of isopropyl alcohol+acetic acid. 
Results: Out of 910 examined patients, 60 patients were suspected to have otomycosis and referred to medical mycology lab. Mycological examinations confirmed otomycosis in 52 patients (86.7%). Most of the patients (78.8%) were cured perfectly after therapy with the mixture of alcohol and acetic acid. After three weeks, in addition to elimination of clinical signs further smear showed no sign of disease. However in four patients there was a relapse of the disease.
Conclusion: Due to therapeutic effect of the mixture of isopropyl alcohol and acetic acid for otomycosis, its low side effects and low rate of relapse, it is recommended to use this mixture for the treatment of otomycosis.

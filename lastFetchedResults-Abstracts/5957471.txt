This work developed a modeling for simulation of a supervising and management system for hybrid energy systems. The modeling uses many renewable energy sources and a battery bank. The main objective is to attend the demand of the Pantanal Study Base (BEP) of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul only with renewable energy sources. So, scenarios of typical days and one year scenario were developed to verify the behavior of the battery bank. First, hybrid energy systems and renewable energy sources are briefly presented. Then the model is described. Following, how the demand curve was obtained is presented, and the dimensioning of the number of solar panels and the number of batteries of the battery bank. Finally, results obtained with the modeling of the system are presented.

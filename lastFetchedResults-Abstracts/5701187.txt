In the present day scenario, large amount of information and data is being stored in the form of digital documents. Cyber forensics analysis tools need to deal with large volumes of data retrieved from the suspectÂ´s hard disk. Searching for relevant evidence from such vast volumes is not an easy task. Analyzing such massive volumes of data manually is impractical. It is obvious that the cyber investigator would need the help of forensic analysis software tools for this purpose. Besides, a number of multilingual documents may be present in the seized media. Especially in a country like India, the analysts may come across multilingual documents very often. Thus, there arises a need to provide support for multilingual search in cyber forensic analysis tools. Not many forensic analysis tools provide multilingual search facility. In this paper, we have discussed the need of multilingual search in forensic tools. Besides, we have also discussed the approach we used in order to attain this objective in our analysis tool.

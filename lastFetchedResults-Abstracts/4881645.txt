This paper presents a solution of Energy Storage System (ESS) for Small Wind Turbine (SWT). Two different topologies of DC/DC converters for ESS are described. Chosen Dual Active Bridge (DAB) topology is verified by simulations. It allows to deal with difference between voltage levels of dc-link and energy storage (ES) and additionally ensures galvanic isolation. Charging and discharging strategies of energy storage are described and simulated. A superior control circuit with assured protection of energy storage system, which consist of four parallel PI controllers is presented for bidirectional power transfer.

Introduction: Spine cord injuries are frequent pathology in general population, which cause significant locomotor disabilities. Objective: We wanted to evaluate the clinical benefits of rehabilitation using natural factors (climate, sapropelic mud, salty water of the lake), applied to patients with spine cord injury. Material and method: We studied (retrospective) patients with spine cord injury at first presentation in Techirghiol health resort, hospitalized from June, 1st 2007 to June, 1st, 2008, undergoing specific rehabilitation treatment and evaluated the clinical benefits of balneal treatment. Results: The first traumatic condition was fall down (37%), and the second car accident (14.4%). The most of them (84%) use wheelchair as support of travel and 30% needs accompanying standing. We noticed after the treatment improvement of muscle activity (both: spastic and flaccid) and psychological and muscle relaxation. Conclusions: Adequate administration of natural factors corroborate with progressive intensity of kinetotherapy or hydro-kineto-therapy completed with electrotherapy and massage lead to improvement of scores of patient. Quality of life of patients can increases in many ways: self esteem, interest for treatment, encouraging other patients, implication in family life and finding new means of support for travel and self assistance.

The generation and optimization of tool paths are considered to be challenging problems for the use of a milling robot in minimally invasive orthopedic surgery. The objective of this study was to minimize the collision of the cutting tool with soft tissue, and we propose a novel approach to tool path generation and optimization. Starting with the physical requirements, we modeled some important components, and on the basis of this model, we propose a geometric optimization approach to improve the tool path. Case studies show the validity of this approach. We developed software for the application, and then evaluated the effectiveness of the application.

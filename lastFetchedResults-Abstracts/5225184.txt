Software runtime monitoring has been used to increase the dependability of software. This paper focuses on software runtime monitoring techniques and tools. A generic software runtime monitoring model is presented, which consists of five basic elements, i.e., Monitored Object, Monitoring Access Methods, Execution Relationships, Runtime Monitor and Platform Dependencies. This model is an innovation in software monitoring fields. This paper gives some features of each element. Based on these features, researchers can use the model to comprehend and analyze runtime monitoring techniques and tools. The objective of this paper is to help researchers and users to identify the difference and the basic principles of software runtime monitoring techniques and tools. This paper also shows a result of relationship between techniques and features, through the result, we can understand the development trends of the techniques and tools.

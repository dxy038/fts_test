A new color filter array (CFA) interpolation scheme for single-sensor digital cameras is presented. The proposed method produces the restored full color image using edge adaptive interpolation and correction steps performed on the color-difference planes. Correction steps are applied to improve initially interpolated color components in regions that exhibit a correlation between the blue/green and red/green channels higher than a predetermined threshold. The scheme consistently outperforms well-known CFA interpolation algorithms, in terms of both objective and subjective image quality measures, and produces visually pleasing images.

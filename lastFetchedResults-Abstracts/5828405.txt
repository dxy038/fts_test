In order to analyze safety of traffic accident scenes and avoid secondary accident, influence factors including human factors, vehicle factors, road and environment factors and management factors were analyzed. Based on system dynamic, system causality graph and flowchart of system dynamic were established. Changing input of every factor, importance degree of factors was obtained. Evaluation index system of safety in accident scene was established. Membership degree and dimensionless function were adapted to deal with quantitative and qualitative index. The three level BP neutral network model was developed to evaluate safety level in traffic accident scene. The results are shown that the evaluation index is logical and the conclusion is objective. At last, Preventive measurements were proposed.

This paper examines the problem of ontological indigence given its conceptual development from the earliest stages of the formation of Islamic philosophy to the time of Mulla Sadra. In doing so, the writers have tried to study some traces of this discussion in pre-Sadrian philosophy in addition to explaining Mulla Sadra’s intended meaning of the essential indigence of beings. To this end, they have initially explained some of the related points by highlighting certain hints to this discussion in the words of certain prominent pre-Sadrian philosophers such as Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Suhrawardi in their treatment of such problems as the criterion of the dependence of the effect on the cause and the continuity of this dependence. Finally, the authors have dealt with Mulla Sadra’s view of this problem, its consequences and concomitants in Sadrian philosophy, and its distinctions from similar discussions in pre-Sadrian philosophy. The main objective here is not only to unfold the development of the discussion of ontological indigence but also to pay attention to the changes in this regard in the light of Sadrian philosophy. In this way, the writers hope to demonstrate the significance and supreme place of this problem in the Transcendent Philosophy more than ever before.

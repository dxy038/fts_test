This paper presents a mechanism for determining a unique set of parameters to characterize membership functions from empirical data. The problem involves a decision making process utilizing fuzzy set theory. This approach is used in conjunction with empirical data from a biomedical application involving disabled patients. The objective is to develop as parsimonious a model as possible, yet still map empirical data observed in the phase plane, in a 1 to 1 manner, to a unique set of parameters of the assumed membership functions

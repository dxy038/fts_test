Background and Objective: purslane seeds provide nutritional value, and have beneficial health effect on the body specially in preventing cardiovascular, cancer and hypertension (high blood pressure) deseases, because it contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and other nutrients such as antioxidants, tocopherols and dietary fibre.
Materials and Methods: In this study, the effect of incorporating purslane powder into wheat flour with concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20% was investigated on dough rheological properties, chemical properties of flour and bread including oil content, fatty acids profile, tocopherols, fat acidity and peroxide. Fatty acids stability during cooking process was also studied. Moreover, sensory characteristics of bread were determined during 5 days of storage.
Results: Findings showed that incorporating up to 10% purslane powder led to the weakening of dough rheological behavior in the farinograph. 20% substitution level increased flour fat content, linolenic acid, tocopherols and fat acidity contents. However, peroxide values of samples did not show significant (p > 0.05) differences. The amount of fat acidity and peroxide increased during cooking. Linolenic acid was stable to heat, while tocopherols decreased. Bread containing 10% purslane received higher sensory scores compared to other treatments. Bread sensory quality gradually decreased during storage.
Conclusion: Incorporating purslane seeds powder increased omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids in bread. At certain levels (below 10%) of pursalne addition, sensorial properties of bread were improved. Linoleic fatty acid was stable during baking, however, the amount of tocopherols decreased upon baking.

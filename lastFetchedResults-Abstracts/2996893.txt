This paper considers an optimal control approach to the channel allocation problem in a multimedia wireless system. The system accommodates several sources with variable bit rates (VBR). The channel allocation paradigm is based on the queue length of the data of the various sources. The objective is to maintain the queue lengths of all the sources and the overall queue length at or near desired levels thus minimizing delays and avoiding data losses while maximizing bandwidth utilization. Since the system equations for the queue lengths are linear, a quadratic performance index can be utilized for the solution of the control problem, even though the uncertainties may not be Gaussian. The performance of the system is also considered in the case when the allowable source rates are discrete, and in the presence of control delay. The results are compared with simulations to indicate the improved performance of the system

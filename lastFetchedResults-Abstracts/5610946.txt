This paper proposes objective functions for dynamic multichannel access (DMA) networks that enable spectrum users (SUs) to assess, locate, and exploit available spectrum opportunities effectively, thereby maximizing the SUÂ´s rewards measured in terms of the average received throughput. We show that the proposed objective functions are: near-optimal, as they achieve high rewards; scalable, as they perform well in small- as well as large-scale DMA networks; learnable, as they allow SUs to reach up near-optimal rewards very quickly; and distributive, as they are implementable by requiring local information sharing only.

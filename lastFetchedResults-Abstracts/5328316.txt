Chaos is a nonlinear phenomenon that degrades the performance of many drive systems. Therefore, controlling chaos increasing interested in these systems. In this paper, chaotic behavior in a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive systems is demonstrated. It is shown that SynRM drive route to chaos when the d-axis component of stator voltage loses its control. The objective is stabilizing chaotic drive systems to a stable point. Consequently, the nonlinear feedback control method is proposed to control chaos via control of d and q-axis component of stator voltage. By computer simulation that is shown that the system states settle down to the stable equilibrium as expected after the control strategy is applied.

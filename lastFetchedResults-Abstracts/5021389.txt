The course of product model-making is to train students to be able to design three-dimensional creations, and acquire the knowledge and skill in the modeling field. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the professional learning items, and the results can be applied to adjust the teaching content and improve the teaching methods. The paper chose the students graduated from the Department of Industrial Design, and are working in the product modeling design field as examinees. The data were analyzed by Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) to evaluate the difficulties of the course content and also put them in order, and the Student-Problem Chart (S-P Chart) was used to establish the Grey Student-Problem Chart (GSP Chart), which provides the cognitive domain of the examinees and becomes the basis of the paper. At the end, the results are shown in the GSM (Grey Structural Modeling) which become the analytical basis of this paper. Through this objective evaluation, the figures and data generated from the paper can clarify the course evaluation which becomes the best Innovative evaluation methods in educational learning and training.

We present experiments on bidirectional transmission with 2.5 Gb/s for downstream and upstream data rates over 10 km transmission distance to complete a WDM PON by SOA for ONU and realize the downstream optical signal is reused for upstream transmission. The results show that OAN and ONW is extincted and the extinction ratio (ER) is reduced to 0 db when the output optical of SOA pass through Scheme III module. We were able to achieve the error-free downstream transmission and achieve the error-free upstream transmission with the downstream ER of high to 15 db; the Q value of the downstream transmission is about 36, the Q value of the upstream transmission is about 61.1.

Objective of work is the computation of the spectral power density of ground clutter for a horizontally over ground moving radar and the demonstration of the validity of the theory by comparison of theoretical with experimental results. The signal-to-clutter ratio for point targets will be estimated theoretically and experimentally as well. Additionally, in relation to this estimation the validity range of the theory and the model will be determined. Starting point of consideration is an empirical model for the backscattering cross section per unit area ??0, established in a previous paper. A comparison of calculated power densities with experimental estimated power spectra for sea surfaces leads to an excellent equality between theory and measurements. The experiment will be explained and interpreted. It is shown that the validity range of the theory and the validity of the simple radar equation are comparable. Like the radar equation, the presented theory holds for incoherent scattering.

We propose a bidirectional add/drop amplifier (BADA) module with an N/spl times/N arrayed waveguide grating multiplexer. The relative intensity noise that degrades bidirectional transmission system severely is suppressed by interleaved wavelength allocation. With two proposed RADA modules, we demonstrate bidirectional transmission and add/drop multiplexing of 8/spl times/2.5 GWs WDM signal over 120-km conventional single mode fiber with less than 0.6 dB power penalty in the receiver sensitivity.

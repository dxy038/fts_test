This study was conducted at Moghan Agricultural Research Center in 2000-01 with five promising lines, two cultivars Chamran and Shiroodi as checks for yield, two cultivars Falat and Forontana as diseases checks. The main objective was to evaluate the promising lines for grain yield and diseases resistance in Moghan region. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used under two different irrigation conditions; furrow and sprinkler irrigations. Combined analysis of variance over two irrigation conditions showed significant effect of genotype at the 1% of probability level on plant height, number of tiller per plant, number of fertile tiller per plant, length of peduncle, grain weight per plant. Mean comparison of lines showed that no significant differences but lines N-81-8, N-81-9 and N-81-18 produced 6000, 6060 and 6310 Kg/ha, respectively. These lines lines were also resistance to yellow rust (O-MR) and fusarium head blight (O). Line N-81-18 not only produced the highest grain yield but was highly resistance to yellow rust and fusarium head blight, under both furrow and sprinkler irrigation conditions. This line could be a promising candidate to be released in Warm Humid Caspian Zone. According to the results of this study sprinkler and furrow irrigations can be used for evaluation of new lines. In this study line N-81-18 with high grain yield and resistance to both yellow rust and fusarium head blight was designated as suitable candidate for Moghan region.

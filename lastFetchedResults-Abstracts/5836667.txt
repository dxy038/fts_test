This paper presents the implementation of adaptive control of an electric wheelchair. The control objective is to control the velocity of the left and right wheels to follow the desired velocity commands. The equations of motion of the wheelchair are derived. This system compared the wheel rotational velocity that is measured by the encoder with the reference model. The adaptive control equation stability has been checked with Lyapunov stability. The simulation result shows that the electric wheelchair velocity using this control system tracks the desired velocity model. If the input was made truncated, it just makes the system reaches its set point a little bit longer.

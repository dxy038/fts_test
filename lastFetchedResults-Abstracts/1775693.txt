Summary
s disease is an osteopathy the incidence of which increases with aging; in the 8th decade, it occurs in 11 % of the population. Complications of this pathology often occur, and appear prevalently in form of basilar disease. We report a case of an ultracentenarian patient (aged 107) who suffered a cervical right femur fracture after falling in her own house at the age of 104 years. Radiological and laboratory findings revealed a mono-osseal Paget's disease of the right femur. Because of her good conditions, the patient underwent an operation of non-cemented endoprothesis of Moore type, with a good post-operatory course and a physiokinetic therapeutic treatment. A kinesiologic evaluation was made, by measuring articular range of motion (ROM) through the neutral zero methods and evaluating the muscular strength: it showed a constantly progressive functional recovery of the lower limbs in both subjective and objective terms.

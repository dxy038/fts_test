Efficiency of energy resource use is a key factor for a sustainable energy future. By matching the exergy levels of supply and demand, Energy Quality Management (EQM) of building energy supply systems may achieve more efficient use of energy resources. Beyond this, environmental impact of energy supply systems is another essential issue. This work addresses the influence of EQM on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the operation optimization of a Distributed Energy System (DES). A multi-objective linear programming problem is formulated to reduce energy costs and increase the overall exergy efficiency. Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are evaluated for the optimized operation strategies of the DES. The operators of the DES can choose the operation strategy from the Pareto front, based on their priorities and also aware of effects on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Results demonstrate more efficient use of energy resources and reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through EQM, as compared with conventional energy supply systems.

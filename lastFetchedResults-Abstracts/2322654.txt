Inroduction & Objective: In this study the effect of different levels of salinity in the amount of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), the number of red blood cells (RBC) and white (WBC), RBC indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC) count and differential white blood ceel fish Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) weight 34/36Â±0/411 was investigated. 
Materials and Methods: Young fish initially for 14 days and has gradually been adapted to salt water. The relevant experiments for 30 days under different levels of salinity 0, 15, 35 and 50 ppt continued. The experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications with four treatments, salt and Hrtymar fiberglass fish tanks were distributed between 12 and repeat with 15 pieces of fish. At the end of the experiment the fish tail vein blood sampling was performed.
Results: The results of this study showed that the decrease in salinity between any of the treatments together with the control group in terms of blood factors studied, there was no significant difference (P >  0.05). The research findings show that the process of gradual change in salinity of sea water with salinity of 50 ppt of fresh water with salinity of 0, as Euryhaline Fish Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) it is not known 
Conclusion: These fish have the ability to adapt to different levels of salinity that it is able to cope with environmental stress.

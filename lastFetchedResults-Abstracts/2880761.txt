We developed a new image development analysis by introducing image processing technology as well as conventional developmental evaluation. In this research, classes will be conducted using movement therapy to emotionally disturbed children. The classes involve cognitive movement therapy and are targeted towards the children with highly impulsive and hyperactive behaviors.

A Dynamic Constitution Evaluation Model for supplier selection and evaluation was suggested in this paper. Subjective weights are given based on G1 method, and objective weights are obtained from entropy method. The combination of subjective and objective weights avoids the one-sided result, which is the limitation of single method. Using dynamic multi-stages linear constitution method on the evaluation scores of the indices, which fully considering the influence of evaluation objectsÂ´ objective condition on evaluation result, and made up the fortuitous result which only considered the current condition. Finally the practicability of the model is illustrated.

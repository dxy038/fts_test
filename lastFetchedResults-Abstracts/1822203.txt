Objective
rpose of the present study was to examine the age- and tissue-related variations of the telomere length in gingiva and dental pulp of donor patients.

ntified the relative telomeric DNA content corresponding to the telomere length in gingiva or dental pulp from donor patients (male and female, aged at 19â€“68) by using genomic DNA of oral tissues in dot-blot hybridization with telomere-specific probe.
s
ric DNA content in the dental pulp showed a negative correlation with the age of donor patients, with smaller telomeric DNA content observed in the elders (p &lt; 0.05). In age-matched gingival samples, the average telomeric DNA content was not significantly different between male and female donors. In the age- and gender-matched samples, telomeric DNA content was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) in dental pulp than in gingiva.
sion
lomere length is greater in the dental pulp than in the gingiva. In the dental pulp, but not in the gingiva, telomere length shortens with age.

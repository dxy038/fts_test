The objective of this study was to perform a narrative review of the literature to determine the adaptations of physiological performance following high-intensity interval training (HIT). High-intensity interval training generally refers to repeated bouts of relatively brief intermittent exercise, often performed with an all-out effort or at intensity close to that which elicits VO2peak. Depending on the training intensity, a single effort may last from a few seconds to up to several minutes, with multiple efforts separated by up to a few minutes of rest or low-intensity exercise. An apparent characteristic of this type of training is the very low training volume. A single high-intensity exercise bout requires the ATP provision of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. By increasing the intense frequent bouts and performing in an intermittent practice with recovery among the bouts, the demand of the muscular cells and metabolic pathways will change and then alter contribution of aerobic metabolism for ATP provision. As a result, both aerobic and anaerobic energetic systems are involved in ATP resynthesis. Overall, Physiological adaptations involving in performance improvement following HIT can refer to closed and synchronized interactions of peripheral adaptations (in skeletal muscle), neural (motor unites and CNS) and cardiovascular adaptations. Therefore, by applying this type of training can expect a wide range of metabolic and performance adaptations that result in improvement of both aerobic and anaerobic systems. These findings show that high-intensity interval training with very low volume can cause major adjustments in body and suggests high-intensity interval training is a time-efficient strategy.

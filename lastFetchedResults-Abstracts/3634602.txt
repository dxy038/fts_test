This paper presents an ac-dc converter topology for realization of power factor correction (PFC) voltage regulators for applications where the mains frequency is high and a low input current harmonic is required, e.g., in aircraft power systems. The proposed converter represents a minimal configuration consisting of two basic converters, which can be systematically derived from a previously proposed general synthesis procedure for rectifierless ac-dc converters. The proposed PFC converter has incorporated a control method which drastically reduces the circulating power and hence raises the efficiency to a level comparable to existing PFC converters. The proposed PFC converter can completely eliminate any crossover distortion, which can be significant for supply systems having a high mains frequency. In addition, the proposed converter allows bidirectional energy flow ensuring all inductors work in continuous conduction mode hence eliminating the distortion due to the abrupt change of dynamic response when the operating mode changes. Analysis and design of the power and control circuits will be given and discussed. An experimental system will be presented for verification purposes.

In this paper we have designed a remote power
control based on both an embedded board and on ZigBee
communication. This design consists of two parts that regard
as the essential two Control parts, the ZigBee control module
and the server module. Where, The main objective of this
article is show the control of electro-electronics devices using
a PC software and a embedded system, sending and receiving
remote data around one kilometer. The text shows the
radiofrequency interface, the choice and programming of a
microcontroller and the PC software that controls it and also
provides a detailed description of the proposed system, from
design to implementation, as well as the results of the
demonstration experiment

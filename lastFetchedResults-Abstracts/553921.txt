Objective: The present study was concerned with effectiveness of assertiveness training on self-esteem and general health in students with and without vision loss in Shiraz. Method: 28 students with, and 28 students without vision loss ageing 13-15 were randomly recruited and assigned to experimental and control groups, each group included 14 participants (7 males and 7 females). Coopersmith Self-esteem, and Goldberg General Health Questionnaires were completed in pretest and post-test stages, and two-factor analysis of variance was used. Results: Results indicated that: 1. assertiveness training could increase self-esteem in both groups, 2. assertiveness training could increase general health students with vision loss, but not in normal group, 3. assertiveness training enhanced self-esteem. As there are many health problems in students with vision loss, and partly due to less of assertiveness, with assertiveness training, their general health status becomes better. Conclusion: We conclude that assertiveness training could ameliorate some self-esteem and health problems in these students.

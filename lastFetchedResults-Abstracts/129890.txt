Objective: To normalize the Abedi Creativity Test (CT) in high schools of the schooling region No. 6 of Tehran. Method: CT was administered to students from 36 high schools randomly selected over the schooling region No. 6 of Tehran. A total of 819 students were selected, 410 male and 409 female students. The instrument was examined for the internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) was used as the criterion for concurrent validity of the CT. Results: Test-retest reliability coefficients of the CT subscales for fluency, 0.023; elaboration, 0.444; originality, 0.614; and flexibility, 0.595 were obtained. The internal consistency coefficient for the CT ranged from 0.48 to 0.68 (mean 0.59). The low internal consistency of some sub scales may be due to the small number of items and the heterogeneous nature of the questions. The correlation coefficients between the subscales of the TTCT and the CT for fluency, 0.468; elaboration, -0.195; originality, 0.424; and flexibility, 0.361 (mean 0.265) were obtained. This low-level relation could be due to intrinsic problems in administering and scoring the TTCT, or it could be an indication of the major differences between the constructs measured by two instruments, or a combination of both of these factors. Comparisons of the means for boys and girls showed there was no significant difference in fluency, originality, and flexibility subscales between boys and girls, but there was a significant difference in elaboration between two groups: girls were higher than boys in elaboration subscale. Conclusion: The required time for TTCT administration and scoring limits its application to large scale assessments of creativity. The CT requires less time for administration and scoring, and hence can be an alternative to the TTCT; provided that its concurrent validity is improved, it could be used for group administration.

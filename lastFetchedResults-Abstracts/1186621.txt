The objective of this paper is to propose a simple method using dynamic relaxation algorithm to find the form and perform a structural analysis of reciprocal frame systems, also called nexorades. After a brief historical note, details of the parameters that govern the design of nexorades are introduced together with details of the assembly. These parameters induce strong geometrical constrains on this kind of structures so that a form-finding step is required. It is suggested here to introduce a fictitious mechanical behaviour to solve this problem. The dynamic relaxation algorithm is used with a model that takes into account the eccentricity between the elements. Its implementation is explained and its versatility is illustrated through several examples covering various fields of applications going from form-finding problems to non-linear structural analysis of structures. In a last example the structural behaviour of nexorades is compared with more conventional triangulated structures.

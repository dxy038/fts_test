As the main trend of development in new energy vehicles field, electric vehicle is bound to have a great development all over the world. However, it must have convenient public charging facilities and services before the vehicles become popular. As the vehicles need a long time when they charge, and the charging stations are widespread and unattended operation, it requires the drivers accomplish the charging operation by self-service, and the charging system should automatically complete the identification of the users´ identity, battery charging and fee management. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a smart card which could have a bidirectional interaction with the charging post in order to provide a safe, friendly and convenient service for the users. In accordance with ISO/IEC7816 and ISO/IEC14443-A protocol, this paper accomplished the design and implementation of smart card based on CPU core for secure payment, and the smart card has both contact and contactless interface for communication, which could be well applicable to the secure payment of electric vehicles´ charging.

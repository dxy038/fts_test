Few investigations have been carried out on the ability of different plants to take up nonexchangeable potassium (K). The objective of this investigation was to examine the ability of different alfalfa cultivars to absorb K from phlogopite. An experiment was carried out with a completely randomized design with 3 alfalfa cultivars including Pickseed 2065 (MF), Rehnani (R) and Hamadani (H) grown in a quartz sand medium containing <53 micron sized phlogopite under complete and Kfree nutrient solutions for a period of 6 months. During the growth period, the shoot was harvested 4 times. At the end of the experiment, the root was also separated from the growth medium and collected. Plant sles were extracted using the dry ash method and their K concentration was determined. Under the Kfree nutrient solution, the highest shoot and root K concentration and uptake were found for the MF cultivar. The shoot and root K concentration in this cultivar were respectively 1.6 and 1.5 times higher than those in the R cultivar and 1.8 times greater than those in the H cultivar. The K uptake in the shoot and root of the MF cultivar was respectively 1.6 and 1.9 times higher than that of the H cultivar and 1.6 and 1.5 times higher than that of the R cultivar. Thus, in addition to other parameters, the type of plant variety should be taken into account when K requirement is evaluated.

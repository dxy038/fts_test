This paper presents an objective comparative evaluation of layout analysis methods for scanned historical documents. It describes the competition (modus operandi, dataset and evaluation methodology) held in the context of ICDAR2011 and the International Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing (HIP2011), presenting the results of the evaluation of four submitted methods. A commercial state-of-the-art system is also evaluated for comparison. Two scenarios are reported in this paper, one evaluating the ability of methods to accurately segment regions and the other evaluating the whole pipeline of segmentation and region classification (with a text extraction goal). The results indicate that there is a convergence to a certain methodology with some variations in the approach. However, there is still a considerable need to develop robust methods that deal with the idiosyncrasies of historical documents.

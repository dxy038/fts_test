OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of placental transfer of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and the effects on maternal and fetal cardiovascular parameters. STUDY DESIGN: Between gestational days 122 and 126 (term 167 days) five rhesus macaques underwent surgery for implantation of maternal and fetal vascular catheters. At least 4 days after surgery maternal and fetal blood pressures and heart rates were recorded for 1 hour. This was followed by a 5-minute maternal venous infusion of saline solution vehicle and recording for an additional hour. Enalaprilat was then infused over 5 minutes through the maternal femoral artery at doses of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg. Maternal and fetal arterial blood samples were collected for determination of blood gas status and plasma enalaprilat concentrations. RESULTS: Enalaprilat rapidly crossed the placenta, and fetal values for areas under the concentration time curve were 50% to 65% of maternal values across dose groups. Drug was retained in the fetal plasma approximately threefold to fourfold longer than in maternal plasma. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, arterial Po2 and pH were unchanged after enalaprilat infusion, as were fetal heart rate and blood gases. In contrast, fetal arterial pressure decreased significantly (19% to 23%, p< 0.01) after maternal treatment with 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg and remained depressed throughout the 6-hour study interval. At 0.05 mg/kg fetal arterial pressure was decreased by 13% from baseline; differences were not significantly different (p> 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that enalaprilat rapidly crosses the primate placenta with a single intravenous administration to the mother, resulting in significant and prolonged reduction of fetal arterial pressure. Because maternal cardiovascular parameters were unaffected, enalaprilat appears to have a direct effect on fetal arterial pressure. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:50-5.)

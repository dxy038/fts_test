This paper explores methods to include aspects of controller taskload into conflict-resolution programs through a parametric approach. We are motivated by the desire to create conflict-resolution decision-support tools that operate within a human-in-the-loop control architecture by actively accounting for, and moderating, controller taskload. Specifically, we introduce two conflict-resolution programs with the objective of managing controller conflict-resolution taskload, i.e., the number of maneuvers used to separate air traffic. Managing conflict-resolution taskload is accomplished by penalizing aircraft maneuvers through their <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> norm in the cost function or constraining the number of maneuvers directly. Analysis of the programs reveals that both approaches are successful at managing controller conflict-resolution taskload and minimizing fuel burn. Directly constraining conflict-resolution taskload is more successful at minimizing the variation in the number of aircraft maneuvers issued and returning the aircraft to their desired exit point. Penalizing maneuvers through <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> norm costs is more successful at reducing controller conflict-resolution taskload at lower traffic volumes. Ultimately, results demonstrate that the inclusion of such parametric models can successfully regulate controller conflict-resolution taskload.

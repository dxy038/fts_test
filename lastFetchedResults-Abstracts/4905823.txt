Due to the deregulation and restructuring in many countries, it is expected that amount of small-scale generations connected to the distribution networks increase. So it is necessary that impact of these kinds of generators on distribution feeder reconfiguration would be investigated. This paper presents an approach for distribution reconfiguration considering distributed generators (DGs). The objective function is summation of electrical energy generated by DGs and substation buses (main bus). A particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the optimal operation problem. The approach is tested on a real distribution feeder.

Abstract
Introduction: Despite the benefits of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in reducing major cardiovascular complications, the risk of thrombotic complications still remains a major concern. While the efficacy of aspirin in primary and secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome is well documented, the precise dose of aspirin is still questionable.
Objective: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of high doses of low dose aspirin in patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) who were under the Primary PCI.
Materials and Methods: In this study, the method of randomized clinical trial double blind controlled on patients with STEMI, referred to the Rasht hospital for a year was performed. Short-term outcome based on the individual  situation until 30 days after the operation defined that variables including the re ischemia, major bleeding, stent thrombosis, stroke, death from heart problems and revascularizations were re-evaluated.
Results: Among 175 patients enrolled, there were 85 patients in the group receiving low-dose aspirin (81 mg) and 90 patients in the group receiving high-dose aspirin (325 mg). Significant differences between complications after PCI except for cardiogenic shock were not observed between the groups.
Conclusion: The use of low-dose aspirin instead of high-dose aspirin, is associated with fewer side effects and better performance.

In the field of pattern recognition multiple classifier systems based on the combination of outputs from different classifiers have been proposed as a method of high performance classification systems. The objective of this work is to develop a fuzzy Gaussian classifier for combining multiple learners, we use a fuzzy Gaussian model to combine the outputs obtained from K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), Fuzzy K-nearest neighbor classifier and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and then compare the results with Fuzzy Integral, Decision Templates, Weighted Majority, Majority Nai&#194;&#191;ve Bayes, Maximum, Minimum, Average and Product combination methods. Results on two benchmark data sets show that the proposed fusion method outperforms a wide variety of existing classifier combination methods.

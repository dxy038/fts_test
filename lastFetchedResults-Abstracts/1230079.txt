Plastic deformation of structures absorbs substantial kinetic energy when impact occurs. For this reason, energy-absorbing components have been extensively used in the structural design of vehicles to intentionally absorb a large portion of crash energy to reduce the severe injury of occupants. On the other hand, high peak crushing force may to a certain extent indicate the risk of structural integrity and biomechanical damage of occupants. For this reason, it is of great significance to maximize the energy absorption and minimize the peak force by seeking for optimal design of these components. This paper aims to design the multi-cell cross-sectional thin-walled columns with these two crashworthiness criteria. An explicit finite element analysis (FEA) is used to derive higher-order response surfaces for these two objectives. Both the single-objective and multi-objective optimizations are performed for the single, double, triple and quadruple cell sectional columns under longitudinal impact loading. A comparative analysis is consequently given to explore the relationship between these two design criteria with the different optimization formulations.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the harmonics spectra spreading effect and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of various Pseudo Random Binary Sequence bits i.e. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 bits of Random Carrier Pulse Width Modulation (RCPWM) technique. The PRBS random bit generator is implemented using shift register and Exclusive or gate. The proposed technique is evaluated using MATLAB/Simulink and the results prove a good harmonic spectra spreading capability and power density spectrum of the RCPWM scheme for various bits as compared with conventional Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) schemes.

The objective of this project was to study the impact of variable myocardial thickness on SPECT perfusion imaging using segmented high-resolution gated-CT data of the heart to define source distributions. High-resolution CT data were obtained using a GE Lightspeed multi-slice CT system. Transverse slices (512&#215;512) with x-y pixel size of 0.039 cm and a slice thickness of 0.25 cm were segmented to obtain left-ventricular (LV) and right-ventricular (RV) myocardial walls for all time frames of the cardiac cycle. Polar maps of myocardial thickness were generated using radial and short-axis slices of the LV. Absolute quantitation was performed on the myocardium thickness polar maps. The segmented LV and RV were also incorporated in the gated MCAT phantom, and analytical SPECT projections generated using typical acquisition parameters. Projection data were folded down to 64&#215;64 image matrices and reconstructed using FBP as well as 10 iterations of OSEM including attenuation correction. CEQUAL polar maps were generated and relative quantitative analysis performed. Results show there is considerable variation in wall thickness at the resolution of the CT studies. Apical thinning, papillary muscles, and apical to base shortening are clearly visible. AC also gives a mole realistic perfusion distribution in the simulated patient data

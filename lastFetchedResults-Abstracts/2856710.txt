3D triangle meshes are widely used in representation of graphic data, and they are subject to various visual distortions during geometry processing and transmission. In this study, we propose a novel objective quality assessment method for 3D meshes based on curvature information. According to characteristics of the human visual system (HVS), two new components including visual masking modulation and saturation effect modulation are designed for the proposed method. Besides, inspired by the fact that the HVS is sensitive to structural information, we compute the structure distortion for 3D meshes. We test the performance of the proposed method on three publicly available databases of 3D mesh quality evaluation, and compare the performance of the proposed method with the relevant state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can predict consistent results in terms of correlation to the subjective scores across these databases.

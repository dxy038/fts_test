Non-intrusive load monitoring (NEM) is a load monitoring technique proposed to be used in todayÂ´s residential energy auditor. It is expected to automatically provide the information of the type, energy consumption, and operation status of the electric loads without getting access to the loads. However, there still not exists any commercialized product so far, mainly because of the extraordinary large load sets comparing with the limited learning data. The fast emerging of new types of loads further aggravates the problem. This paper proposes an adaptive non-intrusive load identification model to address this problem. The proposed model is not dedicated to identify all the loads around the world, but it will grasp knowledge from samples that are not identified in the real application, and gradually form a new learning procedure so as to identify more and more new samples correctly. Random forest algorithm is introduced here to realize the objective and a case study is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the model.

The paper presents a new method for design of power system stabilizer (PSS) based on relay-free sliding mode control technique. The control objective is to enhance the stability and to improve the dynamic response of the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system. We apply this relay-free sliding mode controller to design power system stabilizer for demonstrating the availability of the proposed approach.

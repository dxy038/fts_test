This paper investigates the complete calculations of the different losses in matrix converters such as switching
and conduction losses. A small R-C snubber circuit is usually connected across two terminals of a bidirectional
switch to limit the device voltage at an appropriate level. Also, the complete analysis of the snubber circuit
losses is given. The results show that this simple snubber arrangement causes the total converter losses to
increase. In other words. it has been found that the snubber circuit results in a high power loss compared to the
total semiconductor losses. Another result of this research is that the snubber losses in the matrix converter are
independent of the input and output frequencies and the power factors. The snubber losses mainly depend on the
input voltage, the snubber capacitance and the switching frequency. Also, in this paper it is shown that the total
energy losses is independent of the switching pattern and the load power factor and the majority of the tum-on
energy losses comes from the snubber capacitor. Very good correlation between the analysis and the measured
results were obtained.

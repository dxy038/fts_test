Introduction & Objective: Nociception and behavioral responses
to noxious stimuli are different in males and females. It seems that
these differences are due to the effects 01 sex hormones on fhe
pain mechanisms The aim of the current study was to evaluate the
effect of testosterone administration on nociception by formalin test
in gonadectomized rats.
Material & Methods: In this study 32 male wistar rats were divided
Into four groups (n=8); the control rats without receiving any drug
or surgical operation, the sham - operated animals with surgical
stress, the gonadectomized rats receiving 0,5 ml vehicle (olive oil)
i.p, and the gonadectomized rats receiving testosterone enantate
(6 mg/l00 gr body weight in 05 ml vehicle i.p.). On the sixth day
after gonadectomy operation, formalin test was done in all rats.
Pain scores in formalin test were statistically analyzed by SPSS
and ANOVA.
Results: The results showed that testosterone caused an increase
in pain score in acute phase of formalin test in gonadectomized
rats compared with sham-operated group (p<O.OOl). However,
pain score rn chronic phase was siqniticantly reduced in
testosterone received rats (p<O.OOl).
Conclusion: It can be concluded that testosterone Increases
nociception in acute phase at lormalin test in gonadectomized rats.
On the other hand, testosterone relieved pain during chronic
phase Anti-nociceptive effects of testosterone in chronic phase
may be through central nervous system by Interacting with
endogenous pain modulatory systems.

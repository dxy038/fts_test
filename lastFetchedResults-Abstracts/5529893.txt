The NYNEX Shuttle is a research and development testbed for prototyping concepts for public switched network based multimedia communication services with special emphasis on video services. The Shuttle provides services to employees of NYNEX who need to communicate between its two laboratories in Cambridge, MA and White Plains, NY, by utilizing mixed-media telecommunications facilities and prototype applications. The primary objective of the NYNEX Shuttle project is to evaluate end user requirements for multimedia communications. Since the emphasis is on user applications and not on the technologies, the services are provided using a combination of off-the-shelf technologies and laboratory prototypes requiring both analog and digital transmission.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

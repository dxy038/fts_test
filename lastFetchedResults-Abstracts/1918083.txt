To determine whether self-reported angina pectoris is associated with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia, we assessed angina symptoms, using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and measured ischemia using stress echocardiography in 933 patients with known coronary artery disease. We observed no association between self-reported angina pectoris and objective evidence of inducible ischemia.

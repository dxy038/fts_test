The authors present the principal characteristics of the error-detection system and error analysis based on error field measurement in a digital microwave transmission system. The error performance and propagation field trial was carried out by using a standby channel of 34 Mb/s and another digital path of 64 kb/s. The authors obtained information about errors and reached some conclusions by analyzing the data obtained. The error distribution of the 34 Mb/s hierarchy is summarized by long-term bit error field trials. The relationships between the degraded minutes (DM) objective, the severely errored seconds (SES) objective at 64 kb/s, and the corresponding parameters at the system bit rate according to the errorÂ´s stochastic allotment are given

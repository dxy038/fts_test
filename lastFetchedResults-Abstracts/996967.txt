Multicommutation refers to flow systems designed with discrete computer-controlled commutators resulting in flow networks in which all the steps involved in sample processing can be independently implemented. The flow systems can be re-configured by the control software, presenting thus increased versatility, potential for automation and for minimization of both reagent consumption and waste generation. The main objective herein is to review the concept of multicommutation in order to permit a proper evaluation of the characteristics and potentialities of the related flow systems, to assist methodological implementation and to discuss similarities with other existing strategies. Implementation of tandem streams, controlled dilutions, wide-range determinations, sequential determinations, titrations and in-line separation/concentration are emphasized.

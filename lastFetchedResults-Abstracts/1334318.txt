Background and Objective: Superficial pigmented lesions are the most common complaint in dermatology. This study was done to assess the therapeutic effect of cryotherapy in facial lentigo and junctional nevus.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, 100 cases of flat-pigmented lesions with diameters up to 2 mm and after taking a photograph with USB microscope M2 (Scalar) treated with one freeze thaw cycle with liquid nitrogen through an applicator for 2 second in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran during 2004-05. The patients were visited 3 times again through 3 successive months. According to the decrease in color of the lesion, patients were divided into 4 groups: sever pigmentation, no response, partial ( > 50% color loss) and complete response ( < 50% color loss). Data were analyzed using SPSS-11.5 and Wilcoxon test.
Results: 96% of our patients were female and 4% were male. Mean age was 30Â±11.7 years. Based on Fitzpatrick criteria fifteen patients had type 2, fifty had type 3 and 35 had type 4 skin color. After the period of 3 months follow up, 6% of the patients completely healded, 58% had partial response, 31%with no response and 5% develop hyperpigmentation. Response in patients with type 2 Fitzpatrick skin color was clinically better than type 3 and 4 but this difference was not significant.
Conclusion: Cryotherapy is considered as a simple, cost effective and safe therapeutic regiment in treating of 64% facial pigmental lesions.

The oceans represent a huge energy reservoir. Although today all of the marine power projects are very near from the shore and they are rated at low power, the huge potential of the seas may in a not very distant future bring marine power further into the sea. Also offshore oil and gas exploration is moving into deeper waters and at longer distances from land. New carbon sequestration projects under the seabed are on the way which require a vast amount of electric power consumption. The substitution of offshore power generators by power provided from the grid may have environmental benefits, but the deployment of offshore transmission of bulk electrical power to or from offshore platforms to the electrical grid onshore is a mayor challenge. The main objective of this paper is to focus on trends that can lead to a feasible transmission system in offshore energy systems far from land, and to introduce the technological alternatives which could help to reach that goal. The paper describes the main alternatives and the technical and economical aspects of the transmission of electrical power offshore.

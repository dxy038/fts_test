There are two objectives for optimal module orientation: minimisation of the amount of unused area and of the wire lengths. For the first problem a bottom-up block combining algorithm is used, adapted from a floorplanning algorithm. For the second objective an adaptation of an analytical method is used. The adaptation results in a significant reduction in computation requirements. The authors combined both methods and achieved good results.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of over the limit voltage impressions on typical distribution transformers and the associated consequences on the distributed system. The relationships between the transformer saturations and hysteresis are investigated for transient overvoltages (TOVs) at various voltage levels, KVA ratings, and frequencies. Effects of overvoltage limits are discussed with regards to the performance of the transformer. Examples of TOVs on typical transformer have been presented

The objective of this research is to demonstrate how adaptive wings improve the overall performance of conventional micro air vehicles (MAVs). This will allow MAVs to fulfill missions with different range and endurance requirements, and therefore to perform a wider range of missions than conventional MAVs. These adaptive wings are achieved with the use of macro-fiber composites devices, a low-cost, state-of-the-art system. Moreover, a set of experimental tests at low Reynolds numbers for wings of low aspect ratio has been assessed and validated in this research.

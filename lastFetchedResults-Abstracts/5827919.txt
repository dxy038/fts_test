This paper presents an analysis of the dynamic behavior of manufacturing systems, as a basis for the control study. In this paper we present the special case of an open manufacturing line as an example. We present an analysis as well as an algorithm for minimizing the overall evolution time of a manufacturing line. The objective is to study the effect of changing the flow rate of the pieces arriving to the line on the overall performance of the manufacturing line (settling time, throughput) during the transient and the stationary regions

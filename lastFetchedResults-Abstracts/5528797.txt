The objective of feeder reconfiguration on distribution system during normal operation is to find the best switch operation plan for reducing power losses and enhancing service reliability. By changing on/off status of sectionalizing-switches and tie-switches on a distribution system, feeder reconfiguration can be achieved. Also, the configured system must satisfy operation conditions as well as restrictions. Since the reconfiguration is done by changing the status of switches, it can be categorized as a discrete combinational optimization problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is the one of the methods that can be used to solve optimal problems. Typical PSO is designed for continuous functions optimization, it is not designed for discrete functions optimization. Therefore, the operators of PSO algorithm must be reviewed and redefined to fit the application field of distribution feeder reconfiguration. This paper proposed a method which modifies the operators of PSOÂ´s formula based on the characters of both status of switches and shift operator to construct the binary coding particle swarm optimization for feeder reconfiguration. The test results show that the proposed method can apply to feeder reconfiguration effectively.

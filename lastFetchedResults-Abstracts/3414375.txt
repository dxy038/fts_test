Multilevel power converters have gained much attention in recent years due to their high power quality, low switching losses, and high-voltage capability. These advantages make the multilevel converter a candidate topology for the next generation of naval ship prolusion systems. The primary disadvantage of these systems is the large number of semiconductors involved. This paper presents a reduced-parts-count rectifier which is well suited for naval rectifier applications where bidirectional power flow is not required. The proposed converter is analyzed and experimentally verified on an 18-kW four-level rectifier/inverter system.

Objectives
tudy sought to compare catheter ablation with rate control for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure (HF).
ound
timal therapy for AF in HF is unclear. Drug-based rhythm control has not proved clinically beneficial. Catheter ablation improves cardiac function in patients with HF, but impact on physiological performance has not been formally evaluated in a randomized trial.
s
andomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial, adults with symptomatic HF, radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤35%, and persistent AF were assigned to undergo catheter ablation or rate control. Primary outcome was 12-month change in peak oxygen consumption. Secondary endpoints were quality of life, B-type natriuretic peptide, 6-min walk distance, and EF. Results were analyzed by intention-to-treat.
s
two patients (age 63 ± 9 years, EF 24 ± 8%) were randomized, 26 each to ablation and rate control. At 12 months, 88% of ablation patients maintained sinus rhythm (single-procedure success 68%). Under rate control, rate criteria were achieved in 96%. The primary endpoint, peak oxygen consumption, significantly increased in the ablation arm compared with rate control (difference +3.07 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval: 0.56 to 5.59, p = 0.018). The change was not evident at 3 months (+0.79 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval: −1.01 to 2.60, p = 0.38). Ablation improved Minnesota score (p = 0.019) and B-type natriuretic peptide (p = 0.045) and showed nonsignificant trends toward improved 6-min walk distance (p = 0.095) and EF (p = 0.055).
sions
irst randomized trial of ablation versus rate control to focus on objective exercise performance in AF and HF shows significant benefit from ablation, a strategy that also improves symptoms and neurohormonal status. The effects develop over 12 months, consistent with progressive amelioration of the HF syndrome.

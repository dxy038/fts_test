The wireless communication means is necessary for routine work and emergency operating in nuclear power station. With the developments of wireless technical and nuclear power plant, wireless communication system requires more comprehensive and widespread application. The secure and stable bidirectional wireless communication system is to have an important status in plant communication systems. In certain regions of nuclear power plant, such as nuclear island, RF emitting equipments have requirements to their electromagnetic compatibility, which should confirm to certain standards, to guarantee the operation of safety-related systems and the wireless communication system itself.

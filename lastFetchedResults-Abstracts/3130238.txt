The paper present a new method of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on entropy weight. By establishing the multiple criteria decision making and optimization model, the subjective weight of index in AHP and the objective weight of index in entropy information was obtained to develop an optimization model for the optimal weight of index by the least square method. Then, this method was applied to evaluate the double-stage coupled heat pump system, the groundwater source heat pump system, and the oil-burning boiler heating system for a project in Beijing. The result showed that the decision making index in economy and environment of double-stage coupled heat pump system was 1.0000 and 0.7510, and the comprehensive decision making index was 0.7444, higher than those of others, which meant that the double-stage coupled heat pump was prior to the others. This also indicated that the method of analytic hierarchy process based on entropy weight could be applied to evaluation of multiple criteria decision making problems.

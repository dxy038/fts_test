The objective of this study was to create a method to estimate the temperature distribution at the fill layer underneath a slab-onground
structure of a heated building. It concerns the typical Finnish slab-on-ground structures, where the footing wall
extends above the surrounding soil surface. According to the field measurements and a series of numerical modelling performed
in this study, there are three boundary temperatures having an effect on the temperature distribution underneath a slab-on-ground
structure: the internal, the external and the subsoil temperature. Later, a relation between the numerically determined static-state
weighting factors of these three boundary temperatures and the interrelations of the theoretical thermal transmittance values
of the adjoining structural layers is detected. Based on these observations a new semi-analytical method for the estimation
of temperature distribution along the fill layer underneath a slab-on-ground structure in periodic conditions is developed.
The method applies the superposition principles, where the annual mean boundary temperatures form a basic steadystate
temperature distribution and the amplitudes of the external and internal temperatures contribute periodic seasonal
alterations

Background and objective: In the meat industry, carcass cooling rate is very important due to its
effects on meat quality and economic aspects. Rapid cooling of carcasses causes cold shortening of
muscles and, therefore, results in meat toughening. Electrical stimulation is used in developed
countries as an effective treatment for reducing carcass cooling time and preventing cold
shortening. Electrical stimulation can also increase tenderness of meat. The purpose of this study
was evaluation of the effect of low-voltage electrical stimulation on tenderness and water-holding
capacity in veal.
Materials and methods: Eighteen Holstein steers, 12-14 months of age, with a carcass weight of
243 ± 13 kg (mean ± SD), were stimulated, immediately after exsanguinations, by low voltage (110
V, I A, 20 s). After splitting of the carcasses, from each side a sample of about lkg of M.
Longissimus dorsi was removed. Shear force, sensory tenderness and juiciness were determined at
I, 3 and 7 days post mortem (PM). Water-holding capacity, drip loss and cooking loss were
determined at 7 days PM.
Results: Shear force of the stimulated samples was lower, and their tenderness and juiciness scores
were higher, than the respective control (non-stimulated samples) values at 1,3 and 7 days PM (P <
0.05). (P < 0.05). Ageing resulted in a decrease in the shear force and an increase in the sensory
tenderness and juiciness scores I and 7 days PM (P<0.05 in both the stimulated and non-stimulated
samples. Electrical stimulation had no significant effect on the water-holding capacity, drip loss and
cooking loss,
Conclusion: According to the results of this research, application of electrical stimulation IS an
effective treatment for improving tenderness and juiciness of veal.

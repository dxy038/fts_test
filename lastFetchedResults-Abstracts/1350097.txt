Background: It is important to protect oocytes and embryos from oxidative stress in the culture medium. Melatonin has been shown to be a direct free radical scavenger. Objective: Effect of melatonin during in vitro oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryo development of mouse oocytes was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Oocytes from supper-ovulated mouse were divided to two groups: cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs, group I) and denuded COC (d-COCs, group II). The oocytes were cultured in maturation medium with different doses of melatonin (1Ã—101-105 nM). The cumulus expansion and nuclear status were evaluated after 24 h of in-vitro maturation. The oocytes were used for in-vitro fertilization. The fertilized oocytes were cultured in medium supplemented with different doses of melatonin. Results: The expansion (86.79%) and maturation (80.55%) rate of COCs increased in supplemented medium with 10 nM of melatonin vs. control group (73.33%), p=0.006 and p=0.026 respectively), but oocytes without cumulus cells indicated higher maturation rate at higher melatonin doses (10 and 100 ?M, 84.34% and 79.5% respectively( vs. 69.33% in control group (p=0.002). Fertilization rate was higher in treated medium with 1 ?M of melatonin (93.75%, p=0.007). The rate of cleavage and blastocyst formation was promoted in medium supplemented with 10 and 100 nM of melatonin (92.37% and 89.36% vs. 81.25% in control group, p=0.002). We observed a dose dependent response to melatonin treatment in this experiment. Conclusion: Exogenous melatonin can promote cumulus cell expansion, in vitro oocyte maturation, and embryo development. However we investigated a dose-dependent response in different stages of maturation and development. It may reflect sensitive rate of oocytes and embryos to culture conditions.

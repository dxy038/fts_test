We proposed earlier an optimization approach to flow control where the objective of the control is to maximize the aggregate utility of all sources over their transmission rates. The control mechanism is derived as a gradient projection algorithm to solve the dual problem. The algorithm assumes that each source is served by a single path. In this paper we extend the algorithm to the case where there are multiple paths between a source-destination pair. This allows flow control and routing to be jointly optimized

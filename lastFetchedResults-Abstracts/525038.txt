Background: Although it is well-known that the incidence of developmental delay in high-risk infants is higher than in low-risk ones, little is known about the risk factors among Iranian infants. The objective of this study was to determine the various pre-, peri-, and neonatal factors in developmental delay in participants and to compare the incidence of each factor with that of the normal population. Methods: The Infant Neurological International Battery developmental assessment was employed as the diagnostic tool by a team of experts. Neurological examinations were performed and a questionnaire was completed as well. The subjects consisted of 6,150 infants divided into two groups respectively, with normal and abnormal scores for the evaluation over a period of 12 months in city of Karaj (Tehran Province). Results: The mean age of the participants was 39 weeks. Factors associated with a significant increased risk of developmental delay in the studied population included postneonatal seizures (OR=5.54, 95%CI: 3.1 – 9.6), neonatal seizures (OR=4.37, 95%CI: 1.7 – 10.8), preterm delivery (OR=2.52, 95%CI: 1.3 – 4.7), and type II pneumonia (OR=2.39, 95%CI: 1.4 – 3.8). Conclusion: To increase the survival rate of neonates and effectiveness of early intervention, the above-mentioned risk factors could be considered as valuable clues. Routine neurodevelopmental screening for neonates and infants for early detection of neurodevelopmental delays is highly recommended. If economic limitations prevent mass-screening of neonates, at least high-risk infants should be routinely re-evaluated.

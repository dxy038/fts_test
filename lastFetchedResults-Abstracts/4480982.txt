The integration of system and SW functions for efficiency, performance and especially dependability is of interest from a research and system design perspective. We propose a framework for directing the process of integration of SW functions, with the objective of designing and maintaining desired dependability attributes of the system over the integration process. Rules of composition for integrated functions, and measures to quantify the goodness of dependable system integration are also addressed

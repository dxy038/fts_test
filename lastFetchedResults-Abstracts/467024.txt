Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize gestational profiles of biochemical markers that are associated with preeclampsia in the blood of pregnant women in whom preeclampsia developed later and to compare these markers with the markers of women who were delivered of small-for-gestational-age infants without preeclampsia and with women who were at low risk for the development of preeclampsia. Study Design: This was a prospective case control study. The subjects were women at risk of preeclampsia who were enrolled in the placebo arm of a clinical trial. Indices of antioxidant status, oxidative stress, placental and endothelial function, and serum lipid concentrations were evaluated from 20 weeks of gestation until delivery in 21 women in whom preeclampsia developed later, in 17 women without preeclampsia who were delivered of small-for-gestational-age infants, and in 27 women who were at low risk for the development of preeclampsia. Results: Ascorbic acid was reduced early in preeclampsia and small-for-gestational-age pregnancies. Leptin, placenta growth factor, the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1)/PAI-2 ratio, and uric acid were predictive of the development of preeclampsia. Conclusion: Gestational profiles of several markers were abnormal in the group with preeclampsia, and some of the markers that may prove useful in the selective prediction of preeclampsia were identified.

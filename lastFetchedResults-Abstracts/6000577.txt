The increasing popularity of GPS (Global Positioning System) device has boosted many applications, especially those for GPS information visualization. Information visualization techniques are invaluable tools in numerous applications. The goal of this work is to provide visual access to GPS information through the proposed trip planning web application. The main focus is on visualization, organization, fast retrieval, and effective understanding of GPS data mainly for public use, and the simplest way to plan the journey through the city. The main objective is to introduce this internet-based application to the users of the public transport services. The GPS technology is a new technology in Macedonia and trip planning is not implemented yet, although it has been used in many countries remarkably within the last years. Combining the collected GPS and timetable data in order to bring passengers to a desired location, the goal of journey planner is to reduce travel related risks and uncertainties for passengers who want to travel to an unknown part of the city, or tourists, elderly people or people who usually do not use public transport service.

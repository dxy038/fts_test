This paper presents a dynamic frequency allocation method which aims at optimizing the spectrum assignment in cognitive wireless sensor networks used for avionic control applications. The main objective is to improve the frequency utilization of the avionic bands by enabling the sensor nodes (i.e. secondary users or SUs) sharing the spectrum with primary avionic systems (i.e. PUs) without disturbing them while keeping the network connectivity. Furthermore, we propose the integration of a new entity called Avionic Spectrum Controller (ASC) in order to enhance the spectrum allocation process. This entity is responsible for the prioritization of PUs and the coordination and synchronization between SUs and the reduction of the inter-WSN interference. The performance evaluation work shows that the proposed algorithm enhances the frequency assignment delay as well as the rate of satisfied requests for communication.

The shortest path algorithm is the core problems in intelligent transportation system (ITS), especially for the large scale networks. The problem is classically solved by Dijkstra and Floyed algorithm. Meanwhile, many techniques are proposed to improve the algorithms heuristically. In most researches, such techniques are considered individually. In this paper, we propose an improved shortest path algorithm called Bidirectional Search Algorithm Based-on Index(BSABI) for large scare network. The main idea of BSABI is that it considers a combination of Search Base-on Index and Bidirectional Search. Both analysis results and experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

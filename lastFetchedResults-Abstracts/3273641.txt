This paper investigates agent-based modelling and design of a mission planning module for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Agents can act on behalf of remote human operators, who impose mission objectives, performing autonomous or supervised behaviours. The planning module is in charge to deliberate the strategic tasks to achieve mission objectives and to satisfy environment constraints (area of operations, aircraft performances, etc.). However agent\Â´s autonomy level should be variable because the remote pilot is able to carry out "all level" control (strategic, tactical or remote piloting control). Here we define a multi-objective model for implementing a goal-directed decision making support to the planning module. The statement of the problem and the related design concept are described.

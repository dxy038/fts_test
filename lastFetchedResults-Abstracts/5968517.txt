In recent years, numerous large-scale Wireless LANs (WLAN) have been deployed all over the world. However, the shortage of non-interfering channels makes it a challenge for WLANs to efficiently support real-time multicast services. In this paper, we study the problem of efficient scheduling of <i>real-time</i> <i>multicast</i> <i>flows</i>. For mitigating interferences, we allow access-points (APs) to transmit simultaneously only if they are mutually non-interfering and our objective is minimizing the fraction of time used by the APs for servicing the multicast flows. We introduce two multicast strategies, the <i>association</i> <i>strategy</i> for which each user is restricted to receive flows only from its associated AP and the <i>non-association</i> strategy for which a user may also decode transmissions from other APs in its vicinity. Under both strategies, the scheduling problem of minimizing the multicast service time is NP-hard and we propose simple approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds. Our simulations clearly demonstrate that the proposed algorithms yield efficient multicast scheduling.

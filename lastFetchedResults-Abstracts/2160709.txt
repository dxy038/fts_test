The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent bacteriophage assay (FBA) for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef and raw milk. The FBA is a two step assay that combines immunomagnetic separation, to separate the target organism from mixed culture, with a highly specific fluorescently stained bacteriophage to label the E. coli O157:H7 cells. When used in conjunction with flow cytometry, the FBA was able to detect 2.2 CFU/g of artificially contaminated ground beef following a 6 h enrichment. Between 101 and 102 CFU/ml of artificially contaminated raw milk were detectable after a 10 h enrichment step. The results show that the FBA is potentially useful as a rapid technique for the preliminary detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food.

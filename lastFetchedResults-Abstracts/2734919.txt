Voltage sags are one of the main problems in transmission and distribution grids with high penetration of distributed generation. This paper proposes a voltage support control scheme for grid-connected power sources under voltage sags. The control is based on the injection of reactive current with a variable ratio between positive and negative sequences. The controller determines, also, the amount of reactive power needed to restore the dropped voltage magnitudes to new reference values confined within the continuous operation limits required in grid codes. These reference values are chosen in order to guarantee low current injection when fulfilling the voltage support objective. Selected experimental results are reported in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

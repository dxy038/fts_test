The bidirectional dynamic behavior of walls strengthened with composite materials is studied. For that purpose, a multi-layered high order finite element is developed. The finite element accounts for the bidirectional (plate-type) dynamic behavior and for the interfacial interaction between the adhesively bonded components. The formulation uses a viscoelastic first order shear deformation orthotropic plate theory for the independent modeling of the existing wall and the composite layers and a high order theory for the displacement fields of the adhesive layers. The Finite element framework simplifies the coupling with adjacent structural elements and the use of standard computational procedures. The convergence of the formulation and two numerical examples are studied. The first case studies the response of a strengthened wall to a step base acceleration. The second case studies a wall built in a surrounding frame and strengthened on the outer face. The numerical study examines the capabilities of the model and reveals some of the unique aspect of the dynamic response, including the effects of the orthotropy and orientation of the strengthening system. It also highlights the potential of the high order finite element to become a platform for the modeling and dynamic analysis of the strengthened wall.

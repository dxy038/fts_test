Seidel intramedullary humeral nail is locked distally by a spreading device and proximally by transverse cross locking screws. The main problems found in its use are: the loosening of the distal anchorage, even after X-ray verification of the correct expansion of the device; the formation of distal fractures, occurring even 1 month after the operation; the system's low stability.

oblems noted can be ascribed to the behaviour of the spreading device for distal fixing. The present study, therefore, was directed at analysing the contact between the spreading mechanism and the medullary canal in relation to the geometric parameters of the mechanism itself. The main objective was to define the correct regulation of the expansion in the operating theatre, and to delimit the more appropriate conditions of use, allowing the surgeon to evaluate the suitability of this particular device for the type of fracture under treatment.

cal and experimental techniques were used to perform an analysis of the implant behaviour. This investigation, referred to immediate post-operative condition, allowed to evaluate the stability to traction of the system, to define the typology and properties of the bone-implant contact zone and to quantify the stresses produced, all as a function of the parameter on which the surgeon intervenes in the operating theatre: the number of turns used to tighten the spreading screw.

sults obtained confirm and explain the disadvantages associated with the distal expansion system: the bone-implant contact turns out to be inefficient, as revealed by the distribution of the pressure on the inner wall of the medullary canal.

 basis of the results, it is possible to define the optimal conditions of use of the nail, and to formulate a simple solution for the improvement of its performance.

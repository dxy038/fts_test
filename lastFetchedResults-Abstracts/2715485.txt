In this paper, the conventional I- and T-type three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) inverter for low-voltage renewable energy systems is first investigated. Literature research shows that the T-type inverter improves I-typeÂ´s insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) + IGBT current paths. However, the IGBT + diode paths are the same. The calculation in this paper further reveals that the IGBT + diode current paths dominate the conduction losses and even the whole semiconductor losses. Based on the aforementioned recognitions, a novel T-type inverter is presented as an alternative to be applied in the low-voltage renewable energy systems. In the proposed 3L-NPC, four CoolMosfets replace the IGBT + diode middle bidirectional switch. In the proposed topology, there is no diode involved in the current path supposing the unity power factor. In this way, the conduction loss is expected to be reduced compared with that from the conventional T-type 3L-NPC, particularly in the low and medium power ranges.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) / blood pressure (BP) telemonitor consisting of comprehensive integration of various electrical engineering concepts, devices, and methods was developed. This personal digital assistant-based (PDAbased) system focused on integration of biopotential amplifiers, photoplethysmographic measurement of blood pressure, microcontroller devices, programming methods, wireless transmission, signal filtering and analysis, interfacing, and long term memory devices (24 hours) to develop a state-of-the-art ECG/BP telemonitor. These instrumentation modules were developed and tested to realize a complete and compact system that could be deployed to assist in telemedicine applications and heart rate variability studies. The specific objective of this device was to facilitate the long term monitoring and recording of ECG and blood pressure signals. This device was able to acquire ECG/BP waveforms, transmit them wirelessly to a PDA, save them onto a compact flash memory, and display them on the LCD screen of the PDA. It was also capable of calculating the heart rate (HR) in beats per minute, and providing systolic and diastolic blood pressure values.

A 3.5 months old male infant presented with cough and fever from 45-day- old. Chest X-ray examination revealed a pneumonic patch. Various treatments including antibiotic therapy were not effective.  Finally pulmonary tuberculosis was confirmed by gastric washing. We emphasize that tuberculosis should be considered for neonates or infants with unresponsive pneumonia because delayed diagnosis is associated with a fatal outcome.

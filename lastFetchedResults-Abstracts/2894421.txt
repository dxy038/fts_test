The objective of this paper is to present the architecture of a pedagogical agent dedicated to provide a metacognitive scaffolding through interactive learning environments (ILE). Such a learning situation requires a well-developed metacognitive competence since learner is often alone with the computer. ILEs do not provide any support at this level. For this reason we had the idea of designing a pedagogical agent that performs this function in order to improve the quality of teaching by means of these environments.

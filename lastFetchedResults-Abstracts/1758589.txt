The release of Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General in May 2000 raised national, state, and local awareness, for the first time ever, of the impact of oral disease in America. The report emphasized oral health's link to general health and well-being, and called for a national effort among individuals, communities, and health care providers to improve oral health among all Americans. One of the objectives from the Surgeon General's Report On Oral Health was to “advance the science base and translate into practice.” Our objective here is to address how the science base has progressed in 3 main areas that have significant potential to impact oral health: sequencing of the human genome, tissue engineering, and saliva diagnostics. A secondary objective is to comment on progress in our understanding of dental caries and its impact on young children.

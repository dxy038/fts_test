Objective(s): Osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures are usually considered conditions of post-menopausal or elderly women, but these problems also occur in men. In fact, nearly 30 percent of hip fractures occur in men.
Because osteoporosis is clinically silent until fractures occur, men at risk for osteoporosis and those who have the disease need to be identified.
The purpose of this study was to investigate BMD variation and prevalence of osteoporosis in men. Methods: Among a sample of male aged 10 to 76 years old, 403 individuals from 50 clusters were randomly selected, following exclusion of people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, menstrual problem, fractures or other conditions affecting bone metabolism. All participants underwent clinical examination and lumbar and spinal densitometry using DXA method.
Results: In lumbar spine, the duration of peak bone density was between 25 and 40years old and bone loss started at 40 and after 50-bone loss was quickly. In hip, the duration of peak bone mass was from 20 to 30 years old. Bone loss after 50 years old was increased. Prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in men older than 50 years old were 3.9% and 50%, respectively. Osteoporosis in men significantly was related with increase in age and decrease in body mass index.
Conclusion: Osteoporosis in men is now recognized as an increasingly important public health issue. Adequate intake of Ca and vitamin D can be improved bone loss. Peak bone density in 20 to 39 years old male population could be useful indicator for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

Control system synthesis problem is considered. We have to find a control function as a function of the systemÂ´s state. Synthesized control system should provide meeting a goal objective for the set of initial conditions. Grammatical evolution and network operator methods were considered as means for control systems synthesis. Computational experiments were performed for the non-linear control system synthesis for the Duffing oscillator.

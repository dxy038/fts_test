In this paper we present new oversampled modulator architectures for A/D conversion. The objective is to obtain great simplification of the analog front-end circuits at the expense of a more complex digital signal processing for the bit stream decoding. The system can be segmented into a front-end block and a bitstream processor communicating through noise-immune signal lines. This makes possible the remote placement at the source site of a simple front-end circuit while preserving signal integrity

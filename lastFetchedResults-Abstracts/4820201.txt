Web hypermedia applications have evolved from a simple static information webpage to a more complex web application, supporting sequence of complex processes and transactional workflows. The coexistence of various design features and modeling concepts in web hypermedia engineering therefore raises new issues on modeling approach paradigm. In this paper, we present and discuss the uses of object oriented approach and UML paradigm for complex web hypermedia design. Our main objective is to propose a hypermedia design method, called Com<sup>+</sup>HDM, which is based on UML profile and its general extension mechanisms. We define and propose specific modeling elements, called stereotypes to model conceptual, navigational, and user interface aspects of complex web hypermedia applications. The novelty of our design method stands in the modeling concepts, stereotypes used, and design patterns of the modeling approaches. Some arguments and future refinements will be summarized at the end of the paper.

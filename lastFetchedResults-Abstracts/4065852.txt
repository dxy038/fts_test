A system is considered in which <e1>V</e1> users are competing for the transmission capacity of a link. The users generate messages in a Poisson manner. The message length distribution of each user is arbitrary and may differ for different users. The objective is to investigate nonpreemptive service-time independent scheduling as a means of selectively controlling the average waiting time of the users. The average waiting time assignments that can be realized are characterized. They can be used to establish, in <e1>O</e1>(<e1>V</e1> log <e1>V</e1>) computations, whether a given average waiting time assignment is feasible. The proof of the result relies on a universal scheduling strategy which is simple, is time-invariant, and can be used to realize any feasible average waiting time assignment. A waiting time cost function is associated with each user in order to investigate the problem of finding a nonpreemptive scheduling strategy that minimizes the overall waiting time cost. A set of optimality conditions is given for this problem, and an algorithm is constructed solving it in <e1>O </e1>(<e1>V</e1>) log <e1>V</e1> steps. With a simple modification, the algorithm also solves the problem of finding a nonpreemptive scheduling strategy that minimizes the lexicographic ordering of the waiting time costs. Results are extended to the preemptive case

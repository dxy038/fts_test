In this paper, theoretical and numerical analysis for Rayleigh Backscattering (RB) in TDM-PON full-duplex single-fiber bidirectional transmission with burst mode upstream and reflective ONU are presented. The results show that some scenarios, based on wavelength-reuse networks, require special criteria for the bandwidth allocation to avoid excessive RB due to crosstalk between ONUs.

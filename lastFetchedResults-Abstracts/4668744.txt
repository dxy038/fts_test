SESAR Concept of Operations set out in the SESAR Definition Phase (2006-2008) addressed the issue of the inadequacy of the current ATM communication link identifying new communication technologies that will enable improved voice and data exchanges due to the estimated increase of the flight traffic in the future. Currently SESAR WP15 addresses the non-avionic CNS technologies development and validation comprising the definition of the future mobile datalink systems to serve communication services. Within WP15, the overall objective of the Project 15.2.6 &#8220;Future mobile satellite communication&#8221; is to define the requirements for the future Satellite Communication System developed in the ESA Iris Programme, to perform the complementary activities of validation and to support the standardization of the new satellite link. The present paper describes the status of P15.2.6 on going activities.

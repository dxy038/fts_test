Motion Compensated Frame Interpolation (MCFI) is a commonly used method to enhance the temporal resolution of video sequences. However, when scene change occurs, there is less temporal correlation between frames, so the interpolation technique canÂ´t work well. Moreover, this motion-based method always induces visual artifacts due to incorrect motion vectors. In this paper, firstly a scene change detection method is proposed to detect whether the scene changed. If the scene change occurs, the extrapolation technique will be used, otherwise, the interpolation will be selected. Second, in order to eliminate the hole and overlapping problems induced by the conventional method, the direct bilateral motion estimation method is used to obtain the motion vector field. Then a motion vector processing method is utilized to correct and refine the unreliable motion vectors with variable block sizes, so the object boundaries and structure information can be preserved. Finally, adaptive motion compensation will be given to get the skipped frame. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides both better subjective and objective quality.

Electrical interaction of Engine Cooling Fan (ECF) with Heat Exchanger would strongly influence the electromagnetic behavior, and hence the EMC test results. Motivation and Objective for extensive and exhaustive component-level Electro-Magnetic Compliance (EMC) tests relies on close correlation and harmony between the vehicle-level and component-level test results. In fact, comprehensive component-level tests are presumed to indicate that most stringent possible vehicle-level Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) scenario is exercised in order to relieve expensive vehicle-level tests. This paper examines a component-level test scenario for an ECF according to OEM approved EMC test-plan mandating non-conductive air-flow load, thus resulting in AM band (0.53 MHz - 1.7 MHz) radiated emission deviations. Radiated Emissions (RE) deviations root-cause studies and troubleshooting indicates Amplitude Modulated (AM) band radiated emission compliance would result when a grounded metallic heat-exchanger is used.

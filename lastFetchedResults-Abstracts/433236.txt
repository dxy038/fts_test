A 20-year-old patient who had a single ventricle and pulmonary stenosis presented with recurrent hemoptysis 12 years after a Fontan-type operation. He was referred to us because of unsuccessful treatment with a tentative diagnosis of lung tuberculosis for 3 months. He had been relatively well for the prior 12 years, although he had attacks of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and had underwent successful catheter ablation 3 years ago. Aortography revealed multiple collateral arteries as a cause of hemoptysis and coil embolization of these collateral arteries successfully stopped the hemoptysis. This case illustrates that collateral arteries may stay open or develop, and these collateral arteries can become a source of hemoptysis long after a Fontan-type operation.

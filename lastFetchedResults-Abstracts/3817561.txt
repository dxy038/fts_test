The objective of this letter is to report on the usefulness of a 1-dimensional map for characterizing the dynamics of a third-order piecewise-linear circuit. The map is used to reproduce period-doubling birfureations and particularly to compute FeigenbaumÂ´s number. The 1-dimensional map gives qualitatively identical results as the circuit equations and proved to be far more computationally efficient.

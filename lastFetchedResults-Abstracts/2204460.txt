Near Infrared absorbing colorants have several applications in the high technology area like heat ray blocking, energy conversion, and optical data storage. All these applications require that the colorants need to have broadband absorption extending up to the NIR region as well improved thermal stability. With the above objective in mind several analogues of pigment Green B (C.I. Acid Green 1) are prepared with improved thermal stability. These novel colorants are obtained by the incorporation of carboxamide group which imparts higher thermal stability. The spectral and TGA studies have shown that they are superior colorants, for application into photovoltaic cells.

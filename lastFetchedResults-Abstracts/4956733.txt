In this paper, power system transmission network planning is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem. In this context, three objectives: investment cost, reliability and environmental impact are considered in the optimization. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional mathematical optimization method in arriving at local optimum and dimension disasters, etc., we introduced the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique into transmission network optimal planning for the first time, from which the optimal scheme is generated. A case on transmission network planning problem is presented to show the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency, compared with the existing optimal planning methods, the search time of the particle swarm optimization method is shorter and the result is close to the ideal solution, simultaneously.

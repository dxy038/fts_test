The objective was to determine whether children with a physician parent receive treatment different from that of children of nonphysician parents when they present to the emergency department (ED). The design was a retrospective cohort study. The setting was a university-affiliated children's hospital ED. All children with a physician parent seen in the ED during a 16-month period were identified. Children with a nonphysician parent were matched to children with a physician parent by date and time of visit. Length of stay in ED, performance of laboratory or radiological testing, evaluation by a consultant, and training level of the least experienced physician to evaluate the patient in the ED were measured. The authors identified 92 children with a physician parent and 181 children with nonphysician parents. Children of physician parents were similar to controls with regard to age, sex, nursing acuity level, length of stay, and whether a laboratory or radiographic procedure was performed. Children with a physician parent saw significantly fewer nonconsultant physicians while in the ED (P = .005). Compared with controls, the most junior member of the medical team seen by children of a physician parent was less likely to be a medical student (relative risk [RR] = 0.22) or a resident (RR = 0.71) and more likely to be an ED staff physician (RR = 1.52) or consultant (RR = 1.84). This trend was statistically significant (P = .002). The children of physician parents are more likely to see only an ED staff physician and/or consultant and less likely to see trainees than other children presenting to the pediatric ED.

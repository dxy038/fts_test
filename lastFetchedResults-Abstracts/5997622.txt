This paper put forward a novel method fusion image quality assessment based on modulation transfer function (MTF) as a kind of objective guideline. Different temporal image from the same area was fused by Erdas and ENVI software using different methods. Fusion image quality assessment was implemented by comparing MTF curves from reference image and fusion image. The feasibility and reliability of MTF method were tested with remote sensing images. As showed in this paper, the MTF can describe objectively not only the quality of fusion images themselves, but the difference among fusion methods. Because of the coincidence of the assessment conclusion achieved by MTF method and human vision system (HVS), the MTF method has the character of combining with objectivity and subjectivity.

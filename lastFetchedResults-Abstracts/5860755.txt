This paper describes a design and development of a graphical user interface (GUI) panel for microprocessor-based controller for a flying robot applications. The robot consists of a mini-aerial helicopter with a build-in integrated camera that linked to a PC-based controller that manipulated by a GUI Panel program. A couple of full duplex transceivers are used to provide wireless communications between the controller and the flying robots. The main objective is building advanced GUI panel that could simulate and visualize high-performance robot systems for further image acquisition and analysis. The test result is well described and the vision data captured is encouraging for future development. Some problems is also being notified for further improvement of the flying robot system.

Introduction. The non-enzymatic glycation of Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a naturally occurring chemical modification of apolipoprotein B as a result of condensation between lysine residues and glucose. Glycated LDL is poorly recognized by LDL receptors and initiates different processes that can be considered proatherogenic. Thus, LDL glycation may contribute in the increased atherosclerotic risk of patients with diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of naturally occurring flavonols on LDL glycation in vitro. Methods. In this study, LDL was isolated from EDTA-plasma by ultracentrifugation using a single step discontinuous gradient. Then, glucose was added to LDL and LDL glycation level was estimated in absence and presence of flavonols by sodium periodate assay. Results. This study was showed that five flavonols: quercetin, myricetin, kaempferol, rutin and morin decreased LDL glycation in a dose-dependent manner. Also, it was demonstrated this nutrients decreased electrophoretic mobility of glycated LDL. Conclusion. The results of this investigation show that flavonols probably with their antioxidant properties inhibited LDL glycation and thus may have a role in ameliorating atherosclerotic risk of patients with diabetes mellitus.

We study and solve a particular stochastic version of the Restricted Shortest Path Problem, the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Delay Excess Penalty. While arc costs are kept deterministic, arc delays are assumed to be normally distributed and a penalty per time unit occurs whenever the given delay constraint is not satisfied. The objective is to minimize the sum of path cost and total delay penalty.

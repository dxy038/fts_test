For solving module partition problem in mass customization, this paper presents an approach based on genetic algorithm. The main foundation of module partition is according to the structural and functional associated value between product component parts, the relevance between component parts in the product life cycle at different stages is analyzed comprehensively, and a relational matrix on relevance evaluation is established. The paper presents an objective function for module partition according to the principle of module partition. Then the genetic algorithm based on 0-1 matrix-coded method was adopted to resolve the module partition problem. Finally the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated with example.

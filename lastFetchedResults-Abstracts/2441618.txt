The design of fault tolerant systems is gaining importance in large domains of embedded applications where design constrains are as important as reliability. New software techniques, based on selective application of redundancy, have shown remarkable fault coverage with reduced costs and overheads. However, the large number of different solutions provided by these techniques, and the costly process to assess their reliability, make the design space exploration a very difficult and time-consuming task. This paper proposes the integration of a multi-objective optimization tool with a software hardening environment to perform an automatic design space exploration in the search for the best trade-offs between reliability, cost, and performance. The first tool is commanded by a genetic algorithm which can simultaneously fulfill many design goals thanks to the use of the NSGA-II multi-objective algorithm. The second is a compiler-based infrastructure that automatically produces selective protected (hardened) versions of the software and generates accurate overhead reports and fault coverage estimations. The advantages of our proposal are illustrated by means of a complex and detailed case study involving a typical embedded application, the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

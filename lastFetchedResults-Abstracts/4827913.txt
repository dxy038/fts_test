Objective: This study describes the design and testing of a system designed to quantify improvement in reaching and grasping abilities of the hemiparetic arm and hand of patients post stroke after a series of interactive virtual reality (VR) simulated training sessions. Methods: Five subjects post stroke participated in a two-week training session consisting of interactive computer games for 2-2.5 hours per session. SubjectsÂ´ finger joint angles were measured during a kinematic reach to grasp test using CyberGlove&#8482; and arm joint angles were measured using the trackSTAR&#8482; system prior to training and after training. Downward force applied to the object during grasping was measured using a force sensor system. Results: There was a significant decrease in force applied to objects when grasping post VR training and an improvement in preshaping the hand during the transport phase. Conclusion: A system utilizing magnetic trackers, a data glove, and a force sensor may be sensitive to changes in motor performance elicited by a robotically facilitated, virtually simulated motor intervention.

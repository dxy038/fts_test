This paper is mainly devoted to an Electronic Hydraulic Brake system (EHB) which is driven by two motors. The main objective of this system is to control the brake pedal feel and the hydraulic pressure of the system actively, realizing the maximum braking energy recovery and utilizing the pressure produced by manpower sufficiently. This study can also be used to self-driving cars. Based on the designed dual-motor driving EHB system, a control strategy is introduced and the feasibility of it is verified by using the software AMEsim. The simulation results show that this control strategy can achieve functions well.

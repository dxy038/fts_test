The author describes the use of cryptographic authentication for controlling computer viruses. The objective is to protect against viruses infecting software distributions, updates, and programs stored or executed on a system. The authentication determines the source and integrity of an executable, relying on the source to produce virus-free software. The scheme relies on a trusted (and verifiable, where possible) device, the authenticator, used to authenticate and update programs and convert programs between the various formats. In addition, each userÂ´s machine uses a similar device to perform run-time checking

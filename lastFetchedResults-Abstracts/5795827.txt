The results of usability evaluation of a telemedicine system for interventional cardiology are presented. The demonstrator is located in Catalonia, Spain (AlM2011 EU project) and has been used since August 1994. The evaluation has been done using a structured methodology that analyzes both components of usability: objective component (efficiency and effectiveness) and subjective component (user attitude). This procedure was complemented with other quality (functional) evaluations and an initial cost-benefit analysis (CBA), from which a complete ´utility´ evaluation for the clinical protocol was generated. The particular conclusions can be partially generalized to general telemedicine systems, new environments with lacking of CBA experience.

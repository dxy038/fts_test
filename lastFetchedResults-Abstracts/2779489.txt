Latin American universities are not foreign to the challenges of curriculum reform being implemented worldwide in engineering schools. One of these challenges is the development of adequate tools for the training of engineers for the electricity industry. This paper proposes a new methodology, called "Power exchange Game," consistent with curricular renovation. Its main objective is to diminish the existing gap between theory and practice in the industry. In this context, the proposed simulation scheme allows student groups operate as market agents and they are free to create their own strategies. Results are validated by a student survey concluding that the proposed learning framework provides a useful mechanism for understanding and explaining the observed phenomena, and it also promotes the employability Latin American students. The proposed framework can be extended to other disciplines.

Geographic information technology helps the oil and gas industry organize data and develop new prospects for the exploration, drilling, production, refinement, transportation, distribution of the oil as well as the preservation of the environment. The integration of geographic information systems (GIS), electronic meeting systems (EMS), and workflow concepts, introduces a new approach called SPeCS. This system intends to support the aspects of multi-objective spatial analysis within a distributed GIS with tools that can help a group to cope with all activities in this kind of project. It should aid design team members with coordination features that can vary from workflow facilities to tools that can help them achieve resolutions which shall represent the consensus in a decision-making process. This work presents the use of the SPeCS system in the BamPetro project, which explores the coordination in a spatial collaborative system that supports the georeferencing of the argumentations which were produced by the discussion involving the members of the design team. The main task of these groups is to produce a proposal for environmental preservations or changes taking into account social economics, climate, water and soil aspects.

A thorough analysis is conducted of a novel scalar control method for the operation of direct frequency changers using bidirectional switches that operate at high switching frequencies. The method uses the instantaneous voltage ratio of specific input phase voltages to generate the active and zero states of the various switches. A voltage transfer ratio as high as 0.87 is obtained under synchronous and asynchronous operation with a conventionally connected three-phase load. Moreover, the converter operation can be set to produce almost any power displacement factor, independently of load power factor

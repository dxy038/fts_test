Pore pressure and fracture pressure of the oil industry are important parameters in the exploration and drilling. The accurate estimation of pore pressure and fracture pressure and optimal selection of drilling mud pressure can fracture the formation during drilling problems and the loss can be prevented. Prerequisites for a successful drilling, detailed route planning, drilling, tubing and mud density, fracture pressure, pore pressure, overburden pressure and hydrostatic pressure is. However, planning drilling operations by eliminating problems, avoid losses of life and property, reduce technical risk, reduce drilling costs, safety and environmental issues well, is very important. The main objective of this study was to determine the breakdown pressure well in one of hydrocarbon fields in order to avoid going waste drilling mud, a waste of time, loss wells drilling string is trap. method most widely used methods for estimating pore pressure are Eaton and Bowers. In this study, the relationship Eaton is used to compare the pressures obtained by the method has also been used Bowers. after calculating the fracture pressure of two methods and the results showed that values obtained by these two methods are close to me and little difference to reveal

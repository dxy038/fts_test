Objectives
estigate the most recurrent deletion loci on 3p12-p26 by deletion mapping studies by PCR-LOH and BAC array-FISH in sporadic conventional renal cell carcinoma (cRCC) and further, to evaluate the their clinicopathologic significance in cRCC. Comparative allelotyping studies in cRCC and major epithelial carcinomas (MEC) such as lung, breast, and bladder tumors were also carried out to investigate the specificity of the targeted loci in cRCC.
ts and methods
l of 40 c-RCC patients were enrolled in this study, categorized in to 2 groups: group I comprises of patients of stages I and II and group II includes patients at stages III and IV. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies were performed by PCR using 15 microsatellite markers of region 3p12-p26 on paired normal-tumor tissues. The recurrent LOH loci found in 27 cRCC tumors were further validated by BAC array-FISH using 23 serially mapped BAC clones. Simultaneously, the allelic deletion status of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene was studied by FISH in cRCC and major epithelial carcinoma (MEC) tumors. The numerical aberrations of chromosome 3 were also studied using the centromere enumeration probe (CEP) probe for chromosome 3 to validate the observed allelic losses by BAC array-FISH in cRCC as well as MECs.
s
udy revealed 3 affected regions of LOH on 3p in cRCC: 3p12.2-p14.1, 3p14.2-p21.1, and 3p24.2-p26.1 in both group I (stages I and II) and group II (stage III and IV). Comparative allelotyping studies revealed that except for LOH loci D3S2406 (20%), D3S1766 (14%), and D3S1560 (20%), remaining affected loci revealed retention of heterozygosity (ROH) in breast carcinomas. Lung and bladder tumors revealed ROH at all affected LOH loci. FISH with FHIT gene probe revealed deletions in cRCC (88%), breast (30%), and lung tumors (10%). FHIT gene deletions frequency was almost equal in both groups I and II (&gt;70%), whereas a locus 3p13 (D3S2454) revealed the highest LOH in group II (83%) patients in comparison to group I (16%). BAC array-FISH studies in cRCC identified 15 recurrent deletion loci at crucial regions, 3p12.2, 3p14.2, 3p21.3, and 3p24.2-p26 with long continuous deletion of 3p14.1-p26.1 exclusively in patients of stages III and IV. Validation of LOH loci in breast carcinomas by BAC array-FISH with BAC clones mapped at these loci revealed comparatively lower deletion frequency for RP11-59E22 (3p12.2) (30%), RP11-759B7(3p21.1) (12%), and RP11-57D6 (3p25.2, proximal to VHL) (15%) than cRCC.
sion
lar cytogenetic studies by BAC array-FISH was found to be more sensitive over LOH. Deletion patterns on 3p explored that deletion of FHIT and flanking loci may occur as an initiating event followed by deletions at 3p12.2, 3p21.31–3p21.32, and 3p24.2–3p26.1 in the initial stage of development of disease, while continuous large deletions of 3p21.3–3p26.1 and 3p14.1–3p26.1 occur as progressive deletion due to genetic instability. Lack of VHL along with flanking loci in 50% cRCC patients that included both groups I and II supported the hypothesis of both VHL dependent and VHL independent pathways in cRCC tumorigenesis. Comparative allelotyping studies in cRCC and MECs indicated association of specific targeted loci including VHL in cRCC. Further expansion of these studies with characterization of the genes at targeted loci and correlation with clinical outcome will explore the prognostic significance and also provide an insight into the mechanisms of tumor suppressive pathways in genitourinary cancers such as CRCC.

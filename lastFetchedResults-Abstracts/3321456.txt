Adaptive video streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a recent technology adopted as the choice for delivering videos to smart phones, TVÂ´s, portable data units. Therefore, many services providers tend to adopt it as the basis for their services. In this paper, we focus on the problem of the typical behaviour of DASH, which runs over Client/Server network architecture causing limitations in its performance in regards to the growing recent streaming technologies. Our main objective is to extend DASH implementation towards hybrid architecture between C/S and P2P communication models to guarantee the availability of the video service even in case of server saturation. In a virtualization environment, we tested our approach and the preliminary results that we obtained confirm the efficiency of the proposed idea for streaming videos in term of delay and video quality.

The aim of this paper is designing a new approach for objective function- based fuzzy clustering. A new algorithm will be proposed for possibilistic c-means (PCM)-based models. This PCM-based algorithm uses fuzzy relations. In order to consider both separation between clusters and compactness within clusters, fuzzy relations will be applied. For verifying the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, experimental tests will be implemented.

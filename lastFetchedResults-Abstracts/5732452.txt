Both of decision input and element analysis play crucial roles in component-based design. In the past decade, much of the validation process have been massively implemented by group decision. In this research, we take the output from group decision and extend the focus of the methods and techniques to component analysis by using semantic mediation techniques in supporting the enterprise integration and ontology interoperability. We believe, both human interactive and semantic mediation analysis follow the nature of business in pre-design stage, and semantic mediation in supporting component analysis is crucial in early stage of enterprise integration. Our proposal mainly argues that semantic mediation need to impact components first and push semantics strategy directly into the micro process to be synthesized into the service layer and this is the main objective of component analysis.

Several challenges exist in case of wireless multimedia sensor networks. Out of those challenges, data redundancy is a major problem that is encountered in these networks. When any sort of event takes place in an area of interest, it is initially detected by the scalars. Subsequently, the concerned scalars communicate their reading to their respective cameras, within whose depth of fields the scalars lay. Then the cameras collaboratively decide which among them are to be activated. However, the problem is that when event takes place sensing of occurring event occurs within the event region as well as up to some extra area outside the exact event region. As a result, the cameras present outside the exact event area are activated unnecessarily due to the sensing of occurring event outside event region. Since sensing of event occurs up to certain extent outside event region, therefore the scalars which lay outside the exact event region as well as inside the sensing range of event sense the event. This is due to the coverage of sensing area of occurring event by the sensing range of some of the scalars. Due to the sensing of event by these scalars, the concerned camera sensors are activated unnecessarily. Hence, energy consumption as well as power consumption occurs unnecessarily. Our objective is to minimize this unnecessary energy and power consumption, which can be achieved by keeping the concerned cameras those are present outside the exact event region but inside sensing range of event in turned off condition.

Aimed at the problem of network performance evaluation, a new method based on vague set is proposed. First the network performance attributes are confirmed, then the sample data is transformed to vague value data and weights of attribute are calculated by use of entropy of vague set, finally network performance is evaluated by means of integrating vague set entropy weight with similarity measure. A new transforming formula from single value data to the vague value data and a new formula for similarity measure between vague sets are presented. The results show that the method can make good use of the fuzzy and uncertainty information, the evaluation result is more reasonable and objective.

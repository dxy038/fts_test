This paper presents a formulation of unit commitment for thermal units integrated with wind and solar energy systems and electrical vehicles with emphasizing on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). The renewable energy resources are included in this model due to their low electricity cost and positive effect on environment. As well as, coordinated charging strategy of electrical vehicles and reasonable usage of V2G power can reduce the generating cost. Electric vehicles and renewable energy resources are the most promising options for alternative sources in the near future. The proposed method is solved using MINLP solver in GAMS software. The problem is finding a solution which satisfies the constraints and minimizes the objective function. As a case study, results on IEEE ten-unit system are presented in this paper. The numerical tests and results showing that their inclusion with the conventional power generating sources reduces the operational cost and greenhouse gas emissions were presented in electric power industry.

This paper addresses a control technique for grid connected solar PV system in distributed generation applications. This control technique is based on dual loop controller which combines an Integral Sliding Mode Control (ISMC) in the inner current control loop and Robust Servomechanism (RS) control is used in the outer voltage control loop. The objective of the dual loop controller is to achieve better voltage regulation, low steady state error, fast transient response recovery and low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). This paper also explains the stability analysis and transient performance of the system and investigated under tuning the parameters of the controller. Power flow control problem of a grid connected solar PV system is an issue and power flow control problem is designed based on system parameter identification and nonlinear feed forward algorithm. This paper also includes the LC filter design issue, frequency domain analysis of closed loop controller. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control solution.

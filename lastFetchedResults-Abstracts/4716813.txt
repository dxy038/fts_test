Considers at run-time t the dynamic load redistribution of the m(t) interacting heterogeneous unexecuted modules of a given workload over the p(t) heterogeneous processors available at time t. Average-valued parameters are used to model the workload parameters and its execution on the system processors. We seek to minimize a multi-metric objective function representing a combination of workload completion time, communication cost, resource utilization cost, and processor idle-time cost. The efficacy of a processor is defined as a composite measure of its CPU speed, memory speed, and the averaged workload parameters. The optimal load distribution is found to be the apportionment of the total load among a subset of the available processors, composed of the q(t)&#10877;p(t) most efficacious processors, in direct proportion to their efficacies

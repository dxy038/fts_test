This paper introduces a new algorithm for Boolean factoring. The proposed approach is based on a novel synthesis paradigm, functional composition, which performs synthesis by associating simpler sub-solutions with minimum costs. The method constructively controls characteristics of final and intermediate functions, allowing the adoption of secondary criteria other than the number of literals for optimization. This multi-objective factoring algorithm presents interesting features and advantages when compared to previous works.

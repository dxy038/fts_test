A novel annular dual-slot antenna is presented. The antenna consists of two concentric annular slots and an open-circuited microstrip feed line. The simulation and experimental results indicate broad operating bandwidth from 4.8 GHz to 6.2 GHz (VSWR 2:1). At these frequencies, the antenna displays a broadside bidirectional radiation pattern, with gain on the order of 2.5 dBi. It is suitable for 5 GHz WLAN applications.

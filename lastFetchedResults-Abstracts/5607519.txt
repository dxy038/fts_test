A multi-layer multi-objective resource model is analyzed for multi-user multi-service power line communication OFDM system on the multi-sub-carrier at each slot under the constraints of the largest total power of each slot, the required fixed bit number of the real-time (RT) users, the required minimum number of bits of the non-real time (NRT) users, the allowed maximum power and the bit number of each sub-carrier. A genetic optimization algorithm of dynamic resource allocation with adaptive power and rate is proposed, which firstly gets Pareto non-inferior sets of RT usersÂ´ resource allocation included resource factor and calculates the residual power and subcarrier resources of the corresponding system from each Pareto solution, then allocates resources for NRT users from the residual resources by single-objective genetic algorithm, at last finds the global optimum allocation of system resources in all the resource allocation sets of RT and corresponding NRT users. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than other existing multi-user resource allocation algorithms and more to meet the multi-objective requirements of resource allocation for multi-user multi-service power line communication.

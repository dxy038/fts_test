From the observation that possible values of parameters involved in objective functions and constraints of mathematical programming problems are often only imprecisely or ambiguously known to experts, we consider two-level linear programming problems with fuzzy parameters represented by fuzzy numbers. A computational method, which is based on genetic algorithms, for obtaining the Stackelberg solution to the two-level linear programming problem with fuzzy parameters is developed. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed computational method, computational experiments are carried out

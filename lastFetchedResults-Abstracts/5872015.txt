The market for products whose objective is to improve software project management and software quality management is expected to be large and growing. In this paper, we present data from a software project whose mission is to build a commercial enterprise software project and quality management tool. The data we present include: planned and actual schedule, earned value, size, productivity, and defect removal by phase. We present process quality index and percent defect free modules as useful measures to predict post development defects in the product. We conclude that vendors of software project and quality management tools must walk the talk by utilizing disciplined techniques for managing the project and building quality into their products with known quality methods. The Team Software Process is a proven framework for both software project management and software quality management.

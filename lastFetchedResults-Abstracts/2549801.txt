Background and Objective: Cerebro-Vascular Accident (CVA) is considered to be one of the main causes of acquired motor disability in adults. Different motor rehabilitation programs are being designed in order to improve motor difficulties of patients with CVA. In the current study we aimed to assess the effect of task-based mirror therapy on upper limb functions and activities of daily living in patients with CVA. 
Materials and Methods: Twenty one patients with CVA were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (mirror therapy) (11 individuals) and control (10 individuals) and the both groups were receiving the usual rehabilitation protocol. The intervention group also received mirror therapy besides the usual program. Motor functions and activities of daily living were assessed via different tests (including: Box and Block test, Jebsen Taylor test, Minnesota manual dexterity test and Barthel scale) before and after the intervention course. 
Results: The results showed that regarding the effect of task-based mirror therapy on different motor skills and activities of daily living, measured by mentioned tests, the main effect of time as well as the interaction effect of group Ã— time was significant (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Generally, our findings in the present investigation suggest that mirror therapy has the potential to improve upper limb function and activities of daily living in patients with chronic CVA.

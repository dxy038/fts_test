Objective: To investigate whether pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EM field) emitted by a mobile phone for 30 min has short-term adverse effects on the human central auditory system.
Methods: We studied the auditory brainstem response (ABR), the ABR recovery function and middle latency response (MLR) before and after using a mobile phone for 30 min in 15 normal hearing volunteers.
Results: None of the 3 measures were affected by exposure to pulsed EM field emitted by a mobile phone for 30 min.
Conclusions: Based on the ABR and MLR methods utilized in the study, we conclude that 30 min mobile phone use has no short-term adverse effects on the human auditory system.

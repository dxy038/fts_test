The World Economic Forum recently released a Global Health Data Charter. The objective of this qualitative case study was to determine if the Charter's eight principles, along with a set of data management practice standards, could be used as an assessment tool to determine the maturity of data management practices within a health organization. The Health Authority — Abu Dhabi (HAAD) — represented the bounded holistic case for this study. The data collection methods included structured interviews, completion of an assessment tool, and electronic documentation review. The findings demonstrated good to excellent compliance between HAAD's data management practices and the Charter principles, indicating a high level of data management maturity. Applying the Charter as the assessment framework proved to be successful. This framework provided a simple yet comprehensive approach to rapidly determine HAAD's level of health data management maturity. This assessment tool may prove to be useful for other health organizations.

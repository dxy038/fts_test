Growing demand, requirements for power quality enhancement and distribution generation are increasing the complexity of distribution systems. In this scenario, voltage regulation of distribution networks also becomes more complex, especially in long distribution lines. In this paper, a smart distribution transformer is proposed, which employs an electronic on load tap changer with a bidirectional communication system. This system enables automatic voltage regulation, telemetry and remote control for power utilities, allowing its application in Smart Grids.

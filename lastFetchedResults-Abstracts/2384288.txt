Recent research in this topic has focussed on the use of polymerizable surfactants (surfmers) in emulsion and dispersion polymerization. The main objective is to actually locate the surfactants at the very surface of the particles, and work has concentrated on the structure and reactivity of the surfmer, as well as the process best suited to reach the objective.

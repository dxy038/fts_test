This paper presents an application of a hybrid technique combining bacterial foraging with particle swarm optimization (BF-PSO) for determining the optimal values for the proportional-integral-derivation (PID) controller for a load frequency control (LFC) of two-area interconnected power system. This method is compared to the heuristic optimization method (PSO) and to bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) thereby to the traditional Ziegler-Nichols method. The results of PID-tuning are compared with the results of I, ID and PI controllers. The transient responses are shown due to step load disturbances in area-1. The main primary objective is to suppress all the fluctuations of the system frequency and tie line power flow.

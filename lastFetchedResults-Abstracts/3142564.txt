We utilize second-harmonic- and sum-frequency-generation at the objective focus to optimize spectral resolution in a single-fs-laser-source CARS microscope. Chirp-matching provides spectral focusing with a &lt;40 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> resolution between 1200 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8211;3800 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

The objective of the present study is to determine if surface electromyography (EMG) signals can be used for controlling the motion of the meal assistance robot. The power of four EMG channels were calculated and encoded into five commands to track the motion of meal assistance robot. The results indicated that by using EMG signals, the meal assistance robot was able to follow the movement desire of the subjects and help them to eat. This study has shown the possibility of extracting the features of EMG signals that reflect the subjectÂ´s intent as control signals.

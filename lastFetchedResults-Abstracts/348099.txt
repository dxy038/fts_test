Objective: We compared the effects of tactile interference to the forearm on magnetic responses evoked by electric stimulation of the little finger (D5) and the thumb (D1).
Methods: Electric stimulation was delivered to D5 or D1 individually. In each stimulus session, magnetic recordings were conducted with or without concurrent tactile interference to the radial side of the anterior forearm.
Results: With forearm interference, the amplitude of the primary response (N20m) following D5 stimulation was reduced to 90.7% of the control value without interference, while that following D1 stimulation was not affected (100.7%).
Conclusions: In human somatosensory area 3b, the representation of the forearm is immediately adjacent to that of the D5, and distant from that of the D1. Thus, the result suggests that the tactile interference effect on N20m depends on the cortical distance between electrically and mechanically activated 3b areas.
Significance: Intrinsic synaptic connections between the 3b hand representation and its surroundings have been hypothesized as a neural basis for plastic changes of the human brain, such as a phantom hand phenomenon. The present finding implies that these connections may play some physiological roles even in normal adult humans.

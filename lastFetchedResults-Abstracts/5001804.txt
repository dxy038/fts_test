A high performance and computation efficient decision-feedback receiver for M-ary bi-orthogonal keying (MBOK) direct-sequence ultra-wideband radio (DS-UWB) is proposed. First, an insightful vector-matrix signal model for UWB channel dispersion over many consecutive symbols is built up. Then, by modifying a baseline MBOK-RAKE receiver, we propose a novel RAKE with bidirectional decision feedback (RAKE-BDDF) receiver to efficiently cancel both the post-cursor and pre-cursor intersymbol interference (ISI) and multi-code interference (MCI) at symbol rate. Simulation results are included for 802.15.3a CM2 and CM4 UWB channels. It is seen that the RAKE-BDDF receiver can attain a performance close to the matched filter bound, with only a slight increase in the receiver complexity than that of the RAKE receiver

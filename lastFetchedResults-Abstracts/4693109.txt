We investigate several routing algorithms used in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems. In the literature, most of the routing algorithms designed for LEO systems are based on minimizing the delay. Only a few of them have taken minimization of the number of handoffs as the objective function. We also classify the routing algorithms in two main categories: dynamic and static. There are some other papers that compare dynamic and static routing algorithms. Most of the studies, on the other hand, use static routing algorithms due to the periodic and predictable nature of LEO satellite systems. Therefore, we also designed a static routing algorithm based on genetic algorithms. The results show that our method performs better than classical methods, from the point of view of both delay and number of handovers.

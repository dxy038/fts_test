A pressbrake is a machine used to bend metal sheet at different angles in a metal fabrication factory. High degree of bending angle accuracy and productivity are main objectives for having computerised numerical control (CNC) on such machines. The objective of this paper is to describe the fuzzy logic controller developed for hydraulic pressbrake. This system is shown to be multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, the control parameters being speed, force and positions. To use the fuzzy logic rule base, the architecture of fuzzy controller is divided into eight different MISO systems. A novel approach to solve practical problems of excessive jerks and variation due to environmental conditions is described here. Standard techniques are used for fuzzification and defuzzification. This control strategy is shown to be superior than the existing conventional one

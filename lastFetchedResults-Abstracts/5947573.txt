The objective is to propose a cost estimating method which is fitted to recent continuously producing industrial context evolution. In order to quote the steel product price and control cost before production, estimating steel product cost accurately is important for steel enterprise. After analyzing the existing cost estimation methods, steel product cost estimation was given based on steel product features and process characteristics in this paper. Firstly, product features were extracted from the order information. Secondly, process chain was automatic generation by matching the product features and process chain attributes. If itpsilas failed, a new manual process chain was created according to product features, and process cost estimation was calculated by analyzing process cost constitutes. Finally, the model was demonstrated through an application in a steel enterprise.

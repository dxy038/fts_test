The main objective of greenhouses crop production is to increment the economic profits of the grower by means of finding a trade-off between the improvement of the quantity and quality of the horticultural products and the cost of obtaining adequate climatic conditions using automatic control strategies. This paper shows the development of a hierarchical architecture to control the crop growth in greenhouses based on the inner climate in order to maximize the profit (the difference between the incomes coming from the sale of the final production and its associate costs).

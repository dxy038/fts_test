Eighty women with previous cesarean section who were candidate for VBAC were enrolled the study. Patients were followed up for 6 weeks after delivery. The complication of VBAC was compared between successful or unsuccessful VBAC cases. Data was analyzed by SPSS version 16.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> VBAC success rate was 91%. Post-partumhemorrhage occurred in 2.7% of woman with successful VBAC and 1.3% of CS cases. Maternal and neonatal death did not happen during our study, and none of our cases experienced uterine rupture, dystocia and neonatal tachypnea. Neonatal complications include NICU admission and neonatal resuscitation frequency in VBAC and CS were 6.8% and 57.1%, respectively (p = 0.002). Birth weight of neonates in successful VBAC was 2940 ± 768 grams and 3764 ± 254 grams in unsuccessful VBAC and this difference was significant (p = 0.007). Mean maternal admission duration in VBAC and CS were 1 ± 0.1 days and 2 ± 0.4 days (p &lt; 0.001). Successful breastfeeding rate were higher in VBAC patients (95.8%) in comparison with CS (42.9%) and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.002).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Our results revealed that VBAC can be considered as a safe maternal and neonatal delivery method in patients with past CS women.</p><p> </p>

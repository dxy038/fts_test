The French Space Agency (CNES) has undertaken to reduce the dependency of scientific laboratories against CNES with regard of the processing of science space borne data. The objective is to let the laboratories derive scientific results from the processing of data much faster than in the past. This implies a significant change in the cooperation between CNES and scientific laboratories.

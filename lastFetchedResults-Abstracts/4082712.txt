A new approach for optimal network routing in distribution system planning is presented in this paper. The distribution network routing planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained, nondifferentiable optimization problem. The main objective is to minimize the total cost which is the summation of reliability costs, feeder resistive loss, investment and maintenance costs. Simulated annealing, which is a general purpose combinatorial optimization algorithm, is used to obtain a global optimum solution of the problem

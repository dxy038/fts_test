Nowadays, phenomenon of terrorism has become one of the most important
nation’s and government’s security concerns of around the world.
Broadening phenomenon of terrorism isn’t confined to the specific region
or governments, but all states from micro and less developed countries to
great powers face the security problem in some way. With the escalation of
terrorist activities, international measures increased for combating it, but
despite all of international laws and measures for combating it, in order to
cleaning the world from presence of terrorists that they have killed thousands
of innocent human beings bloodily, international community hasn’t
been successful to combat with this phenomenon completely yet.
Up to now, approximately, the international community has performed
three strategies in process of combating terrorism, but despite minimal victories
and achievements of these strategies, none of them hasn’t battled
with phenomenon of terrorism fundamentally aimed at preventing terrorist
actions in long-term. This study tries to explain dimensions of Islamic
Republic of Iran’s counter-terrorism strategy over the past three decades.
Hence, the findings of this research which base on descriptive-analytical
method and objective-historical data and using library resources and cyberspace
(e), show the Islamic Republic of Iran as one of the countries where
the phenomenon of terrorism has become linked with its international and
national security and has been damaged from terrorism doubly, meanwhile

manifestations of terrorism, and as sought delimitating the roots of the factors
causing terrorist acts (long-term outcome) and has carried out special
policies and actions for counter-terrorism measures. This indicates that the
Islamic Republic of Iran’ counter-terrorism strategy has been explicated.

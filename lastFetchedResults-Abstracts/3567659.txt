Sensor deployment is a critical issue because it affects the cost and detection capability of a wireless sensor network. In this work, we consider two related deployment problems: sensor placement and sensor dispatch. The former asks how to place the least number of sensors in a field to achieve sensing coverage and network connectivity, and the latter asks how to determine from a set of mobile sensors a subset of sensors to be moved to an area of interest with certain objective functions such that the coverage and connectivity properties are satisfied. This work is targeted toward planned deployment. Our solution to the placement problem allows an arbitrary-shaped sensing field possibly with arbitrary-shaped obstacles and an arbitrary relationship between the communication distance and sensing distance of sensors and, thus, significantly relaxes the limitations of existing results. Our solutions to the dispatch problem include a centralized one and a distributed one. The centralized one is based on adopting the former placement results and converting the problem to the maximum-weight maximum-matching problem with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption to move sensors or maximizing the average remaining energy of sensors after movement. Designed in a similar way, the distributed one allows sensors to determine their moving directions in an autonomous manner.

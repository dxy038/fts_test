Blood and serum samples from 372 15-year-old adolescents were collected in two cities in Sweden and analyzed by
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ŽICP-MS.. The objective was to Ž1. determine the levels of 13
elements in blood and serum from the teenagers; and Ž2. for each element, investigate the correlation between the
concentrations in blood and serum. The concentrations in blood and serum were generally in line with that usually
reported for the essential elements Co, Cu, Zn and Se, and generally low for the ‘non-essential’ elements Cd, Hg, Pb.
The median concentrations were in blood and serum, respectively: of Co 0.31 and 0.48  g l, Cu 0.92 and 1.0 mg l,
Zn 6.1 and 0.99 mg l, Se 110 and 100  g l, Rb 2.8 and 0.24 mg l, Hg 1.1 and 0.44  g l, Pb 16 and 0.33  g l. The
median concentration of W in blood was  0.2  g l Žbelow the detection limit. and in serum 0.087  g l. The
median concentrations of Cd, Rh, Pd, Pt and Tl were below the detection limits. Statistically significant correlations
were found between the concentrations in blood and serum for Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, W, Hg and Pb. The levels
presented in this study constitute baseline levels or levels generally not exceeded in adolescents for 13 elements,
including essential, ubiquitous toxic, and rare elements.

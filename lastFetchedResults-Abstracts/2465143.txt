We present results obtained for Epinal (H5), an ordinary chondrite meteorite, irradiated with 60 keV Ar++ ions, simulating solar wind heavy particle irradiation. Bidirectional reflectance spectra (0.3–2.67 μm) measured after irradiating Epinal samples with different ion fluences exhibit a progressive reddening that is similar to the spread of spectra observed for S-type near-Earth asteroids. The timescales for inducing the same effects in space as those obtained in laboratory are estimated to be 10 4 – 10 6   yr . These results suggest irradiation by heavy ions may be a very efficient weathering process in near-Earth space.

The objective of the present work is to assess factors that influence thermo-mechanical stresses developed in adhesively bonded tools. Plain and filled adhesives, dry cutting and cutting with coolant, and the effectiveness of bond line thickness were investigated and their effect has been assessed. The finite element technique was adopted in the present work to study the influence of these factors. The present work showed that the thermal stresses developed in bonded tools decrease tremendously when cutting fluids are applied, however, the thermo-mechanical stresses seems to be unaffected with cutting fluid application.

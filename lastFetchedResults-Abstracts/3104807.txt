Based on control type soft switching, an interleaved three-phase bidirectional DC/DC converter for high voltage high power applications is presented. The converter main circuit uses the interleaved three-phase bidirectional DC/DC topology and takes use of the three-phase complementary PWM control to implement soft switching condition. The circuit principles, the working modes and control type soft switching characteristics of the converters are expatiated thoroughly in this paper.

Providing quality of service (QoS) guarantees in packet networks gives rise to several challenging issues. One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints. Multi-constrained QoS routing finds a feasible route in the network that satisfies multiple independent constraints. In general, multi-constrained path selection is a NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial time. The existing routing algorithms usually optimize a single objective, which have some inherent drawbacks. An improved genetic algorithm based on multi-objective optimization algorithm for multiple QoS routing constraints is proposed in this paper, which search for the set of Pareto optimal solutions of QoS routing. Simulation results show that this algorithm has a high success ratio, and can obtain a set of QoS routing which satisfy all constraints in finite evolutionary generations. Those Qos routing overcomes the drawbacks of single objective optimization.

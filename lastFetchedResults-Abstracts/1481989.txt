The objective of this experiment was to compare traditional dry aging of beef with a novel technique of dry aging in a highly moisture-permeable bag. Four equal-sized sections from paired beef strip loins were dry aged traditionally, unpackaged, or packaged in the experimental bag for 14 or 21 d at 3 Â°C. No differences (P &gt; 0.05) were noted for pH, moisture, fat, total plate counts, cook loss, shear force, or any measured sensory attribute between the two aging treatments after either aging period. After 21 d, however, dry aging in the bag (versus traditional dry aging) decreased (P &lt; 0.05) weight loss during aging, trim loss after aging, and yeast counts on lean tissue and increased lactic acid bacteria counts (P &lt; 0.05) on adipose and lean tissue. Dry aging in a highly moisture-permeable bag is feasible, will positively impact yields and reduce microbial spoilage, and will have no negative impact on product quality.

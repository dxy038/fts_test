This paper presents a method of optimizing real and reactive power in Power Systems. A comparative study is made on simultaneous and sequential optimization of real and reactive power subproblems. For active power optimization generator real power outputs are taken as control variables and cost minimization is the objective. For reactive power optimization generator bus voltages, shunt capacitors/reactors, and transformer tap positions are taken as control variables while cost minimization/loss minimization is taken as objective. For simultaneous optimization of both the subproblems are formulated as cost minimization problem. Particle Swarm Optimization method is used for solving this complex, non-linear, non-convex optimization problem. Simulations are carried out on standard IEEE 30 bus system and results are presented.

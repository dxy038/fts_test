The objective of this study is to review the incidence of severe burns and the complications of burns sepsis in Albanians. The data are from clinical records of the patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Service of Burns, “Mother Teresa” University Hospital Center (UHC), Tirana, Albania during 2001. For the identification of sepsis in burned patients the classification of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) was used. All the cases were evaluated according to the clinical, diagnostic and laboratory data. The study presents some epidemiological data about the causative agent, the extent of burn, the depth of burn and the subjects injured. The study also identifies the pathogens responsible for the development of sepsis among patients. Such data was used to establish compound therapies focused on two or three antibiotics for each subject in order to treat sepsis and its possible complications. As a most important part of the treatment regime it is essential to identify patients at risk of sepsis, and to apply compound therapy with antibiotics in order to resist and treat this sepsis, which is the main cause of high mortality among our severely burned patients.

Many studies on N<sub>2</sub>+SF<sub>6</sub> binary gas mixtures have been reported in the literature as an alternative to pure SF<sub>6</sub> which is used in high-voltage power apparatus and systems. However, information on the response of N<sub>2</sub>+SF<sub>6</sub> to limiting orthogonal electric and magnetic fields is lacking in the literature. Therefore, due to the technical importance of this binary mixture, it is the objective of this study to employ the Monte-Carlo technique to determine the response of N<sub>2</sub>+SF<sub>6</sub> mixtures to crossed electric and magnetic fields.

Objective quality assessment plays a very important role in the video applications, as they promise the means to evaluate the performance of acquisition, display, coding and communication systems. Objective video quality assessment still has a long way to go before it reaches the level of success. In this paper, we propose novel quality metrics for video sequences. These metrics are capable of capturing spatial distortions in video sequences, in addition to temporal artifacts. And they can quantify the spatial distortion and differentiate the type of distortion. Furthermore the metrics correlate well with the subjective quality measures because perception distortions of human have been taken into consideration. Experimental results show that our perceptual quality metric performs better than the existing methods.

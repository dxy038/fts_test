In this work, the Contiguous Partition Method (CPM) and the Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS) approaches are applied to the synthesis of large arrays for wireless power transmission (WPT). The methodologies are employed with a twofold objective: on the one hand, to achieve high beam collection efficiencies (BCE) and low sidelobes; on the other hand, to simplify the overall array complexity/costs. The features and potentialities of the proposed approaches are assessed through a set of numerical examples.

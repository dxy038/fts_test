To overcome declining markets and low-cost competition, Canadian pulp and paper (P&amp;P) mills are considering the diversification of their product platform. Investing in bioenergy is emerging as a promising way to boost the sector. In this paper, we present a mathematical programming approach to evaluate the profitability of bioenergy investments in the case of a P&amp;P mill, while assessing technical and associated economic risks. The mill, called the integrated forest biorefinery (IFBR), could produce a set of high-value bioproducts from biomass generated in the mill or supplied from outside. P&amp;P activity generates residues, such as black liquor and pulp sludge, which could be used to produce bioenergy. P&amp;P activity should then be well managed, by considering the possibility of temporarily stopping the production of P&amp;P, while assuming the costs associated with the shutdowns. The objective is to develop a mathematically-based approach for investors and stakeholders, within the forest sector that aims to optimise the value creation network of the IFBR and to maximise the profitability of future investments in bioenergy, while optimising the existing P&amp;P activity.

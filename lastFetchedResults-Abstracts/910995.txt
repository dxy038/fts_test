ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As an important achievement in industrialization and urbanization, depression can be much related to the oral hygiene especially periodontal indexes which are a symbol of tooth and oral hygiene and their surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study was to compare the periodontal indexes in individuals with and without depression disorders.
METHODS: The present study was carried out in the form of a questionnaire, examination, and recording in the information form. The subjects were divided into two groups of 50; a group included the patients suffering from depression who hospitalized in Neuropsychology ward of Panje Azar hospital in Gorgan, Iran and the control group included either the patients who referred to department of oral medicine and diagnosis of Babol dental school or the people accompanying the patients who had claimed to have no history of depression. The periodontal indexes of the study included: Silness and Loe plaque index, Loe gingival index, pocket depth analysis, as well as bleeding on probing. The information related to each patient was recorded in the form and then two groups were compared.
FINDINGS: In the present study, the pocket probing were 2.7692±0.5991 and 2.2917±0.4643 in the control and case groups, respectively (p= 0.009). The Plaque Index means were 1.5385±0.1 and 7763.2593±0.5257 in the control and case groups, respectively. Furthermore, the GI and BOP difference between the two groups were not significant. Moreover, there was no significant relationship between the mean of all the analyzed indexes and the increase of depression.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate a vivid relationship between the depth of pocket probing and depression. Nevertheless, none of the periodontal indexes were obviously related to the degree of depression.

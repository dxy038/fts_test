This paper presents an implementation of the Qt4 test bench based on ARM9. With Linux as the operating system, based on ARM9 system board, Qt4 test bench is implemented and completes the corresponding tests. The process of the implementation combining the build of compiler environments, the kernel transplant, the production of the root filesystem, drivers installation, and the process of Qt/Embedded transplant supporting touch screen, is detailed explained. At last, the console, based on Qt/Embedded for GUI support system, is presented to control four applications, each of which has tested individual objective functions related to USB camera and LCD display.

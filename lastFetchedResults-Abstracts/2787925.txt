In the concept of symbiotic systems, the relationship between man and machine comes close to even. Recent autonomy of machines is considered independently from human because the cognitive functions equipped in the autonomic system act only for the system itself. On the other hand, a symbiotic system should support bidirectional cognitive functions between machines and human. This means the cognitive function should not be only for the system but also for the human. We have been developing an autonomic network management system based on active information resources (AIR-NMS) that support utilization of management information resources for human and autonomous agents. Although a well-configured AIR-NMS can solve the network management problems, robustness and availability should be improved to deploy more perturbed heterogeneous open environment that is a requirement of ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we propose an interaction space called AIR-space for cognitive robust cooperation between AIRs in AIR-NMS. AIRspace provides a cognitive information exchange function between AIRs. Mainly, a prototypical design and implementation of AIRspace is presented here. The effectiveness of deployment capability and maintenance-less feature is estimated in the evaluation experiments.

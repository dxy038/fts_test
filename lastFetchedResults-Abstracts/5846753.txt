Reports on the work carried out to date on the design and development of updated multivariable control stategies for a surveillance remotely piloted vehicle (RPV). The RPV under consideration is the Raven 2 aircraft developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd. This is a small short-range aircraft used for tactical military surveillance. The aircraft gathers stable telemetered imagery of remote objects using an on-board gimbal-mounted camera. Video imagery is telemetered back to a ground control station. The objective of this research is to design multivariable control strategies to perform the following functions: (a) increased stability in the presence of unstable airflows; and (b) autopilot commands (e.g. dash, loiter, height hold, and maximum rate of climb)

Manganese toxicity occurs in many agricultural and natural ecosystems under the various soil conditions such as the nature of substrate, acidity, flooding or vicinity to the mining areas. The objective of this work was to study the effects of excess Mn in the growth medium on three important crop species, namely rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. T. Hashemi), maize (Zea mays L. cv. SC.704) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. Mehr). Plants were cultured in thq hydroponic medium under controlled environmental conditions and treated with 0 (control), 25 50, 75 and 100 p.M Mn for 12 days. Dry mass production, the effect of supplemental Mg and Ca on the toxicity expression, root respiration and K+ leakage from shoot and root tissues were studied under the Mn treatments. In order to study the effect of light intensity on the expression of toxicity symptoms, plants were cultured under the different light conditions, thereafter their growth and metal uptake and transport were studied. Sunflower plants treated with the 50 ÂµM Mn and higher, showed dark-brown spots associated with the trichomes on the leaves and petioles. Maize plants developed interveinal chlorosis and any visual leaf symptoms was observed in rice. In all of the studied species, a great portion of the absorbed Mn was translocated into shoot, the highest transport was observed in sunflower and the lowest in maize. No significant correlation was observed between the expression of Mn toxicity and the accumulation rate of Mn. Growing under the low light intensity, in addition to the lowering biomass production, increased or decreased the toxicity effect depending on species. Mn-toxicity-induced root respiration was not associated with the differential response of species to Mn toxicity. In contrast the change of K+ leakage from shoot and root tissues was well correlated with the toxicity response of tested plants.

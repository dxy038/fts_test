We propose and develop a model that gives a realistic description of the various processes and their effects as a mobile self-organizing sensor based network evolves. This model provides an analytical approach that describes the dynamics of the network and facilitates the understanding of the effect of the various events on the large scale topology of a wireless mobile sensor network. Based on this analytical model, we investigate the connectivity distribution of the sensor network, with the objective of using this model to develop guidelines regarding the various processes involved in the design and operation of sensor based networks.

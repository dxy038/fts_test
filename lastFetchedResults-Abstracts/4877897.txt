This paper investigates and illustrates the potential of using panorama virtual reality to enhance Web-based library instruction. The project considers that panorama virtual reality (VR) could be a powerful tool when comparing a conventional tour and virtual tour. A VR tour as a whole can became a more useful medium that allows navigating, viewing, reading, hearing and remote access. This paper describes the implementation processes and lessons learned throughout the development process regarding the application stage of prototype development using different software: VR Worx Panorama, VR Worx Scene, PhotoVista Panorama, Reality Studio and Ulead COOL 360. The discussion includes an overview of comparisons between panorama VR and other VR tools. A survey was also carried out with the objective of comparing virtual reality panorama with a conventional technique in delivered guided tour information.

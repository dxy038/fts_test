The dramatic increase of power consumption in very large scale integration circuits has led to high operating temperature and large thermal gradient, thereby resulting in serious timing and reliability concerns. Temperature-tracking is thus becoming of paramount importance in modern electronic design automation (EDA) tools. In this paper we present two thermal placement tools for standard cell and macro cell design styles respectively. They are aimed at reducing hot spots in a design without compromising traditional design metrics such as area and wire length. We developed a compact substrate thermal model that can be used by the placer to calculate the temperature profile of a placement efficiently, or to convert the user-specified temperature constraint into the corresponding power distribution constraint as an alternative placement objective. As a result, our method is much more efficient than directly employing temperature profile simulation during the placement process. The simulation results show noticeable improvement of thermal distribution over the traditional placement algorithm, with little impact on area and wire length of the final layout

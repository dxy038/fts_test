The basic objective of Q-mode factor analysis, a multivariate statistical technique based on the interrelation between samples, is classification of a suite of samples characterized by a large number of variables. The technique has been applied in modeling the microstructural heterogeneity present in a naturally occurring complex material. Significance of results is discussed with regard to the classification of multicomponent multiphase materials in general.

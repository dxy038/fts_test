For tackling multiobjective optimisation (MOO) problem, many methods are available in the field of evolutionary computation (EC). To use the proposed method(s), the choice of the representation should be considered first. In EC, often binary representation and real-valued representation are used. We propose a hybrid representation, composed of binary and real-valued representations for multi-objective optimisation problems. Several issues such as discretisation error in the binary representation, self-adaptation of strategy parameters and adaptive switching of representations are addressed. Experiments are conducted on five test functions using six different performance indices, which shows that the hybrid representation exhibits better and more stable performance than the single binary or real-valued representation.

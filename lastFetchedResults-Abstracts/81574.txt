Fermentation of grain legumes is an efficient method to reduce the concentration of (alpha)-galactosidic compounds that are known to be flatulence producers. Soluble dietary fibre has also been implicated in flatulence production; however, little information exists about the effectiveness of fermentation in diminishing the effects of these compounds. The objective of this work was to study the effect of natural fermentation (NF) and controlled fermentation (CF) on the content of (alpha)-galactosides and dietary fibre in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. After 48 h, the pH during NF dropped from 6.15 to 4.00 and the nominal acidity increased six times; for CF, however, although the decrease in pH was similar to that for NF, the nominal acidity increased only three times after 48 h. Insoluble fibre content did not change the pH significantly after 96 h for NF and CF. Soluble fibre suffered an apparent removal after 48 h of NF and underwent a sharp reduction of 66% after 96 h of CF. The concentration of stachyose (the main -galactoside in raw beans) diminished notably after 48 h and 96 h NF (72% and 95% respectively), whereas with CF only 11% was removed after 96 h. NF of P vulgaris seems to be more effective than CF in reducing the flatulence-producer factors ((alpha)-galactosides and soluble dietary fibre).

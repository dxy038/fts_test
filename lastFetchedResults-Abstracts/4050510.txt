Intelligent simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm for the optimal design of electromagnetic devices is presented in this paper. The algorithm is implemented by assembling fuzzy inference into the improved simulated annealing algorithm, which gives the SA algorithm the ability to reject infeasible solutions prior to objective function computation. The algorithm is applied to the optimal design of a brushless DC motor, and about 60 percent of CPU time of an SA algorithm can be saved

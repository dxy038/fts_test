Background: Mayonnaise is one of the food emulsions (O/W) that is used as a condiment in various foods. 
Objective: Linseed oil (containing omega-3 fatty acids) was used at the replacement levels of 10, 15 and 20% of soybean oil in mayonnaise formulation and the sensory properties of samples were evaluated.
Methods: In the second part of this research, the Zataria multiflora Boiss. (ZMEO) and Satureja hortensis L. (SHEO) (500, 1000 and 1500) were added to oil of mayonnaise and their antioxidant effects, peroxide (PV) and conjucated diene (CD) values were compared with BHA syntethic antioxidant (100 and 200 ppm).
Results: 15% of linseed oil used as replacer for soybean oil, showed no significant differences in the color, texture, taste, smell, mouth feel and overal acceptability compared with control samples, and this same ratio of 15 percent was used in subsequent tests. Statistical results of PV and CD indexes revealed that ZMEO (500) and the SHEO (1000 and 1500) had better antioxidant effect than BHA (100 and 200). In determination of secondary oxidation products, TBA value showed that ZMEO (500) was not significantly different than BHA (200) and that SHEO (1000) had better antioxidant activity than BHA (100 ppm).
Conclusion: The results of antioxidative effect and sensory properties (showed no significant difference in taste and smell score compared with control sample) of formulated mayonnaise showed that these natural antioxidants in mayonnaise formulation can ameliorate the quality of product as functional food due to advancing the public health.

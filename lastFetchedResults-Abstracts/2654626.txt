In the context of public transportation system, improving the service quality and
robustness through minimizing the average passengers waiting time is a real
challenge. This study provides robust stochastic programming models for train
timetabling problem in urban rail transit systems. The objective is the minimization
of the weighted summation of the expected cost of passenger waiting time, its
variance and the penalty function including the capacity violation due to
overcrowding. In the proposed formulations, the dynamic and uncertain travel
demand is represented by the scenario-based multi-period arrival rates of passenger.
Two versions of the robust stochastic programming models are developed and a
comparative analysis is conducted to testify the tractability of the models. The
effectiveness of the proposed stochastic programming model was demonstrated
through the application to Tehran underground urban railway. The outcomes show
the reductions in expected passenger waiting time of22%, and cost variance drop of
60% compared with the baseline plans using the proposed robust optimization
approach.

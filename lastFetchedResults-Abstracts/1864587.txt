The objective of this study was to: (1) assess the relative prevalence of ovarian, thyroid, nuclear, and cardiolipin antibodies associated with premature menopause and unexplained infertility and (2) compare ovarian and thyroid antibodies in premature menopause, unexplained infertility, and the general population. Autoantibodies were evaluated in women with premature menopause (n= 30), unexplained infertility with (n= 38) or without (n= 15) prior gonadotropin-induced ovulation, and normal cycling controls (n= 12) and in a population of women obtained from a blood bank (n= 53). Antibodies to ovary (OVAB), thyroid (THYAB; thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin), cardiolipin, and eight nuclear antigens were assessed by enzyme immunoassay. Organ-specific antibodies (ovary and thyroid) were present with significantly greater frequency than non-organ-specific antibodies (nuclear and cardiolipin) in premature menopause and unexplained infertility (60% (50/83) vs 16% (13/83) respectively;P&lt; 0.0001). OVAB (53%, 44/83) were significantly more frequent than THYAB (30%, 25/83) in premature menopause and unexplained infertility (P= 0.0030). THYAB did not differ among all groups (P= 0.78). In premature menopause and treated or untreated unexplained infertility OVAB frequencies were 53, 61, and 33%, respectively, and were significantly more frequent than in the population (17%) (P= 0.0001). In unexplained infertility, individuals with no prior gonadotropin-induced ovulation had a lower frequency of OVAB than treated individuals (P= 0.07). The frequency distribution of optical density values for OVAB was significantly higher for premature menopause and unexplained infertility than for population or normal cycling women (P&lt; 0.0001). Thus, only ovarian antibodies were significantly more frequent than other antibody markers of autoimmunity in premature menopause and unexplained infertility.

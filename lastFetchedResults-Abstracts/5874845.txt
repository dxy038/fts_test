This paper discusses nonlinear optimization techniques in robust control synthesis, with special emphasis on design problems which may be cast as minimizing a linear objective function under Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) in tandem with nonlinear matrix equality constraints. The latter type of constraints renders the design numerically and algorithmically difficult. We solve the optimization problem via sequential semidefinite programming (SSDP), a technique which expands on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) known in nonlinear optimization. Global and fast local convergence properties of SSDP are similar to those of SQP, and SSDP is conveniently implemented with available semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers.

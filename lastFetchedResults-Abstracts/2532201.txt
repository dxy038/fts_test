Objective(s): For the development of reliable, ecofriendly, less expensive process for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles and to evaluate the bactericidal, and cytotoxicity properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized from root extract of Croton bonplandianum, Baill. Materials and Methods: The synthesis of silver nanoparticles by plant part of Croton bonplandianum was carried out.  The formation of nanoparticles was confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), XRD and UV-Vis spectrophotometric analysis.  The biochemical properties were assayed by antibacterial study, cytotoxicity assay using cancer cell line.  Results: The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-VIS spectroscopic analysis which showed absorbance peak at 425 nm.  X-ray diffraction photograph indicated the face centered cubic structure of the synthesized AgNPs.  TEM has displayed the different dimensional images of biogenic silver nanoparticles with particle size distribution ranging from 15-40 nm with an average size of 32 nm. Silver particles are spherical in shape, clustered.  The EDX analysis was used to identify the elemental composition of synthesized AgNPs. Antibacterial activity of the synthesized AgNPs against three Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria strains like Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried out showed significant zones of inhibition. The cytotoxicity study by AgNPS also showed cytotoxicity on ovarian cancer cell line PA-1 and lung epithelial cancer cell line A549.  Conclusion: The present study confirms that the AgNPs have great promise as antibacterial, and anticancer agent.

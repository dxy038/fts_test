Objective(s): To determine the prevalence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, as a blood borne viral
infection, among prisoners and its associated factors in Iran.
Methods: In this cross sectional study, 5317 inmates, who had stayed in prison for at least -' months, were
tested in 7 provinces from 2001 to 2005. The degree of contamination with HBV and its association with age
and drug abuse were evaluated.
Results: The frequency of contamination with HBV ranged from I% to 15% in different prisons. Overall
frequency was 6.7 % (95% CI: 6.1 ~/Q-7.4%). The crude and adjusted association between HBV infection and
age was studied. While adjusted for prisons. The result showed no significant association between age and
HBV infection (P =: 0.88) based on Mantel Hcanszel test. HO\.....ever, there was a significant association
between HBV infection and drug abuse in two out of seven prisons (where the data was available).
Conclusion: The frequency of contamination with HBV infection is relatively high (more than twice) in
prisons comparing to the general population (6.7~"o VS 2.8%). Planning regular screening, preventive
practices such as 'vaccination against HBV in prisoners as well as easy access to therapeutic facilities arc
highly recommended.

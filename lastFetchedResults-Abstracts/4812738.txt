Microblogging is a communication paradigm in which users post bits of information (brief text updates or micro media such as photos, video or audio clips) that are visible by their communities. When a user finds a &#8220;meme&#8221; of another user interesting, she can eventually repost it, thus allowing memes to propagate virally trough a social network. In this paper we introduce the meme ranking problem, as the problem of selecting which k memes (among the ones posted their contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. The objective is to maximize the overall activity of the network, that is, the total number of reposts that occur. We deeply characterize the problem showing that not only exact solutions are unfeasible, but also approximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted in an on-line setting. Therefore we devise a set of heuristics and we compare them trough an extensive simulation based on the real-world Yahoo! Meme social graph, and with parameters learnt from real logs of meme propagations. Our experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of these methods.

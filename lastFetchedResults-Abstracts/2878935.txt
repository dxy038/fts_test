This paper presents a tool to help the completion of the metadata of the IMS Access for All v3.0 specification, which main objective is to simplify the definition of the accessibility metadata for learning objects and the preferences and needs of the users of these objects. The LOMPad tool has been modified for helping the accessible learning objects creators to complete the set of specificationÂ´s accessibility metadata and to create the XML files that represent them. This tool also helps users to create their XML files with the preferences and needs metadata. This tool has been developed by the authors at the University of Alcala (Spain) in the field of project ESVIAL.

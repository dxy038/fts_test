Within ACTS the project FRAMES (Future Radio Wideband Multiple Access System) has been set up with an objective to define a proposal for a UMTS radio access system. Based on an initial evaluation phase in FRAMES, a harmonized multiple access platform has been designed consisting of two modes: FMA1, a wideband TDMA and FMA2, a wideband CDMA. In this paper, link level results obtained for FMA1 without spreading are presented. In particular, the application of the novel rate compatible punctured turbo-codes (RCPTC), are compared with conventional nonsystematic convolutional coding. The emphasis lies on the packet transmission and on the circuit switched high bit rates. These simulation results can be applied to frequency division duplex (FDD) and to time division duplex (TDD) operation

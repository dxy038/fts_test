Low power and lossy networks (LLNs) require efficient routing protocols that should meet the requirements of the critical applications, such as real-time, reliability and high availability. RPL has been recently proposed by the ROLL working group as a tree routing protocol specifically designed for LLNs. It relies on objective functions to construct routes that optimize or constrain a routing metric on the paths. However, the working group did not specify the set of metrics and/or constraints to be used to specify the preferred path, and left it open to implementations. In this paper, we design OF-FL, a novel objective function that combines a set of metrics in order to provide a configurable routing decision based on the fuzzy parameters. OF-FL has the advantage to consider the application requirements in order to select the best paths to the destination. Our evaluation with a large-scale testbed in ContikiOS reveals that OF-FL can achieve remarkable performance of the RPL-based LLNs in comparison with the existing objective functions, and appropriately satisfy the quality of service contract of the different applications.

The dynamic interaction of a Distributed Synchronous Generator (DSG) with Fixed-speed (FSIG) and Doubly-Fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines during network fault conditions is presented in this paper. The objective is to enhance the damping of the wind turbine torsional oscillations, and the transient stability margin of the distributed generators measured by their respective Critical Clearing Times (CCTs). Power System Stabilizer (PSS), Static Var Compensator (SVC), Transient Gain Reduction (TGR) and high-speed exciters including static and solid-state exciters are investigated as candidate solutions to the system subjected to multiple-fault conditions. Impact of various factors such as fault location, SVC location, SVC size, PSS gain, exciter type and increased ceiling voltage are discussed using the results obtained from the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation.

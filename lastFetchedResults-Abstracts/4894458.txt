The prime objective of fault-tolerant control systems is to handle faults and discrepancies using appropriate accommodation policies. The issue of obtaining information about various parameters and signals, which have to be monitored for fault detection purposes, becomes a rigorous task with the growing number of subsystems. The structural approach, presented in the paper, constitutes a general framework for providing information when the system becomes complex. The methodology of this approach is illustrated on the ship propulsion benchmark

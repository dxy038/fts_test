Inroduction & Objective: Diabetes is one of the most common diseases in now world, that neuropathy is one of the main problems. In this research the Study of Spinal Alpha motoneuron degeneration after sciatic nerve injury in diabetic rats was investigated.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, 18 male wistar rats divided randomly in 3 groups.(Control, compression, and compression+ diabetes).In compression and compression diabetes group Sciatic nerves were highly compressed, STZ (55 mg/kg) was injected in compression+ diabetes  group. After 1 month care, all rats were cordially perused by 10% formaldehyde and their L4-L6 lumber blocks were serially cut (7?m). Slices were stained with to toluidine blue. By using 
sterological quantitative technique (physical dissector), the number of alpha motoneurons in the right ventral horns of spinal cord were  counted and compared with each other. 
Results: Statistical analyses showed that the number of motor neurons in compression group reduced significantly (789±28) in compare with control group (1766.2±70). Also there was significant difference between compression and compression+diabetes groups (543.3±14). 
Conclusion: Diabetes as a Neurodegenrative disease, increase the neuronal degeneration in the CNS
Key words: Diabetes. Neurodegenrative . Compression

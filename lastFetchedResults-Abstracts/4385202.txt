We propose and demonstrate a convergent wireline and wireless access network using time-and-wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (TWDM-PON) architecture. Bidirectional 40-km single-mode-fiber transmissions (including the 60-GHz wireless transmission) satisfying the forward error correction limit are demonstrated, with data rates of ~10 Gb/s per wavelength in the downstream signal and 17.50 Gb/s per wavelength in the upstream signal. To achieve higher data rate, bit-loading orthogonal frequency-division modulation was used. We also analyze the laser-linewidth-induced performance variation to the signal generated by optical beating and the baseband signal.

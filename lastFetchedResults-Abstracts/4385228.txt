The reliability prediction of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is of paramount importance for planning, design, control, and operation management of vehicles, since it can provide an objective criterion for comparative evaluation of various configurations and topologies and can be used as an effective tool to improve the design and control of the overall system. This paper presents a mission-profile-dependent simulation model based on MATLAB for quantitatively assessing the reliability of the electric drivetrain of HEVs. This model takes into consideration the variable driving scenarios, dormant mode, electrical stresses, and thermal stresses. Therefore, more reliable and accurate prediction of system reliability has been achieved. The methodology is explained in detail, and the results of reliability assessment based on a series HEV are presented. Based on reliability analysis, two control strategies are proposed to increase the mean time to failure of HEV powertrains: 1) variable dc-link voltage control and 2) hybrid discontinuous pulsewidth modulation scheme. These novel control schemes reduce the power losses and thermal stresses of power converters, and consequently, enhance system reliability. Numerical simulation results verify the benefits of two proposed control strategies in terms of power losses and reliability.

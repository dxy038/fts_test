Abstract 
Introduction: Pediatric trauma is considered as a growing public health issue in the world. Trauma is the most common cause of mortality in children and puts a heavy burden on society. 
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of trauma in children admitted to Poursina Teaching Hospital.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on children under 15 years of age  admitted to Poursina Hospital in 2011. Sampling was performed using census method on hospital records. Information on demographic characteristics, type of trauma, season of trauma occurrence, length of hospital stay, trauma location, anatomic trauma site, and death due to trauma were collected and analyzed using SPSS (Version 18). To analyze the relationship between mortality and other variables, Chi-square and T-test were used. P < 0.05 was considered as significance level.
Results: Out of 641 traumatic children enrolled in study, 62.1% were male and 37.9% female. Their mean age was 6.62 Â± 4.16 years. Most common locations of trauma occurrence included house (49.6%), followed by urban roads (32.9%). Most common mechanisms of trauma involved falling (40.4%) and accidents (35.1%). The most common anatomic sites of trauma were head (71.2%), followed by organs (15.5%). Most frequent seasons for people to refer were summer (36%) and spring (31%). A statistically significant difference was observed between treatment outcome (death or survival) and age category (P=0.04). The case with 5 deaths was the one with highest mortality on urban and suburban roads
Conclusion: Given that most injuries occurred in heads and necks of children, using protective equipment such as child seat for infants and safety belt for adults in the car or using appropriate helmet while riding a motorcycle should be mandated in popular culture.

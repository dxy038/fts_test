Stability of solution sets for a group multiobjective programming problem in Banach space is studied. Some conditions for the stability of the group multiobjective programming are given. Using these conditions, stability results of major joint cone weakly efficient point sets and joint cone weakly efficient solution sets in the sense of semi-continuance are obtained with respect to the decision making variable perturbation and objective order perturbation respectively and at the same time.

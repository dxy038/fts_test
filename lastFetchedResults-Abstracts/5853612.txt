The main objective of this paper is to show how important an appropriate management of energy flows must be in the new electric generation plants. These new plants should be technologically "cleaner", more efficient and reliable day by day, and are also expected to lead to lower investment and exploitation costs. The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) with new technologies (fuel cells and hydrogen) will lead to situations involving different equipment with different electric interfaces, opening clear paths for more suitable devices and techniques to be implemented. Those related objectives would be achieved in a higher degree as far as power electronics would be developed.

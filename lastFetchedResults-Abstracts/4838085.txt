Taking the minimum thermal resistance as objective function, a nonlinear, signal objective and multi-constrained optimization model was proposed for the microchannel heat sink in electronic chips cooling. The sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method was used to do the optimization design of the structure size of the microchannel. For the heat sink to cool a chip with the sizes of 12 mm times 12 mm and the power of 400 W, the microchannel number is 29, the width and the height of microchannel is 200 mum and 1800 mum, respectively. The distance from the chip surface to the base of microchannels is 200 mum and the width of the fin is 200 mum. Its corresponding total thermal resistance is 0.2628degC/W. The numerical simulation results show that the heat transfer performance of microchannel heat sink is affected intensively by its dimension. Comparing with the other heat sink, the highest temperature of the optimal dimension heat sink is diminished about 16.48degC when they have the same microchannel heat transfer area.

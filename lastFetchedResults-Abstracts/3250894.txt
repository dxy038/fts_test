Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) is a fundamental process used to populate a data warehouse and an important step towards data integration which is a key step for data preprocessing for many data mining projects. The objective of this project is to create a simple web based ETL tool which can be accessed by anyone with internet access. This ETL tool is also supported by a brief on-line tutorial on ETL process. The combination of tool and tutorial makes an ideal self-paced interactive learning tool for a beginning ETL learner. Guests will have limited access to this tool and registered users can have complete access. Using this tool, data can be extracted from text files or MySQL tables, integrated and loaded into target MySQL tables. Before loading the data into target MySQL tables, various transformations can also be applied to them.

The general objective of the ICFHR 2010 Handwriting Segmentation Contest organized in the context of ICFHR 2010 conference was to use well established evaluation practices and procedures in order to record recent advances in off-line handwriting segmentation. Two new benchmarking datasets, one for text line and one for word segmentation, were created in order to test and compare recent algorithms for handwritten document segmentation in realistic circumstances. Handwritten document images were produced by many writers in several languages (English, French, German and Greek). The dataset of previously organized contest (ICDAR ICDAR 2009 Handwriting Segmentation Contest) was used as training dataset. This paper describes the contest details including the datasets, the ground truth, the evaluation criteria as well as the performance of the 7 submitted methods along with a short description of each method.

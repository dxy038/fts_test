Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is emerging as a worldwide agreed alternative to the reductionist and top-down approach
that was central to the water resource management in the last century. It has been adopted by the Water Framework Directive, the most ambitious
and influential water policy tool of these days, as the guiding principle for the development of River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) that will
be the common tool for planning and managing water resource in Europe in the next years. Although the purpose and priorities of the RBMPS
are clearly and unambiguously defined, the question of how integration and participation are to be promoted in their implementation has not been
adequately addressed. This might be partially attributable to the central role generally assigned to the modelling issues with respect to the
decision-making process, which is behind the definition of RBMPS and of which models are an essential e but not the only e element.
This paper argues the need for a methodological approach to give a first answer to the question posed above and proposes a Participatory
and Integrated Planning (PIP) procedure developed for that purpose. The PIP procedure is a 9 phases procedure that, starting from the identification
of the goals of the planning activity, ends with a negotiation process among the stakeholders that produces a set of compromise alternatives
to be submitted to the decision maker(s) for the final political decision. The procedure is presented both in its theoretical aspects and as
an application to the planning of the Lake Maggiore, a transboundary water system between Italy and Switzerland. This application came out
with a solution that will probably close a long-standing controversial between the two countries: it is strongly supported by the stakeholders of
both the sides and the international agreement it requires is presently under consideration of the Foreign Offices of the two countries. The role for
Multi Objective Decision Support Systems (MODSS) as prime tools to support and operationalize the procedure in practice is finally considered.


Today the River of Karaj is exposed to all kinds of pollutions and destruction of ecosystem because of the destructive effects of Tehran, a city with millions of residents. So it is important to examine the quality of the water of this river to collect information about the current situation. The objective of this study is to find out the role of the Purkan sanitary wastewater refinery on the quality of the water of the river. In current study, samples were collected from four stations: into, out of, before, and after the refinery, in seasonal form, four stages. Concentration of  NO3,NH3,PO4,BOD5,COD,TSS,pH indices were tested according to methods suggested by  standard methods reference. Considering the results of the samples, data analysis was done using statistics. The results of  physical , chemical and microbial analyses of the samples show that the refinery has no good role in decreasing basic parameters such as COD, TSS and FC (specially in summer season).  In many cases,  the parameters were more than the limit. The water in the river has an almost fixed condition, so; entrance of the wastewater into Karaj River does not show a great negative effect. As a result, it seems necessary to make a program to find a solution to remove the problems. Prevention of the direct entrance of the wastewater into the river, modification of refinery function, optimization of filteration, and the use of wastewater in artificial irrigater may help remove these problems.

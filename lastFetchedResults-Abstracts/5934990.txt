Batteries utilized in electric vehicle (EV) are often limited by their capacity. How long one can use an EV is determined by the battery lifetime. Nevertheless, there is difficulty to model the relationship between the load voltage and the current under different temperature and State of Charge (SOC) because the nonlinearity of the property of the battery. This research objective is to model the dynamics of the battery using support vector machine (SVM) which is powerful to approximate nonlinear function. A 1000 mAh Li-Po/MH battery pack is used as the base of SVM learning and testing in order to obtain the battery model. It is seen that SVM model can simulate the battery dynamics very well with limited amounts of experimental data with small relative error.

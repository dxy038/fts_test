OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the fascia lata suburethral sling procedure in the treatment of recurrent genuine urinary stress incontinence. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a retrospective analysis of 60 patients who had a suburethral fascia lata sling placement between January 1992 and December 1995. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 3.5 years. The database was obtained by a retrospective chart review, a written questionnaire, and telephone interview. RESULTS: Between January 1992 and December 1995, 72 patients who had at least one previous incontinence procedure were assessed by urodynamic testing and cystourethroscopic examination before undergoing a fascia lata sling placement. Of this population, 60 were available for follow-up. Of this 60, 54, or 90%, had complete cure or marked improvement in the urinary incontinence. There were six failures, two of which had no bladder neck mobility and two of which had detrusor instability and were unable to take medication because of medical contraindications. In addition, two slings were sacrificed because of postoperative complications. The most common postoperative complication was urinary retention, which resulted in eight, or 13.4%, of slings needing to be released. CONCLUSION: Our data support the use of the suburethral fascia lata sling as an effective method for the treatment of recurrent genuine urinary stress incontinence, with urinary retention being the most common postoperative complication.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:6)

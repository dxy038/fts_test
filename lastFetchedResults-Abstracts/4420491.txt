Mixed resolution framework has been applied in stereoscopic video coding system to reduce data-size and bit rate. Recently, Super Resolution (SR) problem in mixed resolution format has drawn a lot of attention in order to provide the users with high quality 3D visual experience. In this paper we present a novel SR scheme, which not only borrows the high frequency content from neighboring full resolution frame, but also makes use of all high resolution (HR) warped images to enhance low resolution (LR) view image. The correlation between the target LR view and auxiliary HR views determines the weight of these high frequency components, which will be merged into LR frame to construct the output HR image. The DCT is used for frequency decomposition and frequency integration. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher performance in both subjective and objective evaluations.

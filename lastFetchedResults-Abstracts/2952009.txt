We consider the problem of multivariable anti-windup bumpless transfer (AWBT) controller synthesis based on a general AWBT framework. Numerous existing AWBT synthesis techniques are reviewed. Next, we give a completely general formulation of the AWBT controller synthesis problem and propose two possible solutions. Using recent results on multi-objective controller synthesis, we show how these two approaches can give a solution in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI)

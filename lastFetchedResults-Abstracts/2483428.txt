Time is a special and abstract quality of human life that is understood through a concrete and objective thing. Due to this, although we live in Time, we are surprised when we want to talk what Time is and consider it as different from other realities. “George Paulet” (1902-1999), a critic following content criticism, reviews the quality of understanding of authors of different Times (periods) and attempted to have a better angle of “world of awareness” of author and a more exact reading of text by analyzing the apprehension of story characters. 
“Hooshang Golshiri” is one of Iran modern story writers who -using stream of consciousness method- designs his contemporary human identity and his/her apprehension. His story characters are all somehow involved with Time. Using analytic-descriptive method and based on Paulet attitude, the current article reviews Golshiri idea about Time in his story of “A crypt for otter”. This review shows that Golshiri reflects a special kind of Time in story writing that is different from usual and routine Time. Imagination, love, expectation and hope to reform things and persons are some outstanding features of such a Time. However, a pure moment which Golshiri and his heroes seek never occurs in moment of living and this time cannot save them too.

A weight scheduling model predictive controller is proposed for gear shift of an electric vehicle with a 2-speed I-AMT. In the inertia phase, the contradictory control objectives of less friction work and smooth transmission output torque are included in the objective function, which aims to improve shift quality. In order to trade off contradictory requirements, a set of suitable weighting factors are chosen to solve this gear shift control problem. The designed weight scheduling model predictive controller is tested with a complete simulation model of powertrain system in the nominal conditions under different acceleration commands and in the changed conditions. The simulation results verified that the proposed controller can provide satisfactory performance even under uncertainties of vehicle mass and road grade.

We put forward a new matching strategy with more elaborate and realistic concepts to improve on the past matching strategy based on keyword. In this paper, we set up a concept lattice for each Web page according to the natural semantic concepts extracted from each Web page. Such concept lattices are encoded by bidirectional associative memories as apposed to complex lattices building algorithms. Then we extract the formal concepts´ objects and attributes those are relevant to queries´ keywords to carry on matching manipulate.

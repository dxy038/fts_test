Volume of the information on the World Wide Web has become very huge in which digital images occupy the largest chunk of such information due to availability of good-quality digital photographic tools in affordable prices. Goal of ongoing research in the field of Image Retrieval is not only the expansion of storage capacity but also the development of effective and efficient retrieval techniques. The objective of this research is to find a solution for retrieving image information from digital image databases with better rate of recall and precision using theory of soft computing which is suitable to model a system for digital image retrieval because of the capability of this approach to capture the vague and imprecise information in digital images. In this paper a review of conventional and content-based image retrieval techniques has been given and finally a color based fuzzy algorithm for CBIR has been implemented by using Fuzzy C-Means algorithm.

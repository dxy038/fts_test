This paper investigates and analyses geometry in Mihrabi carpet design in Safavid period. These carpets are very important group of Persian carpets in Safavid era. Analysis method is based on the main disciplinary lines in frames. The ultimate objective of this analysis is achieving principal and dynamic points in design composition and suggesting sound geometrical patterns underlying these designs. The conclusion was made that the past designers have turned to geometry as a principal base in carpet designing, and have drawn the designs on the basis of geometry. In designing Mihrabi carpets in Safavid period, just like other arts, special proportions were used in dimensions and some patterns were applied in designs.

Reduction of transmitted vibrations of tractor cabin which is caused by road roughness is the major objective of this study; consequently operator health can be achieved. This objective is carried out via experimental measurements and finite element modeling. For this purpose the vertical acceleration of the cabin as well as the rear axle of the tractor is measured in different road conditions and forward speeds. However, it should be mentioned that tests were carried out according to the ISO 2631-1985 but no measurements were done on the driver’s seat. Then the finite element model of the cabin’s tractor is developed and the dynamic response of the cabin interior (with the measured axle acceleration as input dynamic force) is obtained. At the third step the suspension parameters are calculated by comparing the accelerations obtained from the model and measurements. Finally the suspension parameters are optimized according to ISO 2631-1985 via iterative method.

The main objective of developing a digital image watermarking technique is to satisfy both imperceptibility and robustness requirements. Digital watermarking appears as an efficient means of securing multimedia contents such as copyright protection and authentication. In this paper, we propose SVD-based digital watermarking technique for robust watermarking of digital images for copyright protection. The security of the proposed scheme is increased by applying another wavelet function. We also demonstrate the good correlation between the embedded and the extracted watermark with the help of experimental results. One of the major advantages of the proposed scheme is the robustness of the technique on wide set of attacks. Analysis and experimental results show much improved performance of the proposed method in comparison with the pure SVD-based watermarking and the technique without using some wavelet function. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme provides good image quality of watermarked images.

Background: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is recognized as a re-emerging global
public health issue, especially in tropical and subtropical countries. Malaysia, for example,
has increasingly registered leptospirosis cases, outbreaks, and fatalities over the past decade.
One of the major industries in the country is the palm oil sector, which employs numerous
agricultural workers. These laborers are at a particularly high risk of contracting the disease.
Objective: To identify the work environment-related risk factors for leptospirosis infection
among oil palm plantation workers in Malaysia.
Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 350 workers was conducted. The participants
were interviewed and administered a microscopic agglutination test. Seropositivity was determined
using a cut-off titer of â‰¥1:100.
Results: 100 of 350 workers tested positive for leptospiral antibodies, hence, a seroprevalence
of 28.6% (95% CI 23.8% to 33.3%). The workplace environment-related risk factors
significantly associated with seropositive leptospirosis were the presence of cows in plantations
(adjusted OR 4.78, 95% CI 2.76 to 8.26) and the presence of a landfill in plantations
(adjusted OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.40).
Conclusion: Preventing leptospirosis incidence among oil palm plantation workers necessitates
changes in policy on work environments. Identifying modifiable factors may also contribute
to the reduction of the infection.

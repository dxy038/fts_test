The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between allelic imbalance (AI) on chromosome 5q and clinico-pathologic parameters, including cigarette smoking. We examined the AI on chromosome 5q in 119 clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (CRCC) by a fluorescent polymerase chain reaction technique using nine microsatellite markers. AI of one or more loci was found in 43 cases (36.1%). The most frequent AI was observed at chromosome 5q23.1 (D5S467), where the LOX gene is located. The minimally involved region ranged from 5q22.1 to 5q23.2, with a possible breakpoint between 5q22 and 5q22.1. Regarding the relationships between the frequency of AI and the clinico-pathologic and environmental backgrounds, smokers had a significantly higher frequency of AI of 5q22.2∼q22.3 (D5S471) than nonsmokers (P = 0.013). No other significant associations were found between AI of specific loci and other parameters. Our results suggest that AI at 5q plays an important role in the genesis of CRCC. In addition, smoking may cause genetic alterations at 5q22.2∼q23.1, where the LOX gene is located.

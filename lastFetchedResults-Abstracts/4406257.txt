The treatment period was 3 months. Results: 1. When comparing 1 month after and before the treatment, as well as 3 months after and 1 month after the treatment, the PSQI total score and TCM syndrome scale score of the two groups were decreased, showing statistically significant difference (P&lt;;0.05); 1 month or 3 months after the treatment, there were statistically significant difference (P&lt;;0.05) in the PSQI total score and TCM syndrome scale score between the two group; 2. When comparing 3 months after the treatment and before the treatment, the scores of PF, RP, GH, VT, SF, RE, BP and MH in SF-36 Scale of the two groups were increased, showing statistically significant difference (P&lt;;0.05); 3 months after the treatment, the scores of RP, VT and SF of the treatment group were significantly higher than those of the control group, showing statistically significant difference (P&lt;;0.05); 3. 3 months after the treatment, the curative effect of the treatment group was better than that of the control group, showing statistically significant difference (P&lt;;0.05); as to effective rate, the treatment group was better than the control group, showing statistically significant difference (P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: Both acupuncture with ear pricking and only acupuncture show therapeutic effects in treating non-organic insomnia due to deficiency of both the heart and spleen, and the former is better than the latter in improving quality of life and clinical effect.

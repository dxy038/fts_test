The objective of the note is to introduce an intelligent controller reorganization for systems with actuator failures (outages). An adaptive detection observer is utilized to monitor the system for possible actuator outages and a control logic is incorporated to switch (reorganize) the control policy the instant an actuator failure is detected in order to improve performance. The system under consideration is assumed to be square and the requisite control and stability arguments for failure detection and accommodation are similar to those for switched systems and which employ LMIs for controller design

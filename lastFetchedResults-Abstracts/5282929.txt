Wireless mobile networks have become crucial in providing untethered communication services to mobile users. In this paper, we propose an optimization model for the design of survivable wireless access networks. The main objective of the model is to optimize the network design cost of wireless backhaul networks while meeting survivability requirements. This paper also presents a simple and efficient heuristic method to solve the network design model for large network problem sizes within a reasonable computational time while obtaining a near optimal solution.

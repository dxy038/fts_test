In this paper, an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme is designed for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access cellular wireless networks with multiuser cooperation. Joint relay selection, subcarrier allocation and pairing, and power-allocation algorithms are developed with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency of the system considering the quality-of-service requirements of the users. The optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is generally very difficult to solve in its original form. The energy efficiency metric is a fractional and nonlinear function, which complicates the problem further. We provide a novel optimization framework to solve such nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems. The MINLP optimization problem is reformulated to a convex problem by relaxing the integer variables and by introducing the "Dinkelbach" method to tackle the nonlinear fractional objective function. We prove that our proposed solution of the relaxed problem is optimal and has integer values. Based on the dual-decomposition method, we propose a solution to the joint optimization problem, which is optimal and computationally efficient with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

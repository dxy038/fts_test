Background: ease in scoring,performingand identity of multiple choice tests has caused that those apply as the essential instruments in large scale assessments. There was intense criticism toward multiple choices. For example, those not perform all of educational goals (those assess low cognitive levels) and because of using guess to answering questions. Herein, some people for solving of these problems were suggested that we should increase choices of questions. 
Objectives: The objective of this research was the study of effects of number of item choices on psychometric characteristics of test and items and also on estimated ability of subjects in classical test theory and item- response theory (IRT).
Methods: The statistical population was all of high schoolâ€™ students of Shiraz. That 608 of them were randomly selected as sample group. In order to response to study questions, we used the empirical method and for data collecting we used two language and arithmetic tests that were provided to this goal. 
Results: Data analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of item choices on item parameters and the effect of item choices on estimated psychometric characteristics of subjects in different tests is equal. Furthermore, there was difference between estimated parameters in classical test theory and item-response theory (IRT). 
Conclusion: After checking assumptions of item response theory (IRT), this was appeared that data have better fitted with two- parameter model and there was no difference between item choices and fitting with model. In addition, there was difference between estimated ability and item choices too.

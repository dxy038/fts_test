With the objective of determining the effects of initial
infection level (% leaf area infected, % l.a.i.) at the
time of fungicide and foliar nutrient application for
the control of powdery mildew, a study was carried
out under greenhouse conditions at Embrapa Soja,
Londrina, P.R. The fungicide tebuconazole (100 g a.i./
ha/application) and sulphur fungicide (2.0kg a.i./ha/
application), sprayed at 20, 30, 40 and 50% l.a.i.
(growth stages V3 and V5, between R5.1 and R5.3), and
three applications (at V3, V4 and R5.1, beginning at
20% l.a.i.) of tebuconazole were compared with sulphur
foliar nutrient (sulphur at the dose of 125 g a.i./ha/
application). The highly susceptible BR-16 cultivar was
used in a completely randomized design with 11 treatments,
five replications (pots) and five plants per pot.
The parameters evaluated were: % l.a.i., % yellowing
leaf when the control reached growth stage R7.2
(between 50and 75% yellow/mature leaves), % defoliation
(% defol.) when the control plants reached R8.2
(pre-harvest maturity), number of pods and seeds and
seed weight (s.w.) per plant. The area under the disease
progress curve (AUDPC) was determined based on
disease progress. The % l.a.i. and AUDPC of the control
(98% and 65.41) differed from other treatments
(3.5–64.2% l.a.i. and 13.57–40.59 AUDPC). The
% l.a.i. for the sulphur fungicide treatment (41.9–
64.2%) and sulphur foliar nutrient (49.8%) were
greater than for tebuconazole (3.5–28%). The % defol.
of the control (90%) differed from tebuconazole
applied at 30% initial infection (48%), with three
applications (45%), and from sulphur foliar nutrient
(47%). The s.w./plant of the control (2.23 g) was lower
than that of tebuconazole treated at 40% IL (3.03 g)
and at 20% IL (3.35 g) and for sulphur foliar nutrient
(3.7 g). The initial disease severity (20–50% l.a.i.) did
not affect the level of powdery mildew control and the
sulphur foliar fertilizer resulted in greater number and
higher s.w./plant.

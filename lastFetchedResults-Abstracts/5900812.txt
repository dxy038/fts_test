This project investigates the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) that eventually leads to the development of an appropriate ontology to represent and integrates the taxonomy of PSM elements as a knowledge base for safety process analysis. The main objective is to overcome the tedious manual PSM safety audit processes commonly practice in the industry. The proposed PSM ontology provides the fundamental set of knowledge representation for the PSM elements. This PSM ontology semantically integrates the PSM elements and their relationships thus forming a computer readable knowledge base as the platform for artificial intelligent machines to process and automate PSM audit processes. The proposed ontology shall become a framework for further development in PSM domain. Prote&#769;ge&#769; is used as the main development tool in this project The outcomes of the project were evaluated and validated quantitatively and qualitatively using OntoQA metric, OSHA PSM compliance checklist, and by PSM domain researchers.

It is indispensable for the secure operation of a power system to grasp its operating conditions on-line. Static state estimation is a powerful tool for this objective. The authors presents a parallel computation scheme of state estimation by means of an MIMD type processor. In this method, the system is divided into several subsystems based on the sparse factorization path concepts. The gain matrix is transformed into a bordered block diagonal matrix, and each block is allocated to each transputer, which constitutes an MIMD type processor to realize parallel computations. The construction of the Jacobian and gain matrix. LU factorization, and forward/backward substitutions are performed separately at each processor

The self-organizing knowledge representation aspects in heterogeneous information environments involving object-oriented databases, relational databases, and rulebases are investigated. The authors consider a facet of self-organizability which sustains the structural semantic integrity of an integrated schemea regardless of the dynamic nature of local schemata. To achieve this objective, they propose an overall scheme for schema translation and schema integration with an object-oriented data model as common data model, and it is shown that integrated schemata can be maintained effortlessly by propagating updates in local schemata to integrated schemata unambiguously

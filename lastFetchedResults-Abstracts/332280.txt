Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether a dentine bonding agent (DBA) had an effect in reducing fluid filtration under cemented provisional crowns.

Methods. Crown preparations on 34 premolars, randomly allocated to two equal-sized test and control groups, were assessed for dentine permeability by a fluid filtration technique. In the test group, prepared crowns were acid-etched and then treated with a DBA (Prime & Bond NT). In the control group, no such DBA was applied. Provisional crowns were cemented on both groups of teeth using non-eugenol zinc oxide cement. Fluid filtration rates were measured repeatedly after crown preparation, at cementation, 1 h, 1 day, 1 week and 3 weeks following crown cementation for both groups. Filtration rates were also measured after acid-etching and dentine bonding for the test group.

Results. There was insufficient evidence to suggest any statistically significant differences either between the two groups or, on average, across the five time points in each group in terms of the relative percentage of fluid filtration.

Conclusion. The DBA used did not seal dentinal tubules any more than did the smear layer and provisional crowns luted with a non-eugenol ZnO cement.

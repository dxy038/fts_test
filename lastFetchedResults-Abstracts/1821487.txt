Objective
m of the present study was to evaluate the influence of glycemic control on the frequency of Epstein-Bar (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in periodontal pockets of type 2 diabetic subjects with chronic periodontitis.

six subjects presenting generalized chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were selected for this study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the presence of EBV and CMV in shallow [Probing Depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm], moderate (PD = 4–6 mm) and deep (PD &gt; 7 mm) pockets. HbA1c levels ≤7%, &gt;7 to &lt;10%, and ≥10% defined good, moderate and poor glycemic control, respectively.
s
 frequency of EBV was found in the shallow pockets of the subjects with poor glycemic control (p &lt; 0.05; chi-square test). Moreover, EBV-free subjects presented moderate or good glycemic control. Glycemic control did not influence the frequency of CMV in all pocket categories.
sion
lycemic control in type 2 diabetic subjects can increase the occurrence of EBV in shallow periodontal pockets.

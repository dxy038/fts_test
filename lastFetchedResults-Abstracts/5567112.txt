The main objective of the project - to provide new data about the signal strength and coverage of the actual signal Ka-band beams 75 and 76 satellite Ka-Sat in the Arkhangelsk region, Murmansk Oblast and Nenets Autonomous District, the Barents and the White Sea and the development of experimental design of the sample measurement equipment Ka-band for the Far North. Applications coverage maps - Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Oblast and Nenets, Barents and White seas. The cards will be used for the organization of high-quality satellite broadband communications and Internet services for coastal developments and the shelf of the Arctic Ocean. Experimental Design sample measurement equipment Ka-band will serve as a prototype for similar devices.

Objective Recent studies have shown
that asthma represents a major health issue not only
in children of developed countries but also in urban
centers in some middle-income countries. Brazil has
one of the highest prevalences of asthma worldwide.
Recently, interest has grown in the relationship between
psychosocial factors and asthma. This article
examines the relationship between maternal mental
disorders and the prevalence of asthma in low-income
children from an inner city area of Salvador in the
state of Bahia, Brazil, and is part of the SCAALA
program (Social Change, Allergy and Asthma in Latin
America). Patients and methods A total of 1,087
children between the ages of 5 and 12 were investigated,
together with their mothers. The mothersâ€™
mental health was evaluated using the SRQ-20, an
instrument for the psychiatric screening of minor
psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety and somatic
complaints). The prevalence of asthma was
investigated using the ISAAC survey, a standardized,
validated questionnaire for asthma and other allergic
diseases. Cases were defined as asthma if the patient
reported having had wheezing in the previous
12 months in addition to at least one of the following:
having asthma, wheezing while exercising, waking
during the night because of wheezing, or having had
at least four episodes of wheezing in the previous
12 months. Atopy was defined as a positive skin prick
test to allergens. Results and conclusion The presence
of minor psychiatric disorders in the mothers was
significantly associated with the presence of asthma in
the children, and this association was consistent with
all forms of asthma, irrespective of whether it was
atopic or nonatopic. Future studies should be carried
out to further investigate this association and the
potential biological mechanisms involved. Programs
for asthma control should include strategies for stress
reduction and psychological support for the families
of asthmatic children.

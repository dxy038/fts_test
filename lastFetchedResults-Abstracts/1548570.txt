Our aim is to suggest ways of improving time-domain modelling, for the purpose of more effective forecasting, by better interpretation of the sample autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations obtained from raw time-series data. For this objective, we assume no specialist knowledge, as we start by surveying all those standard ideas of univariate analysis which are needed for the subsequent development of our thesis.

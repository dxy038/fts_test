The measurement of motility is an important component for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Now only the invasive measurements of partial GI have been reported such as gullet, rectum that were very inconvenient and uncomfortable. So making use of the MEMS technology, we developed a microsystem to monitor the motility and its changes of the whole GI tract under normal physiological status in a long period. Each functional part of the system is introduced, which mainly includes a capsule for monitoring GI motility in vivo, a portable data recorder and an ultrasonic localization system. We made animal experiment on a pig and the result shows that the system can work effectively as designed.

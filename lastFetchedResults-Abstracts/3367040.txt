In this paper, two evolutionary programming (EP) algorithms (classical EP and fast EP) are applied to design prototype lowpass Finite Impulse Response filters for use in a modulated filterbank. The chosen filter design technique is based on frequency-sampling (where the Fourier transform magnitudes of the filter are the objective variables). Design is simplified by constraining most of these values, leaving only a small number of values in the filter transition band to be optimized. The EP algorithms were used to determine the optimum values for this subset of values. Since there is an additional monotonic constraint on the transition band values, a modification to the EP algorithms was developed called variable limits evolutionary programming. Results indicate that a) both EP algorithms were insensitive to initial conditions, and reliably found the minimum values of the chosen objective functions, and b) the designed prototype filters are suitable to obtain near-perfect reconstruction filter banks, offering quality parameters comparable or better than systems obtained using other techniques

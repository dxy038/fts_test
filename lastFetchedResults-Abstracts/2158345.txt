Background and Objective: Nurses' adequate knowledge and skills in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is effective in increasing success rate and reducing mortality rate following CPR. This study was conducted to compare the effect of two methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation education including computer-based stimulation and mannequin stimulation on nursing students' knowledge and satisfaction.
Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 64 nursing students randomly assigned to two groups including computer based stimulation and mannequin stimulation. Students' demographic characteristics, knowledge about CPR and satisfaction with CPR education methods measured before and after performing intervention. Data was analyzed by SPSS18 software using descriptive and analytics statistics tests.
Results: Findings revealed that knowledge mean scores were different between pre and post intervention in mannequin stimulation group (7.72±3.46 and 9.68±2.93). The difference between two groups was statistically significant. Both groups were satisfied with the employed methods. Satisfaction rate was more in mannequin stimulation group compared to computer based stimulation group and this difference was statistically significant.
Conclusion: Given the positive impact of simulation in improving knowledge and satisfaction of students from CPR education, it is recommended that this method to be used especially for medical groups.

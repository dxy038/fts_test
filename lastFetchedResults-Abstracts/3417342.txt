PWM voltage source inverters (VSI´s) supplied from diode rectifiers are employed with most of today´s static power supplies for variable frequency ac type loads. This method generates nonsinusoidal input and output voltage/current waveforms and yields poor system reliability. An upgraded method of power conversion is presented that eliminates both problems. In addition, it allows bidirectional power flow which improves efficiency and simplifies cooling requirements. The subject method requires a PWM rectifier and a PWM current source inverter. Advanced PWM techniques employed with both static Converters allow the minimization of all associated passive components.

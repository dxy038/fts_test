In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) and the gradient descent method is presented. In the FCM, the minimization process of the objective function is proceeded by solving two equations alternatively in an iterative fashion. Each iteration requires the use of all the data at once. In our proposed approach one datum at a time is presented to the network, and the minimization is proceeded using the gradient descent method. Compared to FCM, the experimental results show that our algorithm is very competitive in terms of speed and stability of convergence for large number of data

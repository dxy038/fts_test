Multi-radio access selection (MRAS) is a key issue to obtain performance improvement in heterogeneous wireless networks. MRAS can affect the usersÂ´ QoS directly, as well as the resource allocation and load balance for networks. In this paper, a universal MRAS decision model was set up by multi-objective optimization methods. Parameters from upper layer and lower layer related with network selection were classified systematically, and a new multi-attributes decision making algorithm combined genetic algorithm and Tchebycheff method was proposed. The simulation results show that the parameters are identified effectively, and the network selection mechanism we proposed based on the multi-objective optimization modeling can select the appropriate network for users.

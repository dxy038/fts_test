OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze placental metabolism in a genetically controlled in vitro animal model.
STUDY DESIGN: Placentas from Sprague-Dawley rats were centrifuged, and microsomes were isolated. Four treatment groups were incubated with cocaine over four time periods: placental micromes + cocaine, placental microsomes + diisopropyl fluorophosphate (an anticholinesterase) + cocaine, placental microsomes + cocaine + butyrylcholinesterase, and a blank (cocaine only). Gas chromatography was used to quantify cocaine (Limit of QUANTITATION = 19 ng/ml) and metabolites. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to verify the identity of the metabolites.
RESULTS: Butyrylcholinesterase enhanced cocaine metabolism to ecgonine methyl ester. More than 40% of cocaine was metabolized to norcocaine by rat placenta when diisopropyl fluorophosphate suppressed cocaine. Norcocaine is produced by hepatic N-demethylase action on methyl-bearing nitrogen in cocaine, suggesting that placenta and liver have this capacity. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was essential to the identification of norcocaine, because norcocaine is frequently not identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This biotransformation of cocaine to norcocaine may be a primary metabolic pathway induced in the cholinesterase-deficient placenta. This has clinical implications because norcocaine is ninefold more active physiologically than cocaine or ecgononine methylesterase.

In the reports in the literature on inventory control, the effects of the random capacity on an order quantity
and reorder point inventory control model have been integrated with lead time demand following
general distribution. An iterative solution procedure has been proposed for obtaining the optimal solution.
However, the resulting solution may not exist or it may not guarantee to give a minimum to the
objective cost function, the expected cost per unit time. The aim of this study was to introduce a complete
solution of the order quantity/reorder point problem, optimality, properties and bounds on the optimal
order quantity and reorder point. The two most appealing distributions of lead time demand, normal and
uniform distributions, in conjunction with an exponentially distributed capacity, are used to illustrate our
findings in determining the optimal order quantity and reorder point.

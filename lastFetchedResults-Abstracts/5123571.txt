A high level animation language is being developed to allow programmers to specify movements within &#8220;obstacle-rich&#8221; environments. An environment is provided in which the user can describe the behaviour of multiple walking figures. The objective is to explore and incorporate into the system, several algorithms for route planning so that, movements can be specified by merely giving the final position as a goal. The authors present some of the details of the language system that has been built and the implementation of a route finding algorithm which was incorporated into the system

The objective of this study was to elucidate the nitric oxide–forming reactions of the iron-N-methyl-image-glucamine dithiocarbamate (Fe-MGD) complex from the nitrogen-containing compound hydroxyurea. The Fe2+(MGD)2  complex is commonly used in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic detection of NO both in vivo and in vitro. The reaction of Fe2+(MGD)2 with NO yields the resultant NO-Fe2+(DETC)2 complex, which has a characteristic triplet EPR signal. It is widely believed that only NO reacts with Fe2+(MGD)2 to form the NO-Fe2+(MGD)2 complex. In this report, the mechanism leading to the formation of NO-Fe2+(MGD)2  was investigated using oxygen-uptake studies in conjunction with the EPR spin-trapping technique. We found that the air oxidation of Fe2+(MGD)2 complex results in the formation of the Fe3+(MGD)3 complex, presumably concomitantly with superoxide (O2•−). Dismutation of superoxide forms hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently reduce Fe3+(MGD)3 back to Fe2+(MGD)2. The addition of NO to the Fe3+(MGD)3 complex resulted in the formation of the NO-Fe2+(MGD)2  complex. Hydroxyurea is not considered to be a spontaneous NO donor, but has to be oxidized in order to form NO. We present data showing that in the presence of oxygen, Fe2+(MGD)2 can oxidize hydroxyurea to yield the stable NO-Fe2+(MGD)2  complex. These results imply that hydroxyurea can be oxidized by reactive oxygen species that are formed from the air oxidation of the Fe2+(MGD)2 complex. Formation of the NO-Fe2+(MGD)2 complex in this case could erroneously be interpreted as spontaneous formation of NO from hydroxyurea. The chemistry of the Fe2+(MGD)2  complexes in aerobic conditions must be taken into account in order to avoid erroneous conclusions. In addition, the use of these complexes may contribute to the overall oxidative stress of the system under investigation.

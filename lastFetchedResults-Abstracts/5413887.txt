Finishing an engineering program with the highest academic standards, and giving a diploma certifies the graduate skills to apply pertinent knowledge to the practice of engineering. Traditionally, the way of certifying the knowledge is through isolated academic evaluations whose results are supposed to estimate the overall student performance. The necessity for predicting and diagnosing the students performance and for improving the teaching-learning processes through the use of academic evaluations, in a continuous way, is imperative in educational institutions with the commitment of continuous quality improvement. Moreover, with these results, the administration could take actions on time, especially if the institutions have defined (a requirement for graduation) to pass an academic evaluation. This document shows the academic results of the Monterrey Tech Queretaro Campus versus Monterrey Tech System (ITESM System) and CENEVAL national evaluations (National Center for Evaluation) in different curricula of electronics engineering programs. A methodology is proposed for implementing an academic adaptive evaluation system using the technological platform Lotus Notes/Learning Space. The objective is to certify the academic performance of the students when they finish their engineering studies

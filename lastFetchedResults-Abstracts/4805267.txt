The Pan-European Laboratory (Panlab) is a concept that is being introduced to enable the trial and evaluation of service concepts, technologies, system solutions and business models to the point where the risks associated with launching of these as commercial products will be minimized. The accomplishment of this objective, which should encompass many different European collaborative projects, is an important step towards the establishment of a truly pan European collaboration network. A Common Technology Vision for ICT and the Panlab serves as a Technology Roadmap and as a Strategic Development Guideline for European and global telecommunications. Furthermore it defines a Pan European Laboratory (Panlab) for next generation networks and services in terms of legal and operational general conditions, as well as in terms of technical infrastructure. The result is a framework under which a Panlab should operate. The Panlab will build a full chart of the testing labs and sites available and will present a plan of coordination between these so that the full benefit will be realised. It will pave the way for a clear view of where in Europe is the best place to test a specific technology, system, service or application. It will enable the implementation of a physical infrastructure (interconnection facilities, remote management capabilities, etc.), aiming at establishing integration, testing, validation/verification and possibly certification services for product prototypes of European collaborative projects. The ultimate goal is the establishment of the grounds for a future operational and long-term self-sustainable Pan-European laboratory including a business model that would advise on the continuation as an independent entity

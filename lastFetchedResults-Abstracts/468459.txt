Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether a cytosine to thymine mutation at nucleotide 677 in the gene encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is associated with particular subtypes of recurrent unexplained spontaneous abortion. Study Design: The prevalences of cytosine to thymine mutation at nucleotide 677 in the gene encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase among 41 patients with recurrent unexplained spontaneous abortions and among 18 healthy control subjects were determined with polymerase chain reaction. Results: Homozygosity and heterozygosity for the cytosine to thymine mutation at nucleotide 677 in the gene encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase were observed at nonsignificantly different rates among patients and control subjects (9% and 48% versus 22% and 38%, respectively, P< .95). Among patients with recurrent unexplained spontaneous abortions both homozygosity and heterozygosity were associated with significantly increased prevalence of recurrent early fetal loss rather than with repeated anembryonic gestations (P< .0001). Conclusion: The observation that polymorphism for the cytosine to thymine mutation at nucleotide 677 in the gene encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is associated with repeated early fetal losses rather than with anembryonic gestations strengthens the argument for the role of hypercoagulability and abnormal uteroplacental vasculature in recurrent spontaneous abortion.

We present a multi-objective simulation-based optimization tool. The proposed tool can handle a large variety of analog circuits since it is able to include a large spectrum of performances. Application examples are presented to show viability of this tool. Two current mode circuits are considered, namely a conventional second generation CMOS current conveyor and a differential based current conveyor. The tool is used to generate the Pareto front linking two conflicting objectives for both circuits. Comparisons with already published works dealing with the same circuits but using the equation-based optimization approaches are given.

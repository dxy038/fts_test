Considering resources constraints of supply chain environment, a problem of products optimal decision under demand uncertainty was studied in this paper. Putting every component of supply chain such as suppliers, manufacturing plant, distribution centers and customers into an identical decision system, an integrated optimal stochastic chance constraint programming model with objective of maximum profit was presented. According to characteristics of the problem, a real number genome matrix encoding based genetic algorithm combining with stochastic sampling constraints verifying was proposed. A numeric example is performed and the results illustrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of proposed model and algorithm.

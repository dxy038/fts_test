The purpose of this paper is to describe a broad spectrum of seismic deconvolution problems and solutions which we refer to collectively as maximum-likelihood (seismic) deconvolution (MLD). Our objective is to perform deconvolution and wavelet estimation for the case of nonminimum phase wavelets. Our approach is to exploit state-variable technology, maximum-likelihood estimation, and a sparse spike train (Bernoulli-Gaussian) model for the reflection signal. Our solution requires detection of significant reflectors, wavelet and variance identification (nonlinear optimization), and estimation of the spike density parameter.

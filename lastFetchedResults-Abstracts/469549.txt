Objective
This study was undertaken to assess job satisfaction and quality of life among obstetrics and gynecology residents before the 80-hour work week.
Study design
We administered a job satisfaction survey to residents before July 1, 2003, assessing satisfaction with residency training, indicators of current quality of life, and predictions for the effect of reduced work hours.
Results
Residents were satisfied with training, with important outliers, including leisure time, ability to pursue educational reading, and surgical experience. We created job satisfaction facets that were generally reliable constructs and valid predictors for overall residency satisfaction. Residents predict more free time and a healthier lifestyle under the new requirements, but do not anticipate using additional time to study or teach.
Conclusion
Job satisfaction facets for residents are proposed here and may be refined through further study. Lower scores for surgical experience are of concern in light of decreasing work hours. Educators must monitor self-directed learning efforts under new work hours.

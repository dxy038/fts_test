A nonlinear state-feedback control suitable for large-signal applications and based on a bilinear average description of bidirectional switching DC-to-DC power converters is presented. The application of this technique to second and fourth order nonisolated power converters reveals that one stable equilibrium point can be reached in each case. Experimental results obtained in a bidirectional boost power converter with output filter verify the theoretical predictions

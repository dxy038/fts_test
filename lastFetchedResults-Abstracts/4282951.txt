This paper describes a variable-speed motion-sensorless permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) control system for wind energy generation. The proposed system contains a PMSG connected to the grid by a back-to-back PWM inverter with bidirectional power flow, a line filter, and a transformer. The control system employs PI current controllers with cross- coupling decoupling for both inverters, an active power controller, and a DC link voltage controller. The PMSG rotor speed without using emf integration, and the line voltage frequency are estimated by two PLL based observers. A D- module filter is used to robustly estimate the grid voltage positive- sequence for control in the case of asymmetric voltages. The paper investigates the ride-through performance of this system during asymmetric power grid voltage sags. Design details for various parts of the control system are presented, together with experimental results for single-, two-, and three-phase voltage source sags. Smooth transition through asymmetric voltage sags is demonstrated by all experiments.

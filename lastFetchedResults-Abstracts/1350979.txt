The clinical significance of ABO and Rhesus blood group systems has been well documented. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of ABO and Rhesus blood groups in blood donors in Lahore, Pakistan, with a view to generate data with multipurpose future practicalities in the field of medicine. Blood groups of 3000 blood donors were determined by commercially available standard monoclonal antisera by tube agglutination technique. Out of 3000 donors, 92.2% were males and 0.8% were females. The most frequent ABO blood group present was B (37.8 %) followed by O (28.8%), A (24.2%) and AB (9.1%) in blood donors; while in Rhesus system 93.0% were Rh+ve  and 7.0% were .Rh-ve . The most important implementation of such studies is in management of blood banks and transfusion services.

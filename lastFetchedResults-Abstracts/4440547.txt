This paper presents an approach for optimizing paths online for a pursuit-evasion problem where an agent must visit several target positions within a region of interest while simultaneously avoiding one or more actively-pursuing adversaries. This is relevant to applications such as robotic path planning, mobile-sensor applications, and path exposure. The methodology described utilizes cell decomposition to construct a modified decision tree to achieve the objective of minimizing the risk of being caught by an adversary and maximizing a reward associated with visiting the target locations. By computing paths online, the algorithm can quickly adapt to unexpected movements by the adversaries or dynamic environments. The approach is illustrated through a modified version of the video game Ms. Pac-Man which is shown to be a benchmark example of the pursuit-evasion problem. The results show that the approach presented in this paper runs in real-time and outperforms several other methods as well as most human players.

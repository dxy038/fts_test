ABSTRACT: Early blight, caused by Alternaria solani, is a fungal disease which affects solanaceous crops. Powdery mildew, caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea, is one of the most serious diseases of cucumber, resulting in significant yield losses on fruit. Chemical fungicides are not considered as long-term solutions due to the concerns associated with exposure risks, health and environmental hazards, residue persistence, and development of tolerance. The objective of this study was determination of antifungal properties of Achillea wilhelmsii oil from two regions in Iran against A. solani and S. fuliginea. Determination of antifungal activity was performed by hole plate diffusion method. The results indicated that the oil of Sardasht and Chamgol could inhibit growth of the A. solani. The oil of Sardasht could inhibit growth of the S. fuliginea while the oil of Chamgol could not inhibit it.

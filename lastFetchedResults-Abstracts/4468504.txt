This paper presents a global tuning procedure for FACTS power oscillation damping (POD) and power system stabilizers (PSSs) in a multi-machine power system using real coded genetic algorithm. The stabilizerÂ´s gains are obtained through the minimization of an objective function based on the damping ratio. The proposed controllers were simultaneously designed and they have provided a coordinated control action and a satisfactory performance for the power system, as shown in the results.

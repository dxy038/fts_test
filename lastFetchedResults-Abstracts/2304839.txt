BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Performance indicators are the essential tools for measuring the efficiency of hospital services. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of performance indicators by the Pabon Lasso Model in the teaching hospitals of Babol affiliated with Babol University of Medical Sciences.
METHODS: This experimental study was conducted using a descriptive method and the performance indicators of the Pabon Lasso Model from 2011 to 2014 in four major medical centers and hospitals of Babol University of Medical Sciences (Beheshti, Ayatollah Rohani, Yahyanejad and Children’s Hospital of Amirkola). Data were extracted from the monthly database of the Ministry of Health consisting of the inpatient bed occupancy rate, bed turnover rate, bed turnover interval and the patients’ average length of stay. The collected data were evaluated according to the criteria of the Health Ministry.
FINDINGS: In 2011, the Children’s Hospital of Amirkola and Ayatollah Rohani Hospital accounted for the highest (75.74%) and the lowest (69%) bed occupancy rate, respectively. In 2014, the highest rate of bed occupancy was observed in Ayatollah Rohani Hospital (82%). The comparison of the indices by the Pabon Lasso Model indicated that all the four surveyed centers were located in the third area of the diagram from 2011 to 2014.
CONCLUSION: In general, the indicators surveyed in this study appeared to be desirable compared to the criteria of the Ministry of Health, with the exception of the patients’ average length of stay. Thus, further attempts are required as to reduce the average length of stay in the patients.

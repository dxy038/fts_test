The objective of the present work was to characterize commercial-grade Tyranno SA SiC fiber reinforced chemically vapour infiltrated (CVI) SiC matrix composites (SiCf/SiC) with chemically vapour deposited (CVD) SiC coating. The characterization includes the assessment of the monotonic mechanical properties. Low cycle flexural fatigue behaviour has been investigated at room temperature (RT) and 1000 째C by means of 4-point bending tests. The creep behaviour at 1000 째C was preliminary investigated by means of constant bending stress rupture test. The material showed a pronounced degradation of monotonic mechanical properties at high temperature. Low cycle flexural fatigue behaviour showed excellent and satisfactory results at RT and 1000 째C, respectively. The creep resistance at 1000 째C is significant only at low load level.

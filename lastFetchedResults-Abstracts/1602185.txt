The existence of a representative volume element (RVE) for a class of quasi-brittle materials having a random heterogeneous microstructure in tensile, shear and mixed mode loading is demonstrated by deriving tractionâ€“separation relations, which are objective with respect to RVE size. A computational homogenization based multiscale crack modelling framework, implemented in an FE2 setting, for quasi-brittle solids with complex random microstructure is presented. The objectivity of the macroscopic response to the micro-sample size is shown by numerical simulations. Therefore, a homogenization scheme, which is objective with respect to macroscopic discretization and microscopic sample size, is devised. Numerical examples including a comparison with direct numerical simulation are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

Despite consistent evidence that adolescent girls
are at greater risk of developing depression than adolescent
boys, risk factor models that account for this difference
have been elusive. The objective of this research was to
examine risk factors proposed by the gender additive model
of depression that attempts to partially explain the increased
prevalence of depression in adolescent girls. The theory
suggests that body image and eating related variables
predict depression for girls, but not for boys, above and
beyond the variance accounted for by other well-known
risk factors, some of which were examined in the current
study. The sample was 247 adolescent girls and 181
adolescent boys studied over a 24-month duration. Results
suggest that body dissatisfaction is a potent predictor of
depression for girls, but not for boys, above and beyond the
predictive effects of other established risk factors. Results
provide insight into the etiology of adolescent depression
and the disparate rate of depression among adolescent
girls and provide direction for identifying high-risk individuals
and developing effective prevention programs.

Compared with photovoltaic panels only and wind only stand alone energy systems, the hybrid PV/wind system is more economical and reliable. It can be able to adapt to climate changes. This paper presents a new method to design the PV/wind system. While meeting the basic requirements of the stand-alone energy system, the minimum cost of objective function is constructed which is considering initial cost, yearly operating costs and maintenance costs. The hybrid system consists of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and storage batteries. Considering the complexity of this nonlinear integral planning, differential evolution algorithm is used to solve this problem. By use of migrant operation strategy, the global optimal searching ability of the proposed algorithm is further improved. The improved differential evolution algorithm can avoid to the local minimum trap. The method mentioned in this article is proved to be effective through using an example. Finally, the optimal solution is received.

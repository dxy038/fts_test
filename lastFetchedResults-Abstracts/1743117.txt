Linked-segment representations of human body dynamics have been used extensively in biomechanics, ergonomics, and rehabilitation research to systemize thinking, make predictions, and suggest novel experiments. In the scope of upper body biomechanics, these models play an even more essential role as the human spine dynamics are difficult to study in vivo. No study exists to date, however, that specifically disseminates the technical details of a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the upper body for the purpose of estimating spinal joint torques and forces for a wide range of scenarios. Consequently, researchers are still bound to develop and implement their own models. Therefore, the objective of this study was to design a dynamic model of the upper body that can comprehensively estimate spinal joint torques and forces from upper body kinematics. The proposed three-dimensional model focuses on the actions of the lumbar and cervical vertebrae and consists of five lumbar segments (L1 to L5), the thorax, six cervical segments (C2 to C7), and the head. Additionally, the model: (1) is flexible regarding the kinematic nature of the spinal joints (free, constrained, or fixed); (2) incorporates all geometric and mass-inertia parameters from a single, high-resolution source; and (3) can be feasibly implemented via different inverse dynamics formulations. To demonstrate its practicality, the model was finally employed to estimate the lumbar and cervical joint torques during perturbed sitting using experimental motion data. Considering the growing importance of mathematical predictions, the developed model should become an important resource for researchers in different fields.

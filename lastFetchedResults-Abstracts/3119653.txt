The temperature control problem has become an important concern in heating furnace production. In this paper, an expert fuzzy control strategy is put forward in order to realize the optimum of the temperature in the billet heating furnace, which imports the expert system to the fuzzy control. At the same time, the structure of the expert system and fuzzy controller are introduced. The production rule is adopted by using if-then to express knowledge and a forward reasoning method is used to control rules from forward to backward. The objective is to provide computer-based support for industries specialists or workers. When actual furnace temperature deviates at a certain range by using fuzzy control, while a big deviation uses expert control. It is indicated that the static error is small and the control precision is high. The application results show that the control scheme is feasible and effective.

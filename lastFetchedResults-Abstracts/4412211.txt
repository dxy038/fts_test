This paper concentrates on the problem of designing a powerful multi-agent negotiation model for E-commerce platform. In the multi-agent negotiation model, negotiations mean interactions between multiple agents with several different targets. The multi-agent negotiation model can be represented by seven elements, and the key component of a negotiation agent contains private data, knowledge base and rule base. Furthermore, the information are communicated between the negotiation case database and users through the negotiation agent. After supplier and customer login in the E-commerce multi-agent negotiation system, each supplier or customer is allocated an agent. Particularly, the main task of the multi-agent negotiation model for E-commerce platform is to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. Finally, experiments are conducted to make performance evaluation based on a specific case. Based on the experimental results, conclusions can be drawn that the negotiation ability and flexibility of the buyer and seller agent can be promoted by our proposed algorithm.

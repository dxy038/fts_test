Abstract-The objective of this paper is to assess the sub-aperture analysis technique for the detection of coherent scatterers (CSs) using polarimetric SAR data. The non normalized coherence is used to greatly improve the contrast between the clutter and the target, since it can preserve the strong intensity information of the target. Furthermore, by applying a way similar to the polarimetric interferometry coherence optimization, the optimal coherence can be achieved by tuning the polarization states using the full polarimetric SAR data. Finally, utilizing the ALOS PALSAR data, the preliminary results and analyses of the detection of CSs are demonstrated.

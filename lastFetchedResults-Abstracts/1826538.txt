Optimal placement of distributed generation (DG) has significant effects on reliability and loss of the distribution network. This paper presents an objective function for optimal DG allocation and sizing in distribution systems in order to reduce power loss of the system and increase reliability improvement at the lowest cost. The optimization technique is based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). Also, distribution system reconfiguration and load shedding is implemented for reliability improvement. Time varying load is applied in this optimization to achieve practical results. For this purpose, a load duration curve including four load levels with different weighting factor is considered. Besides, all of the study and their requirement are based on cost form. Finally, to evaluate the proposed algorithm, the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus test systems are employed and simulation results are reported to verify the proposed approach.

Although numerous methods have attempted to resolve the internet connectivity problem associated with rural and otherwise isolated locations, most have failed to provide a complete solution for the vast array of external constraints that make such situations difficult to resolve. Satellite technology solutions have attempted to approach this problem with moderate levels of success. Limitations such as inadequate satellite footprints, proprietary sender and receiver protocols, and the fact that the use of IP had not been specifically addressed as the main transmission vehicle for packets of data, only highlighted the flaws of such systems. Internet Protocol over Satellite (IPoS) as developed by Hughes Network Systems&#194;&#174;, is a proprietary technology that was later ratified as a Telecommunications Industry Association open standard, which has the objective of providing a true next hop solution for the movement IP datagrams. It attempts to serve as an additional link for the overall Internet framework. The following document attempts to provide a brief introduction to IPoS, how it works, and overview the current business applications for this technology. There is extensive emphasis on how IPoS distinguishes itself from other existing solutions for rural and geographically isolated connectivity problems. A brief mention of threats to IPoSÂ´s business growth is also made.

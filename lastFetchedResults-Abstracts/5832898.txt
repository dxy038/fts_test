This paper presents the solution of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with different objective functions i. e. fuel cost minimization and active power loss minimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The basic OPF solution is obtained with fuel cost minimization as the objective function and the optimal settings of the power system are determined. For reactive power optimization, active power loss has been taken as the objective function. OPF solution with Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) device is carried out considering fuel cost minimization and active power loss minimization as objective. TCSC is used to relieve the overloading of the lines under heavy loading conditions. The results obtained using IEEE 75-bus Indian system is presented.

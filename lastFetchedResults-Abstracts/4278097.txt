The availability of high-level design entry tooling is crucial for the viability of any reconfigurable SoC architecture. This paper presents a template generation method to extract functional equivalent structures, i.e. templates, from a control data flow graph. By inspecting the graph the algorithm generates all the possible templates and the corresponding matches. Using unique serial numbers and circle numbers the algorithm can find all distinct templates with multiple outputs. The template selection algorithm shows how this information can be used in compilers for reconfigurable systems. The objective of the template selection algorithm is to find an efficient cover for an application graph with a minimal number of distinct templates and minimal number of matches.

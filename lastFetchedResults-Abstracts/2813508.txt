Researchers in environmental areas (biology, geographical information, etc.) need to capitalize, communicate and validate their experiments. In this context, the scientific workflow is increasingly used, since it facilitates the resource reusability and makes the daily work of the experts more efficient. This article, after a short introduction, has the objective of introducing our global vision of a scientific workflow system. By considering the user point of view and the analysis of existing work, we propose to realize the system based on a 3-level architecture (statistical level/intermediate level/dynamic level). We will focus on two essential points: (1) building a resource management environment (&#8220;work desktop&#8221;) and (2) using this environment to instantiate, validate and correct different workflow models. Finally, we conclude the article and present some perspectives.

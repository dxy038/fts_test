The Response surface methodology provides a way to engineering optimization problems of the turbomachinery. Using a prototypical Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) problem, turbomachinery aerodynamic optimization can improve the efficiency and performance. This study explores the approximation of the turbomachinery objective function which has a significant impact on the accuracy and effectiveness of the resulting ANN model. Application of straightforward simulation computation time improved the generalization capability of the ANN model, avoiding the potential problems of over-training or memorization meanwhile.

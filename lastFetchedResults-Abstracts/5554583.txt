The diversity of mobile devices and their limitations have raised many challenges for the actual deployment of mobile learning across institutions. The main objective of this work is to present a solution that encourages institutions to adopt mobile learning as a tool to support the learning process. We present a generic framework for interoperability with existing VLEs that provides a compact and an easy to use implementation of their learning activities on Java enabled mobile devices. In this paper, we discuss the design and the prototype of the proposed interoperability framework. The results and the feedback of the prototype evaluation with tutors are reported. The reported results and comments cover the systemÂ´s usability and its value for both tutors and students

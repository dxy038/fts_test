Parameter optimisation in the search function of phased array radar is surveyed. The boundary between the search and tracking functions is taken to be the establishment of a confirmed detection. One must distinguish between the optimum choice of parameters in the design process, where the objective is to achieve a specified track formation (confirmed detection) range against a given approaching target and the optimum (adaptive) choice of parameter values in a rapidly changing operational situation. This dynamic situation could relate to clutter, jamming, tracking load (including false alarm dismissal) and information on the target situation from other sensors (cues). To a large extent the understanding generated by parameter optimisation in the design process provides a sound basis for adaptive radar management in the operational situation

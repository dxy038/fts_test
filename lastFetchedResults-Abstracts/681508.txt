The objective of this research was to develop a statistical model to predict one day in advance both the maximum and 8 h (10 am–5 pm) average ozone for Houston (TX). A loess/generalized additive model (GAM) approach was taken to model development. Ozone data (1983–1991) from ten stations in the immediate Houston area were used in the study. The meteorological data came from the Houston International Airport. The models were developed using data for April through October for 1983–1987 and 1989–1990. Forecasts were developed for 1988 and 1991. The final model, which was multiplicative in nature, contained three interaction terms for the west/east and south/north wind components (average of hourly values from 8 pm to 5 am, 6 am to 9 am, and 10 am to 5 pm). Opaque cloud cover (averaged over the period 10  am to 5 pm), yesterday’s maximum ozone, today’s maximum temperature and morning mixing depth were also important variables in the model.
Individual forecasts were generated for all ten stations in the Houston area using observed meteorology. In addition forecasts were produced for three measures of the network as a whole. The root-mean-square prediction error for the 8 h average forecasts ranged from 13.2 to 16.3 ppb (with R2 ranging from 0.66 to 0.73) for the individual stations and from 18.5 to 22.0 ppb (with R2 ranging from 0.61 to 0.68) for maximum ozone. A detailed examination was undertaken for a day on which the forecast was much too low.

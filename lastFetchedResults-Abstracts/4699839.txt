This research investigates and develops distortion measures for assessment of wavelet compression effects on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The end objective is to select those measures that relate most directly to automatic target recognition (ATR) performance. Windowed measures were developed that relate to ATR feature size. These were the most sensitive to distortion, and they provide an effective method for assessing tradeoff between compression and distortion

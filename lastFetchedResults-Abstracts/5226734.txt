Installing subsection switches on distribution network feeders is an effective measure to improve system reliability. In this paper, based on value engineering, a new method is presented to determine optimal subsection scheme. By application of value engineering theory, a new objective function is constructed. The new objective function, based on cost-benefit analysis, is constructed by reference to theory of value, function and cost in value engineering. The new objective function could more clearly reflect the value relationship between improved reliability and increased input costs. This proposed method not only broadens the applicable scope of value engineering, but also makes better combination of reliability and economy. Finally, the proposed method has been tested on the IEEE RBTS-2 bus system. Test results indicate that solution solved by the improved function is more superior to that of the original objective function, which has proved effectiveness and scientific of this new method.

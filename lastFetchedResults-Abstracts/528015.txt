 In this paper we address the problem related to determination of the most suitable candidates for an M&A (Merger & Acquisition) scenario of Banks/Financial Institutions. During the pre-merger period of an M&A, a number of candidates may be available to undergo the Merger/Acquisition, but all of them may not be suitable. The normal practice is to carry out a due diligence exercise to identify the candidates that should lead to optimum increase in shareholder value and customer satisfaction, post-merger. The due diligence ought to be able to determine those candidates that are unsuitable for merger, those candidates that are rela-tively suitable, and those that are most suitable. Towards achieving the above objective, we propose a Fuzzy Data Mining Framework wherein Fuzzy Cluster Analysis concept is used for advisability of merger of two banks and other Financial Institutions.  Subsequently, we propose orchestration/composition of business processes of two banks into consolidated business process during Merger & Acquisition (M&A) scenario. Our paper discusses modeling of individual business process with UML, and the consolidation of the individual business process models by means of our proposed Knowledge Based approach.

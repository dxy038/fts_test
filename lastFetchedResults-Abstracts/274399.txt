The objective of this work is to determine the relaxation spectrum of spherical particles reinforced viscoelastic and
isotropic composites from 3D Finite Elements (FE) simulations of the microstructure. The matrix and the reinforcements
are assumed to be incompressible and Maxwellian. The spectra obtained from the FE simulations are compared with those
obtained from analytical homogenization models. This paper presents the procedure used for generating the FE models as
well as the procedure used for obtaining relaxation spectra meeting the thermodynamics requirements imposed on linear
viscoelastic materials. It seems that the relaxation spectrum for the microstructure studied in this paper is composed of a
negligible continuous part and a discrete part of higher intensity. In any case, the resulting material does not have a Maxwellian
behavior.

High demand for reactive power is known as one major characteristic of large wind farms. If the power network is not able to satisfy the wind farm reactive power requirement, the integration of the wind farm power into the large power system would be limited and the overall energy losses in the distribution networks would be increased, even some voltage problems would also be caused. Tabu search algorithm and sensitivity analysis are applied to optimize the reactive power compensation for wind farms in the paper. Some component models in the wind farm are discussed. An objective function composed of power losses, capacitor installation costs, bus voltage and wind turbines output constraints is proposed. The reactive power optimization scheme is also presented. And the optimization method is tested in a MATLAB based simulation model. Results show that the proposed reactive power optimization method is simple and effective, and it can correct voltage deviation and reduce power loss.

The main objective of this paper is to describe and simulate an adaptive interference cancelling technique named amplitude domain processing (ADP). The ADP filter will improve the GPS receiverÂ´s robustness against all types of interference (coherent CW pulsed or continuous, chirp interference, etc). The ADP filter is designed in Matlab (Simulink) to show its performance and how it can be applied as an adaptive interference canceller to estimate and remove GPS jammers in a real time basis

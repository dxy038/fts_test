The objective of this paper is to investigate novel configurations of planar multiport radio-frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) C-type and R-type switches and redundancy switch matrices for satellite communications. An in-house monolithic fabrication process dedicated to electrostatic multiport RF MEMS switches and switch matrices is developed and fine tuned. The proposed C-type switch is a four-port device with two operational states. This switch exhibits an insertion loss of less than 0.3 dB and isolation of about 25 dB at satellite C-band frequency range. The novel R-type switch is also a four-port device with an additional operational state. The measured results show an insertion loss of better than 0.4 dB and an isolation of better than 25 dB at C-band. This is the first time that an R-type RF MEMS switch is ever reported. Several of these switches are integrated in the form of redundancy switch matrices, and two novel monolithic five to seven redundancy switch matrices are developed, fabricated, and tested. It is shown that the additional operating state of the R-type switch not only decreases the number of elements by 50% but also reduces the size drastically

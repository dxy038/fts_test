Background: The main objective of this study is the Predictive role of personality traits with mediation of affective control in conjunction with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (ABS) among the students of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences (2013-2014)
Materials and Methods: This research is co relational studies with sample size of 384 (252 females and 132 males) who were selected by stratified random sampling method among the students of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences. In this study, NEO questionnaire by McCrae and Costa (1989), affective control scale by Williams Chambless (1997) and IBS scale by researchers (1992) was used. For analyzing the data, structural equation modeling with AMOS statistical software program were applied.   
Results: The study results showed that extroversion variables (p > 0.015), agreeableness (P > 0.0001), Neurotic (P > 0.0001) has significant effect on affective control, and variable of affective control (P > 0.01) has significant effect on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). In this research it is found that extraversion 
(-0.14), agreeableness (-0.07), and Neurotic (0.13) has indirectly significant effect on IBS, while among five personality traits only Neurotic (0.12) has significant effect on IBS.
Conclusion: Based on the obtained results of this study it can be expressed that among the personality traits only Neurotic has significant effect on IBS either with the mediation of personality traits or without mediation of this variable. Also personality traits of extroversion and agreeableness were able to affect the IBS patients with the mediation of affective control (indirectly).In contrast other personality traits under this study had no effect on Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

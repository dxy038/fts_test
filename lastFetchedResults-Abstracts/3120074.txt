Pole placement approach of controller design is capable of providing system stability, setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection. The proposed work focuses on design of a digital controller using pole placement method for magnetic suspension ball system which is an open loop unstable system. The digital controller design is a 2-DOF controller using the transfer function approach for given constraints in terms of peak overshoot and rise time. The objective is to determine a controller which satisfies the specialized constraints. This paper introduces design process for a digital controller using pole placement method for a magnetic suspension system.

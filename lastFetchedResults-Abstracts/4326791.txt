The precise instruments such as integrated circuit and semiconductor are easily contaminated. The contaminants that are attached to the instrument such as oil, metals and organic are usually cleaned by chemical liquid reagents. However, they cause water secondary pollution and need a lot of cost. Now objective of the study is that clean the contaminants by hydroxyl radical. But the hydroxyl radical is conventionally produced by the reaction of dissolved ozone. Hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet light is used for decomposition of the dissolved ozone. However, the radical production efficiency of the conventional method is not high. For this reason, a high-efficiency hydroxyl radical production technique is desired. In response to this need, new technology of the hydroxyl radical which be generated by `ozone-water, ultraviolet, MHz ultrasonic and TiO<sub>2</sub>Â´ was developed.

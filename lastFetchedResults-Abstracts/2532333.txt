Among the victims, Janbazan as objective and perdurable symbols of devotion and martyrdom discourse, have a significant position. Janbazan are faced with a diversity of problems and issues including "the Janbaz identity concern" and the challenges related to it.Â 
The question of this article is that how they think about their Janbaz position and identity and its changes in comparison with the past. To evaluate and analyze this issue, using the qualitative methodology and interview technique, we gathered and compared the detailed comments of 32 Janbaz in Tehran.
The findings demonstrate that in their view, Janbaz literature has changed and in many cases, its sanctimony and dignity reduced to a set of compliments and media and propaganda discourse. In the society, new behavior patterns and ways of interpretations have developed which are incongruent with the devotion culture and its discourse. According to the results, nowadays the transformations in Janbaz and devotion value discourse led to a material and subsistence approach to the extent that this economical approach toward Janbazan overcomes the cultural attitude. This transformation has been added to their own and their families cultural concerns and social separation, especially their spouses and children.

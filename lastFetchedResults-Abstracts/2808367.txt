In order to solve the problem in parameter optimization of control strategy for Engine of Hybrid Tracked Bulldozer, a new method is put forward based on a multidisciplinary design optimization. Based on the optimization design, the power train system model of the bulldozer for the Engine control strategy parameter optimization that took the minimum fuel consumption as objective function was established. The optimization took parameters of the engine control strategy as design variables and took the working area of the engine speed and power as the constraints. Then, the optimization problem is solved by means of adaptive genetic algorithm. Through optimization, the fuel consumption reduces 3.6% further more under a certain operating mode.

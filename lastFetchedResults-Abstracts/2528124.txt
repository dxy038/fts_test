Inroduction and Objective: The extensive use of medicinal herbs such as anchusa italica theory and indiscriminate use of them and chemical compounds Especially to determine the effectiveness of the various aromatics plant reproductive process and the relevant parameters in this study were taken decision. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of Anchusa italica on estrogen and progesterone concentrations and placental parameters in female miceMaterial and Methods:In this study, after mating and observation of vaginal plug, 30 Wistar female mice were randomly divided into five groups including one group receiving physiological saline intraperitoneally, and four treatment groups receiving aqueous extract of Anchusa italica at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg/kg for five days after the 7th day of pregnancy. Cesarean operation was performed on 16th day of pregnancy. The blood was taken from miceâ€™s heart to measure the concentrations of the estrogen and progesterone hormones alsoFetalplacental parameters Was evaluatedand the results were analyzed using SPSS software.Results: The results show that Anchusa italica extract was effective on progesterone concentration, since the correlation coefficient is less than 0.05. while was not effective on estrogen concentration since the correlation coefficient is higher than 0.05. Also Injecting extract affected on placental weight, Placental size and The number of placental Has been effective because the correlation coefficient less than 0.05.Conclusion:According to the study of aqueous extract of borage on reproductive parameters such factors and reproductive organs also affect the fetus feeder.

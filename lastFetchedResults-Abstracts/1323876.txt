By positional cloning, we identified two breakpoint-spanning genes in a familial clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC)-associated t(1;3)(q32.1;q13.3): LSAMP and NORE1 (RASSF1 homolog). Both genes are downregulated in 9 of 9 RCC cell lines. While the NORE1A promoter predominantly presents partial methylation in 6 of the cell lines and 17/53 (32%) primary tumors, the LSAMP promoter is completely methylated in 5 of 9 cell lines and in 14/53 (26%) sporadic and 4 familial CCRCCs. Expression of LSAMP and NORE1A proteins in CCRCC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation. These characteristics indicate that LSAMP and NORE1A may represent new candidate tumor suppressors for CCRCC.

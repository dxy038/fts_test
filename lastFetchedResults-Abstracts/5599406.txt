This work presents a novel isolated full-bridge DC/DC converter with bidirectional communication capability. The transformer in the proposed converter is utilized as an isolation interface for transferring energy and data. Power delivery and forward data transfer are conducted simultaneously by modifying the full-bridge switching phase. Backward data transfer is realized by manipulating the amplitude of the resonant signal through modulating the impedance of the resonant tank at the secondary side of the transformer. Finally, the operation principle of the proposed converter was verified on a 280 mW prototype operating at 400 kHz from a 12 V DC input.

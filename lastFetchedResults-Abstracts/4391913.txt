This paper represents the study of the multimode permanent magnet synchronous machine constructed for a small-sized unmanned aircraft. An overview of commonly used electrical machine types for unmanned aircrafts is also given within this paper. The main objective of the research was to create an electrical machine that could be used in addition to the combustion engine as a motor-generator. Based on the specifics of the area and the goal of the research the most suitable and optimal solution of the machine topology is considered. The paper gives an overview of the design of the permanent magnet electrical machine and its mechanical and electrical parameters. The test bench for experimental study of the prototype permanent magnet machine was also designed and built. Using the test bench the no-load test was carried out and corresponding characteristics were charted in a generator mode of the machine.

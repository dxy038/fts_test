An important issue for video transmission over IP networks is preservation of perceived video quality despite packet loss. Packet loss can be detrimental to compressed video. However, reducing packet loss to a very low level is difficult with current loss control techniques. Furthermore, even a very low objective loss probability can still seriously distort perceived video quality. This paper presents two buffer management schemes using video characteristics. They increase maximum loss tolerance for a desired level of video quality, providing better quality at equal loss ratios, when compared to a conventional buffer management scheme. Meanwhile, service fairness and network efficiency are also improved.

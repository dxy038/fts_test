This paper deals with the control of a class of perfectly modelled linear hybrid systems which consist of two, in general coupled, subsystems one being continuous -time while the second one is digital. Both subsystems are driven by continuous time and sampled values of a control input. The description of the overall system is given through an extended hybrid system , which is purely discrete at sampling instants, which has two , in general, coupled continuous-time and discrete - time substates. The discrete -time substate is jointly defined by the digital substate and the samples of the continuous substate while being driven by the sampled input. The control objective has a double nature and it consists of the achievement of separate continuous-time and discrete-time model- matching objectives with respect to two predefined stable reference models . It is achieved by synthesizing a dynamic hybrid controller consisting of a continuous subcontroller and a discrete one. Each of those controllers has its own control objective.

Engineering design problems are generally multi-objective, in that they require several, generally conflicting, requirements to be met. One approach to solving a multi-objective design problem is to formulate the problem as a set of algebraic inequalities, which must be satisfied for a successful design. Two algorithms based on simulated annealing which can be used to solve a set of inequalities are proposed. The algorithms are tested on several control system design problems.

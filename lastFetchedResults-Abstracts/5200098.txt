This paper describes the design and the simulation of a robust adaptive discrete variable structure control (AVSC) scheme for a high performance DC motor. The objective of the proposed controller is to control the motor speed and/or position to follow the desired value at all times. Unlike the conventional variable structure control (VSC) scheme, the parameters of the controller are calculated and updated every sampling interval based on the identified parameters of the system model. The proposed controller is robust to parametersÂ´ variation and external disturbances. In addition, the chattering in the control input and in the motor current are minimized. Simulation results reported showing the advantages of the proposed control technique compared to the conventional VSC scheme

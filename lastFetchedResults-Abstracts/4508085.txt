The objective of this study is to map Cyanobacteria Bloom in brackish Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi using satellite data such as MODIS. The 10 satellite sensor data such as QuickBird, ALOS AVNIR-2, and MODIS from November to December, 2010 were collected in these lakes. Cyanobacteria bloom was distinguished by viewing from satellite data. Furthermore, it was judged quantitatively by Rayleigh corrected reflectance of 500 m spatial resolution MODIS. As a result, Green Color Index (G/[R+G+B]) was found to be suitable for mapping of Cyanobacteria Bloom.

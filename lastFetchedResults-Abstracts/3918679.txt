In this paper, we propose a low-complexity iterative joint channel estimation, detection and decoding technique for doubly selective channels. The key to the proposed technique is a segment-by-segment processing strategy under the assumption that the channel is approximately static within a short segment of a data block. Through a virtual zero-padding technique, the proposed segment-by-segment equalization approach inherits the low-complexity advantage of the conventional frequency domain equalization (FDE), but does not need the assistance of guard interval (for cyclic-prefixing or zero-padding), thereby avoiding the spectral and power overheads. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity bidirectional channel estimator, where the Gaussian message passing (GMP) technique is used to exploit the channel correlation information, and the intermediate channel estimation results in the iterative process are employed to perform inter-tap interference cancellation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection and channel estimation algorithms.

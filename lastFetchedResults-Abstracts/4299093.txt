Objective: to elucidate the application and biosafety of nanomaterials in sports engineering. Methods: literature and experts interview. Results: nanomaterials have widely been applied in sports engineering, such as sports stadium and gymnasium, sports turf, running track, sports clothing, sports equipment and nutrition supplement. Inevitably, nanomaterials may cause some potential adverse effects on the cell, lung, liver, kidney, and brain, respectively. Conclusion: nanmaterials have been fully used in sports fields, and its biosafety should also be focused.

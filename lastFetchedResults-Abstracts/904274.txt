Runnelling, a method of habitat modification used for mosquito management in intertidal saltmarshes in Australia, alters marsh
hydrology. The objective of this research was to assess if runnelling had affected the distribution of the grey mangrove (Avicennia
marina (Forsk.)) at a study site in southeast Queensland. Since runnelling is carried out in diverse marshes a second aim was to assess
differences in mangrove colonisation in the two main saltmarsh species in the area. These are marine couch [Sporobolus virginicus
(L.) Kunth.] and samphire [Sarcocornia quinqueflora (Bunge ex Ung.-Stern.)]. Runnels at the study site were in an area dominated by
Sporobolus. The mangrove area was measured by classifying digital color infrared (CIR) data obtained from aerial photographs
acquired in 1982, which was 3 years before runnelling, and in 1987, 1991 and 1999, 2e14 years after. Changes in the spatial extent of
A. marina were identified using difference images produced from post-classification change detection. The results showed that
runnels did not significantly influence the distribution of A. marina at the study site. At a more detailed level differences in A. marina
establishment in the Sporobolus and Sarcocornia areas were determined from counts of trees on the aerial photographs. There was
a greater proportion of mangroves in Sarcocornia than Sporobolus and this increased over time. This may be related to differences in
density between the plant species, to grapsid crab activity or to other edaphic conditions. There may be implications for runnelling in
Sarcocornia marshes. The large increase observed in A. marina in the area generally is likely to be related to factors such as
catchment modification or tidal/sea-level changes. It is concluded that runnelling has not led to mangrove establishment in the
Sporobolus dominated saltmarsh.

An algorithm for optimal allocation of reactive power in AC/DC system using FACTs devices, with an objective of improving the voltage profile and also voltage stability of the system has been presented. The technique attempts to utilize fully the reactive power sources in the system to improve the voltage stability and profile as well as meeting the reactive power requirements at the AC-DC terminals to facilitate the smooth operation of DC links. The method involves successive solution of steady-state power flows and optimization of reactive power control variables with unified power flow controller (UPFC) using linear programming technique. The proposed method has been tested on a real life equivalent 96-bus AC and a two terminal DC system under normal and contingency conditions.

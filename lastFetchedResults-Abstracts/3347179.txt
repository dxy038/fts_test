The objective of this paper is to illustrate how Maxwell came to his mathematical constructs of the work done before him by Oersted, Ampe&#768;re, Faraday, Gauss and so on, into a concise and precise mathematical form. In addition, the presentation will address two specific topics which are fundamental in engineering electromagnetic education: how did Maxwell reached the conclusion light was electromagnetic in nature and thereby revolutionizing the last century physics and the concept of displacement current.

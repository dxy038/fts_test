Poultry Meat is one of the major sources of human food. The cholesterol level
in poultry productions could be monitoredby feeding different medicinal plants. The
medicinal plants have hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties.
Objective: The aim of this study was comparison hypolipidemic effect, hematocrit
percentage and hemoglobin concentration in broilers given three commercial herbal extracts
and virginiamycin.
Methods: A total four hundred and eighty 1-d-old male broiler chicks were assigned to the
basal diet (control) and 0.15% (V/V) virginiamycin, 0.1% (V/V) extracts of thyme (Thymus
vulgaris), coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), garlic (Allium sativum) and blend of extracts with
the same dose were added to water. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, triglycerides
(TG), HDL cholesterol, hematocrit percentage and hemoglobin concentration were measured
after 42 day.
Results: Garlic (Allium sativum) significantly reduced the levels of TC, LDL, and TG and
significantly increased the level of HDL. Thyme (Thymus vulgarisimproved hematocrit
percentage and hemoglubin concentration, but not significantly.
Conclusion: Herbal extracts could improve blood factors in comparison with the control
and antibiotic fed birds.

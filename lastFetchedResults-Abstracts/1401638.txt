Vickers and Knoop hardness measurements performed on various ceramics (hard metals) and light alloy materials (soft metals) are compared. The results show that the Knoop hardness number is, in general, lower than the Vickers hardness number for the highest values of hardness, and this behaviour is reversed when the hardness values are low. This change in values, which occur at 8 GPa, has no real physical meaning and, therefore, it is difficult to interpret such behaviour in terms of the elasto-plastic deformation around the indent such as sinking-in, piling-up, and bulging of the indent faces, phenomena which take place during indentation or after the withdrawal of the indenter.

to interpreting the hardness difference, it is very important to consider the same area in the hardness calculations. That is why we have compared the available hardness data obtained from the literature and recalculated them by considering the projected and true areas of the contact. If the objective is to compare the two hardness numbers, it seems more suitable to consider the true area of contact, procedure which will provide a Vickers hardness number higher than the Knoop hardness number all over the range of the hardness values.

The use of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products modified with the cross-linking reagent dimethyloldihydroxyethylene urea (DMDHEU) and the quaternary amine, choline chloride, as anion exchange resins, has not been reported. The objective of the present study was to convert the readily available by-products, soybean hulls, sugarcane bagasse and corn stover to functional anion exchange resins using DMDHEU and choline chloride. Optimization of the modification method was achieved using soybean hulls as a substrate. The optimized method was additionally used to modify sugarcane bagasse and corn stover. Adsorption efficiency results with chromate ion showed that modification with both DMDHEU and choline chloride was required for the highest efficiencies. Adsorption capacities of the modified by-products were determined using chromate ion and found to be 1.97, 1.61 and 1.12 mmol/g for sugarcane bagasse, corn stover and soybean hulls, respectively. Competitive adsorption studies were conducted at 10 and 50 times US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) limits for arsenic, chromium and selenium in a simulated wastewater at pH 7. The results showed preferential adsorption of chromate ion over arsenate or selenate ion. Estimated product costs for the three resins ranged from $0.88/kg to $0.99/kg, which was considerably lower than the market costs for the two commercial anion exchange resins QA-52 and IRA-400 also used in this study. DMDHEU/choline chloride modification of the three by-products produced an anion exchange resin with a high capacity to adsorb chromate ion singly or competitively in the presence of other anions from aqueous solutions.

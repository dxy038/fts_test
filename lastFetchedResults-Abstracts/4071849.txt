This paper presents a new design method for improving the torque performance of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) for high speed applications. The drawback of the conventional design method based on the overall static average torque maximization is that the torque control performance is degraded at high speed. On the other hand, the proposed method optimizes the torque profile by dividing it into several regions so that it is suitable for high speed operation. This multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using a fuzzy optimization algorithm which incorporates a finite element method. The torque performance of the motor for various speed ranges is investigated and the optimally designed motor shows a better performance at high speed

Background and Objective: Based on both laboratory animal and human society studies, inequality in food intake and social instability has adverse effects on individuals and community health. However, it is not known whether social instability, food deprivation and food inequality affect neuronal death and premature aging in young animals. To address this question, the effect of food deprivation, food intake inequality with or without unstable social status was evaluated and histopathological changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells and aging process were investigated. 

Materials and Methods: Forty eight Newzealand white male rabbits were divided into six groups and different social situations were applied to some groups during eight weeks. After the end of the period of the experiment, lipofuscin accumulation and apoptosis as main markers of aging were studied by long Ziehl Nelseen staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in the hippocampal pyramidal cells, respectively. Serum cortisol level was also measured. 

Results: The simultaneous application of the mentioned situations (i.e. food deprivation, social inequality and instability) caused a significant change in lipofuscin accumulation in the hippocampal pyramidal cells in comparison with the control group (p < 0.005). The results also showed a significant increase in ratio of apoptotic to normal cells in all of the stressed groups compared with control (p < 0.05). 

Conclusion: These findings suggest that food deprivation, inequality in food intake and social instability can enhance the apoptosis rate of hippocampal pyramidal cells through increasing lipofuscin accumulation.

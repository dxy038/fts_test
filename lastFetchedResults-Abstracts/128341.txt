The main objective of this study was to formulate a liposome preparation loaded with recombinant major surface metalloproteinase glycoprotein of Leishmania (rGP63) to selectively induce cell mediated immunity (CMI) in susceptible BALB/c mice and protect the mice against challenge with virulent L. Major. rGP63 was incorporated into liposomes composed of lecithin and cholesterol, 1:1 molar ratio by solvent evaporation (Multilamellar vesicles, MLV-rGP63), reverse phase evaporation (Large unilamellar vesicles, LUV-rGP63) and detergent solubilization (Small unilamellar vesicles, SUV-rGP63) procedures. Liposome preparations containing rGP63 (2 lag), rGP63 (2 Âµg) by itself, PBS (Phosphate buffer saline), and a control liposome (rGP63-free liposomes) were injected subcutaneously (SC) three times in groups of 10 female BALB/e mice with three week intervals. Three weeks later the mice were tested for delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) by injecting 2 (Mio)g of rGP63 SC to the left footpads; and for comparison the right footpads were injected with PBS. After 24, 48 and 72 hours the footpad thickness was measured on both foot pads. One week after the DTH test, the mice were challenged with virulent L. major promastigotes (1 x 10^6 / 50 (Mio)L) SC to the left footpads and the footpad thickness was measured for 10 weeks. The results of DTH test indicated that among different groups, the SUV-rGP63 had the greatest positive DTH response compared to the control groups (p < 0.01). The DTH response of LUV-rGP63 and rGP63 groups were also positive (p<0.05); however, the response of MLV-rGP63 was Iess than the other groups and it was significant (p<0.05) only at 24 and 48 hours compared to control groups. In the challenge test, the SUV-rGP63 liposomes had a complete protective effect (p < 0.001), the LUV-rGP63 and MLV-rGP63 had a little protective effect that was not statistically significant, and rGP63 by itself showed only partial protection. These results indicate that liposomes prepared by detergent solubilization procedure (SUV-rGP63) could be a suitable immunoadjuvant for rGP63 to induce selective CMI in susceptible BALB/c mice and protect the mice against cutaneous leishmaniasis.

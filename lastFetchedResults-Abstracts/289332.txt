Objective
We sought to determine the influence of provider sex on neurologists’ annual incomes after controlling for work effort, provider characteristics, and practice characteristics.
Methods
We used survey responses collected throughout the 1990s from 216 actively practicing neurologists and linear regression modeling to determine the independent influence of provider sex on neurologists’ annual incomes.
Results
White female neurologists reported seeing 11% fewer visits and working 6% fewer annual hours than their white male counterparts. White female neurologists had practiced medicine for fewer years than white males (p = 0.01). In addition, females were less likely to be employees, as opposed to having an ownership interest in the practice, and were more likely to be board certified, though not statistically significantly so. After adjustment for work effort, provider characteristics, and practice characteristics, white female neurologists’ mean annual income was $165,321, or $47,854 (22%) lower than that for white males (95% CI: $82,710 lower to $12,997 lower, p = 0.007).
Conclusion
During the 1990s, female sex was associated with lower annual incomes among neurologists. Just as policymakers are exploring sex differences in access to and outcomes health care, they should further explore these findings to ensure that income differences among physicians who provide that care are not unjustly driven by provider sex.

The DEPARTS research project has developed a laboratory simulation model to develop and evaluate optimization models that can be used in future surface traffic management systems. Operational benefits of different modeling approaches can be evaluated over several days of simulated operation using desired performance metrics. Research also shows a significant benefit in improving the current accuracy of push-back time estimates. The objective of DEPARTS research is to develop computer algorithms that could be incorporated into future surface traffic management systems, and to build a research tool that can be used to simulate different surface traffic management operational concepts in the laboratory.

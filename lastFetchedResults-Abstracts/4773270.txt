This paper deals with the rapid growth in biomedical sensors, and power consumption of ZigBee module in different modes of operation. The wireless communications has enabled a new generation of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN): the body area networks. These networks are composed of tiny, cheap, and low-power biomedical nodes, mainly dedicated for healthcare monitoring applications. The objective of these applications is to ensure a continuous monitoring of vital parameters of plant operators in bio-power plants, while giving them the freedom of motion and thereby better quality of healthcare. The monitored signals are then transmitted to the control module through ZigBee.

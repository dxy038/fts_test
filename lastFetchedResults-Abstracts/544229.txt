The main objective of this paper is to discuss the possibility and nature of reliÂ¬gious science from the viewpoint of transcendental philosophy. Hence in the first place, the ontological principles of transcendental philosophy are reviewed to explain the nature of human being, religion and science in the light of these principles. In the next step, on the basis of these principles, the main problem, that is, the identity, possibility and materialization of religious science and then the issue of contradiction between science and religion are discussed. On the basis of primacy of existence and man's essential move in the curve of ascent, man and his knowledge on the one hand, and the world, Quran and the perfect man on the other, are all existential issues and are gradational. Hence cognition of science or religion is achieved when man through his perfection move ascends from material grade to be able to know the higher grades of existence, Quran and the perfect man.
The conclusion of the paper is that religious science is the result of the work of a person who, by means of Quran, traditions and the perfect man, become more acquainted with the system of divine names and attributes and through practicing 
his own knowledge, becomes divine and the vicegerent of God on the earth. Any science or technology produced by such a person is religious science or technology.

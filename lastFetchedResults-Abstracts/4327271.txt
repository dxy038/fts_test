The author reviews the principles and clinical applications of objective quantitative techniques for (1) defining auditory brainstem response (ABR) quality and threshold and (2) forming an average weighted toward sweeps having the best signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) using estimates of the background noise and Bayesian principles. It is concluded that the techniques are useful for exploring the complex relationship between perceptual and electrophysiological measures, maximizing the averaging efficiency, and developing truly objective quantitative procedures

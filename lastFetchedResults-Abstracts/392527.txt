Objective: Following the introduction of single-use-instruments (SUI) for tonsillectomy in January 2001 in UK, the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) received reports of significant increase in secondary haemorrhage in some centres. This was believed to be related to electrosurgical (diathermy) forceps. The aim of this study is to compare post tonsillectomy morbidity before (year 2000) and after (year 2001) the introduction of SUI in a unit where bipolar dissection is the most popular method of dissection. Method: The case notes of all tonsillectomy patients between 20 April and 31 October for the years 2000 (145 patients) and 2001 (166 patients) were reviewed. The patientsâ€™ age and sex, other concurrent operations, grade of surgeon, dissection and haemostasis methods, length of post operative hospital stay and the reason for prolonged stay (if more than one night) were noted. Readmitted cases were analysed to identify the cause and the management. Results: There was no case of reactionary haemorrhage in both the non SUI (year 2000) and the SUI (year 2001) groups. For the non SUI versus SUI group, 6.2 versus 4.8% stayed more than one night post operatively; 4.8 versus 5.4% were readmitted for secondary haemorrhage with 1.4 versus 2.4% return to theatre to control bleeding, respectively. The average hospital stay for the readmitted cases were 2.1 versus 1.6 days and the average time lapse between tonsillectomy and secondary haemorrhage were 6.7 versus 6 days respectively. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in post tonsillectomy morbidity following the introduction of SUI.

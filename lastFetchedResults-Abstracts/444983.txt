Introduction
The role of physician examiners in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is relatively passive. In our institution examiners criticized the passive nature of their role. This study evaluates the reliability and viability of adding a structured oral examination to an OSCE.
Method
Ten 24-minute stations consisted of three parts. Part 1:12 minutes—patient encounter. Part II: 6 minutes—oral presentation covering findings, differential diagnosis, and management plan. Part III: 6 minutes—structural oral examination (SOE), containing 5 predetermined questions.
Results
Over 6 consecutive days, 72 graduates were assessed. Overall average score: 72.02 (SD 5.05); reliability 0.84. Part I of the OSCE average score: 69.2 (SD 7.4); reliability 0.69. Part II oral presentation average score 64 (SD 5.8) reliability 0.87. SOE average score 77.7 (SD 6.3); reliability 0.64. Eighty-nine percent of the examiners indicated satisfaction with the new format.
Conclusions
The SOE was a reliable component of an OSCE and contributed to the overall reliability. Examiners reported a higher degree of satisfaction with the examination.

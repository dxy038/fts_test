This paper presents the self-tuning fuzzy controller (SFLC) for zero voltage switching power supply (ZVS). The main objective is to apply SFLC for output voltage controlling in case of load variation. The structure of SFLC consists of conventional fuzzy controller with scale factor self-tuning path which output performance is maintained by adjusting the scale of input membership function. Moreover, the practical ZVS design algorithm based on computer program is also proposed for more convenient to obtain the optimal ZVS parameter. Finally, the numerical calculation parameter and experimental results of ZVS both without SFLC and with SFLC in case of no load and on load are achieved respectively.

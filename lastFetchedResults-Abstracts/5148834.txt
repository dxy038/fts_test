Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most significant measures of performance of sigma-delta (&#931;-&#916;) modulators. In order to achieve desired performances, parameters in a sigma delta modulator model should be estimated and chosen carefully. The evaluation of these parameters needs an optimization procedure. This paper attempts to estimate sigma delta modulator models parameters by using a combined optimization algorithm implemented in MATLAB environment. The proposed algorithm has been proved in several domains and presents the advantage to be simple and easily implemented in MATLAB environment. When performed on sigma delta modulators models, objective SNR, for different models, was achieved.

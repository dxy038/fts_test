This paper describes development of a 32-bit embedded microcontroller board intended for a broad range of applications. In addition, three example applications are discussed. The first application is an embedded data logger installed on locomotives. This device has resources for recording analog and digital inputs, GPS position, GMT time, logging records to SDHC card and uploading periodically over a cellular network. The second application involves using the same board for a high density serial communications application for multiplexing 193 production machines in a manufacturing environment and supporting simultaneous bidirectional conversations with all machines. The paper will describe decisions regarding what resources were included in the device as well as how to provide flexibility in order to meet a diverse range of applications.

The objective of this article is to study the kinetics of charged particles in a glow discharge low pressure in DC mode, sustained by electrons and ions uniform production source. We deduced for the stationary state, the electrics characteristics distributions of the charged particles in a two-dimensional 2D plan-plan configuration. The numerical model presented in this work is based on the first two moment resolution of BoltzmannÂ´s equation. The characteristics of the glow discharge in argon (densities, field, and potential) according to source term value are presented in this paper. Different types of glow discharge (abnormal, normal, subnormal regime) can be observed that depends of technology application.

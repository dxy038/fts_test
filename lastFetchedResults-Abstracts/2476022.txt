In this paper, a new tuning method is proposed for the design of non-PID controllers for complex processes to achieve high performance. Compared with the existing PID tuning methods, the proposed non-PID controller design method can yield better performance for a wide range of complex processes. A suitable objective transfer function for the closed-loop system is chosen according to process characteristics. The corresponding ideal controller is derived. Model reduction is applied to fit the ideal controller into a much simpler and realizable form. Stability analysis is given and simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The run-time performance of a strategy (previously proposed by the authors, J. Shao et al., 1989) for processing recursive queries in deductive database system is studied. The algorithm, introduced informally by examples, is coded in occam2 and runs on a network of transputers. A wide range of recursive queries and database structures are used as benchmarks. Both the speedup factors achieved and the elapsed time spent by the strategy in answering recursive queries are analyzed. Experimental results show that it is possible to achieve significant performance improvements when queries are evaluated in parallel. These results provide insights into the success of this strategy in meeting the primary objective of focusing on relevant data

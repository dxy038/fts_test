The authors argue that one should keep things simple when controlling bidirectional pulsewidth modulation rectifiers by considering the utility grid as a virtual electric machine. The advantage is that the air-gap flux of this big machine can be directly measured in a straightforward way. Therefore, as shown in this paper, principles of field orientation can be applied to control the power flow, yielding high-dynamic performance

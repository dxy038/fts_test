A parametric study on adhesively bonded carbon composite-to-aluminum single-lap joints was experimentally conducted. FM73m, a high strength adhesive produced by Cytec, was used for bonding. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as bonding pressure, overlap length, adherend thickness, and material type, on the failure load and failure mode of joints with dissimilar materials. While metal bonded joints generally fail at the adhesive, the final failure mode of all the tested bonded joints with dissimilar materials was delamination of the composite adherend. Bonding strengths of the tested joints were lower than the metal-to-metal bonded joint strength. The specimens bonded under pressure of 4 and 6 atm yielded higher failure loads than under pressure of 3 atm, which is within the range of the manufacturer-recommended bonding pressure. Failure loads of the joint increased slightly at an overlap length larger than 30 mm. Increasing adherend thickness resulted in an increase of the failure load, but was not linearly proportional to the failure load.

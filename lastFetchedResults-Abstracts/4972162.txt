For most image fusion algorithms split relationship among pixels and treat them more or less independently, this paper proposes a region based multi-focus image fusion scheme using wavelet transform, morphological and genetic algorithm, which combines aspects of feature and pixel-level fusion. The basic idea is to select sharply focused regions from source images and to combine them together to reconstruct the resultant image in which all the regions are properly focused. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms Haar wavelet approach and morphological wavelet approach, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria, particularly when there is movement in the objects or mis-registration of the source images.

A data compression technique, Adaptive Differential PCM (ADPCM) with Time Assignment Speech Interpolation (TASI), that is capable of reducing the bit rate required for PCM encoded speech is described. The particular case of 2:1 compression in a T1 system environment is described in detail and evaluated using computer simulation. The ADPCM/TASI system has wide dynamic range, little degradation under loading, than standard PCM. Signal-to-noise ratios provide an objective metric. An audio tape containing computer processed speech for various ADPCM/TASI systems in various environments accompanies this presentation.

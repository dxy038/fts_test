Objective Our purpose was to assess the value of second harmonic imaging compared with fundamental imaging for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Patients and Methods  Sixty-four patients underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography with both fundamental imaging and second harmonic imaging. Coronary angiography was performed within 3 months. Ischemia was defined as new or worsening wall motion abnormalities in ≥1 segment during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Coronary artery disease was defined as a ≥70% luminal diameter stenosis in ≥1 coronary artery by coronary angiography. Results There was a higher prevalence of segments with invisible border with fundamental compared with second harmonic imaging both at rest (11% vs 8%, P < .05) and at peak stress (17% vs 10%, P  < .001). Significant coronary artery disease was present in 49 (77%) patients. The sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography for detection of coronary artery disease by fundamental and second harmonic imaging was, respectively, 78% and 94% (P  < .05), whereas specificity was similar (73% vs 73%). Second harmonic imaging had a particularly higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of 1-vessel disease (93% vs 50%, P < .05). Conclusion  The use of second harmonic imaging improves the sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease compared with fundamental imaging, particularly for 1-vessel coronary artery disease, whereas specificity remains unchanged.

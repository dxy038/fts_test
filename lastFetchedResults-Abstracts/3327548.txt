In this paper control of high index or even non-regular linear descriptor systems subject to multi-objective constraints is considered. Especially the problem of simultaneous H<sub>&#8734;</sub> and strict passivity constraints on different input/output channels of the system is addressed. Analysis and synthesis conditions for these constraints are given by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simultaneous validity of multiple constraints is then guaranteed by the requirement that the Lyapunov functions associated with these constraints coincide. This paper thus extends previous work by [14] to the important class of descriptor systems.

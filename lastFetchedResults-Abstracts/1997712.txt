The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sodium alginate obtained from brown seaweed as a prebiotic supplement to the feed of reared sea bream (Sparus aurata). Addition of the alginate to a control diet was investigated at both concentrations 2% and 5%.

ate composition in the flesh were not modified significantly by sodium alginate inclusion in the diet of the sea bream; however the fat and ash content in the specimens supplemented with 5% alginate were found to be significantly higher than those found in individuals who were fed the control diet. No significant differences in mineral content, fatty acid profiles, cholesterol content, texture parameters and sensory acceptability among the three studied groups. Results obtained in this study offer support for the use of alginate as a feed additive in sea bream diets since no significant effects were found in the flesh quality and characteristics of commercial size sea bream.

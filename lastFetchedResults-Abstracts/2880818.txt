A nose radome is a complex dielectric structure located at the front of the aircraft. Its main function is the protection of the weather radar antenna and automatic landing system antennas. Several metallic strips are installed on the radome and connected to the fuselage in order to drive the lightning current. The presence of this composite structure in the near field impacts the antenna behavior (loss of transmission, increase of side lobes). The objective of the paper is to present a numerical methodology used to predict the radome influence, this approach being compatible in terms of computing time with the industrial constraints of a design phase.

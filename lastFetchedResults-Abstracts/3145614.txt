A principle solution representation model based on design catalogue is proposed. Evaluation system of conceptual design is then built up. A method called Fuzzy Multi-objective Weighted Analytic Hierarchy Process (FMWAHP) is then proposed to realize the evaluation of principle solutions in mechanical products conceptual design. The evaluation of several mechanical transmission system solutions for service robot arm is given as an example, which demonstrates that the methodology is obviously useful for product innovation.

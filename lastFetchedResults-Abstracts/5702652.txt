Visual degradation and distortion may be introduced during the 3D mesh simplification. The critical issue in all mesh simplification methods is how to evaluate it. Some geometric metrics without the consideration of human visual perception and perceptual metrics based on subjective test have been proposed. It is urgent to develop an objective evaluation metric with the consideration of human visual perception. We used mesh saliency integrating with Just-Noticeable Difference(JND) methodology to define the salient information entropy based on the theory of information and presented a perceptual metric based on it for measuring the visual degradation and distortion introduced by 3D mesh simplification. Experimental results show that our perceptual metric can evaluate the visual degradation effectively and the essential of 3D mesh simplification is decreasing the visual redundancy and average visual uncertainty.

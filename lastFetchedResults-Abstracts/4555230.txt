The present paper addresses the issue of social capital dimensions considering its application for collaborative network governance. The objective of the project is to understand how collaborative networks can be influenced considering the perspective of social capital. Initially, we present the most important Brazilian Wine Cluster, where the present work will be implemented. We defend the importance of linking social capital in collaborative networks as an integrator concept. In this sense, a theoretical model to analyze the linking of the social capital approach in collaborative networks is presented. In this model, we defend four elements of analysis: identity building, power relations, evaluation process and network performance.

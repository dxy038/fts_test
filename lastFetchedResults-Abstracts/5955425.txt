This paper describes on the technology of systems integration that allows users to connect and use two or more software at the same time. This technology will facilitate the method and processes involved in the development and presentation of the new system in order for the system to give a better performance. The objective of this study is to integrate CAD system and MySQL database using AutoCAD, SQL and Java. The integration is implemented by developing and visualizing the design of the Block G and H, FTSM (Fakulti Teknologi dan Sains Maklumat) using AutoCAD with related information that are stored in MySQL database. The integration enables the visualization of buildings and on the same time, the related information can be accessed and displayed. Information related to the visualized buildings such as rooms, laboratories, the name of lecturers and staffs as well as email and phone numbers are being assigned to the database. The integration between CAD systems have been developed using MySQL and Java connector. This integrated system enables users to explore the visualization of block G and H with relevant details that emerged from the database at the same time. From this paper, it can be concluded that AutoCAD has been successfully integrated with MySQL and Java.

Objective
To investigate regional root canal push-out bond strengths for two fiber-reinforced post types using two adhesive systems.
Methods

The crowns of 24 recently extracted sound maxillary central incisors were sectioned transversely 2 mm coronal to the labial cemento-enamel junction, and the roots treated endodontically. Following standardized post space preparations, fiber-reinforced posts (C-POST; AESTHETI-PLUS) were placed using two adhesive systems (acid-etch ONE-STEP PLUS/C&B CEMENT; self-adhesive RelyX Unicem), in four equal groups. Push-out bond strength tests were performed at four sites in each root. Results were analyzed using split-plot ANOVA, with a = 0.05 for statistical significance.
Results

AESTHETI-PLUS quartz fiber-reinforced posts showed significantly higher push-out strengths than C-POST carbon fiber-reinforced posts (P < 0.0001). The separate acid-etch adhesive system resulted in significantly higher bond strengths than the self-etch self-adhesive system (P < 0.0001). Bond strengths decreased significantly from coronal to apical root canal regions (P < 0.0001).
Significance

The quartz fiber-reinforced post placed using the separate acid-etch adhesive system provided significantly better post retention than the carbon fiber-reinforced post placed using the self-etch self-adhesive system.

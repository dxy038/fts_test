Background: Regarding the importance of right diagnosis in medical applications,
various methods have been exploited for processing medical images solar. The method
of segmentation is used to analyze anal to miscall structures in medical imaging.
Objective: This study describes a new method for brain Magnetic Resonance Im
age (MRI) segmentation via a novel algorithm based on genetic and regional growth.
Methods: Among medical imaging methods, brains MRI segmentation is important
due to high contrast of non-intrusive soft tissue and high spatial resolution. Size varia
tions of brain tissues are often accompanied by various diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s
disease. As our knowledge about the relation between various brain diseases and de
viation of brain anatomy increases, MRI segmentation is exploited as the frst step
in early diagnosis. In this paper, regional growth method and auto-mate selection of
initial points by genetic algorithm is used to introduce a new method for MRI segmen
tation. Primary pixels and similarity criterion are automatically by genetic algorithms
to maximize the accuracy and validity in image segmentation.
Results: By using genetic algorithms and defning the fxed function of image seg
mentation, the initial points for the algorithm were found. The proposed algorithms are
applied to the images and results are manually selected by regional growth in which
the initial points were compared. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could
reduce segmentation error effectively.
Conclusion: The study concluded that the proposed algorithm could reduce seg
mentation error effectively and help us to diagnose brain diseases.

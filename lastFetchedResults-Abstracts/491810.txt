The objective of the present study was to quantify the relationships among body condition score (BCS; scale 1 to 5), live
weight (WT) and milk production in Irish Holstein-Friesian spring calving dairy cows. Data were from 66 commercial dairy
herds during the years 1999 and 2000. The data consisted of up to 9886 lactations with records for BCS or WT at least once
pre-calving, or at calving, nadir or 60 days post-calving. Change in BCS and WT was also calculated between time periods.
Mixed models with cow included as a random effect were used to quantify the effect of BCS and WT, as well as change in each
trait, on milk yield, milk fat concentration and milk protein concentration. Significant and sometimes curvilinear associations
were observed among BCS at calving or nadir and milk production. Total 305-day milk yield was greatest in cows calving at a
BCS of 4.25 units. However, cows calving at a BCS of 3.50 units produced only 68 kg less milk than cows calving at a BCS of
4.25 units while cows calving at 3.25 or 3.00 BCS units produced a further 50 and 114 kg less, respectively. Cows that lost
more condition in early lactation produced more milk of greater fat and protein concentration, although the trend reversed in
cows that lost large amounts of condition post-calving. Milk yield increased with WT although the marginal effect decreased as
cows got heavier. Milk fat and protein concentration in early lactation also increased with WT pre-calving, calving and nadir,
although WT did not significantly affect average lactation milk fat concentration.

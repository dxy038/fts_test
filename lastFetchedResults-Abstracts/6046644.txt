The efficiency of multistream speech recognizers is investigated by performing several experiments. In order to take advantage of multistream features, each stream should compensate the weakness of the other streams. Our objective is to utilize frequency modulation (FM) which can compensate errors from traditional analysis methods. In order to achieve informational independence from other features based on the spectral/time envelope of signals, our features do not contain amplitude information, but contain temporal structure information of frequency modulation. Our method is evaluated by the continuous digit recognition of noisy speech. We confirmed that our AM-FM combination method is efficient for noisy speech recognition.

Objective
We previously described a nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation regimen in dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical littermate recipients consisting of low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) before and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/cyclosporine (CSP) given after transplant to control both graft-vs-host and residual host-vs-graft reactions. In this study, we sought to develop a reduced-intensity regimen to achieve engraftment across major histocompatibility complex barriers in DLA-haploidentical littermate recipients.
Materials and Methods

We tested a regimen of 450-cGy TBI with or without postgrafting MMF/CSP for 28 and 35 days, respectively, and with the administration of monoclonal antibody (mAb) S5 (anti-CD44), at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day from days −7 through −2, prior to receiving TBI.
Results

One of six dogs conditioned with 450-cGy TBI alone achieved engraftment of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Three of six dogs achieved sustained donor cell engraftment using 450-cGy TBI and posttransplantation MMF/CSP. None of three dogs given mAb S5 followed by 450-cGy TBI showed signs of donor cell engraftment. However, when S5 mAb pretreatment was added to 450-cGy TBI and postgrafting MMF/CSP, 10 of 12 dogs achieved sustained engraftment (p = 0.008 or 0.007 vs 450-cGy alone or to S5 + 450-cGy TBI without MMF/CSP, respectively), with only three dogs developing severe graft-vs-host disease on this short regimen of immunosuppression.
Conclusion

These results show that engraftment across a DLA haplotype-mismatched barrier can be achieved after reduced-intensity conditioning when mAb S5 directed at CD44 is added to this regimen.

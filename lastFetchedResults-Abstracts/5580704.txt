In this paper ongoing research for a PhD-thesis is presented. The objective of this thesis is to develop an approach for engineering quality requirements. Quality requirements are an important part of requirements on software and their thorough specification is a prerequisite for the successful development of high quality systems. The presented approach relies on a quality model, that defines software quality and that serves as a structured knowledge-base. The quality model is integrated with an use-case based approach for eliciting and analyzing quality requirements. This way an effective communication with stakeholders as well as the quantification of quality requirements is assured.

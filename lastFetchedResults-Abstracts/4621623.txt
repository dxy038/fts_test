In this work, the problem of joint power and rate control (PRC) in CDMA-based ad hoc networks is considered and analyzed. We propose a game theoretic framework for performing efficient power and rate allocation in CDMA ad hoc networks and develop a distributed PRC algorithm for dynamically selecting the optimal neighboring destination, power and rate values. The objective is to maximize properly-defined node utility functions that reflect a tradeoff between actual achieved throughput and power consumption. The PRC algorithm selects opportunistically the destination nodes, by exploiting current channel state information, as expressed by the experienced SINR of the receivers, while it assures the convergence at the gamepsilas unique Nash Equilibrium point in terms of power and rate transmission vectors. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in two different network scenarios with respect to the allocated transmission power, received node performance satisfaction, actual achieved throughput and the convergence of the non-cooperative game.

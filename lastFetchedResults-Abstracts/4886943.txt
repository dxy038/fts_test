This paper investigates the structure of the replica-symmetric (RS) solutions for randomly-spread CDMA obtained with the replica method. The objective of this investigation is to resolve the apparent inconsistency observed between the RS solutions for the individually-optimum (IO) detection and those for the jointly-optimum (JO) detection: They appear to be inconsistent with each other in the limit of high signal-to-noise ratio. Our result reveals that the RS solutions have a complex structure at high-SNR regime, which has been mostly overlooked in the literature

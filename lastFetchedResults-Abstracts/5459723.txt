We present a new technique for detecting the possible presence of certain Denial-of-Service attacks in network traffic. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated in experiments against 23 attacks in three different traffic backgrounds. Even though some attacks persist for only 2-4 seconds, results show detection rates up to 84%. Results also show that (for these data) the technique can be tuned to eliminate false alarms. These results are especially favorable given the techniqueÂ´s objective of detecting new (previously unseen) attacks without a template of the background traffic.

The primary objective of fault detection is to detect abrupt undesirable changes in a process at an early stage. This early detection has a potential of preventing loss of production and equipment damage due to these undesirable changes, thus reducing process downtime. This paper details the implementation of some parametric fault detection techniques for sensor decalibration monitoring. A parametric fault detection approach that is handled in depth in this paper is the local approach. This approach developed by Benveniste, Basseville, and Moustakides [Benveniste, A., Basseville, M., and Moustakides, G., The asymptotic local approach to change detection and model validation. IEEE Trans. Autom. Control AC-32 (7), 583-592 (1987)] offers a computationally inexpensive way to attain the objective of monitoring changes in model parameters. However, the algorithm in its original formulation is not applicable to certain processes such as sensors. Therefore, the local approach is coupled with other estimation algorithms such as the input independent Kalman filter to derive a robust sensor decalibration monitoring algorithm. The proposed fault detection algorithm is applied to a pilot scale process for evaluation of its performance.

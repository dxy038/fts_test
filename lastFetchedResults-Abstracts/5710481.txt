In order to improve the service level of urban public transportation and the efficiency of the vehicles resources, a new multi-objective synthesis optimization scheduling model is set up in this paper based on the maximum weight value of three satisfaction degree such as comfort inside buses, waiting time and bus company benefits, then it uses the improved genetic algorithm to seek the approximate optimal solution to the model. Finally, the model has been applied to the bus demonstration route of Shijiazhuang city and proved feasible.

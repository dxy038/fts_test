Classical control and one cycle control of current are popular methods used to modulate pulses in active rectifiers for ac-dc power conversion. One cycle control has lower control complexity and can be implemented using linear analog circuits when compared with the classical approach. However, it also suffers from problems such as instability and offsets in current that is severe at light load conditions. A control strategy for bidirectional boost rectifiers based on one cycle control of charge is proposed for that overcomes these limitations. The integral of sensed current, which represents charge, is compared with a non-linear carrier, which is modified for ac-dc power conversion. This generates the gating signals for the switching devices. The modifications required for the control law governing one cycle control of charge is derived in the paper. Detailed simulation studies are carried out to compare one cycle control of current with the proposed method for ac-dc power conversion, which are validated on a laboratory hardware prototype.

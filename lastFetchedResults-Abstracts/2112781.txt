Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has been investigated for elaboration of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 using TMBi (Trimethylbismuth), TESb (Triethylantimony) and DETe (Diethyltellurium) as metal–organic sources. Their thermoelectric and physical properties were studied versus growth conditions. The MOCVD elaboration of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 was carried out in an horizontal reactor for a temperature varying from 400 to 500°C, a total hydrogen flow rate DT varying from 3 to 6 l mm−1 and (RVI/V) ratio ranging from 1.5 to 15. The thin films were deposited on pyrex and silicon substrates. The partial pressure of the V element varied between 0.5 10−4 to 2 10−4 atm to obtain high growth rate for micro-peltier applications. The cristallinity was investigated by X-ray diffraction and we observed a typical preferential c-orientation. The SEM micrographs show the layers quality and confirms the hexagonal structure. The microprobe data indicate that the stoichiometry of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 is constant for all thickness of the epitaxial films (0.3–7 μm). The films are always n-type conduction for Bi2Te3 and p-type for Sb2Te3. Seebeck coefficient and the minimum values of the resistivity were found close to −210 and +110 μV K−1, 9 and 3.5 μΩ.m for Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3, respectively. Electrical measurements (mobility and carrier density) were performed by Van der Pauw method. For the two materials, the best values of thermoelectrical properties were obtained at a growth temperature closed to 450°C and a VI/V ratio varying from 2 to 8. The thermoelectric properties of the two materials stay constant when the growth rate is increasing to value higher than 1.5 μm h−1. This result is very interesting for thick film applications. The previous objective of these experimental results has been to perform the thermoelectric properties of n- and p-type films by establishing first suitable deposition conditions and the elaboration of ternary alloys is now possible.

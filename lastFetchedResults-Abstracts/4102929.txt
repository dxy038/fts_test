End parts are one of the most costly components of a superconducting magnet. Therefore, efforts are underway at Fermilab to develop new technologies to reduce the fabrication time and cost of the magnet end parts. In this paper, we discuss some of the design and fabrication issues for the magnet end parts with a particular specific objective in mind

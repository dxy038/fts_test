An algorithm, which adapts to an appropriate interpolation technique for high-quality deinterlacing based on the spatial-temporal spectral and edge-oriented features of local video contents, is introduced. This algorithm employs a spectrum-adaptive vertical-temporal filter to deal with generic video scenes, and adopts a texture-adaptive edge-based line-averaging interpolation with an edge-consistency check to interpolate moving edges with high efficiency. This deinterlacing algorithm likewise incorporates an economical recursive stationary-pixel detection scheme with a field-averaging filter to effectively interpolate stationary video scenes. Because of the precise selection of the interpolation technique for versatile video contents, the proposed algorithm provides not only better objective peak signal-to-noise ratio, but also results in more impressive subjective visual quality when compared with other non-motion compensated deinterlacing approaches.

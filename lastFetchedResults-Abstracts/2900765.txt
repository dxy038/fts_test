In the last several years, organic electronics have gained increasing consideration as a cost-effective alternative to silicon, especially in RFID applications. An inductive-coupled organic RFID operating at 13.56MHz was demonstrated on foil using p-type organic technologies [1]. A complementary organic technology was used for a 13.56MHz transponder in [2]. Recently, a complementary hybrid organic/metal-oxide process was exploited to demonstrate bidirectional communication in an HF RFID [3]. It adopts passive envelope detection using traditional diode-based schemes with OOK modulation. However, OOK modulation usually reduces sensitivity and reading range. In this work, a complementary organic TFT (C-OTFT) technology [4] is used for the first time to implement a 13.56MHz RX front-end, which exploits an active detection scheme and is able to demodulate ASK PWM-coded signals with modulation depth (h) as low as 25%.

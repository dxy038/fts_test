Background and Objective: Since the advent of mammography screening, ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS) of the breast has been diagnosed increasingly. In contrast to the situation in invasive
breast carcinoma, there are only a few reports on androgen receptor (AR) status in DCIS and few
reports on estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors.
Materials and Methods: AR expression was examined in 51 cases of DCIS of the breast
and correlated to the degree of differentiation and ER/PR expression status in accordance to
immunohistochemical results.
Results: AR immunoreactivity was noted in 17 of the cases, whereas the other 34 cases were
negative. There was also no significant association between AR expression and the degree of
differentiation of DCIS; two of the 11 well-differentiated DCIS cases, nine of the 17 intermediately
differentiated cases, and six of the 23 poorly differentiated cases were AR positive (p = 0.091).
However, a strong association was shown between the expression of ER (p < 0.001) and PR (p =
0.002) and the degree of differentiation of DCIS. In addition, no significant association was found
between the expression of AR and the expression of ER (p = 0.37) or PR (p = 0.63) in DCIS of the
breast.
Conclusion: Clinically significant number of cases of DCIS of the breast expresses AR, which
may affect accurate typing of DCIS. Moreover, the expression of AR (but not ER or PR) in DCIS
does not appear to be associated with the degree of differentiation.

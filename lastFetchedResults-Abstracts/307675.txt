Objective:
The study investigated the association of genetic polymorphism of the α1AT gene with COPD.
Design and methods:
The mutations and polymorphism of α1AT gene were investigated by DNA sequence analysis using polymerase chain reaction.
Results:
The frequency of the PIM3 allele in COPD patients was found to be significantly higher than the controls (P< 0.0001). Five SNPs, including a novel SNP (24_25insA), were observed near the junction of exon–intron I. The occurrence of these SNPs didn't show any association with COPD. However, the PIM3 allele of the α1AT gene was found to be associated with COPD.
Conclusion:
The PIM3 allele of the α1AT gene is found to have an association with the pathogenesis of COPD in the Indian population.

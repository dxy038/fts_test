The topology optimization of YKS5120B-3 NC gear shaper machine tool bed is completed based on ANSYS with the shape envelope of the whole tool bed as solution domain and the minimum static compliance as objective function. The optimal topology model of the tool bed is obtained. And then the tool bed model is reconstructed in Pro/E and re-tested by static and dynamic analysis in ANSAYS. The re-tested results show that not only the static and dynamic performances of the tool bed are improved, but also the quality is reduced effectively.

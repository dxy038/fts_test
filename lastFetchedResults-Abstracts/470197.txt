Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experience with endometrial carcinoma in women ≤45 years of age at Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, La.
Study design
We evaluated the clinical history, treatment, and follow-up of 38 women ≤45 years of age diagnosed with endometrial cancer.
Results
Thirty-eight patients received primary treatment for endometrial cancer: stage I, 32 (84.2%); stage II, 1 (2.6%); stage III, 4 (10.5%); stage IV, 1 (2.6%). Tumors were well differentiated in 20 (52.6%), moderately differentiated in 10 (26.3%), and poorly differentiated in 8 (21.1%). At end of study period 32 women (84.2%) were alive with no evidence of disease, 5 had died of recurrent disease, and 1 died of metastatic breast cancer.
Conclusion
Patients ≤45 years of age had lower incidence of advanced stage disease, higher degree of tumor differentiation, and better prognosis compared to patients older than 45 years.

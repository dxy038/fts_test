The design optimization of synchronous reluctance (SyR) machines is considered in this paper by means of a Finite Element Analysis-based multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOOA). The research focuses on the design of the rotor geometry which is the key aspect of SyR machines design. In particular, this digest analyzes the performance of several popular MOOAs and the impact of their settings on the quality of the final design. A procedure to minimize the computational burden of the optimization process is introduced and applied for the first time to a five layer rotor. A rotor prototype has been realized to demonstrate the feasibility of the design procedure.

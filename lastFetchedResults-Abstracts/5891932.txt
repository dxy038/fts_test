A semantic trust computation algorithm of information is presented according to the attribute characteristics of information and interaction mechanism of nodes in semantic web. Semantic trust is the integration of objective content trust to information and subject node trust to source. Each node computes the content trust of the information according to the formal description of knowledge provided by its own ontology. And nodes compute the node trust through the interaction of information. Then the two former computations can be integrated into semantic trust of information. Experiments show that the semantic trust of information can be computed effectively.

The objective of the present experiment was to examine the influence of mean physiological concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on frozen–thawed Surti buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) spermatozoa functional parameters, i.e., motility, plasmalemma integrity, acrosomal integrity, functional membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation and fructose uptake in vitro. Frozen–thawed semen samples (n = 6) were washed in tris buffer and divided into two equal parts (control and IGF-I groups). Only in the IGF-I group, IGF-I (rhIGF-I analogue) was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and the assessments were made at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min of incubation. The mean concentration of the buffalo seminal plasma (n = 17) IGF-I was 116.83 ± 28.34 ng/ml (range 41.4–198.95). IGF-I had significant effect on the total motility (P &lt; 0.01), progressive forward motility (P &lt; 0.01), functional membrane integrity (P &lt; 0.05) and lipid peroxidation levels (P &lt; 0.05) during the 120-min study period as assessed by area under curve. Treatment with IGF-I increased (P &lt; 0.01) the total spermatozoa motility at 30, 60 and 90 min as compared to the control. The progressive forward motility was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher at 60 and 90 min of incubation. The addition of IGF-I resulted in significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in straight-line velocity (VSL, μm/s) as compared to the control at 60 and 90 min of incubation. The linearity (%) was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in IGF-I treated semen as compared to control at 60 min of incubation. Plasmalemma integrity in IGF-I group was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than control at 30 and 60 min of incubation. The functional membrane integrity differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) between groups (control and IGF-I) at 60 and 90 min of incubation. The percentage of acrosomal intact spermatozoa decreased continuously over a period of time in both the groups. As compared to 0 min of incubation, the significant (P &lt; 0.05) loss of acrosome was observed at 60 and 90 min of incubation in control (63.87 ± 3.17 vs. 58.52 ± 2.54) and IGF-I (61.60 ± 2.26 vs. 56.11 ± 2.12) groups, respectively. Lipid peroxidation levels were significantly lower in IGF-I group at 90 min (P &lt; 0.05) and 120 min (P &lt; 0.01) of incubation than the control group. Fructose utilization was significantly higher in IGF-I group as compared to control at 30 min (P &lt; 0.05) and 60 min (P &lt; 0.01) of incubation. The present study suggests that addition of IGF-I improve spermatozoa functional parameters by reducing lipid peroxidation levels.

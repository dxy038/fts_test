We investigate the rake receiver design alternatives for CDMA systems. The main objective of this paper is to find ways to achieve the rake receiver for both fast PN code acquisition and minimizing hardware complexity and power consumption. We design a searching finger to enhance the speed of the initial PN code acquisition. The searching finger is used as a searcher in the initial acquisition and as a finger after the initial acquisition. The results indicate that, without introducing significant hardware increments, the acquisition is faster twice than that of the conventional rake receiver

The main objective is to develop methods that automatically generate kinematic models for the movements of biological and robotic systems. Two methods for the identification of the kinematics are presented. The first method requires the elimination of the displacement variables that cannot be measured while the second method attempts to estimate the changes in these variables. The methods were tested using a planar two-revolute-joint linkage. Results show that the model parameters obtained agree with the actual parameters to within 5%. Moreover, the methods were applied to model head and neck movements in the sagittal plane. The results indicate that these movements are well modeled by a two-revolute-joint system. A spatial three-revolute-joint model was also discussed and tested.

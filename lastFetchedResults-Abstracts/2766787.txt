Design of online algorithms for assigning mobile users to basestations is considered with the objective of maximizing the sum-rate, when all users associated to any one basestation equally share each basestationÂ´s resources. Each user on its arrival reveals the rates it can obtain if connected to each of the basestations, and the problem is to assign each user to any one basestation irrevocably and without delay so that the sum-rate is maximized at the end of all user arrivals. In online algorithms, at each user arrival, the rates of future users are assumed to be unknown, and no assumptions are made about their statistics. Online algorithms with constant factor loss in comparison to offline algorithms (that know both the user arrival and user rates profile in advance) are derived. The proposed online algorithms are motivated from the famous online k-secretary problem and online maximum weight matching problem.

RESULTS: The mean±SD age of the women undergone oophorectomy was 28.3±8.46. Complications were reported in 28.7% of the cysts and more commonly found in younger age groups. Corpus luteum was found to be the most frequent histopathology in all cases (22.87%) while follicular cysts were seen in 50% of the bilateral presentations.

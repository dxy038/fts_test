We study a cognitive channel reuse approach for autonomous femtocell deployment in an OFDMA-based cellular network. The objective is to manage the uplink interference from macrocell users to femtocell access points. Macrocell users are normally far away from the base station and may cause strong uplink interference to the close-by femtocells. By cognitive interference recognition, a femtocell access point autonomously reuse the proper channel modes for interference minimization. We propose an opportunistic channel scheduling scheme that determines optimal channel and power allocation to femtocell users. Simulation results show improved uplink performance in terms of the average channel outage probability in femtocells.

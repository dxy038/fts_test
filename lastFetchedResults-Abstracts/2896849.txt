In this paper, a coding scheme targeting stereoscopic content for polarized displays is introduced. It is proposed to use row-interleaved sampling of the views. Asymmetry is achieved by selection of odd/even rows for different views based on the format they will be shown on a polarized display. Coding performance of several different multiview coding schemes with inter-view prediction was analyzed and compared with the anchor case where there is no downsampling applied to the input content. The objective results show that the proposed row-interleaved sampling scheme outperforms all other schemes.

A group of the neurons in the brain responds to the stimuli from the outside and inside. The information propagates to a suitable area and is processed in the correct way in the brain of a healthy person. When a series of processes has some problems, a psychoneurotic disorder can be caused. The objective of this research is to visualize the correlation and propagation of the information between the brain regions. Using the coherence analysis of electroencephalography (EEG), the coherence and time-lag between EEGs of two electrodes in all sets were calculated. We have developed two kinds of user-interfaces including interactive GUI for the visualization. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional user-interfaces have been developed using C++/CLI and OpenGL with GLUI on Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, respectively. The correlation and propagation can be depicted on the developed two- and three-dimensional user-interfaces, and a user can operate the parameters for drawing or moving the image at his/her disposal. This research has achieved two goals: detailed information between the regions in the brain has been successfully visualized, and the high usability of the user-interfaces for brain analysis has been realized.

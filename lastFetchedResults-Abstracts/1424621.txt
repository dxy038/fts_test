The tracking interferometer, or the laser tracker, is a laser interferometer with a steering mechanism to regulate the laser beam direction to follow a retroreflector (“target”). Applying the multilateration principle, it measures the target's three-dimensional position at an arbitrary location in the workspace. Its application to the volumetric accuracy measurement for coordinate measurement machines or machine tools has been long studied. In this paper, we propose the ‘open-loop’ tracking interferometer, where the laser beam is regulated toward the command target position. This eliminates the automated tracking mechanism and thus may significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of conventional tracking interferometers. The objective of this paper is to validate this ‘open-loop’ tracking interferometer concept by investigating its measurement uncertainty both experimentally and analytically. To simplify the problem, this paper focuses on the measurement of the target's two-dimensional position by using a single-axis ‘open-loop’ tracking interferometer prototype.

A methodology for low-cost multi-objective design of antenna structures is proposed. To reduce the computational effort of the design process the initial Pareto front is obtained by optimizing the response surface approximation (RSA) model obtained from low-fidelity EM simulations of the antenna structure of interest. The front is further refined by iterative incorporation of a limited number of high-fidelity training points into the RSA surrogate using co-kriging. Our considerations are illustrated using two examples of antenna structure.

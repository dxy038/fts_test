A microgrid system under three phase fault is investigated with MATLAB based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for studying the effects of voltage changes on load buses having static polynomial (ZIP) loads. Load modeling is always a critical aspect on approaching power system rationally. Examining the behavior of the ZIP load model under a faulty condition is the main objective of this paper. Static characteristics of common load models can be grouped into three categories based on their dependency on voltage. Quadratic relation between power and voltage exists for constant impedance load model (Z). Linear power-voltage relation is true for constant current load model (I). Power is independent of voltage changes for constant power load model (P). The sum of these three categories is a polynomial model known as ZIP load. Voltage and power variations of ZIP load will be investigated with designed user-friendly MATLAB based GUI and overall changes will be discussed.

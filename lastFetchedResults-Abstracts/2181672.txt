Today, transportation of hazardous materials (i.e., hazmat) is a very important issue for researchers
due to the risk of this transit, which should be considered for development of industries and transportation.
Therefore, a model that is useful should consider the risk and damage to humanitarian
and environmental issues due to transit of hazmat materials. By considering the related cost, the
reality and applicability of the model are also very important. In this paper, a bi-objective model is
presented for routing rail-truck intermodal terminals with the cost and risk as objective functions
by considering three sets of the effective factors that lead to hazardous materials transportation accidents
in favor of sustainability. Additionally, a fuzziness concept is considered in the presented
model. The model is first validated by the prevalent software using the authoritative solver to solve
a numerical example. Furthermore, to help managers, an efficient fuzzy approach proposed in the
literature is used. Finally, it is concluded that in this work a reality and sustainable model is suitable
for hazmat transportation.

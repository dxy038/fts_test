This paper proposes an optimal blind decoding scheme for linear transceivers based on orthonormal real valued short time block codes. The decoding scheme is to minimize the total decoding error within the blocks subject to the orthonormal property among the encoded vectors. The decoding problem is actually an optimization problem with a quadratic objective function subject to a quadratic matrix equality constraint. The solution of the optimization problem is solved analytically via a singular value decomposition approach. As no computer aided design tool is required for solving the problem, the computational power for solving the problem is very low and the solution can be obtained in real-time. Computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method achieves a lower total decoding error compared to those of existing decoding schemes.

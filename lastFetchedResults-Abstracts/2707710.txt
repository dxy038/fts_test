This paper presents an integrated traction machine and converter topology that has bidirectional power flow capability between an electric vehicle and the dc or ac supply or grid. The inductances of the traction motor windings are used for bidirectional converter operation to transfer power eliminating the need for extra inductors for the charging and vehicle-to-grid converter operations. These operations are in addition to the vehicle traction mode operation. The electric powertrain system size and weight can be minimized with this approach. The concept has been analyzed with finite-element- coupled simulation with dynamic analysis software. Experimental results are also provided with electric machines. The interleaving technique has been used with the inductors to share the current and reduce the converter switching stresses.

In order to find the optimal combination of spatio-SNR-temporal transcoding operations, we need to measure the distortion due to the transcoding operations. In this paper, we develop computational methods to calculate the distortion by using only the information extracted directly from the input bitstream through a minimum decoding process in the DCT domain. The objective of our distortion modeling is to estimate the multidimensional distortion before the entire transcoding process

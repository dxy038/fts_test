The Max Planck Society for the advancement of science is an independent non-profit research organization. It was established on 26 February 1948 as successor to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, which itself was founded in 1911. The society s registered seat is in Berlin; the presidents office and the headquarters are situated in Munich.
This society is predominantly backed by public funds, generated by the German Federal Government and individual states.
The prime objective of the Max Planck Society is to perform top-class research at the service of general public. Depending on their subject areas, institutes and faculties are organized in three sections: the Chemistry section, Physics & Technology Section, the Biology & Medicine Section, and the Humanities Section.
The Max Planck Society embraces new, especially innovative lines of research which universities are still unable to accommodate adequately. This is due to the fact that the interdisciplinary character of such research does not fit into the universities' organizational framework.

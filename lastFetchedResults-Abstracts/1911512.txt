Objective
jective of this study was to assess the effect of dutasteride on serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with serologic relapse following radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy for clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
s
pective, single institution, IRB approved trial was conducted. Entry criteria required that all participants have serologic disease relapse only with serum PSA levels between 0.4 and 10.0 ng/ml. Enrolled participants were treated with 0.5 mg dutasteride daily. The primary endpoints were serum PSA level and clinical recurrence. The rate of durable decline in PSA was assessed according to the recommendations of the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group.
s
-five patients provided informed consent and participated in the present study. At a median follow-up duration of 27 months (range, 4–42 months), 46% of enrolled men had a serum PSA decrease of greater than 10%, and 25% had a serum PSA decrease of greater than 50% (P &lt; 0.001). Pre-study PSA doubling time (PSADT) (≥12 months vs. &lt;12 months), and Gleason score (≤6 vs. ≥7) were associated with a better response to dutasteride, but only PSADT was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). Thirty percent of patients experienced PSA progression (increase in serum PSA of greater than 50%). Two (6%) patients developed bone metastasis. No patient was removed from the study for drug-related toxicity.
sions
 present pilot study, treatment with dutasteride resulted in a significant decrease in serum PSA in men with serologic relapse following radical treatment for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. These data appear to suggest that dutasteride may delay or prevent progression of prostate cancer in some men with biochemical relapse after radical therapy. These findings require confirmation in the setting of a larger, longer trial.

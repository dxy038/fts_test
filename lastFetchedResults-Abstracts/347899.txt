Objective: When we move hand-held objects that exhibit stable physical properties grip force is regulated in anticipation of movement-induced inertial loads. In contrast, when the object's behaviour is unpredictable, grip force is adjusted in response to sensory feedback with the consequence that grip tends to lag behind load. Previous studies analysed reactive and predictive grip force behaviour by systematically varying the predictability of the physical object properties.
Methods: This study examines if anticipatory force control also depends on the predictability of the limb dynamics interfering with external objects. The coupling between grip and load force profiles was comparatively analysed during voluntary and externally guided vertical arm movements with an instrumented hand-held object. Voluntary and externally guided movements were performed with and without visual feedback.
Results: During voluntary arm movements grip force was precisely regulated in anticipation of movement-induced inertial load fluctuations with grip force increasing in parallel with load force without an obvious time delay. In contrast, during externally guided movements grip force was regulated in reaction to the imposed load fluctuations. However, the reflex-mediated grip force responses were still flexible to account for the differential loading requirements of movement direction. There was no difference of grip force performance between movements performed with and without visual feedback.
Conclusions and significance: The results suggest that predictability of both the external object and the dynamics of the own body is essential to establish an anticipatory mode of grip force regulation. Unpredictability of the own limb dynamics results in a reactive mode of grip force control. Reactive grip force control appears to be both highly automatised and flexible reflecting differential loading requirements of movement direction.

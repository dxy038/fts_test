Practical challenges in distributed generation and electric vehicles have motivated the rapid development of bidirectional multi-port dc-dc converters. This paper proposes a converter that not only can perform fast battery voltage balancing and limit ground leakage current, it also features low switching ripple and component count, providing significant cost savings from reduced filter requirements and improved efficiency. Experimental testing of a 3.3 kW prototype confirms the bidirectional power transfer capability and demonstrates above 99% converter efficiency over a wide range of input power.

The four key objective properties of a system that are required of it in order for it to qualify as “autonomic” are now well-accepted—self-configuring, self-healing, self-protecting, and self-optimizing—together with the attribute properties—viz. self-aware, environment-aware, self-monitoring and self-adjusting. This paper describes the need for next generation system software architectures, where components are agents, rather than objects masquerading as agents, and where support is provided for self-* properties (both existing self-chop and emerging self-* properties). These are discussed as exhibited in NASA missions, and in particular with reference to a NASA concept mission, ANTS, which is illustrative of future NASA exploration missions based on the technology of intelligent swarms.

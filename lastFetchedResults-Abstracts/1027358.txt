Background and Objective: Since the preparation of antibacterial materials in dentistry is very noticeable, therefore, we tried to evaluate this effect on Streptococcus mutans by addition of silica nanoparticles to LCGI (light curing glass ionomer).

Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, we had five LCGI experimental groups that contained 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2% (w/w) of silica nanoparticles. For disc diffusion test, 15 samples were prepared and their anti-Streptococcus mutans effects in agar culture were evaluated. Antibacterial effects of 15 micro-tubes containing different groups of LCGI were evaluated in direct contact test.

Results: There were significant differences between specimens containing nanoparticles and control group in both disc diffusion and direct contact test.

Conclusion: In disc diffusion test, bacterial growth inhibition hallo showed that LCGI penetrates into peripheral environment and disrupted bacterial growth. In direct contact test, samples showed significant bacterial growth inhibition. By increasing nanoparticles weight percent, there was a significant decrease in bacterial growth.

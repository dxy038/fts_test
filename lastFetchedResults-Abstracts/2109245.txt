Objective(s):In recent years, the chemistry of Tetrazolo[5',1':2,3][1,3,4]thiadiazepino [7,6-b]quinolines have received considerable attention owing to their synthetic and effective biological importance which exhibits a wide variety of biological activity. As the inhibitor of aldose reductase, the aforementioned compounds may have implication in preventing complications of diabetes.
Materials and Methods: A group of tetrazolo[5',1':2,3][1,3,4]thiadiazepino [7,6-b]quinolinederivatives were synthesized, and theoretically evaluated for their inhibitory potency against aldose reductase (ALR) via docking process. The docking calculation was done in Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking (GOLD) 5.2 software using Genetic algorithm.
Results: Compounds 3a and 3f showed the best inhibitory potency by GOLD score value of 78.83 and 76.88 respectively.
Conclusion: All of the best models formed strong hydrogen bonds with Trp 111 and Tyr 209 via tetrazole moiety. It was found that pi-pi interaction between Tyr 209, Trp 20 and His 110 side chain and quinolin moiety was one of the common factors in enzyme-inhibitor junction. It was found that both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are important in the structure and function of biological molecules, especially for inhibition in a complex.

The objective of this high performance computing (HPC) challenge project is to perform virtual live-fire tests via three-dimensional modeling and simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of weapons systems, specifically general-purpose bombs and the continuous rod warhead (CRW), against beach zone and surf zone obstacles. The overall goal is to perform end-to-end simulations, using parallel hydrocodes, to evaluate obstacle damage and displacement as a function of time. Results of select simulations for both the bomb effects program and CRW program are discussed. The HPCMO, through the challenge program, has provided the computational resources to simulate these fully three-dimensional, time-dependent scenarios with sufficient fidelity to address their highly disparate time and length scales.

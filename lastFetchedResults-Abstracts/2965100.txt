An adaptive asteroid filter is compared to the conventional circular and square shaped lowpass filter in the frequency domain for optical and radar satellite imagery for compression of satellite images. The adaptive asteroid filter is first performed by detecting the shape and direction of the energy concentration of various frequencies, and then adapting itself by rotating and reshaping, so as to retain only the most important frequency components present in the images. The image quality is evaluated through the use subjective and objective mean square error (MSE) between the original and compressed satellite images

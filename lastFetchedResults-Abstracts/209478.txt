Background and Objective: The phospholipids fatty acid content of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has
recently been found to be related to several important biological functions which may serve as a risk factor
for coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether fatty acid
composition of HDL phospholipids correlates with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.
Materials and Methods: The study population included 117 patients with coronary artery disease which was
approved by angiography. The severity ofCAD was assessed by the number of arteries (I, 2 or 3) with more
than 50% stenosis reported by angiography. The fatty acid composition of HDL phospholipids was
determined by gas liquid chromatography. The independence of association between fatty acids and CAD
were evaluated by multivariate analyses which included all of the variables associated with the severity of
CAD in univariate analysis.
Results: These analyses showed that the association of EPA (P~-0.23, P<O.O 1) and DHA W=-0.17, P<0.05)
with the severity of CAD was inversely and independently significant.
Conclusion: Some kinds of polyunsaturated HDL fatty acid contents such as EPA and DHA (omega-3 fatty
acids) have adverse association with severity ofCAD.

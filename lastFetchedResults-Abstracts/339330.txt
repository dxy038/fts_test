Objective
Although several methods for the generation of dendritic cells (DCs) exist, little is known about the transmigration capacities of the cells developed. Their ability to migrate to the adjacent lymphatic system is relevant since their efficacy does also rely on their potential to interact with lymphocytes.
Methods

We studied the transmigration of DCs derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), from peripheral blood monocytes, and from leukemic cells. DCs from monocytes and leukemic cells could be generated within 1 week, whereas DCs from HPC needed 2 weeks for maturation.
Results

While DCs from all sources showed similar morphologic features and allostimulatory capacities, their transmigration capacities varied: HPC-derived DCs showed the highest migratory response to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α and β. Monocyte-derived DCs were equally attracted to MIP-3β and stroma-derived factor (SDF)-1α. Only few leukemic DCs migrated in response to SDF-1. Other chemoattractants tested included MIP-1α and RANTES. Replacement of fetal bovine by human serum did not change the DC's overall migratory capacities. It did, however, influence the responsiveness to certain chemokines.
Conclusion

Although DCs from all three sources are immunocompetent antigen-presenting cells, our findings suggest that HPC and monocyte-derived DCs can be administered subcutaneously and intravenously, but that leukemic DCs should be injected into the lymph node.

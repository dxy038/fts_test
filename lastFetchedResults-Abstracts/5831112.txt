This paper presents ultracapacitor and battery pack modeling with a DC/DC converter in a hybrid power system. Ultracapacitor is dimensioned for peak power requirement and battery pack provides the power in steady state. A Topology structure was analyzed that the ultracapacitor system is connected with battery pack parallel after a bidirectional DC/DC converter. A detailed theoretical analysis on the control strategy of DC/DC converter has been conducted. For reasons of cost and existing components, the experimental test benches are designed in reduced scale. Simulation results obtained from classical PI control strategy are presented shows the control strategy of the DC/DC Converter can meet the requirements of hybrid power system.

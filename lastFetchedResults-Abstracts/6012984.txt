One of the limitations of the stability-constrained optimal power flow (SOPF) model is that the representation of angular stability rests on assumptions that can lead to a sub-optimal dispatch outcome. The present research enhances the SOPF model to improve upon the quality of the solution. The paper demonstrates that the feasible set of a stability-constrained optimal power flow problem can be open and hence the optimal solution may not exist. The paper then reviews a step-by-step integration (SBSI) based approach which has the limitation of yielding sub-optimal solutions. A primary objective of the present research is to introduce two algorithms that can be used to find an improved solution, starting with a sub-optimal solution. The proposed enhancements are expected to establish the SOPF model on a firmer footing because it is better equipped to locate the optimal dispatch and pricing outcome.

This paper describes the evaluation of the characteristics of a real automatic traffic sign detection system. The objective of this review is to provide the basis of quality of a whole system, which is capable of identifying the different signs that can be found in route. At the moment, our work is concerned with the developing of an inventory system capable to get a complete catalog of all the traffic signs and their corresponding state information. The paper analyzes exhaustively the different problems that can appear in real environments and shows how the system implemented overcomes all these difficulties with a high success. The flexibility of the system allows it to run new algorithms even though several of them can be run in parallel and, on the other hand, it is relatively easy to change the training traffic sign according to the circumstances: urban or non-urban environments and traffic signs from different countries.

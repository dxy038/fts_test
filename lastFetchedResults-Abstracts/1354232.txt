Skidding operations can cause considerable and wide spread soil disturbance. The objective of this study
was to evaluate the effects of ground skidding operations on soil compaction, moisture content, and total
porosity at different levels of slope and traffic frequency. Four levels of traffic intensity (3, 8, 13, and  > 13
passes of a Crawler Tractor Onezhets â€“ 110) and three levels of slope ( < 10%, 10%-20% and  >  20%) were
applied to assess soil disturbance. The soil samples from the depth interval 0-10 cm were collected with a
soil hammer and rings. Results showed that dry bulk density, moisture content and total porosity were
affected considerably by slope and traffic frequency of skid trails. Bulk density was drawing near to the
critical value after 8 passes in the trail with the slope  > 20%; when the number of machine passes increased
from 8 to 13 passes, the additional bulk density increment was negligible. Irrespective of traffic frequency,
dry bulk density increased significantly in the slope  > 10% compared to the slope  < 10%; however there was
no significant difference between slopes 10-20% and  > 20% . Minimum moisture content was measured as
27% on the skid trail versus 47% in the undisturbed area. A negative correlation was found between
moisture content and dry bulk density. Total porosity was measured as a maximum 58% to a minimum
44% on the skid trail treatments, and 65% in the undisturbed area. Soil disturbance was extended
dramatically on the treatments with slopes  > 20%, so dry bulk density on the treatments with 8 passes and
slopes  > 20% (1.38 g cm-3) was significantly higher than on the treatment with 13 passes and slopes  < 10%
(1.32 gcm-3). Results showed that slope  > 10% increased soil disturbance quite dramatically.

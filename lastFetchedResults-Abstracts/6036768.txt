The paper presents a compile-time scheme for partitioning non-rectangular loop nests which consist of inner loops whose bounds depend on the index of the outermost, parallel loop. The minimisation of load imbalance, on the basis of symbolic cost estimates, is considered the main objective; however options which may increase other sources of overhead are avoided. Experimental results on a virtual shared memory computer are also presented

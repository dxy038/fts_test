Objective: Multiple Scl erosis (MS) is one o f the most common
chr oni c disea ses of the central nerv ous sys tem (e NS), which cau ses
imp ortant changes patient' s life , sp ecially in adults life. MS decreases
the quality of life (QOL) of pati ents seve rely and led to di sability
gradually.
The aim of this study is to assess the effects of applying hyd rotherap y
on quality of life of Multi pie Sclerosis patients.
Materials & Methods: In this Quasi-e xperimental study, 50 Multiple
Sclerosis pati ent s were selected with no probability sampling according
to specific criteria and then assigned to experimental and control groups
(25 patient s in ea ch g roup) with balanced randomized allocation .
Hydrotherapy performed for 24 sessions by experimental group during three
months but no interv ention was done for control group. Data coll ector tool s
included: demogr aphi c questionnaire, SF8- QOL que stionn aire, Self report
checklists. Stati stical analysi s was done by use of statistica l tests such as: chi
square, paired t-test , student t-test ,ANOYA with repea ted measurements and
independent t-rest.
Results: There was no significant difference between two groups in phycical
and mental dim en sion s (P:::.0.04 & P=0.2) and whole (P:::.0.81) scores of QOL
before interv enti on, but tbere were significant differences between two groups
after intervention in the se scores (P<O.OOl, P=0 .003 & P<O.OOl) . ANOYA
test with repeated mea surements showed that there is significant difference in
mean score of whole (P=0 .04) and physic al (P=0.05 ) and mental (P=O.04)
dimen sions of QOL between two groups in 4 times.
Conclusion: Hyd rotherapy is pra ctically fea sible and is associated with
increa se of MS pati ent ·s QOL; so that applying this technique can promote
MS patient ·s QOL and offered to these patients.

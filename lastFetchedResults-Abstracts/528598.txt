Objective

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic syndrome presenting with severe hypotonia and decreased agility. Growth Hormone (GH), which is often used in these patients to treat short stature and obesity, seems improve hypotonia, physical strength, activity, and locomotor developmental ability. The aim of

this study was to find the effects of growth hormone on agility and strength of these patients.

Material & Methods

In a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial in an out-patient pediatric endocrine clinic in Tehran, 21 PWS children (12 boys and 9 girls, 4 to 9 years old) were divided into either GH-treated or control groups and followed for two years. Agility run, sit ups, weight lifting, and inspiratory and expiratory strength were considered as the main outcome measures.

Results

All the outcome measures of the GH treated group showed a significant improvement compared to the control group.

Conclusion

GH causes a significant improvement in agility and strength of PWS children.

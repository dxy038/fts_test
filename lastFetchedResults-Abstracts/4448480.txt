It is known that glow discharge modifies the physical and chemical nature of polymer surfaces and in general enhances their adhesion to the metals. This effect finds wide use in a commercial technologies of polymer electrets. However, in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films treated by a glow discharge (prior to metallization and conventional corona-charging procedure) the surface voltage stability is reduced significantly. The first objective of the present paper is to study the charge relaxation mechanism in PTFE-Al structures having interfacial region modified by the glow discharge. The second is to obtain information about the electrophysical, chemical and structural properties of this region

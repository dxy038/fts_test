Capacitive deionization (CDI) with carbon-aerogel electrodes represents a novel process in desalination of brackish water and has merit due to its low fouling/scaling potential, ambient operational conditions, electrostatic regeneration, and low voltage requirements. The objective of this study was to investigate the viability of CDI in treating brackish produced water and recovering iodide from the water. Laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments were conducted to identify ion selectivity, key operational parameters, evaluate desalination performance, and assess the challenges for its practical applications. The performance of the CDI technology (CDTÂ®) system tested was consistent throughout the laboratory- and field-scale experiments. Deterioration of the carbon-aerogel electrodes was not observed during testing. The degree of ions adsorbed to the carbon aerogel (in mol/g aerogel) during treatment of brackish water was dependent upon initial ion concentrations in the feed water with the following selectivity I>Br>Ca>alkalinity>Mg>Na>Cl. The preferential sorption of iodide revealed merit to efficiently recover iodide from brackish water even in the presence of dominant co-ions. The research findings derived from this study identified parameters that merit further improvements regarding design and operation, including modification of pore-size distribution of aerogel, development of high capacitance and low-cost electrode materials, reducing the dead volume after regeneration and rinsing, minimizing energy consumption, and maximizing system recovery.

Objective: We investigated the possible effect of the T3111C CLOCK gene polymorphism on depressive disorder, insomnia and diurnal preference. Material and methods: twenty seven subjects, aged 23-71, self-selected from a larger sample of healthy controls and clinically depressed patients were screened for the presence of the aforementioned SNP. Results: We detected a possible association of the T/T allele with depression. Conclusion: No support was found for an involvement in sleep disturbance or circadian preference, but CLOCK may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders.

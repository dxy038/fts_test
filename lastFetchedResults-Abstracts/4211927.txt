This paper outlines a new approach of distribution system operation utilizing state of the art communication technology. Based on a generalized architecture that is suitable for real time control incorporating fluctuating infeeds from renewables a market driven approach will be outlined. This approach also includes some reference situations related to optimal distribution network power flow with an open and adaptive objective function. The value of the proposed structure will be demonstrated in reference to a first benchmark application within a real distribution network of a public utility.

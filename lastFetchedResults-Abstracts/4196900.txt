In order to evaluate the ability of the service network after taking off some valves in the event of one or more pipeline breakages, the paper has established the water supply pipeline failure consequence assessment model. The model was two hierarchical assessment model using an objective weighting method. It took the node demands decrease of affected pipelines, the node demands decrease and the pressure reduction of non-affected pipelines as three estimate indexes. All of parameters were treated as the properties of the node. The water supply pipeline failure consequences evaluation model based on water supply pipeline failure hydraulic model, which first redistributed node demands, and automatically adjusted the node demands under node pressure, and was calculated by genetic algorithm(GA). Through the simulation experiments in a small water distribution system, it showed that the model worked well. According to the assessment results with the model, the reasonableness of the valveÂ´s arrangement and the role of some pipelines can be effectively analyzed, and the research proposed measures to reduce the consequences of pipeline failure.

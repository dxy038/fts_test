Future wireless networks are in need to provide customers with high data rate, wideband multiple services, and flexible communication. Nowadays, there is a strong competition between optical access technologies and wireless access technologies to achieve these requirements. The optical fiber access networks provide wide bandwidth digital services and long-distance communication, but they are less ubiquitous. The wireless access networks provide flexible and ubiquitous communication with a low deployment cost. In this paper, a system module for optical transmission and digitization of analog signals and the tests conducted on an experimental setup is presented. The dynamic range of output /input voltages is 2V- 4V at a frequency of 1 KHz-4 KHz. The extended application is to transmit multiple analog signals through multimode fiber over a distance of 100 meters with minimal distortions. The objective is to study, understanding and research of optical fibers and digitization of analog signals under the point of view of experimental, simulation approaches.

Following the proposal presented by the DRM consortium, some trials have been performed worldwide in an attempt to confirm the viability of the use of the 26 MHz for local broadcasting. This paper presents the results of the field trials performed in the city of Brasilia, Brazil, in 2006. The objective of these trials was to find in which conditions the DRM signal can be well received. Tests were performed in different reception environments, both stationary and mobile, in order to verify the influence of the surroundings in the signal reception. Furthermore, an attempt was made to find the thresholds above which the reception is successful.

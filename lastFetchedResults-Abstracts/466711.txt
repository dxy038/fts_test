Objective: To compare cytokine production after lipopolysaccharide stimulation of whole blood from women who were delivered of infants at term compared with women who were delivered of preterm infants with intra-amniotic evidence of infection or inflammation. Study Design: Whole blood samples from 12 women who were not pregnant and who had previously had preterm deliveries before 32 weeks complicated by intra-amniotic infection or inflammation and samples from 12 age- and race-matched control subjects were stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 levels were quantified at 6 hours and interleukin-10 at 24 hours by enzyme immunoassay. Results were compared with use of the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: Tumor necrosis factor-α production was significantly higher in whole blood from women with histories of a preterm birth and intra-amniotic infection or inflammation (11,243 ± 1030 pg/mL [mean ± SEM]) compared with control subjects (3649 ± 349 pg/mL) at a lipopolysaccharide concentration of 1 μg/mL (P = .002). There were no significant differences in interleukin-6 or interleukin-10 production. Conclusion: Women with previous early preterm deliveries who had evidence of intra-amniotic infection or inflammation had significantly higher tumor necrosis factor-α production after lipopolysaccharide stimulation of whole blood compared with women with previous term deliveries.

The looped oil/gas gathering and transportation pipe network is to realize the gathering and transportation purposes by linking the oil wells with the metering stations through the pipe loop. In order to improve the design quality of the pipe network, the location-allocation optimization model for the looped gathering and transportation pipe network is established, wherein the minimum investment is taken as the objective function, and the unique affiliation and processing capacity of nodes, gathering and transportation loop and the geometric position of stations are taken as the constraint conditions; and then the solution strategies of hybrid genetic-simulated annealing algorithm are worked out. By adopting the real-coded chromosome, the uniform arithmetic crossover and the non-uniform mutation, the copy strategy and optimum maintaining strategy based on the Metropolis Criterion are implemented to effectively improve the optimum performance of algorithm. This method is used to conduct the optimum design for the oil/gas gathering and transportation pipe network of certain oilfield tract and the investment on pipeline is reduced by 11.57% compared with the artificial design.

The objective of this study was to empirically examine how the management style of the team leader effects the internal dynamics of a cross-functional product development team (CFPDT). Results of a correlation analysis indicate that facilitative behavior (considerate and participative management style) of a team leader had a tremendous influence on virtually all aspects of team communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution. Facilitative behavior enhances both the openness and quality of CFPDT communication. A more facilitative style of team management increased the collaboration within the team and reduced instances of dysfunctional conflict resolution. Effective means of resolving conflict (compromising, confronting) were positively related to the consideration and involvement of the team leader. This indicates that the team leader acts in a &#8220;facilitative&#8221; capacity, increasing the likelihood that conflicts will be negotiated and mediated to a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned

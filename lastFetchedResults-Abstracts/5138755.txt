CIDre, which stands for "Confidentialy, Integrity, Availability, and repartition\´\´, is the name of a new research group created in Rennes, France, as a follow-up of the SSIR team (www.rennes.supelec.fr/ren/rd/ssir), which was, until 2011, a Supe&#769;lec team whose work was mainly focused on intrusion detection and spontaneous network (ad hoc, P2P) security. The global research objective of this new CIDre research group is to study new security solutions for nodes and network of nodes, in particular through the use of classical but potentially revised approaches coming from the distributed computing field. More especially, we focus on three different aspects of security: privacy, trust, and intrusion detection.

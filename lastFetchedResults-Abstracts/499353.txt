The main objective of this research is to study the process of deep soil temperature in Yazd station. For this purpose, the daily temperature of soil in Yazd synoptic station was selected at depths of 5,10,20,30,50 and 100 cm from the earth surface at 03,09 and 15 GMT o’clock in a 5 years statistical period (2001- 2005). The results indicated that the most oscillation amplitude of daily temperature is at the layer close to the earth surface (5 cm depth) at 6.30 o’clock in April which continually decreases with depth increase, so that reaches to minimum at depth 100cm  in August. Also at depth of 5 and 10 cm, maximum temperature happened in July, while at 10 cm depth with a time delay of one month happened at the ending days of July. 
Also Minimum temperature at higher depths (5,10 and 20 cm) happened at  the late December and at lower depths gradually happened up to middle of January, which shows that maximum daily heat reaches to a specified depth later than the minimum ones.

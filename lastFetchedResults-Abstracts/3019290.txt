The main characteristic that hinders the application of state estimation methods in a distribution network is the limited amount of available data in real time. However, the need for automating and controlling the operation requires the use of some equipment that incorporates measurement modules of network variables, the values of which are transmitted in real time for the System Operation Center. These variables, combined with data obtained off-line - that are treated as pseudomeasurement - allow the application of traditional algorithms of state estimation for a distribution system. The main objective of this paper consists of showing how such a model can be developed to accomplish an estimate of the loads in a primary distribution network. These values can be used for many planning purposes like, for example, estimates of technical losses, using further load flow calculations.

Heterogeneous QoS video broadcast over wireless network is a challenging problem, where the demand for better video quality needs to be reconciled with different display size, channel condition and QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a framework for broadcasting scalable video to heterogeneous mobile users with diverse display devices and different channel conditions, which includes joint spatial-temporal layered video and Fountain coding optimization. First, we develop an elastic rate video adaptation method so as to serve mobile users with heterogeneous QoS requirements, which includes a hybrid temporal-spatial quality metric. Joint Fountain coding protection is introduced so as to provide adaptive and reliable video streams. Second, we use dynamic programming approach to obtain optimal video layer structure, so as to achieve maximum broadcasting utility. The objective is to achieve maximum overall receiving quality of the heterogeneous QoS users. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution.

Objective
ess the feasibility of a new multi-institutional program of direct observation and report what faculty observed and the feedback they provided.
s
ram of direct observation of real patient encounters was implemented in 3 pediatric residency programs using a structured clinical observation (SCO) form to document what was observed and the feedback given. Outcome variables included the number of observations made, the nature of the feedback provided, resident attitudes about direct observation before and after implementation, and the response of the faculty.
s
y-nine preceptors and 145 residents participated; 320 SCO forms were completed. Faculty provided feedback in 4 areas: content, process of the encounter, patient-centered attitudes and behaviors, and interpersonal skills. Feedback was 85% specific and 41% corrective. Corrective feedback was most frequent for physical examination skills. After program implementation, residents reported an increase in feedback and a decrease in discomfort with direct observation; in addition, they agreed that direct observation was a valuable component of their education. Participation rates among faculty were high.
sions
 observation using SCOs results in timely and specific feedback to residents about behaviors rarely observed in traditional precepting models. Resident competency in these clinical skill domains is critical for assessing, diagnosing, and managing patients. The SCO methodology is a feasible way to provide formative feedback to residents about their clinical skills.

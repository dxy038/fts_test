Bank-to-turn (BIT) missile coordinated autopilot system design principle is presented. The general design concept, design objective and requirement, design approach, and performance analysis are discussed. The closed loop system of the resulting control law is stable for a wide range of flight conditions with little changes in the location of the closed loop eigenvalues. The control loop frequency responses of six flight conditions during the terminal phase are presented to show the robustness of a feedback controller design. Simulations of the time responses of the tracking system are also presented to demonstrate tracking autopilot with good turn coordination.

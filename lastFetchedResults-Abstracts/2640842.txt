Background and Objective: The proportional practice protocol is an important issue for middle-aged women to start a health and energetic life style. Aerobic training is proposed as the first and best method of practice for all individuals. However, this protocol is not without damage, because this method like other methods can lead to some cellular disorders, especially muscle cell disorder. The purpose of this study was the effect of a period of aerobic training on the level of enzymes of cellular index damage in the middle-aged women. 

Materials and Methods: The method of this study was semi-experimental. 12 middle-aged women participated as volunteers in this study. The protocol of training consisted of 8 weeks and 3 sessions per week. Each session included 60 minutes of training with 50-70 percent of heart rate intensity. The dependent variables were creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as muscle cell damage indices that were measured in 3 periods of training (before training, the first session and after the last session). The data was analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferoni post hoc tests. 

Results: The results showed that the amount of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase significantly increased after a practice session. In addition, amount of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase significantly decreased after 24 sessions than the first session. Also, there was no significant difference between before practice session and after session 24.

Conclusion: According to these results, it is proposed that a period of aerobic training can decrease cellular damage indices in middle-aged women.

This review traces the underlying theory and practice of continuous powder blending to provide a foundation for its development. Apart from reviewing the experimental studies reported in literature, some of the monitoring techniques used in blending research with applications in continuous blending also are considered. This review attempts to identify the synergy that can be realized by studying powder behavior in batch blenders and applying similar techniques to continuous blenders. Predictive modeling in the design of continuous blenders is identified as a long-term objective in this growing body of knowledge.

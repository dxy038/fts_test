The objective of this paper is to introduce the Improved-Ant Colony Optimization in Virtual Circuit Networks. We discuss AntNet, an improved version of Ant Colony applied as a routing protocol. A new model is proposed that introduces the application of Ant Colony Optimization in the area of communication network. The proposed model is analyzed with the application of shortest path algorithm in Virtual Private Network. We also discuss the drawbacks of other optimization techniques that paved for the use of Ant Colony Optimization as an efficient optimization technique. In finding the optimal path, the proposed model is found to perform better than the OSPF.

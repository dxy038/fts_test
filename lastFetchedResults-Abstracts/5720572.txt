The objective of this paper is to define an integrated approach for offline verification and validation of the control logics to provide absolute solution by implementing the Ill-phase V&amp;V method in a manufacturing industry. The control logic plays vital role in an agile manufacturing system for proper functioning of the FMS. The effort to integrate the formal verification techniques with virtual commissioning is emerging, which is still not in a full fledged industrial usage, due to the isolated thinking of the user about formal verification techniques. Existing techniques like simulation has not been able to detect the hidden errors, which may propagate from one workcell to another workcell in a long run and create a complete breakdown in the manufacturing unit. These errors required to be carefully tested before the real time implementation. Control logics play a vital role to reduce the down-time and ramp-up time in a manufacturing industry. We need an integrated approach and techniques to support the consistent running of the production cycle. This paper explained about the positive aspects of manual and software based automated and virtual commissioning techniques to provide an applicable solution to the fast paced manufacturing industries.

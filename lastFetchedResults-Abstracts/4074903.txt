This paper proposes a Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) based excitation system for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) used in wind power generation. The excitation system is composed of the rotor-side converter, the grid-side converter, the dc chopper and the superconducting magnet. The superconducting magnet is connected with the dc side of the two converters, which can handle the active power transfer with the rotor of DFIG and the power grid independently. Utilizing the characteristic of high efficient energy storage and quick response of superconducting magnet, the system can be utilized to level the wind power fluctuation, alleviate the influence on power quality, and improve fault ride-through capability for the grid-connected wind farms. According to the system control objective, the system can contribute to the stability and reliability of the wind power grid-connected system. Using MATLAB SIMULINK, the model of the SMES based excitation system for DFIG is established, and the simulation tests are performed to evaluate the system performance.

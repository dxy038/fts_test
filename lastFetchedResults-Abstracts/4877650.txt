Summary form only given. The objective of the Air Force Wright LaboratoriesÂ´ battery program is to develop aviation battery systems which meet Air Force needs; this includes batteries for on-board aircraft, aircraft ground support equipment, life support/survival equipment, special operational forces equipment, and tactical weapons. The major thrust areas in the Wright Laboratories battery program are: more electric aircraft (MEA), retrofit with maintenance-free or reduced cost-of-ownership systems, aircraft emergency power (hydrazine replacement), life support/survival (high energy density, rechargeable batteries), sensors and detectors, special operational forces, tactical weapons and environmentally friendly batteries. This presentation gives an overview of programs supporting the above objective and thrusts. The efforts to be reviewed are developments in bipolar batteries, rechargeable lithium/lithium-ion batteries, polymer batteries and environmentally friendly batteries

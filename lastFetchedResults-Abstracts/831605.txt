Finite deformation plasticity formulation based on additive split of rate of deformation and hyperelasticity is presented. This approach is valid for finite elastic and plastic strains, while rendering the choice and numerical integration of objective stress rates superfluous as the results are automatically objective. For small elastic strains our method reduces to the classical hypoelastic-corotational formulation provided that the Dienes objective stress rate is employed, while in the absence of inelastic deformation it coincides with the hyper-elastic formulation. The validity of the model has been examined on four test problems and the numerical results were found to be in good agreement with either the exact solution or experimental data.

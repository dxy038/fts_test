This paper presents a computational homogenization scheme that is of particular interest for problems
formulated in curvilinear coordinates. The main goal of this contribution is to generalize the computational
homogenization scheme to a formulation of micro–macro transitions in curvilinear convective coordinates,
where different physical spaces are considered at the homogenized macro-continuum and at the locally
attached representative micro-structures. The deformation and the coordinate system of the micro-structure
are assumed to be coupled with the local deformation and the local coordinate system at a corresponding
point of the macro-continuum. For the consistent formulation of micro–macro transitions, the operations
scale-up and scale-down are introduced, considering the rotated representation of tensor variables at the
different physical reference frames of micro- and macro-structure. The second goal of this paper is to
use objective strain measures like the Green–Lagrange strain tensor for the solution of boundary value
problems on the micro- and macro-scale by providing the required transformations for the work-conjugate
stress, strain and tangent tensors into variables admissible for the considered micro–macro transitions and
satisfying the averaging theorem. Copyright q 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

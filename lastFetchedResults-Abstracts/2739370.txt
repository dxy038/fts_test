As photovoltaic energy continues to gain market penetration, thanks in part to substantial cost reductions on the solar modules, attention is shifting to the balance-of-system performance and costs. This paper proposes an approach to explore the design limits of a module-integrated inverter by means of the component-level multiobjective optimization. A two-stage inverter along with an active filter to eliminate double-frequency content of the dc-link current is proposed for the topology of module-integrated inverter, and three candidate topologies were taken into account for the dc-dc stage. Efficiency, volume, and reliability of the converters are taken as objective functions, and comprehensive component modeling is performed. Pareto frontiers reveal that the limits of the system are illustrated, which help the designer to pick the most suitable topology and design for the entire converter. Experimental results show the validity of the modeling and optimization technique.

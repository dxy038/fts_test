Purpose Since its inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, there has been skepticism
over the validity of delayed-onset posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Paucity of research on the correlates
and the clinical consequences of delayed-onset PTSD
have historically added to this skepticism. The objective of
this study was to address an important gap in the literature
by examining the prevalence, the correlates, and the clinical
consequences of delayed-onset PTSD using data from
a large epidemiological survey.
Methods Data were drawn from the Canadian Community
Health Survey-Canadian Forces Supplement (N = 8,441),
a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of mental health in
the Canadian Forces. Logistic regressions were used to
identify correlates of delayed onset. Cox regressions were
used to examine the impact of delayed onset on symptom
duration.
Results The prevalence of delayed-onset PTSD in this
Canadian population was less than 1%. Delayed-onset
cases accounted for 8.5% of all PTSD cases. Experiencing
trauma in early childhood, experiencing a repeated trauma,
and serving in the land troops were all associated with
greater likelihood of developing delayed-onset PTSD.
Delayed onset, after controlling for important sociodemographic,
military, and clinical variables, was associated
with greater symptom duration.
Conclusions The phenomenon of delayed-onset PTSD,
albeit uncommon, does exist. Certain trauma characteristics
may increase the risk for developing delayed-onset
PTSD. Delayed onset may be associated with more chronic
forms of this disorder.

In previous work, we have proposed a parallel hybrid genetic algorithm (PHGA) which can find high quality solution from the mathematical viewpoint for the multiple protein sequence alignment. We present new improvements to the PHGA. Local alignment information is added to the weighted sum-of-pairs objective function to achieve better alignment from the biological viewpoint. We also extend our method to run in parallel on a cluster of machines instead of a multi-processor machine to speed it up.

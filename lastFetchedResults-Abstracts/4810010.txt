The objective of this paper is to characterise the fuselage effects in the aeronautical satellite channel model using a deterministic electromagnetic (EM) simulation tool. The interest is focused in three kinds of aeronautical platforms: large commercial jets, business jets and rotorcrafts. In the EM simulation a realistic modelling of the platform have been considered in order to obtain accurate results for channel parameters such us impulse response, time channel variations for both narrow and broad band signals. Tools based on Method of Moments (MoM) have been used for the simulations.

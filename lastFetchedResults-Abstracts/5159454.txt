In the research on mobile sensor networks, coverage control is one of the most important challenges. For the sensor network constructed by random distribution, better network coverage can be achieved by topology adjustment utilizing mobility of sensor nodes. This paper investigates how to make use of sensor radius adjustment and the mobility of the sensor nodes to improve the sensor network coverage. A node distribution optimization scheme based on multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can quickly achieve node distribution optimization of a mobile sensor network, increase the effective coverage rate, reduce network redundant coverage and network energy consumption, extend network lifetime, and achieve global optimization of the deployment of the mobile sensor network.

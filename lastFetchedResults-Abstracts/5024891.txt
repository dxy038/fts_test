Noise evaluation of television systems takes either a subjective approach, in which the viewing conditions and observer expertise are important, or objectively using noise measuring sets based on sampling areas within the active regions where video information changes little. This is so that the noise components can be uniquely extracted without confusion. The display signal to noise ratio (DSNR) develops the original measurement methods into one which not only can give a single figure of merit, but also a set criteria to define the noise performance of a video source, or the whole TV chain. The important point about the method is that the luminance/chrominance coding/decoding is accommodated, and validity has been verified by objective means

Chemo-mechanical synthesis of (Cd, Zn)Se thin films with a variable composition has been brought about with an objective to study the deposition history and the growth kinetics, structural changes and the optical properties and is presented in this paper. The effect of various process parameters (deposition time and temperature, concentration of the species, speed of the substrate rotation, pH, etc.) on the growth and quality of the films is studied experimentally. At the first insight, mechanistic interpretation of the reaction mechanism is given on the basis of the influence of the process parameters on the film growth, compositional, structural, microscopic and optical characteristics of Cd1−xZnxSe thin films. The films are crystalline over the whole range studied with a predominant wurtzite structure for 0≤x<0.2 and a zinc blende structure (solid solution) for 0.7<x≤1. The film compositions in the middle of the range (0.2≤x<0.7) include both the cubic and the hexagonal structures. The crystal size determined from the XRD and SEM micrographs, is observed to decrease with increasing x (up to x=0.5). The optical gap estimation showed a non-linear increase in the band gap with increasing Zn content in the film.

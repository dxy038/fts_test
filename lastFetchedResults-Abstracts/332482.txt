Objective
To assess the incidence of endodontic inter-appointment emergency (EIE) in a dental teaching hospital in China, and to correlate its occurrence with preoperative and treatment parameters.
Methods

Three thousand six hundred and ninety six cases were collected at root canal treatment appointments on demographics, presenting symptoms, treatment procedures and periradicular status. The operators consisted of faculty, undergraduate students and advanced trainees. Root canals were conventionally instrumented and then medicated. No systemic medication was prescribed. In cases EIE developed between appointments, an emergency visit was arranged and active treatment was carried out. The data of EIE cases were statistically analyzed using the chi-square test and a multiple logistic regression model.
Results

The overall incidence of EIE was 5%, which rate was 5.5% in females and 4.3% in males. Analyses of the potential factors revealed that patient age, tooth location, preoperative percussion pain and pulp status were the most important independent variables.
Conclusion

EIE was significantly associated with some host factors (patient age, tooth location) and presenting factors (preoperative percussion pain, pulp status).

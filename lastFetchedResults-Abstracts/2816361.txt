The Programmable Logic Control (PLC) is a small device controller, which has been used to replace the large-size mechanical relay switches and timers in the traditional control panels. The main objective of this study is to design a low-cost Operation System (OS) for a Mini-PLC based on Microcontroller ATxmega256A3U-AU by using C language to develop the OS and visual basic to design a ladder diagram editor compiler. The obtained results showed that the CPU harmonized with other Input/output digital and analog modules via protocol Modbus RTU. The CPU unit can be connected to more than one Model (Input/output Digital Analog). In addition, the model is the ideal solution for providing a highly efficient mini-board that will help students to understand the principles of PLC.

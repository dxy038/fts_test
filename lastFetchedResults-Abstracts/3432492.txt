A digital distribution system has been constructed at the Indiana University cyclotron facility to link the control computer, an XDS Sigma 2, with the three stages of the accelerator and the control console. This system consists of a network of modular digital multiplexers attached to a common bidirectional data bus. When fully expanded, the system can transmit or receive 16-bit data words to or from 1024 different devices. In addition, a device may generate a computer interrupt by raising 1 of 256 available status bits. The multiplex system was implemented with XDS T series modules and thus is compatible with any DTL or TTL logic.

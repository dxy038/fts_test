Objective
tudy examined the expression pattern of the Deleted-in-colorectal-carcinoma (DCC) gene in developing rat tooth germs.
s
ps at 4, 7 and 10 d postpartum were used in this study. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescent localization were used to determine the level of DCC expression during tooth development.
s
was more than 2-fold higher level of DCC mRNA in the rat 2nd maxillary molar tooth germs on 10 d postpartum, which was the root stage, than in the rat 3rd maxillary molar tooth germ, which was at the cap/early bell development stage. In addition, the levels of DCC mRNA in the 2nd maxillary molar germs at 4, 7 and 10 d postpartum increased gradually according to tooth development. Interestingly, immunoreactivity against DCC was specifically detected in the differentiating ameloblasts. DCC was observed in the lateral and apical sides of the newly differentiating and secretory stage ameloblasts. Afterwards, DCC was localized only in the apical side of the maturation stage ameloblasts, not in the lateral side.
sion
 expressed in the differentiating ameloblasts, which suggests that this molecule plays a crucial role in amelogenesis.

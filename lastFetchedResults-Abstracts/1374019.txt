Artificial open channel structures are expensive infrastructures in terms of their materials, construction and maintenance. Design of a minimum cost channel section involves minimization of the sum of costs per unit length of the channel, subject to uniform flow condition in the channel. In this research, the objective function was expressed using the cost per unit length of the channel for lining, the depth-dependent unit volume earthwork cost, and the cost of water lost due to seepage and evaporation. A general resistance equation was used as an equality constraint. Optimal design of trapezoidal channel sections using genetic algorithm with depth, bottom width and side slope variables was accomplished. Two methods and several Models were evaluated including no restriction and restriction on normal depth, velocity of flow, side slope and top width. Restricted depth, velocity and side slope resulted in higher costs. However restricted top width resulted in lower costs comparing with other models. Also, another model  was employeed which used the Manning equation as an equality constraint.

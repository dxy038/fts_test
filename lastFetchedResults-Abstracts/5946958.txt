The objective of this work is to generate transmission curves to study the influence of material composition specificity of elemental composition its curves calculations. We used the Geant4 toolkit to generate the curves for primary broad beam geometry. The photon spectra used, on this work, were monoenergetic, from 60 kV up to 150 kV, and polienergetic, into the rage of 60 kVp up to 150 kVp. The materials studied were barite concrete, barite mortar and steel for the energies applied on diagnostic radiology. The results of this work showed that the spectra applied to diagnostic radiology can be sensitive of shielding composition for the some conditions and all material studied. As an example, considering monoenergetic beam showed higher variations of 25% for barite mortar when the larger shielding thicknesses were simulated.

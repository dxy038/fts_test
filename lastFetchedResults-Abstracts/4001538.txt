Outlines a project that forms part of a Teaching Company Scheme involving the simulation of manufacturing systems. Particular emphasis has been given to the process of developing a simulation model capable of evaluating the operational characteristics of a material handling system operated within a Just-in-Time (JIT) environment. The main objective is to identify operational problems specific to the material handling system which may become apparent due to changes in operational methods under JIT. The complex nature of operations and large amounts of initial data created a set of techniques which can be used in further simulation studies. The Teaching Company programme is between Unisys Ltd., Livingston, and Napier Polytechnic, Edinburgh. The article does not attempt to describe current operating conditions

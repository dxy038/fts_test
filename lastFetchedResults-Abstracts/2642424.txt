Surface-piercing propellers can be considered as an innovative for development of the high-speed marine vessels.  They have attracted the attention of designers in recent years due to their high efficiency at sea-surface conditions and their resistance to destructive phenomena of cavitation. Designers of these propellers need to reconsider some special parameters such as high maneuverability, vessel stability, higher speeds of propeller, which are of interest to owners and users. Duo to their importance role in propulsion system of high speed vessels, numerous experimental and numerical works had been done on the design of these propellers. The main objective of this research is to review the recent researches on hydrodynamics of surface piercing propellers, either theoretically or numerically, or empirically.

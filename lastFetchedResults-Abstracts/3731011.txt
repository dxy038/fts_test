A computer-aided method to compensate for the computational delay in the digital equivalent of continuous control systems is presented. The objective is to obtain the transfer function of the digital controller so that the performance of the equivalent digital control system is as close to that of the existing continuous system as possible. This is done by matching the frequency response of the digital control system to that of the existing system with a minimum weighted mean-square error. A formula for computing the parameters of the digital controller is obtained as a result. The design method is illustrated with an example

An investigation into the development of a fuzzy velocity controller for DC motor drives is presented. The controller development is based on a verbal performance objective which is intended to minimize the response time following a step change in load torque. This performance objective has been translated into separate fuzzy controllers for high and low inductance machines. The authors present the conceptual foundation for the fuzzy control, as well as details of the development of the fuzzy control implementation. Two classes of machines are identified, and simulation results are presented for both. A laboratory implementation has been developed for a two-horsepower, permanent-magnet machine using graphical programming on a 486 computer for the fuzzy control implementation. The initial results of this implementation show the effectiveness of the control

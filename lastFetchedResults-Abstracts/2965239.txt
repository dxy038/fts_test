The snow surfaces of the high plateaus of the East Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are used to determine multi-year drift in the sensitivity of the visible channel of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments on the polar-orbiting satellites NOAA-9, 10, and 11. Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) are empirically derived for the months of October-February (Antarctica) and April-August (Greenland) using a simplified atmospheric model. The BRDF of the snow surface should not change from year to year for near-nadir satellite views. Therefore, drift in normalized monthly averages of the derived BRDFs is interpreted as showing a change in channel sensitivity. Using this method, the authors show that the visible channel on NOAA-9 degraded linearly over the lifetime of the instrument (February 1985-0ctober 1988) by 5.2%/year. The detrended monthly average BRDFs have a standard deviation of 1%, indicating that the sensitivity changed at a constant rate. The drift of channel 1 on NOAA-10 (December 1986 August 1991) was nonlinear, but could be fitted with a fourth order polynomial. The visible channel on NOAA-11 was much noisier, with a detrended standard deviation of ~3%, indicating that this satellite experienced month-to-month sensitivity changes. Data processed for November 1988-February 1991 showed a linear increase in sensitivity of 0.5%/year

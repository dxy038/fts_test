Design and test approaches are described here for a novel antenna array deployed inside shelves of a smart cabinet that is used for real-time inventory of critical medical supplies using the HF RFID technology. In particular, a custom-built antenna array was designed to mitigate efficiently impact of multi-tag metal-content operational conditions caused by particular tagged product while providing nearly 100% tag reading rate. This objective was reached through a systematic study involving several subsequent steps, i.e. (1) full-wave numerical EM and circuit simulations, (2) quick prototyping using cardboard &#8220;substrates&#8221;, (3) prototyping of FR-4 boards, and (4) component-level and system-level tests.

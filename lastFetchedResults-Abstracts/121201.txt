Background&Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) is still one of the most common causes of death in the world. The incidence of TB, included extra pulmonary variant has been increasing in developed countries for two past decades and also has a high incidence and prevalence in underdeveloped countries. To determine the type of involved organ by extra pleuro-pulmonary TB in Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Babol, the present study was carried out.
Materials&Methods: Pathological reports of extra pleuro-pulmonary TB in Shahid Beheshti Hospital during performed 1990-2003 have been studied. Sex, age and involved organs were determined, and subsequently the appropriate table was set up.
Results: During 14 years, we diagnosed 82 cases of extra pleuro-pulmonary TB, 44 were men and 38 women, with age ranges of 8 months - 79 years. TB lymphadenitis was the most common form (45cases), followed by soft tissue 14 cases, bone 4, intestine 3, and 2 cases for endometrium, skin, testis and epididymis, and one case for ovary, tonsil, larynx, prostate, parotid gland, synovium, stomach, and kidney. The diagnosis was confirmed by presence of acid-fast bacillus in tissue section by Ziehl Neelsen staining and good response to anti TB treatment.
Conclusion: Although the TB lymphadenitis was the most common type, but in regions with high rate of TB, considering extra pleuro-pulmonary TB in unusual clinical setting is important and using appropriate diagnostic procedures and treatment if it is necessary.

The objective of this paper is to provide efficient and reliable numerical procedures for the evaluation of the Galerkin testing integrals with the use of the triangular-type wire-to-surface junction function. The 1/&#961; singular behavior of the testing integrands is removed before the evaluation, leading to two-dimensional integrations suited for its numerical implementation. Compact closed-form approximations are also given that allows to speed up the computations while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The proposed procedure guarantees the reliable application of the GalerkinÂ´s formulation to the analysis of arbitrary configurations of wires and surfaces, using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions for surfaces and its counterparts for wires and wire-to-surface junctions.

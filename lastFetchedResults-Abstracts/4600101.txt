This paper presents a numerical tool for evaluating the usability of a screen design based on its complexity measures. An objective performance (search time) and a subjective evaluation (opinion of the ease of search) were analyzed as a function of the complexity of the screen. In developing the tool, we defined four measures of complexity: size, local density, aliment, and grouping factors. Multiple regression analysis was used to model the relationship between the modified measures of complexity and search time. A subjective evaluation of the screen layout with respect to its ease of search was performed using the. pairwise comparison technique The results of the subjective evaluation are discussed in comparison with the numerical results of the multiple regression model

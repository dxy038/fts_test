Objective: This study aimed to detail the phenomenology and psychiatric co morbidities in patients with pathologic skin picking (PSP). Method: Forty five subjects (30% males) with PSP (mean± S.D. =33.2±10.9) were assessed. Subjects were assessed for psychiatric co morbidity using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to assess obsessive compulsive symptoms; the Dermatology quality of life index(DLQI) was utilized to evaluate the quality of life in patients; and clinical severity using Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) was employed for evaluating skin picking behavior. Results: The mean time after (±S.D.) the onset of PSP was 6.6±2.4years. Twenty eight (62.2%) individuals had a bimodal GHQ score higher than five which implied probable mental disorder, and twenty two (48.9%) of the individuals with PSP had significant obsessive compulsive disorder. The severity of impairment of quality of life status was increased with increment of mental disorder severity. Conclusion: PSP appears to be time consuming and frequently associated with psychiatric co morbidities. Considerations should be made on the relationship between psychiatric co morbidity and quality of life in PSP diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.

The energy distribution systems are naturally unbalanced, mainly due to unbalanced loads and different number of phases per circuit. The reconfiguration of distribution networks are usually done with a focus on reducing electrical losses and balancing loads, relieving the systems of overload conditions. The main of this work is to present a model that uses genetic algorithm to achieve the balancing in three-phase secondary distribution networks. The procedure used is based on load transfer between electrical network phases, aiming at a balance with a minimum set of actuation. Thus, the problem of balance can be characterized through a mono-objective focus, and its efficiency can be assessed through transformer balance and the consequent improvement in voltage drop along the main feeder.

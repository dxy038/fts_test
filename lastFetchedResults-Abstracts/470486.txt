Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of peripartum myocardial ischemia in Canada.
Study design
We identified the cohort of women who were admitted to Canadian hospitals for delivery between 1970 and 1998 to calculate the incidence rate and to evaluate potential risk factors.
Results
One hundred fourteen of 10,032,375 women delivered in Canadian hospitals between 1970 and 1998 had peripartum myocardial ischemia recorded as a discharge diagnosis. The overall crude incidence rate was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.93, 1.37) women with peripartum myocardial ischemia per 100,000 women delivering per year as noted in the Canadian Hospital Morbidity database. Rates did not increase over time but increased with maternal age. Identified risk factors were diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and chronic heart disease. The case fatality rate among women with the disease was 1.8%.
Conclusion
The incidence of peripartum myocardial ischemia did not increase between 1970 and 1998 in Canada, despite an aging cohort with more prevalent medical comorbidities. Maternal mortality from this event is lower than previously described.

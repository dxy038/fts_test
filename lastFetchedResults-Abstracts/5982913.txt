Based on dynamic programming method, the unified planning mathematical model of multi-voltage substation is established. The model takes the voltage levels as phases, the location and sizing of new stations as decision-making, the power supply scope as state, and the annual cost of multi-voltage levels overall investment as objective function. In the paper, for locating and sizing of 110 substations, dynamic and weighted Voronoi (V) diagram planning method is presented, and an algorithm based on Cellular Automata for creating V diagram is designed; for locating and sizing of 220 substations, differential coefficient evolutional algorithm based on GIS is adopted. Due to considering the effect of unusable plots, ensures the practicability of new substation locations. Practical examples show that: the proposed method can satisfy the requirements of substation planning well, and obtained the good efficiency.

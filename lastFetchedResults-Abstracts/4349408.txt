We transfer the frequency of an ultra-stable laser over a cascaded optical link comprising two compensated links of 150 km and a repeater station. Each link passes through two important nodes of the telecommunication network and includes 114 km of Internet fiber simultaneously carrying data traffic, through a dense wavelength division multiplexing scheme. The metrological signal is inserted in and extracted from the communication network using bidirectional optical add-drop multiplexers. The repeater station is working independently without any remote control. The phase noise on the two links is compensated with the usual round-trip technique. The 300-km multiplexed cascaded link shows an Allan deviation of 3&#215;10<sup>-15</sup> at one second and 7&#215;10<sup>-20</sup> at 20 hours. This work paves the way to a wide dissemination of ultra stable optical clock signals between distant laboratories via the Internet network.

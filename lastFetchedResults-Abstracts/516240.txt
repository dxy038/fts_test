Defining, definition, the way logicians see is very complicated. As Wittgenstein has mentioned providing a precise definition is not possible and the meaning of the word can only be put forth through its use in a framework, as is common, before opening any discussion, a definition is given for it so that a general view is formed and for this some explanations concerning the topic, objective and those subject matters needed in that science are given. This happens for theory and theory formation. However, since here we are dealing with definition itself, first we need to clarify the tools needed for this word based on theories and basic discussions and eventually through deducting from what has been said decide on a meaning for the word definition. This is also said to be true about the process of self theorizing. In order to reach this point, first and most importantly the framework in which theorizing is to take place that is science and scientific methodology should be elaborates on. Therefore, the first thing to do is to define scientific methodology.

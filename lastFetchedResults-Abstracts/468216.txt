Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery for the coverage of myelomeningocele in utero. Study Design: Women in the mid-second trimester of a pregnancy complicated by fetal myelomeningocele were offered an experimental procedure designed to prevent ongoing exposure of the spinal cord to the intrauterine environment. The procedure consisted of maternal laparotomy while the patient was under both general and epidural anesthesia, with exposure of the gravid uterus. Endoscopic ports were placed for camera and operating instruments. Amniotic fluid was removed and replaced with carbon dioxide. The fetus was then positioned and a maternal split-thickness skin graft was placed over the exposed spinal cord or neural elements. The skin graft and a covering of Surgicel Absorbable Hemostat were attached with fibrin glue prepared from autologous cryoprecipitate. Results: Four fetuses with open myelomeningocele underwent endoscopic coverage of the spinal lesion between 22 weeks 3 days and 24 weeks 3 days of gestation. One infant, delivered by planned cesarean section at 35 weeksâ€™ gestation after demonstration of fetal lung maturity, is almost 3 years old. A second infant was delivered by cesarean section at 28 weeks after preterm labor and is now almost 6 months old. Both survivors manifest only mild motor and somatosensory deficits. One fetus who was delivered 1 week after operation after development of amnionitis died in the delivery room of extreme prematurity. The final fetus died intraoperatively from abruptio placentae. Conclusion: Minimally invasive fetal surgery appears to constitute a feasible approach to nonlethal fetal malformations that result in progressive and disabling organ damage.

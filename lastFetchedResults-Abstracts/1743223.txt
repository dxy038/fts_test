A neonatal head phantom, comprising of an ellipsoidal geometry and including a circular aperture for simulating the fontanel was designed and fabricated, in order to allow an objective assessment of thermal rise in tissues during trans-cranial ultrasonic scanning of pre-term neonates. The precise position of a series of thermocouples was determined on the basis of finite-element analysis, which identified crucial target points for the thermal monitoring within the phantom geometry. Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP) was employed for the manufacture of the skull phantom, which was subsequently filled with dedicated brain-mimic material. A novel 3DP material combination was found to be able to mimic the acoustic properties of neonatal skull bone. Similarly, variations of a standard recipe for tissue mimic were examined, until one was found to mimic the brain of an infant. A specific strategy was successfully pursued to embed a thermocouple within the 3DP skull phantom during the manufacturing process. An in-process machine vision system was used to assess the correct position of the deposited thermocouple inside the fabricated skull phantom. An external silicone-made skin-like covering completed the phantom and was manufactured through a Direct Rapid Tooling (DRT) technique.

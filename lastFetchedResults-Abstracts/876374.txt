The objective of this note is to give an estimate for a positive perturbed semigroup in terms of
the free one. Here we consider perturbation by a potential and the estimate is given by a pointwise
Hölder inequality. As a consequence it is shown that ultracontractivity and Gaussian upper bounds
are preserved by such perturbations.

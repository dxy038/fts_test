Electric vehicles, whether powered by batteries, fuel cells, or petrol hybrids, have within them the energy source and power electronics capable of producing the AC electricity that powers our homes and offices. When bidirectional connections are added to allow this electricity to flow from cars to power lines and vice versa, this is referred to as "vehicle-to-grid" power, or V2G . The electric vehicles can then become mobile distributed generation resources, which can be valuable, particularly during peak hour. The Electric Power Research Institute predicts that power from electric-drive vehicles could reduce the global requirement for central station generation capacity by up to 20 percent by the year 2050. The paper describes a power electronics system that can be used to provide the bidirectional power transfer capability of the charger. The proposed bidirectional power converter can also provide reactive power and voltage support which theoretically does not make use of the energy of the energy storage in the EV.

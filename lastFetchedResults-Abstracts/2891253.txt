Degradation of air quality in cities is the result of a complex interaction between natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions. With the increase in urbanization and industrialization and due to poor control on emissions and little use of catalytic converters, a great amount of particulate and toxic gases are produced [1]. The objective of this paper is to monitor air pollution on roads and track vehicles which cause pollution over a specified limit. Increasing number of automobiles is a serious problem that has been around for a very long time. This paper proposes use of Internet of Things(IoT)[2] to address this problem. Here, combination of Wireless Sensor Network and Electrochemical Toxic Gas Sensors and the use of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging system to monitor car pollution records anytime anywhere.

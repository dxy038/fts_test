Nowadays, DGs are widely used in the power
systems to improve the overall conditions of the network.
Less environmental impact, high electric efficiency, low
variable maintenance cost, quick start up, low installation
cost and many other benefits, encourage the system
manager to utilize this type of generation in the network.
One of the most important issues about DG is allocation
size and place of DG in the network to achieve optimal
using of it. Strength Pareto as a multi-objective algorithm
optimizes DG size and place while DG cost and system
total power loss are optimization objectives. This
program gives several results which all of them are
optimal and designer could select one of them according
to his interest. This result is known as Pareto front. Pareto
front is compared with result of GA and its capability is
shown.

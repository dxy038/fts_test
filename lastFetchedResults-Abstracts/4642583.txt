The valuation of a company has moved from the concept of easily valuable and measurable tangible assets, to also consider intangible assets like intellectual capital. For this reason, the analysis of the actual state and evolution of the basic intellectual capital variables inside a company has become a relevant subject; besides, it is now considered a fundamental element in the processes of technological innovation and development, and it can be viewed as a competitive advantage in the human talent management in its innovation capability. This paper approaches an intellectual capital systemic model from the point of view of System Dynamics in order to back a set of strategic decisions towards the achievement of certain goals in an organization. The subsequent objective of this work, not included in this paper, is the application of the obtained model in two particular academic programs of a higher education institution, in order to value its intellectual capital.

Abstract
Objective
In healthcare system, it is necessary to have exact and accurate information in order to address health care needs and  requirements of society members as well as expectations of policy makers, planners and decision makers. The aim of this narrative review article was to explain the role of information systems in cerebral palsy management and identify the advantages and barriers to the development of cerebral palsy registry system. Data were collected using databases such as of Science Direct, PubMed, Proquest, Springer, and SID (Scientific Information Database). Overall, 65 sources were selected. One of the biggest challenges for children with physical and motor disabilities in rehabilitation center is access to a system, which provides a comprehensive data set reflecting all information on a patient’s care. Thus, data and information management in children with physical and motor disability such as cerebral palsy facilitates access to data and cerebral palsy data comparison as well as the monitoring incidence rate of cerebral palsy, enhancing health care quality; however, there are always numerous barriers to establish the system. One of the ways to overcome these problems is the establishment of a standard framework of minimum data sets and exact definition of its data components. Reliable standards in the use of applications as well as user-friendly software will ensure patients’ data extraction and registration.

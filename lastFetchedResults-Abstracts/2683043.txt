One of the most important problems for distribution companies is to find the
best locations for depots and to find proper routes for transportation vehicles to
optimize their supply network. This study intends to develop a model for the
problem of location-routing in post offices. So, a new bi-objective locationrouting
problem for locating town post office and routing parcels is defined.
This problem is modeled through the mixed-integer mathematical
programming. The aim of the proposed model is to select potential post offices
and to find optimal routes for transportation vehicles whiletime constraints are
taken into account. The proposed model is applied in a real case study including
eight main post area and 21 regional offices in Tehran, Iran. A goal
programming approach is proposed to solve this bi-objective optimization
model. An optimization Software is used to code and solve the associated
mathematical model. Some required parameters of the model such as demands
are estimated using Geographical Information System (GIS) and simulation
methods. The results of proposed model including the objective functions,
decision variables, and proposed routing of vehicles have been compared with
the existing practical solutions. Sensitivity analysis on main parameters of the
proposed models is accomplished and the results are analyzed. This comparison
illustrates the efficacy and applicability of our proposed approach.

Objective: Umbilical cord blood is an effective alternative to bone marrow as a source of hematopoietic stem cells in transplantation. However, the amount of donor blood and the cell content that are collected may be insufficient for engraftment in some adult recipients. This study identifies obstetric factors that affect retrievable placental cord blood volume. Study design: A retrospective analysis of factors that were obtained by direct observation or medical record review that were related to harvested cord blood volume was conducted; the analysis involved 9205 deliveries from mothers who donated placental cord blood through the obstetric services of two New York City hospitals between 1993 and 1999. Results: Obstetric factors that influenced significantly the total volume of blood that was collected were route of delivery, induction of labor, presence of a nuchal cord, infant birth weight, multiple births, placental weight, and duration of labor. The length of the umbilical cord from the venipuncture site and the length of time to cord blood collection also affected the volume that was retrieved. Maternal ethnicity was associated with cord blood yield; Caucasian mothers provided larger quantities than either African American or Asian mothers. Conclusion: Our results confirm that the volume of residual placental cord blood that is collected for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is influenced by several factors, the presence of which predict the likelihood of an adequate collection. Collected volumes can be improved when a longer length of the cord is left with the placenta and when there is a shorter time between the delivery of the placenta and the collection.

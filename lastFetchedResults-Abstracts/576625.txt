Background: Exercise test is a non-invasive method to assess the cardiovascular situation. 
The results of exercise test alone cannot determine the presence or absence of coronary artery diseases and for definite diagnosis the application of angiography is necessary. 
Objective: To investigate the results of coronary artery angiography in persons with positive exercise test. 
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed on 200 clients with chest pain who underwent exercise test at Imam Sajjad Hospital in Ramsar during 2009-2010. Study population was selected based on simple sampling and data were collected through interview and observation. Data were further analyzed using chi-square and t-independent tests.  
Findings: Of 200 clients participated in the study, 49 (24.5%) had positive exercise test, 122 with negative exercise test (66%), and 19 (9.5%) needed further evaluation. Among those with positive exercise test, 29 had positive angiography indicating a real-positive exercise test of 59.2% and a false-positive figure equal to 28.56%. There was a significant relationship between the positive exercise test and both BMI and sex (P < 0.05 , P < 0.04).
Conclusion: It seems that the application of exercise test to be a suitable screening tool especially in people with chest pain. However, caution must be taken when interpreting the result of an exercise test for a patient.

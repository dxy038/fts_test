Directing at the complexity of design of articulated dump truck steering-system, there are a lot of fuzzy uncertainties, so using the multi-objective fuzzy optimization theory to optimize the design of the steering-system. According to the geometry model of steering-system, taking the minimum of oil cylinder itinerary difference and the average that the power system consumed as objective function, it established the fuzzy optimal mathematical model of steering-system and done the work with TL345J articulated dump hydraulic steering - system as an example. The results showed that after multi-objective fuzzy optimization, output power and oil cylinder itinerary difference were down 12.1% and 46.24% compared original institutions respectively, proving the feasibility and correctness of this method. It has important theoretic value and practical engineering significance.

Abstract
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid, the need for health, water, food and other critical needs introduced has individual aspects. Also since man is a social person, the need for security is one of the basic human needs that deserve consideration in all disaster management planning. Thus, in this paper, hospitals as an institution providing medical services, food warehouses for meeting critical needs and police centers for securing the area in disaster have been considered. The backup warehouses considered to improve the reliability in disaster management in the model. The Mentioned problem has been modeled as non-linear and two-objective for which first linearization and then the epsilon constraint method is used. Also, a case study on the earthquake disaster in 1st district of Tehran has been studied by using the lagrangian relaxation method, which the results show that the optimal location of the facility and consideration of appropriate transfer points can be a help to decision makers in the area of disaster management and increasing services in time of disaster.

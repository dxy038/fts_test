The most important indicator of dynamic optimization of system design in open cycle engines is known, minimize of the maximum amount of start transient regime parameters. How decreasing the maximum amount of transient regime parameters; that is one of the most important factors in defect of this kind of Engines, is the main objective of this paper.
The procedure is based on two different simulation models; the software program C++ and Matlab Simulink. By regard to considered Engine condition; at first we present important factors in decreasing of maximum amount of transient regime parameters, and then will show their effects by comparing of simulation prediction and hot test results. Finally, results of engine hot test are compared with model that shows acceptable accuracy of simulator code.

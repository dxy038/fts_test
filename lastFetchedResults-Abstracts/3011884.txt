Sandia´s Umbra modular simulation framework was designed to enable the modeling of robots for manufacturing, military, and security system concept evaluation. Umbra generalizes data-flow-based simulation to enable modeling of heterogeneous interaction phenomena via a multiple worlds abstraction. This and other features make Umbra particularly suitable for developing simulation federates. Umbra´s HLA interface library utilizes DMSO´s HLA Run Time Infrastructure 1.3-Next Generation (RTI 1.3-NG) software library to federate Umbra-based models into HLA environments. Examples draw on a first application that provides component technologies for the US Army JPSD´s Joint Virtual Battlespace (JVB) simulation environment for Objective Force concept analysis.

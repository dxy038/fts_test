This paper presents a viability study of the use of cementitious renderings with incorporation of very fine recycled aggregates with the intention of improving their performance. An experimental programme was therefore designed with a series of tests being performed with the objective of characterizing the behaviour of such renderings at several levels: mechanical strength, water-related behaviour, durability and other properties. Even though several studies report using various materials as filler in mortars, glass has seldom been studied in that role. The results were very positive, with most properties improving with the incorporation of up to 20% of fine glass aggregate.

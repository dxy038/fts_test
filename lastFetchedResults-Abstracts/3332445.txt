This paper is to develop a robust guidance and control (G&amp;C) system and corresponding real-time algorithms for ADEPT (Adaptable Deployable Entry Placement Technology) planetary entry vehicle for Mars aerocapture mission with large payloads. The convex optimization based guidance approach is proposed that enables the real-time implementation of the algorithm and increases the predictability and robustness of the closed-loop system. The objective of this study is to utilize ADEPT aeroshell as a controllable G&amp;C effector through active bank angle and angle of attack modulation and convex optimization based control methods for planetary entry maneuvers. A Mars aerocapture case study is simulated to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed guidance concept.

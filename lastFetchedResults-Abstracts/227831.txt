To reduce the voltage distortion in a distribution network, parallel (shunt) harmonic
impedances (SHIs) can be strategically positioned in the network. However, to avoid the additional
cost of adding SHIs to the distribution network, the SHI function can be implemented as a
secondary function of convertors connecting loads or generators to the mains. A control strategy
for a single-phase bidirectional full-bridge AC–DC convertor is proposed. This control strategy
allows a fixed resistive impedance to be programmed for harmonics, independent of the direction of
the fundamental power flow. Hence, the bidirectional rectifier obtained behaves, as a secondary
function, like a resistive SHI, providing damping for resonances and resulting in an overall
improvement of the voltage distortion in the distribution network. The theoretical results obtained
are verified by using an experimental test setup. The superior damping potential of the
experimental bidirectional rectifier with the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by a
comparison with experimental results previously obtained for ‘classical’ control schemes.

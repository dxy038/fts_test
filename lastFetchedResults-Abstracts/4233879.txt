A study is made of the control algorithms for the transmission of time-critical messages. Each message comprises packets with unit data length. The objective is to minimize the maximum tardiness of the messages. Optimal algorithms are presented for communication nets with in-tree or out-tree structures. A heuristic algorithm is presented for more general hierarchical communication nets

The objective of this paper is to present major challenges and a framework for modeling and managing context-aware policy-driven Cyber Infrastructure-Based Systems (CIBS). With the growing reliance on Cyber technology providing solutions for a broad range of CIBS applications, comes the high assurance challenges in terms of reliability, trustworthiness and vulnerabilities. The paper proposes a development framework to allow dynamic reconfigurability of CIBS components under various contexts to achieve a desired degree of assurance.

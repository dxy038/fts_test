The objective is to determine the feasibility of placing a fuel cell on a medium size ocean going research vessel. The proposed system will be used as an electric generator with the capacity to supply power to equipment and also as a propulsion system for all speeds. Different fuel cell types have been considered, along with a variety of conventional and alternative fuels. Two fuel cell systems were found to be optimal considering the size and weight constraints of a medium sized vessel. A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) would be the smallest and probably the cheapest system at the current time. However this type of cell currently produces only low quality heat as a byproduct due to its low temperature operation (80 to 100&#176;C). If high quality heat in the form of steam is required, a solid oxide fuel cell would be the best choice. This type of cell is roughly twice as large as a PEMFC system, but operates at a higher temperature (800 to 1000&#176;C) and can therefore deliver high temperature steam. The best fuel to use was found to be diesel, mainly due to safety and availability issues. However, a fuel processor system that has the ability to run on several types of fuel is recommended so that a variety of fuels could be used if necessary.

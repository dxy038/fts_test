Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict the presence of metastasis in nonsentinel lymph nodes (SLN) when the SLN is positive.

Methods: A prospective database was analyzed and included patients who underwent SLN biopsy for invasive breast cancer from July 1997 to August 2000 (n = 442). One hundred (22.6%) patients had one or more positive SLNs, and were analyzed to determine factors that predicted additional positive axillary nodes.

Results: Of the 100 patients with a positive SLN, 40 patients (40%) had additional metastasis in non-SLNs. The only significant variables that predicted non-SLN metastasis were tumor lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.004), extranodal extension (P <0.001), and increasing size of the metastasis within the SLN (P = 0.011). In analyzing just those patients who had lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, and a SLN metastasis >2mm, 92% were found to have additional positive nodes.

Conclusions: In patients with invasive breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node, lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, and increasing size of the metastasis all significantly increase the frequency of additional positive nodes.

The objective of the present study is to build a. chemical sensor utilizing the features of SAW devices. We developed the fine casting method (which was named as &amp;ldquo;droplet-surface casting method&amp;rdquo;), and deposited several kinds of adsorption films on a SAW device with a multi-channel structure. The device was ST cut quartz 90 MHz SAW resonator chips, each of which has two resonators on a substrate. We constructed a four channel odor sensing system that has one reference channel and three sensing channels using two chips of the device, and measured the response pattern of organic solvents which have same carbon number and different atomic group. We compared SAW sensors with quartz crystal microbalance ones, in terms of chemical sensor sensitivity due to using the mass loading effect

Cross-brace units constructed of 10 different softwoods and nine different hardwoods were exposed on a test fence in Wisconsin for up to 22 years. Sapwood was included for all species and heartwood for some. The objective of this study was to determine the above-ground longevity of these woods against decay. The wood was classified into above-ground decay resistance groups. The longevity spans apply only to structural components similar in cross-sectional size to the test units used in this study. Millwork and fencing components may fit into this category. Woods estimated to last more than 20 years above ground, and thus classified as most resistant, included the heartwood of Douglas-fir, western white pine, redwood, Eucalyptus sp., red and white oak, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and the sapwood of redwood, white oak, and red oak. No woods fell into the nonresistant class (  7 years expected average life). The remaining woods were classified moderately resistant or resistant based upon service lives of 8 to 13 and 14 to 19 years, respectively.

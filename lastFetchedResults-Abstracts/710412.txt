Study Objective: To evaluate the use of a minimally invasive global endometrial ablation technique in the management of life-threatening bleeding unresponsive to hormonal treatment.
Results: Immediate cessation of bleeding with recovery of normal hematologic profile.
Conclusions: Endometrial ablation by global balloon ablation may be considered an alternative to hysterectomy in life-threatening hemorrhage in the adolescent patient who is unresponsive to hormonal therapy.

In this work, a new approach to natural-language chunking using an evolutionary model is proposed. This uses previously captured training information to guide the evolution of the model. In addition, a multi-objective optimization strategy is used to produce the best solutions based on the internal and the external quality of chunking. Experiments and the main results obtained using the model and state-of-the-art approaches are discussed.

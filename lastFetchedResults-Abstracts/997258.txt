The present study describes the development of a quantitative miniaturized single microparticle immunoassay. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of a miniature heterogeneous immunoassay on a single microparticle in respect to assay kinetics, volume, and sensitivity, binding capacity of microparticles and sensitivity using europium(III) nanoparticle labels. The performance of the single microparticle assay of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was investigated using different-sized microparticles (60–920 μm in diameter) and microtiter well as a solid-phase. Equilibration time of the assay was shown to be dependent in a linear manner on surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. larger surface-to-volume translated to a faster reaction. However, no correlation between PSA binding capacity and equilibration time was observed in these kinetic studies. Only moderate improvement in assay kinetics was found when PSA binding capacity was increased on a microparticle. Using europium(III) nanoparticle labels, 107 nm in diameter, coated with streptavidin a detection sensitivity of 30 ng l−1 (0.1 amol) was achieved in 1 μl total assay volume per microparticle. This was 50-fold higher compared to the same assay performed with intrinsically fluorescent europium(III) labels.

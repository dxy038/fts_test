In battery systems, various types of voltage equalizers are applied to balance the cell voltages. These established equalizers have some issues which are complexity of the circuit topology, power consumption, and inevitable difference caused in the production steps. In this paper, a novel cell voltage equalizer for series-connected EDLCsÂ´ (Electric Double Layer Capacitor) energy storage system is proposed. The proposed equalizer is composed of bidirectional switches added to the series-connected EDLCs. In principle, the proposed equalizer completely balances the cell voltages of the EDLCs. The performance of the equalizer was confirmed with MATLAB/Simulink simulation and circuit experiments.

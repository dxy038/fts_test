This paper presents an intelligent object manipulation framework for industrial tasks, which integrates a sensor-rich multi-fingered robot hand, an industrial robot manipulator, a conveyor belt and employs machine learning algorithms. The framework software architecture is implemented using a Windows 7 operating system with RTX real-time extension for synchronous handling of peripheral devices. The framework uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) image processing algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm and 3D point cloud techniques for intelligent object recognition based on RGB camera and laser rangefinder information from the robot hand end effector. The objective is automated manipulation of objects with different shapes and poses with minimum programming effort applied by a user.

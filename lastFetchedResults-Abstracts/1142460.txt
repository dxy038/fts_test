The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of the steam agglomeration process variables on the characteristics of cocoa beverage powders. A pilot scale agglomerator was used in the tests. For the cocoa beverage powder formulated with granulated sugar, most common commercial product, the increase in solids feed rate (400–700 g/min) led to a decrease in the mean particle diameter (400 g/min – 564.70 μm, 700 g/min – 438.40 μm) and an increase in the dryer rotation (12–52 rpm) led to an increase in the product moisture (12 rpm – 1.52% w.b., 52 rpm – 1.88% w.b.). The changing from 1.0 × 102 to 1.8 × 102 kPa of the vapor pressure resulted in an increase in moisture of the cocoa beverage powder (1.0 × 102 kPa – 1.46% w.b., 1.8 × 102 kPa – 1.94% w.b.) and the intensification of the yellow color of the product (1.0 × 102 kPa – 14.51, 1.8 × 102 kPa – 15.17).

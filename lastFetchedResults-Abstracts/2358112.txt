Objective
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a cliniconeuroradiological
disease entity, which is represented by characteristic
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of subcortical/cortical
hyperintensity in T2-weighted sequences. It is more often seen in parietaloccipital
lobes, and is accompanied by clinical neurological changes. PRES is
a rare central nervous system (CNS) complication in patients with childhood
hematologic-oncologic disese and shows very different neurological symptoms
between patients, ranging from numbness of extremities to generalized seizure.
In this article, we will review PRES presentation in hematologic-oncologic
patients. Then, we will present our patient, a 7-year-old boy with Evans syndrome
on treatment with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone,
with seizure episodes and MRI finding in favour of PRES.

In wireless sensor networks design, nodes are dispersed in the environment with high density. Therefore, topology control is one of the mechanisms designers employ to monitor and reduce power consumption in these networks. Since topology control may increase the end-to-end delay, one of the factors that should be considered in topology control algorithms is delay constraint. Existing works in this field mostly have utilized hop count criterion for delay computation. But considering only the hop count is not a proper criterion for delay measurement because delay in each node is dependent on several things such as, propagation delay, transmission delay and processing delay. Assuming the packet size and processing time of each packet is constant, the end-to-end delay not only depends on hop count but also on propagation delay. In this paper, we aim to define a precise benchmark to compute end-to-end delay in a WSN. We also introduce an algorithm capable of creating an energy efficient topology, taking into consideration an acceptable delay for a given application. The basis of the proposed method is that by partitioning the network, creating minimum spanning tree of energy consumption and imposing a delay constraint build a topology that meet our objective. Simulation results show that the proposed method not only is able to satisfy the delay constraint, but also offers reduced energy consumption compared to existing algorithms.

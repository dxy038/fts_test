The production of Mg-rich carbonates by Idiomarina bacteria at modern seawater salinities has been investigated. With this objective, four strains: Idiomarina abyssalis (strain ATCC BAA-312), Idiomarina baltica (strain DSM 15154), Idiomarina loihiensis (strains DSM 15497 and MAH1) were used. The strain I. loihiensis MAH1 is a new isolate, identified in the scope of this work. The four moderately halophilic strains precipitated struvite (NH4MgPO4 · 6H2O) crystals that appear encased by small Ca–Mg kutnahorite [CaMg(CO3)2] spheres and dumbbells, which are also regularly distributed in the bacterial colonies. The proportion of Ca–Mg kutnahorite produced by the bacteria assayed ranged from 50% to 20%, and I. abyssalis also produced monohydrocalcite. All precipitated minerals appeared to be related to the bacterial metabolism and, consequently, can be considered biologically induced. Amino acid metabolism resulted in a release of ammonia and CO2 that increase the pH and image concentration of the culture medium, creating an alkaline environment that favoured carbonate and struvite precipitation. This precipitation may be also related to heterogeneous nucleation on negatively charged points of biological structures. Because the nature of the organic matrix determines which ion is preferentially adsorbed and, consequently, which mineral phase is formed, the uniquely high content in odd-iso-branched fatty acids of the Idiomarina suggests that their particular membrane characteristics could induce Ca–Mg kutnahorite production. The Ca–Mg kutnahorite, a mineral with a dolomite-ordered structure, production at seawater salinities is noticeable. To date, such precipitation in laboratory cultures, has only been described in hypersaline conditions. It has also been the first time that biomineralization processes have been related to Idiomarina bacteria.

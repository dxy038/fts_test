Sensor observations made during carefully scheduled spacecraft (S/C) maneuvers, such as pitch, yaw, and roll maneuvers, can be used to support its on-board calibrators (OBC) or to perform independent sensor calibration and characterization. Using MODIS as an example, this paper illustrates applications of various S/C maneuvers, including lunar observations via S/C roll maneuvers to track MODIS reflective solar bands (RSB) radiometric stability, solar observations via S/C yaw maneuvers to map its on-board solar diffuser (SD) bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and to derive the SD screen vignetting function, and deep space observations via S/C pitch maneuvers to characterize its thermal emissive bands (TEB) response versus scan angle (RVS). Experiences and lessons learned from these applications will provide valuable information and reference for future sensor as well as spacecraft design.

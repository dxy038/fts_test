
Objective: In electrochemotherapy (ECT), there is an unpleasant sensation of muscle contraction when using a low frequency (1 Hz). Therefore, by increasing the pulse frequency
above the tetanic
frequency this painful
sensation can be reduced.  The
aim
of the

present
study
is
to
compare
the
treatment
efficiencies
of
low
and
high
frequency
ECT,
and

estimate
the effect
of its repeated sessions. 
Materials and Methods: We transplanted invasive ductal carcinoma into the flanks of female Balb/c mice. ECT was performed on the mice by the use of 8 pulses, 1000 v/
cm, of 100 Âµs duration at 1 Hz and 5 kHz repetition frequencies along with intra-tumoral
injections
of
bleomycin.
We
also
used
this
ECT
protocol
for
the
second
therapy

session
six days after tumour regrowth. The
effect
of treatment was measured by

calculating
the tumor volumes for 24 days following treatment. Statistical analysis was

performed
with
ANOVA.
Results: ECT at 1 Hz and 5 kHz pulse frequencies demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth, but after the first treatment the tumours began to regrow. Repetitive ECT sessions increased the curability of tumors up to 40% in the group treated by 1 Hz frequency
and 60% in the group treated with 5 kHz frequency.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the effects of 1 Hz and 5 kHz pulse repetition frequencies are comparable for inhibited tumour growth. Repetitive treatment can improve the effectiveness of ECT.

Harmony search (HS) algorithm is an evolutionary optimization algorithm developed in an analogy with an improvisation process where musicians try to polish their pitches to obtain a better harmony. In this paper, a modified HS (MHS) algorithm is adapted to multi-objective optimization using external archiving, ranking with crowding distance, and control parameters tuning based on Ricker map to solve a transformer design optimization (TDO) problem with two competing objectives. Simulations applied to a TDO problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective MHS algorithm. Results indicate that, compared with other multi-objective HS algorithm, in terms of output quality, the proposed MHS is able to find competitive solutions with a good tradeoff between the design objectives.

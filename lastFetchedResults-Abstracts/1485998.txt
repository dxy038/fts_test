Sixty young bulls of the Pirenaica breed, representative of the beef production and marketing system in northern Spain, were used. The carcass grading and weight, pH at 24 h post-mortem, and objective colour measurements (CIE L∗a∗b∗) were recorded on the Latissimus dorsi, Rectus abdominis and Longissimus dorsi in order to find indicators and predictors of beef colour stability (Longissimus dorsi metmyoglobin percentage on ageing for 3, 7 and 14 days) by means of early post-mortem measurements on the carcass.

r the conformation nor the degree of fattening, under the current EU beef carcass classification system, displayed any statistically significant relationship with colour stability of beef aged 3, 7 and 14 days. However, there was a relationship between the instrumental colour measured on the carcass and the colour stability of the beef. This relationship allowed prediction of colour stability (Longissimus dorsi MMb percentage) after 3, 7 and 14 days of ageing and 48 h blooming using colour coordinates measured on the carcass.

The effectiveness of the instruction on the methods of application of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles in the most popular Philippine language, the Filipino lingua franca was assessed. The manuscript: HACCP System and Guidelines for its Application, Annex to CAC/RCP 1–1969, Rev 3 (1997), FAO was translated and used. A matrix of specifications that assessed learning objectives within Bloom’s taxonomy for HACCP concepts was used for learning effectiveness evaluation. Individuals (n = 118) affiliated with food industries, food regulatory agencies and the academe participated in the test instruction. The typical test instruction participant was female, aged ⩽35 years old, who is employed with the food industry and with previous exposure to the HACCP concept through trainings and reading materials in the English language. The established improvement after Filipino instruction per learning objective was: application > knowledge > comprehension > analysis. The test instruction likewise enabled recipients to answer correctly paired consistency check questions pertaining to the same principle. The HACCP instruction in Filipino lingua franca using an interactive training mode was found effective.

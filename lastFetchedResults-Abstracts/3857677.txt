The objective of this paper is to present a remote laboratory in the context of power electronics education. New technologies and developments are compelling educators to deeply reflect on the traditional means of teaching. Modern curricula require new ways of conception and implementation of innovative pedagogical approaches. Often, these new pedagogical approaches require novel technological realizations. Although e-learning facilities are increasingly being used in engineering education, often, they are based on simulations and/or emulations of virtual laboratories. This paper presents a remote laboratory facility that allows the students to conduct real power electronics reconfigurable experiments through the Internet, promoting a more efficient learning through online industrial automation operation using the Internet and WWW services.

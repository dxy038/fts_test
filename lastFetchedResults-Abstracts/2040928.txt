Without a doubt Shahnameh is a universal text whose humane ethical system goes far beyond the race and geographic barriers.  Hence it is not surprising to see the rare capacity of Shahnameh to accommodate so many characters and to attribute world symbols and human character archetypes to them.  This research is based on the psychological and archetypal approach used by Carol S. Pearson and Hugh K. Marr in the theory of “Awakening the hero within” and Joseph Campbell’s theory in “The hero’s journey”.  Descriptive analytic method was used to prove the above theories in life stories of Seyavash and Kay khosrow in Shahnameh.  The result of this analysis seems to suggest that their lives begin with the archetype “orphan” becomes intrinsic in them despite the changes brought about in their characters and in their life condition, this archetype almost evolves symbolically with death in Siayvash.  The outward and objective expression of this evolutionary transformation and awakening is manifested in Kay Khosrow in the form of “sage” archetype which leads to his awakening.  Therefore the process of Ferdowsi’s characterization from Seyavash to Kay Khosrow  both from the aspect of cycle of life and death ( Plant god and martyre in Seyavash’s being to fertility goddess and life in Kay Khosrow’s being) and the quality of the here’s journey are complementary.

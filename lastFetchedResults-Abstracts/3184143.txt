A magneto rheological fluid (MR fluid) is a type of smart fluid in a carrier fluid, usually a type of oil. When subjected to a magnetic field, the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity, to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid. Importantly, the yield stress of the fluid when in its active (&#8220;on&#8221;) state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity. The upshot of which is that the fluidÂ´s ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet, which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications.MR fluid is different from a ferrofluid which has smaller particles. MR fluid particles are primarily on the micrometer-scale and are too dense for Brownian Motion to keep them suspended (in the lower density carrier fluid). Ferro fluid particles are primarily nanoparticles that are suspended by Brownian motion and generally will not settle under normal conditions. As a result, these two fluids have very different applications. The main objective of this project is to develop an artificial magneto rheological fluid by using the commonly available ingredients and analyzing its torque transmission capacity in a clutch system.

Objective(s): To study the views of medical students in Oroumieh Medical University on laboratory-based periodic health evaluation.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed all externs and interns in Oroumieh Medical University's school of medicine in the academic year 2004-2005. The subjects were asked about the frequency and indications of eighteen different check-up tests. A total knowledge score was also developed which showed the overall knowledge on these 18 tests.
Results: Nearly all (98.5%) of the students recognized the importance of education in this field, though only 24.5% said they had received any relevant training. The mean of the overall knowledge score was 5.5 (SD = 3.8), which was significantly higher in those who had received education (P=0.002). Conclusion: The mean knowledge score was rather low. The remarkable "unmet need" for education in this field also confirmed this considerable gap (24.5% vs 98.5%). Systematic education of medical students in appropriate administration of periodic, laboratory-based health exams (check-up) seems that it should be mandatory.

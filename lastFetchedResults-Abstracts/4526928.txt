The technologies as location-based service (LBS), traditional in-car GPS positioning, and bidirectional positioning of GPS and GSM were analyzed. Based on it, a traffic accident detection system based on multimode radio positioning was presented. The system was composed of alarming devices (mobile phone, in-car terminal), GSM public network, and back-end traffic control center. The detection mode, target audience, and structure of the system were presented. Finally, the detection performance was analyzed from three aspects of DR, AFAR, and MTD. Some schemes to promote detection performance of the system were put forward.

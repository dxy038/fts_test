Objective: Lumbar c urvature is an important factor in posture and bod y
mo vement that help us to understand low back pain problems. The aim
of thi s study was ev aluatio n of ext ernal load and trunk posture e ffec t on
lumbar c urva ture under static co nditio n.
Materials & Methods: This study is an interveruional, quasi-experimental
and case-co ntro l st udy. Ten women wi th non spec ific c hro nic low bac k
pain and ten match ed witho ut low back pain wome n were parti cipat ed in
th is study. We used simple and non random meth od for sampling. Two
clinometer!'> se nso rs we re used to eva]uate lumbar cu rvature . Six static task s
whi le holding three le vel s of load (0, 6, 12 Kg) and two lev els of trunk
posi tion (ne utral a nd 30 degree of fle xion ) wer e simul ated for subjects .
Dat a wer e ana lyzed by usin g Kolm ogroff-Smirnoff, ANOYA (Re pe ate d
Measurement) and independent T-test.
Results: Findings revealed lumbar lord osis in pati ent s with low back pain
does not ch ange to kyphosis while increas ing ext ernal load from Okg to 6kg
and 12kg in neutral trunk position (p<O.05) .
Conclusion: Dysfunction in pa ssive sys tem due to soft tissu e di sord er,
afra id of pain , cha nges trunk mu scle s recruitment and reducti on of
moment arm are likely reaso ns for increased lumbar lordosis in patients
with low back pain du ring load ing.

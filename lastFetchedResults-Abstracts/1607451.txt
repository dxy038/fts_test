Objective: To explore whether endemic fluorosis in Tibet is related to local factors. Method: An epidemiological survey of fluorosis was conducted in three districts in Tibet. The fluorine in the local environment of the three selected districts was studied in detail. Results: The possible fluorine sources examined indicated that only the brick-tea carried a high content of fluoride; water, other food materials, and fuel contents were insignificant. Conclusion: The endemic fluorosis that occurs in Tibet was essentially due to heavy consumption of foodstuffs prepared with brick-tea; however, the high altitude, harsh living conditions, and poor nutritional status aggravated the fluorosis.

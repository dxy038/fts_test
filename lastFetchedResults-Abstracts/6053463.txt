Though design change requirement (DCR) is part of life in a new fab construction given the difficulty for integrating all construction related vendors prior to fab construction and the fast change in technologies. In order to contain the quantity of DCR without scarifying the specification requirements of any systems during a new fab construction is getting more attention from fab management team. The objective of this article is to use the result of recent surveys in 8 inch and 12 inch wafer fab construction cases with statistically modeling to find the optimization of the DCR level for a fab construction project. This study looks into the causes of DCR and then provide possible solutions to minimize the occurrence of the DCR for the future fab construction project.

The objective was to evaluate the effect of the shear rate on red blood cell (RBC) aggregation with power Doppler ultrasound (PDU) and color Doppler flow (CDF) imaging. CDF was used to estimate the velocity profile and the shear rate across the tube. PDU was used to estimate the echogenicity of blood and the level of aggregation. The results show that PDU depends on the shear rate and flow rate. The power variations were measured at shear rates below 40 s<sup>-1</sup>, where RBC aggregation is maximum

This paper investigates the use of additional-objective for solving multi-objective optimization problems in dynamic environment. A number of authors proposed the use of additional-objective for maintaining diversity in static single-objective optimization task; in this paper the work is extended to dealing with the dynamic multi-objective optimization problems. Individual diversity is used as an additional-objective, and a new efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed. Experimental results clearly indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is gratifying.

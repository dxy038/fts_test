The objective of this paper is to propose an alternative methodology for normalization and aggregation in life cycle assessment (LCA). The proposed normalization approach is based on target on emission reduction and the aggregation approach is done through fuzzy inference system. A sensitivity analysis methodology is also presented in order to quantify the magnitude of change in index of total environmental improvement when quantity of a particular emission changes. Index of total environmental improvement of a product is computed by utilizing the proposed methodology in order to demonstrate its applicability. The results show that the methodology is simple and effective.

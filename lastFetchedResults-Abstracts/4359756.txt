The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the operational utility of using experimental long-range (LR) oceanic lightning data from the existing North American network. The LR lightning data are an extension of the existing North American Lightning Detection Network(NALDN)-a combination of the National Lightning Detection Network and the Canadian Lightning Detection Network. We examine an earlier evaluation of using LR lightning data to supplement satellite imagery. Thus, it can be shown that the value of this product is sufficient to (i) develop a need for routine access to the LR lightning data for the entire Gulf of Mexico (GOM) region since the NALDN is limited in areal extent, and (ii) expand the network to enhance data availability beyond the GOM region (over the Caribbean, Central America, and Southern America regions) with improved detection and location accuracy

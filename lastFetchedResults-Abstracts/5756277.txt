Currently, for wind generators connected to distribution network, voltage regulation systems are centralized. For a best integration of these distributed generators, the voltage regulation system must also be distributed. In this paper, a decentralization of voltage regulation using multi-agent system technique is proposed. Each agent has a local multi-objective optimization function and controls the voltage at its wind generator bus and participates in voltage regulation of pilot bus. This one represents the voltage variations in all buses. All agents are coordinating together and the coordination is cooperative. To manage this coordination, different interaction protocols are developed. To test this decentralized strategy, an experimental platform is performed. Multi-agent system can operate in a realtime environment that combines simulation system and network communication. Some experimental results are presented.

Social trust means more people in your life trust to each other. But the scope and radius of this trust do not have fixed form, therefore, we have two forms of trust: particular trust and universal trust. In this paper, after designing of the problem, the conceptual and theoretical dimensions of trust, radius and range of social trust were inquired. Then with considering the variables of objective participation, generalized trust, reciprocity, sense of social security and optimism that constitute conceptual and empirical models of this essay, the subject were explained. 18 years old and above residents of Kashan city make the population of this article. After selecting a sample of this population by survey and technique questionnaire, the data were collected and analyzed. The results of this study showed that the radius and range of social trust in Kashan are located at an intermediate level. There is significant relationship between the independent variables of conceptual model and dependent variables. The variables entered the equation can have a good predictability, showing that the scope and radius of trust can be developed as they are improved.

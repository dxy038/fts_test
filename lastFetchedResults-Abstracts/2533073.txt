Background and Objective: As a result of globally increasing trend in infertility, taking advantage of reproductive technology to deal with this issue is recommended. Taking the wellfounded claim about Vitamin E as a powerful antioxidant with a protective role in the body, this study was instigated to find the relationship between levels of vitamin E in Follicular fluid and morphology of oocyte along with embryo quality in IVF patients.

Materials and Methods: This crosssectional analytical study was carried out on oocytes and embryos obtained from 50 women with IVF admitted to Al Zahra Hospital of Rasht city. Patients underwent a similar ovulation stimulation protocol and then ten thousand units of hCG injected. After 36 hours, they underwent Follicle suction and mature oocytes were isolated for fertilization. Vitamin E level was measured and consequently the morphology of oocytes and the quality of embryo were evaluated by means of inverted optical microscopy.

Results: Of 50 treated IVF women, 583 oocytes and 275 embryos were examined. No significant relationship was observed between age, BMI, duration or cause of infertility and Vitamin E (P>0/05). At 0.51 mg/dl level of vitamin E, there were higher MII oocytes in comparison with other levels (p= 0.014). Despite the mean number of 2PN embryos at this level of vitamin E was more than other levels, this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.872).

Conclusion: The results prove the evidence that at 0.51mg/dl level of Vitamin E, oocyte morphology and embryo quality were significantly improved.

The objective of this work is to study the feasibility of applying cellulose nanofiber membrane prepared by electrospinning as affinity membrane. Cellulose acetate (CA) solution (0.16 g/ml) in a mixture solvent of acetone/DMF/trifluoroethylene (3:1:1) was electrospun into nonwoven fiber mesh with the fiber diameter ranging from 200 nm to 1 μm. The CA nanofiber mesh was heat treated under 208 °C for 1 h to improve structural integrity and mechanical strength, and then treated in 0.1 M NaOH solution in H2O/ethanol (4:1) for 24 h to obtain regenerated cellulose (RC) nanofiber mesh, which was used as a novel filtration membrane in this work. The RC nanofiber membrane was further surface functionalized with Cibacron Blue F3GA (CB), a general affinity dye ligand for separation of many biomolecules. The material's chemical and physical properties were studied by SEM, DSC and ATR-FTIR. Water filtration properties of the novel RC membrane were studied and compared with a commercial micro-filtration membrane. The CB derived RC nanofiber membrane has a CB content of 130 μmol/g, and capture capacity of 13 mg/g for bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 4 mg/g for bilirubin. The membrane showed reusability after regeneration with elution buffer. Dynamic adsorption of BSA on the nanofiber membrane was studied by breakthrough curve measurements.

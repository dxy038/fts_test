A multiple channel controller (MCC) is a controller which switches a given number of channels among a larger number of input/output devices and permits simultaneous access to as many devices as there are channels available. A simple queuing model for multiple channel controllers is created, and an approximate solution for this model is generated. The approximate solution is found, using simulation, to be very close for those cases examined to the actual behavior of the model. Further simulations indicate that the approximate solution of the model appears to be robust with respect to changes in some of the assumptions used in making the approximation. Trace data taken from a real system are analyzed and they confirm the predicted utility of MCC´s. The problem of optimal scheduling of MCC´s is briefly discussed. Alternative system configurations are compared with the objective of minimizing queuing delays.

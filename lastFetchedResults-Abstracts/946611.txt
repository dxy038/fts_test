The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of pollution on seabed bacterial diversity, structure and activity in the Port of Livorno. Samples of seabed sediments taken from five selected sites within the port were subjected to chemical analyses, enzymatic activity detection, bacterial count and biomolecular analysis. Five different statistics were used to correlate the level of contamination with the detected biological indicators. The results showed that the port is mainly contaminated by variable levels of petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals, which affect the structure and activity of the bacterial population. Irrespective of pollution levels, the bacterial diversity did not diverge significantly among the assessed sites and samples, and no dominance was observed. The type of impact of hydrocarbons and heavy metals was controversial, thus enforcing the supposition that the structure of the bacterial community is mainly driven by the levels of nutrients. The combined use of chemical and biological essays resulted in an in-depth observation and analysis of the existing links between pollution macro-indicators and biological response of seabed bacterial communities.

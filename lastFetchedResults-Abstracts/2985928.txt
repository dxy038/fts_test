This paper proposes a new integrated design method of structure-control combined system: such as several types of mechanical systems equipped with vibration control system in order to suppress the structural vibration. When the proposed method is applied to the design of a structure-control combined system, the closed loop pole placement of the reduced order model of the combined system is specified in advance as a design requirement. The proposed method is constructed from two steps: 1) output feedback control system is designed for the initial closed loop system in order to realize the specified closed loop pole placement; and 2) structural and vibration control system design parameters are simultaneously optimized to minimize the objective function subject to constraints on the pole placement. Scalar objective function is defined as a linear combination of several measures of the optimality of the structure design and the vibration control system design. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by the numerical example

This paper proposes a new three-phase power factor correction rectifier using current injection technique. This topology uses two active networks: an injection network composed by three bidirectional switches operating at low frequency and a current shaping network consisting of two high frequency switches and only one inductance. An input current total harmonic distortion (THD) of 8.6% and a high power factor were obtained at a load of 61 Ohms. Simulation results will consolidate the proposed circuit study.

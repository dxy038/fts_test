In this paper an optimization method for analog circuit sizing is proposed. The proposed method is an estimation based method, and our goal is to achieve analog circuit sizing with practical computational cost. In order to apply the stochastic process model, which is used to estimate the objective function, to practical problems of analog circuit sizing, we propose the method with a dynamic search window. The experimental result shows that the analog sizing of OPAMP was performed with 253 SPICE simulations and its CPU time was 9,430 seconds. This result illustrates the efficiency of our method

Distributed generation (DG) is predicted to play an important role in electric power system in the near future. The insertion of DG system into existing distribution network has great impact on real-time system operation and planning. It is widely accepted that micro turbine generation (MTG) systems are currently attracting lot of attention to meet customers need in the distributed power generation market In order to investigate the performance of microturbine generation systems their efficient modeling is required. This paper presents a dynamic model of a MTG system, suitable for grid connection/islanding operation. The presented model allows the bidirectional power flow between grid and MTG system. The components of the system are built from the dynamics of each part with their interconnections. The control strategies for both grid connected and intentional islanding operation mode of a DG system are also given.

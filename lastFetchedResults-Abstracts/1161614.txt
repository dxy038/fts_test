Based on earlier work, a renewal model for structural failures with subsequent systematic reconstruction is developed. It is shown that simple objective functions can be obtained by making use of some asymptotic results of renewal theory. Complete objective functions must include benefits and expected failure cost which both must be discounted appropriately. Some techniques in optimization for locally stationary and locally non-stationary failure models are developed. Those are illustrated at simple examples.

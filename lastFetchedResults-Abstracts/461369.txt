Background
The objective of this study was to understand better the status of and ways to improve dissemination of influenza and pneumococcal standing-order vaccination policies to at-risk adults in health care institutions.
Methods

A statewide sample of 5 different types of institutions serving at-risk elderly persons in North Carolina was surveyed. A 45-question telephone survey was administered to infection control nurses or facility directors at 267 (86% response rate) health care facilities involved in direct patient care.
Results

A majority of respondents reported that influenza (81%) and pneumococcal (59%) diseases were important to their facility, and 63% stated that the influenza vaccine was very effective versus 47% for pneumococcal. Except nursing homes, few facilities reported adoption of standing-order policies to vaccinate routinely the at-risk adults. Over 70% of respondents stated that their facilities might consider adopting standing-order policies for influenza and pneumococcal disease. A majority of respondents also supported a state law that requires such vaccines for high-risk patients unless contraindicated or the patient refuses.
Conclusions

Respondents across diverse health care institutions appear interested in adopting standing-order policies to increase influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates and are more likely to do so if provided with appropriate administrative and/or financial support for implementation.

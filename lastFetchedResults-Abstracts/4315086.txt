This paper presents a novel high frequency link inverter circuit topology based on the bipolar combined phase-shifted modulation to achieve high-power density, bidirectional power flow, high frequency isolated dc/ac power conversion with single power stage. The proposed dual secondary winding and dual power bridge high frequency link inverter consists of an inverter bridge, a high frequency converter bridge and a high frequency transformer with dual secondary winding. The switches in the first bridge can achieve ZVS and those in the second bridge can achieve ZCS with low voltage surge. To achieve good dynamic response, double closed-loop feedback with one cycle control scheme is applied. Theoretical analysis and experimental results referring to a laboratory prototype indicate that the proposed topology and the modulation scheme have the promising features.

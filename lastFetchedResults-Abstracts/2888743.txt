The objective is to design a frequency reconfigurable active antenna which involves the integration of active device such as FET with a passive structure. Here the dual port dual band antenna is independently designed and later connected to one port amplifier using matching network. The passive antenna serves as radiator, frequency selector as well as feedback network for the oscillator. First the two port, dual band antenna is simulated in CST. Then the S parameters of the antenna were substituted in ADS as two port item. Here annular slot antenna with shorted slots was selected as radiator which was designed to resonate at 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz respectively. The antenna was connected to the amplifier, the active antenna was then simulated and the simulated results were validated through measurement. When tested the oscillator was found to oscillate at 2.097 and 4.576 respectively.

Objective
To examine predictors of coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality in Aboriginal Australians.
Method

In 1988–89, a survey of Western Australian Aborigines (256 women, 258 men) aged 15–88 years documented diet, alcohol and smoking habits. Linkage to mortality and hospital admissions to the end of 2002 provided longitudinal data for modelling of coronary heart disease endpoints and all-cause mortality using Cox regression.
Results

Coronary heart disease risk increased with smoking (HR 2.62, 95% CI: 1.19, 5.75), consumption of processed meats > once/week (HR 2.21, 95% CI: 1.05, 4.63), eggs > twice/week (HR 2.59, 95% CI: 1.11, 6.04) and using spreads on bread (HR 3.14. 95% CI: 1.03, 9.61). All-cause mortality risk was lower with exercise > once/week (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26, 1.05), increased in ex-drinkers (HR 3.66, 95% CI: 1.08, 12.47), heavy drinkers (HR5.26, 95% CI: 1.46, 7.52) and with consumption of takeaway foods > nine times/month (HR 1.78, 95% CI 0.96, 3.29). Greater alcohol intake, smoking and adverse dietary choices clustered in 53% of men and 56% of women and increased risk of coronary heart disease (HR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.0) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.2).
Conclusion

Lifestyle in Aboriginal Australians predicts coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality. Clustering of adverse behaviours is common and increases risk of coronary heart disease and death.

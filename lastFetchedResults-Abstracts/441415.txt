Background. In off-pump coronary bypass grafting (CABG), invasiveness is reduced but technically perfect anastomosis is jeopardized by cardiac motion and the need to hurry to reduce the time of ischemia. Also, a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality is ungrafted circumflex coronary artery disease. We have devised a means of overcoming these shortcomings and performing multivessel CABG. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of our technique.
Methods. One hundred patients with severe triple-vessel disease underwent multivessel off-pump CABG. For cardiac stabilization, a combination of local pericardial stabilization sutures and lifting and rotating the heart by means of posterior pericardial sutures were used. For myocardial perfusion, a technique of retrograde coronary sinus perfusion by arterial blood from the ascending aorta was used.
Results. Each patient received an average of 3.8 grafts (range 3 to 5). Complications included conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in 1 patient and a perioperative myocardial infarction in the same patient. In all other patients we were able to perform a satisfactory grafting in all territories with no operative mortality. Rapid recovery allowed 95% of our patients to resume normal activity within 1 month. A predischarge graft angiogram in 35 patients showed 97.8% patency.
Conclusions. These results suggest that off-pump CABG with our techniques is effective and safe. Early clinical outcome and excellent patency rates suggest its more widespread use in selected cases.

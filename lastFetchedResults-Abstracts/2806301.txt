Video quality measurement is an important factor to establish the quality of video communication and processing systems, such as broadcasting and mobile television, since they need to monitor broadcasting quality to compute optimal parameters that ensure a satisfactory quality level. The objective video quality assessment is a quick and low cost alternative when compared with the subjective evaluations. This paper presents a novel objective video quality algorithm that combines temporal analysis and the perceptual weighting technique. The proposed algorithm was validated using the correlation between objective measurements and the subjective scores provided by the LIVE Video Quality Database, considering the following conditions: H.264 and MPEG-2 encoding and transmission of H.264 bit-streams over IP and wireless networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is a competitive alternative when compared with classical objective algorithms, such as MOVIE.

Numerous new broadband and multimedia applications have emerged in recent years, in which streaming video services are particularly of interest. Unlike data communication, streaming video requires a subjective measure of quality referred to as the Quality of Experience (QoE), but the subjective evaluation is very time consuming and complex. We are proposing an objective approach to provide mapping between QoE and Quality of Service (QoS), in which Video Quality Metric (VQM) is utilized to indicate QoE. We have analyzed the emulation results and derived a simple formula to estimate QoE from QoS parameters for streaming video under certain conditions. This method is non-intrusive and quick to use.

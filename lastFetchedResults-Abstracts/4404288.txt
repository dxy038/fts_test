Droop control is a common method used in power systems to share load between multiple sources. In a dc system, traditional droop control utilizes a linear relationship to determine the reference current for each source based on the changing bus voltage. This paper presents a method for finding a nonlinear droop relationship in order to optimize the source operation to meet a given objective. The method is implemented for an example dc microgrid system. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) results are presented.

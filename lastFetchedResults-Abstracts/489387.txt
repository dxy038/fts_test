BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Abdominal pregnancy is a rare event but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical presentation of abdominal pregnancy varies, and the diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion. Clinical history, physical examination and ultrasonographic features are all non-specific.
CASE: A 29-years-old woman, G1, presented with a history of 4 days of vaginal bleeding and treated as missed abortion. After medical treatment failure, we decided to do D&C (Dilation and Curettage) for termination of pregnancy. After evaluation of cervix under anesthesia, with suspicious of abnormal pregnancy, laparotomy was done. In laparotomy abdominal pregnancy was diagnosed. Fetus and placenta was removed from the cul-de-sac, and the patient remained well after the operation.
CONCLUSION: There are many pitfalls in diagnosing abdominal pregnancy by examination and ultrasound. Laparoscopy or laparotomy is required to make a definitive diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy. For abdominal pregnancy, surgical interventions are recommended.

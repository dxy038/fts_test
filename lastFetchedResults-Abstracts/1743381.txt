Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in children and adolescents; however, its etiology is still unknown, which hinders the existence of reliable, fast and inexpensive standard diagnostic methods. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for automatic diagnosis of the combined type of ADHD based on nonlinear signal processing of 24 h-long actigraphic registries. Since it relies on actigraphy measurements, it constitutes an inexpensive and non-invasive objective diagnostic method. Our results on real data reach 96.77% sensitivity and 84.38% specificity by means of multidimensional classifiers driven by combined features from different time intervals. Our analysis also reveals that, if features from a single time interval are used, the whole 24-h interval is the only one that yields classification figures with practical diagnostic capabilities. Overall, our figures overcome those obtained by actigraphy-based methods reported and are comparable with others based on more expensive (and not so convenient) adquisition methods.

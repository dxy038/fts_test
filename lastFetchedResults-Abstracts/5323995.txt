In global Web services selection, it involves to multi-objectives optimization and tradeoffs of diversified QoS criteria, therefore a suitable genetic algorithm is proposed to tackle the service selection problem. Since the QoS criteria are not always explicit and usually containing of fuzzy element, So this paper focuses on the relation between constraint satisfaction of fuzzy QoS criteria optimization and fitness evolution in multi-objective Web services selection and how to adjust the fuzzy QoS criteria of individual to fit for the evolution of population.

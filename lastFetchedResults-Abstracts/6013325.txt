Currently, using information technology more efficiently in connection with firm strategies is one way to achieve the objectives of cost containment and improved service. Management literature has established the strategy-structure-process-performance (SSPP) paradigm as a means to assess direction of the relationships and their interactions. The objective of this research is to expand on the established paradigm by testing the relationships within the context of logistics information technology processes. And this paper will evaluate the generalizability of the SSPP framework and improve understanding of information technologyÂ´s role in logistics.

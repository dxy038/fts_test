Electric distribution systems are becoming large and complex leading to higher system losses and poor voltage regulation. This has stressed the need for an efficient and effective distribution network. The main objective of this paper work is to determine optimal location for capacitor placement in radial distribution feeders to improve the voltage profile and reduce the energy loss. This problem of capacitor placement is solved using fuzzy approximate reasoning and sizing is solved using particle swarm optimization technique. Firstly, an efficient load flow solution for the radial feeder is obtained by a suitable algorithm. Voltage and real power loss index of distribution system nodes are modeled by fuzzy membership function. Then, a fuzzy inference system containing a set of heuristic rules is designed to determine candidate nodes suitable for capacitor placement in the distribution system. Capacitors are placed on the nodes with highest sensitivity index. Three test radial feeders are solved using the proposed development to illustrate the technique and results simulated from MATLAB.

Mobile agent application always consists of multiple agents cooperating with each other to achieve the overall goal. However the world perceived by mobile agent varies from site to site due to agent migration, which induces context-dependent coordination issues. The role-based context-dependent objective coordination model proposed in this paper adopts local programmable reactive tuple space at every mobile agent environment to address the context-dependent coordination problems. Additionally, role mechanism is adopted for access control to prevent unauthorized access. Type system is introduced to formalize this role mechanism. A sample application is discussed to illustrate the proposed mode.

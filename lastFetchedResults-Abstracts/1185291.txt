The geometrically non-linear free vibrations of thin isotropic and laminated rectangular composite plates with fully clamped edges have been successfully investigated in previous series of works using a theoretical model based on Hamiltonâ€™s principle and spectral analysis. The objective of this work is the extension of the above model to the case of clamped clamped simply supported simply supported rectangular plates, denoted by CCSSSSRP, in order to determine their fundamental non-linear mode shape, and associated amplitude-dependent resonant frequencies, and flexural stress distribution. Numerical data are given for both linear and non-linear analysis, for various plate aspect ratios and vibration amplitudes. Good agreement was found with previous published results.

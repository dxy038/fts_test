Objective: We hypothesized that mental arithmetic is a complex of sequential information processing. In order to test the hypothesis, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured during 3 mental tasks.
Methods: Fifteen normal human subjects performed the following tasks; (1) subjects added up every digit delivered successively on a computer display, (2) subjects counted the number of presented digits, or (3) subjects counted the number of meaningless patterns. Spatiotemporal differences between ERP waveforms under the 3 tasks were studied within the period of 1200 ms post-stimulus.
Results: During the adding task, N120–P180–N220 complex advanced in latency in the left frontal, central and parietal regions. P300 increased in amplitude in the frontal and temporal regions during adding and counting digits, which was specific to the digit presentation. A positive slow potential depended on the adding task and showed two spatiotemporal distributions; one was a widespread brain activity over the frontal, central, temporal and parietal regions observed within 400–820 ms, and another was a brain activity restricted to the frontal region lasting up to 1150 ms.
Conclusions: The results suggest that the early portion of ERPs reflects identification of physical attributes of stimuli and numeric meaning of digits, and that the positive slow potential reflects processes associated with calculation.

One of the new challenges in education is the call for the integration of ICT in teaching and learning. This paper reports on a research project on the development of Interactive multimedia learning systems (IMLS). The principle objective of this project is to create an additional learning tool that combines on-screen text, graphics, animations, audio and video in order to improve the learning process. It also considers the data from the research studies in this area concerning the key issues in designing an IMLS. Furthermore it includes the experience in developing bilingual interactive multimedia learning system for the IT-skills course.

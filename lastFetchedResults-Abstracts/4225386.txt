This work aims to present a device for the objective evaluation of video quality from the user perspective, in mass content distribution networks. This simple and cost-effective device with an integrated image sensor and an embedded processor intends to be network pervasive while minimizing the network overhead, allowing quality measurements over the network with greater control of the content distribution throughout the video chain, from content producers, distributors and to consumers.

Molecular subjects have an extending importance in biological investigations the first of which is nucleic acids extraction (DNA and RNA). Therefore, there is always a need for a rapid, safe and reasonable method for DNA extraction with a desirable quality and quantity. In order to minimize the extraction steps, several different methods have been reported. The results of recent studies demonstrated that the desirable extraction method should be selected based on its aim and function. The objective of this study was to compare the quality and quantity of obtained DNA from salting out and phenol–chloroform methods. Eighty sperm samples of the Holstein Cow were used in the study. After DNA extraction, the spectrophotometer and agarose gel methods were used in order to determine the quality and quantity of the extracted DNA. The average of the minimum square of quantity and quality of DNA was 813. 27±114.88 (ng/µl) and 1.86±0.013 in the salting out method and175.31±23.16 (ng/µl) and 1.57±0.022 in the phenol – chloroform method, respectively. The electrophoresis results showed that there was no fraction in DNA samples. This study clarified that the results of DNA extraction using the salting out method was more desirable than the phenol – chloroform method; therefore, it seems that the salting out method is more appropriate for DNA?extraction from sprem samples in molecular labs.

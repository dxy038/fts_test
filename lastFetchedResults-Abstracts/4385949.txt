In this letter, we investigate the robust transceiver design problem for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multiple-input-multiple-output underlay cognitive radio networks where the channel uncertainties are modeled by the worst-case model. Our objective is to maximize the sum harvested power at energy harvesting receivers while guaranteeing the required minimum mean-square-error at the secondary information-decoding (ID) receiver and the interference constraints at the primary receivers. We propose to alternatively optimize the transmit covariance matrix at secondary transmitter and the preprocessing matrix at secondary ID receiver. Simulation results have shown that the robust transceiver design has significant performance gain over the non-robust one.

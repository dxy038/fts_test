Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a single application software package which integrates the majority of business functions into a single system. Its implementation process is complex from both aspects of technology and also change management. In order to have a robust yet flexible requirement analysis along with providing the maximum level of user agreements and acceptance, incremental development of software is the best practice in which engages the user and stakeholders at maximum level. Conventional communication methods for user interaction and formal session cannot answer the aforesaid matters best, hence deployments of accepted technologies and methods for communication within the lifecycle of the ERP implementation is vital for the success of the project. The main objective of this paper is to embed knowledge management throughout the ERP implementation process and develop a framework with which implementation of ERP can be facilitated by a better knowledge extraction and repository and use of web based communicational techniques.

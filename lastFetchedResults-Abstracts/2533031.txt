Background and Objective: Pomegranate peel contains many compounds of glycosides, flavonoids and anthocyanins. Candida albicans is the commonest cause for oral fungal infections in individuals with immune system deficiency and people with diabetes. This study was an endeavor to illustrate the effects of pomegranate peel on some blood parameters including creatinine, urea, total protein, albumin, and liver enzymes AST, ALT and ALP in rats infected with Candida albicans.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 30 male Wistar rats were allocated to six groups of five. In the control group, the diabetic rats were contaminated by an infectious dose of fungus Candida albicans. Then, the rats were treated with dissolved extract of itraconazole in drinking water. The remaining four groups received pomegranate peel extract dissolved in drinking water at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg according to their body weight for 7 days 24 hours. The effectiveness of pomegranate peel extract was compared with itraconazole. Their weight was measured on days zero and seven.

Results: The results showed a significant increase in the plasma concentration of albumin and total protein levels than the control group (plt 0.01). Liver enzymes decreased in a dose dependent manner according to the concentration changes (plt 0.001).

Conclusion: The administration of pomegranate peel extract showed significant improvement in oral Candidiasis lesions and repair of mucosal tissue. However, the presence of flavonoids and alkaloids in Punicaceae plants has negative effect on biomedical parameters and lead to disorders in functioning of vital organs.

In this letter, we demonstrate an optimization problem of antenna placement of distributed multi-input multi- output (MIMO) radar. To evaluate the surveillance performance of the radar system, a coverage ratio is proposed as a criterion. Since the problem is of extremely huge computational complexity due to its complicated objective function and high dimensionality, we propose a solution that contains two parts: 1) a low- complexity method to simplify the objective function; 2) a placement algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to deal with the challenge of high dimensionality. We also analyse the computational complexity of our solution. Simulation results verify the validity and advantage in computational complexity of our solution. Our contributions include a novel optimization placement model of distributed MIMO radar and a computational efficient solution to establish the optimal positions of antennas.

A novel constraint-graph algorithm for the optimization of yield is presented. This algorithm improves the yield of a layout by carefully spacing objects to reduce the probability of faults due to spot defects. White space between objects is removed and spacing in tightly packed areas of the layout is increased. The computationally expensive problem of optimizing yield is transformed into a network flow problem, which can be solved via known efficient algorithms. Yield can be improved either without changing the layout area, or if necessary by increasing the layout area to maximize the number of good chips per wafer. Our method can in theory provide the best possible yield achievable without modifying the layout topology. The method is able to handle a general class of convex objective functions, and can therefore optimize not only yield, but other circuit performance functions such as wire-length, cross-talk and power

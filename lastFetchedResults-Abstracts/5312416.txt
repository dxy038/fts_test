In this paper, a prototype of a multifunctional controlled three-phase voltage-source bidirectional zero voltage soft-switching PWM converter with three auxiliary active resonant commutated snubber link (ARCSL) is presented for battery and/or electric double layer capacitor energy storage system (BESS) and active power filter system (APFS). The operating principle of this active resonant snubber-assisted soft-switching converter circuit and multi-functional digital control-based converter system including active rectifier and inverter operation modes are described. The effectiveness of a soft-switching bidirectional converter system is proved on the basis of simulation analysis

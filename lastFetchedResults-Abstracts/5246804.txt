In this paper, we propose an algorithm for face recognition. The new feature representation technique is called bidirectional 2-dimensional orthogonalized fisher discriminant analysis (B2D-OFD). B2D-OFD directly extracts image scatter matrix from 2D image and uses LDA for recognition. And then it eliminates dependence among feature vectors by orthogonalizing. By simultaneously considering both the row and column direction, we greatly reduce the size of feature matrix and get similar recognition rate. As a result of ORL database, the average recognition rate of B2D- OFD is 96.1%, while the average recognition rate of (2D)<sup>2</sup>FLD is 95.3% and the average recognition rate of (2D)<sup>2</sup>PCA is 94.6%.

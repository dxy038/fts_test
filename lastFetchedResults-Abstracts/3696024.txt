A mixer-integer programming formulation is presented of a satellite system synthesis problem, or geostationary-orbital-planning synthesis problem, which is referred to as the arc allotment problem (AAP). Each satellite administration is to be allotted a weighted-length segment of the geostationary orbital arc within which its satellites may be positioned at any longitude. The objective function maximizes the length of the unweighted arc segment allotted to every administration, subject to single-entry cochannel interference restrictions and constraints imposed by the visible arc for each administration. Useful relationships between special cases of AAP and another satellite synthesis problem are established. Solutions to two example problems are presented

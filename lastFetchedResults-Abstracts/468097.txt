Objective: The aim of the study was to characterize n-3 and n-6 fatty acid Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities and their time course variations in human fetal liver between the 17th and 36th gestational week. Study Design: Twenty-one biologic samples were obtained after legally approved medical abortion, according to French law. The desaturase activities were measured in the 21 liver samples by a radiochemical method by means of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The fatty acid composition (percentage by weight) of liver phospholipids was assessed in 16 samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. Results: Both Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities were significantly expressed between the 17th and 36th gestational weeks. During the second trimester n-6 fatty acid Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities showed opposite patterns of variation; both then remained stable between the 25th and 36th weeks. Δ6-Desaturation was higher in n-3 than n-6 fatty acids and peaked at the 18th gestational week. The percentages of linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids in liver microsomes were positively correlated with the gestation age (P< .01), whereas arachidonic acid remained stable. Conclusion: Significant n-3 and n-6 Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities are expressed in human fetal liver as early as the 17th gestational week and are stable throughout the third trimester. Their theoretic capacity evaluated from in vitro measurements appears lower than polyunsaturated fatty acid requirements and is not directly related to liver microsomal membrane fatty acid composition.

Feed restriction strategies are proven to be effective in increasing the growth performance and carcass parameters of broiler chickens. The objective of the present experiment was to evaluate the effects of feed removal for three hour time period on growth performance and carcass parameters of relatively older male broiler chickens. Twenty days old male broiler chickens (n=80) were allocated into 16 floor pens. Birds in eight pens were fed ad libitum while those in other eight pens were fasted for 3 hours per day (13.00-16.00) during 21-42 d experimental period. There was a slight feed intake reduction (P < 0.01) due to feed restriction during 21-25 d, but not thereafter. When feed was offered after three hours of deprivation, birds consumed significantly (P < 0.01) higher amount of feed within first two hours, compared to the feed intake of ad libitum group during the same time period. Birds fed ad libitum were heavier (P < 0.05) on day 42 but not on days 25, 30 and 35. Feed restriction significantly reduced the weight gain between 35-42 d (P  < 0.01) and the total weight gain (P < 0.05) from day 21-42. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) between 30-42 d was significantly (P < 0.05) lower under ad libitum feeding, and also overall FCR from 21-42 d was affected by the feeding regimes. Restricted feeding increased the total giblet weight (liver+heart+gizzard) (P < 0.10), the carcass weight (P < 0.01) and dressing percentage (P < 0.05) while reduced (P < 0.01) the length of the small intestine relative to carcass weight. Restricted feeding tended to reduce (P < 0.10) the percentage of abdominal fat. The results conclude that feed restriction for three hours per day from days 21-42 increased dressing percentage while reducing abdominal fat content of matured male broiler chicken.

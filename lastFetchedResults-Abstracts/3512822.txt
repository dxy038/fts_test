The paper describes the theory and application fo a multi-input/multi-output self-tuning regulator where the control objective is the assignment of the closed-loop pole set to prespecified locations. The key theoretical result is that the algorithm has the so-called `self-tuning&#191;&#191; property. From a practical viewpoint the pole-assignment concept leads to direct digital controllers which are more robust than self tuners based on optimal control synthesis methods.

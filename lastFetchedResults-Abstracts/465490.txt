Objective: Our goal was to determine whether toxicity of the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene regulated by the human chorionic gonadotropin promoter can be directed to malignant ovarian cell lines. Study design: Plasmids containing diphtheria toxin A-chain gene linked to the regulatory elements of the metalloergothioneine and human chorionic gonadotropin promoters were transfected into the cell lines. Expression of diphtheria toxin A-chain gene was determined by the inhibition of a cotransfected luciferase reporter gene. Results: Cytotoxicity of the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene is shown in a dose-responsive manner. Transfection of a plasmid expressing the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene controlled by a constitutive promoter readily inhibits protein synthesis. Specific inhibition of luciferase protein synthesis occurs in ovarian cancer cells transfected with the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene under the control of the human chorionic gonadotropin promoters when compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells or fibroblasts. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the preferential expression of the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene, regulated by the human chorionic gonadotropin promoter, to ovarian cancer cell lines. This provides an avenue for targeting such cells for suicide, toxin, or cytokine genes.

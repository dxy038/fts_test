For promoting accessibility in a Web based learning environment, ISO and IEC developed the International Standard ISO/IEC 24571. This norme helps to match the needs of learners with disabilities with appropriate accessible digital resources. However, when a visual resource doesnÂ´t have a textual adapted resource, it stays inaccessible. In this paper we present a novel approach having as objective, an automatic generation of adapted resources for digital images used like a pedagogical resources. Indeed, it makes it possible to provide automatically a textual and a semantic interpretation of the visual resources in order to make them accessible to all learners. To carry out our approach, we benefit from the techniques of image processing at end to make the conversion of raster images towards the format Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG), and to introduce semantic classification into SVG.

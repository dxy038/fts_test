Background and Objective: Increasing rates of ciprofloxacin resistance among Escherichia coli (E.coli) causing community acquired urinary tract infections (COMA-UTI) over recent year has been noticed. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with COMA-UTI due to ciprofloxacin resistance E.coli.

Methods and materials: This cross-sectional study was performed on forty ciprofloxacin-resistances E.coli and eighty ciprofloxacin-susceptible E.coli causing community acquired urinary tract infection. For all of the patients questionnaires include demographic and clinical risk factors of UTI were completed. Data entered to SPSS software & has been analyzed. P<0.05 were significant.

Result: recurrent UTI (p=0.004), prior urological operation (p=0.005), urinary catheterization (p=0.001) and prior use of quinolones (p=0.001) were associated with a high risk of ciprofloxacin resistance E.coli. By multivariate analysis, urinary catheterization (OR 2.77 [95% CI 1.26-6.08], p<0.009) and use of quinolones in the last six month (OR 10.42 [95% CI 3.86-28.14], p=0.001), were identified as independent risk factors.

Conclusion: in patient with UTI, urinary catheterization and use of quinolones in the last six month are associated with a high risk of ciprofloxacin resistance E.coli which may cause treatment failure.

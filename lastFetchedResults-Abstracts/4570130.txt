In this paper, we investigate a robust control approach for a class of uncertain systems containing input nonlinearities. Model reference adaptive sliding mode control is suggested to design stabilizing controllers for the uncertain nonlinear systems with input nonlinearities. An integral sliding surface design is proposed by adding an integral term into the linear sliding surface. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, the adaptive sliding mode control strategy for solving the robust tracking problem without the knowledge of upper bound of perturbations is developed. The adaptive sliding mode controller guarantees the global reaching condition of the sliding mode in these systems. In addition, the use of adaptive technique is to adapt the unknown upper bound of perturbations so that the objective of globally asymptotical stability is achieved. Once the system enters the integral sliding manifold, the dynamics of controlled systems are insensitive to matching perturbations as the systems with linear input. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme

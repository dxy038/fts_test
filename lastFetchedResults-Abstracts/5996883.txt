The recent spectacular progress in modern microelectronics created a big stimulus towards development of mobile, autonomous, embedded and re-configurable systems, but also resulted in many difficult to solve issues, as power and energy crisis or increased leakage power, that are especially serious for this sort of systems. What prevents the (re-)configurable heterogeneous embedded systems from becoming one of the main practically used paradigms is mainly inadequate support of the development methodologies and EDA-tools for efficient mapping of applications and producing power, energy, and speed optimized systems. As a part of our research that aims at development of effective methods and EDA-tools for the heterogeneous (re-)configurable embedded system synthesis, we performed a comparative analysis of several representative commercial and academic synthesis methods and tools for the FPGA-targeted controller synthesis. In this paper, the automatic hardware synthesis for the heterogeneous embedded systems is considered, when focusing on the efficient multi-objective controller synthesis. In particular, a part of results and conclusions from our analysis, and effective solutions of some problems observed are discussed

In this paper, combining the optimization design theory and the robust mathematical model of a transmission system based on maximal variation analysis was established. In the model, we take volume of the gearbox as objective function and bending fatigue strength and contact fatigue strength as main constraints. Compared with conventional design the proposed method can reduce the volume of the gearbox and improve both reliability and robustness of the transmission system.

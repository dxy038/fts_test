Driving Dielectric Electro Active Polymer (DEAP) transducers, which can be operated both as actuators and generators, requires a high voltage power electronics (HVPE). This HVPE has to provide a bidirectional energy transfer in order to realize energy-efficient actuator applications or a generator mode in general. In this contribution a modular converter concept for driving DEAP transducers is investigated, enabling the use of standard semiconductors and smaller passive components compared to a single stage converter design. For realization of the converter modules the bidirectional flyback, the Isolated Bidirectional Full-Bridge and the Dual Active Bridge converter topology are investigated. For each approach a current-mode control scheme is analysed, which allows to operate the respective converter modules as current sources and at the same time to limit the electrode current of the DEAP transducer in order to prevent electrode damage. In addition a voltage balancing control scheme ensuring a symmetrical voltage distribution among the converter modules is proposed. For each modular converter concept simulation results are given and the experimental results of a first single bidirectional flyback converter module operated in hysteretic current-mode control are presented.

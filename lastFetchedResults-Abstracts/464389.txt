OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the potentials and limitations of the early detection of ovarian cancer in protocols that involve transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis was performed on the data from 206 referred patients who either had surgical or clinical follow-up of ovarian masses evaluated by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography. Most of the patients were referrals or had risk factors. RESULTS: In this series of 206 patients, 26 ovarian cancers were detected, >70% of which were stage I or II. CONCLUSION: Transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography is capable of early detection of ovarian carcinoma. An improved detection rate may be realized with better identification of high-risk patients who should be studied with transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography.

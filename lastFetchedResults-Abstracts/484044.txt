Giving names to individuals is as old as the time human being started to speak among themselves. The purpose of selection of personal names was to identity individuals properly. In spite of this long history and the objective of name giving, the number of names used in societies is limited and not proportionate to the number of human beings. As an example family name selection in a very dense populated country such as China, is from a booklet containing only 300 names (about 10 pages).
In the decade of 1360(1981), the National Organization for Civil Registration (NOCR) in a correct action forbade nomination of immodest and obscene names. The correctness of the action was confirmed by the turmoil to change many such names, some of the names were so obscene that their bearers were ashamed to pronounce it. By the elimination of such names more limitation were caused and many people to nominate their children turned to foreign names. Can a solution be found to this and put an end to the strife between parents and NOCR officials? This needs a serious research work. In this easy attempt is made to refer to reliable ancient national texts to widen the scope of personal name selection.

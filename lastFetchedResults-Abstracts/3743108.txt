A model is presented that extends the applicability of the propagation data collected during a long measurements campaign in a particular site and for a particular radiolink, to a generic link in a generic site. In fact, the objective of the model is to create a set of attenuation time series to be used in the design of advanced TLC systems. The model assumes that the marked differences of the rain statistics observed in various locations are, in first approximation, mainly due to the different frequency of occurrence of the various rainy events rather than to their shape. Starting from this assumption the model selects, from a large database of rain attenuation events collected in a particular site, a subset that, after an appropriate frequency and elevation scaling, can be used to represent time series of attenuation recorded in other experimental conditions (as for both site and link). The model has been applied to the attenuation data collected at Spino d´Adda (Milan, Italy) during the ITALSAT propagation campaign in order to simulate attenuation time series in several different links and sites. The model demonstrated good performance both in link conditions and climates, similar and different from the Spino d´Adda ones.

The objective of this study is to ascertain the relative importance of lithological controls and geomorphological processes in the development of Drakensberg basalt terraces. Various hypotheses for terrace formation are considered, including geological controls, macroscale geomorphology, and climaticâ€“geomorphological controls. The variations in strength and relative age differences for scarp surface exposures on two slopes of varying aspect are determined, so that a comparison can be made between various scarp outcrops and relative rates of weathering. Scarp outcrops were measured for their rock mass strength, rock surface roughness, and percentage lichen cover. The ethylene glycol test was performed on prepared rock samples to determine susceptibility to tensional breakup. A satellite image depicting the distribution of late-lying contemporary snow was used to assist in the construction of topo-climatic linkages with scarp terrace localities. Findings show that terraces are most common on southeast-facing aspects, and coincide with the major joint strike direction. Lithological factors are thus considered the primary control to such terrace development. It is suggested that a different set of geomorphological processes operates on various slope-altitudinal and slope-orientational positions at any given time.

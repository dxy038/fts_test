Background: 
Fever, is a common sign during the course of HIV infection. The aim of this study was to describe the
etiology and clinical characteristics of fever among HIV/AIDS patients in a teaching hospital in Iran.
Patients and methods: 
In this existing data study, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of admitted HIV/AIDS
patients with fever to Imam Khomeini hospital, from October 1995 to March 2005 to assess the causes of their fever.
Results: 
Totally, 125 admissions were performed for 120 patients. The mean (±SD) age was 34.8± 14.7 years. The final
diagnosis of fever was determined in 65.6% of all admissions. Mostly (34.4%), the cause of fever remained
undiagnosed. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the most commonly identified etiology of fever (33.6%), followed by
opportunistic infections such as oral candidiasis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and cerebral toxoplasmosis.
Conclusion:
 Tuberculosis is the most common infection in Iranian HIV/AIDS patients and appropriate workup should
be considered in all feverish HIV/AIDS patients.

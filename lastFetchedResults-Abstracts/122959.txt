BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the non-invasive methods for diagnosis and differentiation of abnormal lesions from normal tissue is ultrasonic tissue characterization method with one of measuring of elastic modulus. This investigation was conducted to design a measurement method for elastic modulus.
METHODS: For measurement of elastic modulus of breast tissue and abnormal masses, breast tissue should be compressed controllably and with regard to the rate of displacement of masses and normal tissue, the kind of lesion is diagnosed. For production of controllable stress in tissue, two hand and mechanized loading systems have been designed and produced.
FINDINGS: With loading of tissue by these systems and saving ultrasonic images, and processing of images for measurement of displacement of lesion. elastic modulus was calculated.
CONCLUSION: These loading systems are able to apply compression forces in tissue and grab of compressed tissues synchronously. In this study, structure and quality of operation of these loading systems were surveyed.

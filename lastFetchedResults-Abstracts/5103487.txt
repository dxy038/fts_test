Multiple line graphs that represent a large amount of everyday data are commonly used in business and in the finance industry. Color has become a useful addition to such complicated graphs to allow graph-readers to obtain relevant information quickly and easily. Although previous color research revealed that color contrast attracts human attention, a perceived and salient feature of multiple color combinations have not been clearly evident in a graph reading context. This study examines the effect of three color combinations on the userÂ´s perceived attentiveness level and usability of using a three-line graph. This research aims (1) to theoretically contribute color science domain with a graph comprehension aspect, (2) to design a quantitative experiment by measuring objective usability and subjective affective state, and (3) to understand the moderating effects of task types on reading of a pop-out line graph.

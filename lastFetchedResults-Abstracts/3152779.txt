In this paper, we discussed the optimal harvesting problem of a stochastic single logistic population model. First, we proved that the stochastic logistic equation has a unique positive solution and analysed the limit behavior of this solution. Furthermore, we chose the maximum sustainable yield as the management objective and explored the optimal harvesting policy for this model. Finally, the maximum sustainable yield and the corresponding optimal harvesting effort are determined.

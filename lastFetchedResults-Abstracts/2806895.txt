This paper presents a framework for optimal operation scheduling of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in coordination with Renewable Energy Resources (RERs) in distribution systems. The proposed framework is a multi-time interval optimization problem that includes an efficient three-phase unbalanced Distribution Optimal Power Flow (DOPF) model. Mathematical models for RERs and ESS are integrated into the problem, and multiple objective functions such as minimization of losses, imbalanced power at the substation, total energy costs, and peak demand are formulated to optimally operate distribution networks from the perspective of a local distribution company. The proposed framework generates optimal charge/discharge scheduling of ESSs, while meeting technical and operational requirements of distribution networks and ESSs. Relevant simulation results for a test system with multiple solar PVs and two ESSs are presented and discussed to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method to optimally operate distribution systems with multiple ESSs and RERs.

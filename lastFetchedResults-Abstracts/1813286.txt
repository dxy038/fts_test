Background and Aims
ins are low molecular weight antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides. Their participation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) infection has been scarcely studied.
s
cribe the kinetics of murine Î²-defensin 2 (mBD-2) expression by quantitative real-time PCR and cellular location by immunohistochemistry in murine models of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis and latent infection.
s
 progressive disease, mBD2 gene expression raised its peak at 14 days postinfection, whereas in latent infection it was at 90 days. In both models, mBD-2 immunostaining was essentially located in cells with dendritic morphology located near mediastinal lymph nodes, which correlated with the previous reported highest expression of cell-mediated protected immunity in both models.
sions
results suggest that mBD-2 may play a role in the control of bacilli growth by contributing to establish a Th1 response, being a link between innate and adaptative immunity. These data may be used for the development of new vaccine approaches.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Perineal trauma particularly from routine episiotomy that is associated with short and long term morbidity for women. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of perineal massage with lavender essence on episiotomy and laceration.

METHODS; This clinical trial study was performed on 176 nulliparous women who referred to Arak Talghani teaching center for normal delivery. They were randomly participating in massage with lavender essence oil (91 cases) or control group (85 cases). In lavender group when they progressed to full dilatation of the cervix, the midwife inserted two fingers inside vagina and using a sweeping motion gently stretch the perineum with lavender essence oil 5 up to 10 minute, in and between mother's pushing in second stage of labor. In control group just Ritgen Maneuver was applied. At last we compared the rate of intact perineum, episiotomy and laceration, mean duration of second stage of labour and Apgar score in 1st and 5th minute between two groups.

FINDINGS: In case group, intact perineum, episiotomy and laceration were: 60.2% (53), 8% (7), and 31.8% (31) respectively. In control group, intact perineum, episiotomy and laceration were: 2.4% (2), 80% (68) and 17.6% (15) respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0001). In Lavender essence group, first and second degree laceration were 27.3 % (27) and 4.5% (4) respectively. Third and fourth degree laceration were not occurred. In control group, first, second and third degree laceration were 4.6 % (4), 7.1% (6) and 5.9% (5) respectively, fourth degree laceration was not occurred. Difference was statistically significant. (p=0.0001)

CONCLUSION The results showed that perineal massage with Lavender essence in second stage of labour decreases incidence of episiotomy and degree of laceration. Lavender essence may be increase blood flow, elasticity, softness and relaxation of perineal tissue.

The present research centers on the moral predicaments of political power that prevents the continuation and dynamic movement of political sovereignity. We want to investigate this issue from Imam Ali's (As) outlook, one who himself has presented at the top of political power and has identified closely them. The conclusion is that there is a close connection between "polities" and "morality" to the extent that moral reform is seen as objective of the politics, and the moral predicaments causes the decrease in efficiency and decline of the political power, lack of legitimacy of sovereignty regarding the quick change in loyalty of the people to the government.

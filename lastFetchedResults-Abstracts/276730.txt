Repetitive lifting in the workplace has been identified to be a cause of low back disorders. Epidemiologic data further supports an hypothesis that higher repetition rate (i.e. frequency) is an added risk factor. The objective of this study was to provide experimental data testing the above hypothesis. An in vivo feline model was subjected to 20-min of cyclic lumbar loading at frequencies of 0.1 Hz and 0.5 Hz while monitoring the EMG from the L-3/4â€“L-5/6 multifidus muscles and the creep at the L-4/5 level. Seven hours of rest were allowed after the cyclic flexion/extension was terminated. During this rest period, a single test cycle was performed every hour to assess recovery of EMG and lumbar creep. The results demonstrate that cyclic lumbar flexion elicits a transient neuromuscular disorder consisting of EMG spasms during the cyclic loading and initial and delayed muscular hyperexcitabilities during the rest period. Cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz resulted in significant (p<0.05) increase in the hyperexcitability magnitude and duration during the recovery period. It was concluded that repetitive lumbar loading at fast rates is indeed a risk factor as it induces larger creep in the lumbar viscoelastic tissues which in turn intensify the resulting neuromuscular disorder.

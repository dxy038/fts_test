An integrated electromagnetic team fuzzy logic, (EM-TFL) environment is developed for the characterization and design optimization of EM launchers (EML). In addition, a novel technique that uses FL membership functions to model the conflicting objective functions in multiobjective design optimization problems is also presented. The results of a case study involving a multistage EML are presented.

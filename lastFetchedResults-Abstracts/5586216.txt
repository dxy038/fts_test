In this paper, we consider the combined task of determining a favorable machine configuration and line balancing for a single assembly line where a single type of PCB is assembled with a set of interconnected, reconfigurable machine modules. First, we formulate the problem as a non-linear integer programming model with the objective of minimizing the cycle time. Then we transform it into a linear model to obtain the solution. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the model by numerical tests and compare the optimal solution from our model with evolutionary algorithm.

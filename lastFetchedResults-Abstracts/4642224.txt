The issue of plant explosion due to gas leakage is a serious problem which impacts the lives of the personnel, damages plant equipments and incurs high cost for maintenance. As this issue is a high risk at hazardous place such as a combustible gas plant, there is an important need to use gas detector which functions to detect gas leakage at a particular area. However, some gas detectors are less reliable in detecting gas due to presence of other unwanted elements which may cause the instruments to malfunction. The objective of the study is to eliminate those unwanted elements in order to maintain the well functioning of the instrument. The paper discusses the Infrared signal absorption by combustible gas and solution to eliminate moisture trapped in gas detector.

In this paper, a signal decorrelation technique is presented that aims to minimise the degradation on stereo signal perception, whilst alleviating the non-uniqueness problem in stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation (SAEC). The proposed technique is based on higher-order time-varying allpass filters (HO-TV-APF) utilising spectral-shaped noise, together with the interpolation method. The test results on real speech signals indicate improved performance in both objective and subjective manners.

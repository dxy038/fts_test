Recently there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant resource. Knowledge is essentially defined as an asset in an academic institution. Due to the large repository of the Intranet, searching the experts in various field is difficult. Availability of the data in the institutional repository will be in different formats (pdf, ppt, excel etc). In order to organize the data, a common terminology should be adopted. Ontology is used to capture the domain knowledge. With this objective personalized ontology is constructed. It enables the institutional heads to identify the experts in specific domain in order to enhance the growth of the academic institution in the competitive world.

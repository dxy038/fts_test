Background: The legionellaceae family has a single genus legionella which is a major cause of respiratory disease in human. These agents are water - born organisms with a wide distribution in natural and artificial environmental water supplies. Transmission to human may occur through contaminated aerosols.
Objective: This study was performed to isolate and identify determine the legionnaire's disease agents from the medical equipments and environmental water sources. Methods: 210 samples were collected from hospitals and other aquatic sources in Ahwaz. The samples were examined for legionella bacteriology.
Findings: The results indicated that the legionella were present in 14 out of 210 samples. Using biochemical tests, 9 serogroups of legionella species were recognized as pneumophila and the remaining 5 serogroups were reported as other legionella species. Conclusion: It seems that legionellas exist at the location of the sampling areas. Recognition of different serogroups of these bacteria needs more epidemiological studies.

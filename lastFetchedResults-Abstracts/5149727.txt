This In the Parallel itinerary based KNN query processing we have routing phase, KNN boundary estimation and spatial irregularity which uses the routing protocol called Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR). This GPSR offers routing support for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). However GPSR was designed for the symmetric links (bidirectional reachable), but sensor networks are often asymmetric in nature. GPSR suffers by energy inefficiency as it has to trace through all the nodes in the boundary for reaching the destination. In the prior work spatial queries are propagated in the sensor nodes and it is energy efficiency and query accuracy is determined by using the parallel itinerary based KNN query processing techniques. But the problem it is applicable for the symmetric link thereby to optimize the energy efficiency and query accuracy we propose the Customized Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (C-GPSR), modified version of GPSR is proposed which identifies optimal route based on energy utilization and overcome problems in GPSR so that the feasibility of using GPSR in asymmetric WSN can be increased thereby improve the overall energy efficiency in parallel itinerariesÂ´. The simulation using Network Simulator results proves that the energy and delay is minimized and hence the proposed protocol outperforms the existing routing protocol for WSN.

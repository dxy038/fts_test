We address the problem of rationing common components among multiple products in a configure-to-order system with order configuration uncertainty. The objective of this problem is to maximize expected revenue by implementing a threshold rationing policy. Under this policy, a product is available to promise if fulfilling the order for the product will not cause the inventory of any one of its required components to fall below the componentâ€™s threshold level for that product. The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic integer program and solved using the sample average approximation approach. A heuristic is developed to generate good feasible solutions and lower bound estimates. Using industry data, we examine the benefit of component rationing as compared to a First-Come-First-Served policy and show that this benefit is correlated to the average revenue per product and the variability in the revenue across products whose components are constrained.

This paper proposes an approach for optimal restoration of radial power distribution networks after an incident. This complex problem requires a decision-making process whose combinatorial nature can avoid the assessment of all possible solutions. Thus, the proposed approach is based on a binary coding particle swarm optimization (PSO) tool for handling the discrete variables associated with the switching decisions. The restoration process involves a multi-objective reconfiguration model whose objectives are maximizing the supplied loads and the voltage regulation, with minimal power loss and switching maneuvers. Two case studies are introduced.

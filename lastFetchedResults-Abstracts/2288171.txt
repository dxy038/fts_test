The objective of this work focused on preparing and characterizing bentonite clay through thermal treatment in order to be applied in a porous bed for copper adsorption. Tests to obtain adsorbent physical and chemical characteristics were performed on natural clay samples, samples calcined at 400 and 500 Â°C, and calcined submitted to copper adsorption. This clay was characterized according to the following techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) method, N2 physisorption (BET), helium pycnometry, mercury porosity, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). A study was conducted to define the operation outflow, based on the minimum mass transfer zone (MTZ) obtained, useful (qU) and total (qT) adsorbed amounts, and total copper removal percentage (R (%)).

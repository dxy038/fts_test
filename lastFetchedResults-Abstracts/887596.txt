Knowledge plays important role on having continuous improvement within organization. Highly skilled employees normally contribute their knowledge within organizations and help others. In this paper, we perform an empirical investigation to find important factors influencing expediting knowledge distribution in one of Iranian organizations. The proposed study of this paper designs a questionnaire and distributes it among a randomly selected employees and using some statistical test, the relationship between knowledge distribution as dependent variables with eight independent variables are investigated. The results of our survey confirm that informal mechanism, building a good trust within organization, having a good interaction among different units of organization, hiring highly committed employees, improving innovation, and learning capabilities within organization may help expedite distribution of knowledge within organization. However, the survey does not find any statistical evidence to believe that formal mechanism, having a good identity and stating objective had any meaningful impact on distributing knowledge within organization.

The current of Islamic Revolution and its consequent developments led to the formation of a kind of be-havior, culture and organizational management model that was later interpreted as jihadi work and manage-ment. Evidently, inattention to the original essence and vital factor of jihadi thought would lead to diversion or misconception. The objective of this research is to understand the essence of this emerging phenomenon and its fundamental differences with similar phenomena. Hence, employing interpretative phenomenology, the present paper is an attempt to study and analyze more than 60 statements of Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khame-nei about jihad (holy struggle). 
The findings of this research indicate that the pivotal distinction of jihadi activities become meaningful in the framework of faith in the invisible and acquisition of this faith as well as its bolstering is possible through piety. The effectiveness of jihadi management is rooted in individualâ€™s mystical and spiritual spirit; and, final-ly the nature of jihadi management is defined on the basis of struggle, which is founded on two pillars, i.e. ample efforts; and struggling against the obstacles in the way of achieving Islamic progress and civilization. 
Proper understanding of the nature of jihdi management can lead to the formation of jihadi culture with such dimensions as utilization of the capacities, struggle against the obstacles and limitations as well as intro-duction of examples and epitomes. Success in launching this model of management would lead to such results as happiness and hope in the organization, quicker access to the goal, strengthening of the inner construct, experiencing dignity and achieving progress and civilization.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated citrate salt, acetate salt, and their combinations for antibacterial activity against a sample of common pathogens.

METHODS: Bacterial suspensions were added to serial microdilutions of the salts in broth, with final cell concentrations of 104–5 colony-forming units per milliliter. After overnight incubation at 35°C, the minimum inhibitory concentration was recorded. Bactericidal activity was screened by quantitative subcultures from the minimum inhibitory concentration dilution.

RESULTS: Citrate salt was active against gram-positive species and Candida albicans but showed little activity against gram-negative species; acetate salt showed the opposite results. Their combination did not show synergism or antagonism.

CONCLUSION: It may be feasible to take advantage of the different antibacterial spectra of these two agents and combine them for possible application such as food or medical preservative agents.

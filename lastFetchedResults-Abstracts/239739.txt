This paper describes the mathematical modelling, analysis and simulation of a novel hybrid powertrain used in a scooter. The primary feature of the proposed hybrid powertrain is the use of a split power-system that consists of a one-degree-of-freedom (dof) planetary gear-train (PGT) and a two-dof PGT to combine the power of two sources, a gasoline engine and an electric motor. Detailed component level models for the hybrid electric scooter are established using the Matlab/Simulink environment. A simple rule-based power control strategy is then established with the primary objective to optimize the fuel economy of the hybrid electric scooter. The performance of the proposed hybrid powertrain is studied using the developed model under four driving cycles. The simulation results verify the operational capabilities of the proposed hybrid system and show both the engine and the electric motor work in an optimal state under various operating conditions.

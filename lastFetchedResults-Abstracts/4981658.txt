The main objective of this study is to validate the thermomechanical properties of materials used in some electronic components. The improved performance of HgCdTe infrared focal plane arrays requires reliability of the assembly at low temperatures down to 77K. Unfortunately, the thermomechanical behavior of most materials of these components remains to be clarified, particularly in a cryogenic environment. The present investigation is a part of a global study that aims to analyze the reliability of some electronic assembly, through numerical simulations combined with experimental measures. The relevance of this numerical modelling strongly depends on a precise characterization of the thermo-mechanical behavior of specific materials involved in the considered assemblies. Thus, through numerical simulations of a model of electronic chip, we determine the thermal and mechanical properties of materials such as indium, silicon, fused silica, by comparing these simulations results with the experimental measurements carried out on these same models of chips. This study enables us to have a complete database of the thermomechanical behavior of materials studied for the range of operating temperatures.

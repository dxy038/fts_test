The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method has be proposed and popularly applied in many disciplines over three decades. In the same time, many scholars also suggested various improved methods to enhance the decision quality. For the more delicate decision-making, it is necessary to provide more accurate and abundant reference information for the decision-maker. However, traditional AHP related questionnaires are insufficient for providing enough information and a friendly environment. In this paper, we proposed a KM-based AHP decision-making method to provide the questionnaire designer a guideline or reference and developed an auxiliary web questionnaire system based on this method. A case study of selecting a machine center was illustrated the implementation and applicability of this method, a mold manufacturing company was invited as the survey objective. This method proposed in this research is general in form and can be applied to the other multi-criteria decision making cases.

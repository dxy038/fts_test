The objective of the proposed paper is to investigate an adaptive concatenated codes, which can provide a more efficient error protection in the channels with different types of errors. The block diagram of the proposed technique is presented. These codes provide different random error protection capability, which is related to guard space between a burst of errors. To achieve an additional protection for bursty channels, we have implemented a majority logic encoder and decoder

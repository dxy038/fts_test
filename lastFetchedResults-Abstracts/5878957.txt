The objective here is to develop a home automation and security system which can be controlled and monitored remotely using any telephone line. The user can enter into the system by entering the valid pin code. After entering into the system, the user can control the status of devices connected with the system using any Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The system can also be implemented for security purposes in banks or at home. If the user is at outstation, he can change the status of the lights remotely for security reasons. The heart of the system is a PIC micro-controller (PIC18F4520) which controls the complete working of the system. The GSM modem is also interfaced with the micro-controller. The remote user can also monitor the current status of the devices by sending SMS message to the GSM modem. The system can be controlled and monitored from anywhere by using telephone line.

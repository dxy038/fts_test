Physical models of multi-winding transformers for SMPS with modern standard or variable core geometries and solenoidal windings arranged side by side or planar spiral windings are presented, suitable for computer aided optimization under consideration of skin and proximity effects. The winding layers are composable to interleaved or arbitrary composited windings to reduce losses. The height of ferrite cores for planar transformers in power modules can be assigned, while core losses are approximately accounted for. The selection of an objective function, the initial values and algorithms are guided by the aim to integrate the nonlinear optimization program into a CAE package for SMPS, run on PCs

Imagery and depicting are considered as the literary miracle aspects of Holy Quran. The Holy Quran has showed a dynamic and vivid picture of all phenomena to its audiences, minds using existing phonemes, letters, words and combinations, and these existing pictures in the verses can be understood by a creative mind and a divine blessing. All images in the Quran possess a criterion the base of which relies on their harmony with the guidance objective of Quran. To understand these images better, we must consider the words and their literal and spiritual implications, the musical tone of the sentences, and the forms and the shades of the words with the same harmony. One of the most beautiful imagery and depicting in the Holy Quran is manifested in Musabbihat suras (Isra, Hadid, Hashr, Saf, Jumu`ah, Taghabun, and Aâ€™la).
It should be noted that the unity of thought is dominated on the images of these suras and while having an individual indepe-ndency, each of these images has an inner relationship with the other images. This paper considered some parts of the Holy Quran miracles regarding the function of artistic image in the Musabbihat. All creatures, Praising towards God Almighty is clear in the imagery of the Musabbihat suras, and the honor and wisdom, on the other hand the dominant feature of these images.

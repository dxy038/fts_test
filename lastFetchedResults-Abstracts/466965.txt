Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the pregnancy loss rate after genetic amniocentesis that was performed by general obstetrician-gynecologists in a community hospital. Study Design: Medical records and billing information were used to identify all genetic amniocenteses that had been performed by a group of general obstetricians-gynecologists from 1996 through 2000. Maternal charts were reviewed for data that were pertinent to the risk of fetal loss: maternal age, parity, ethnicity, procedure indication, gestational age at procedure, karyotype results, physician operator, gestational age at delivery, and live birth/stillbirth. Results: During this 5-year time period, 370 procedures were performed by this physician group. Completed delivery outcomes were available on 369 of 370 patients (99.7%). Three patients underwent pregnancy termination. Data were analyzed on the remaining 366 patients. There was 1 pregnancy loss (amniocentesis at 17 weeks with vaginal bleeding at 21 week and preterm delivery at 24 weeks). There was 1 other procedure-related complication: membrane rupture 7 days after the procedure, with spontaneous resealing of the membranes after prolonged bedrest. Conclusion: Over a 5-year period, pregnancy loss after midtrimester amniocentesis performed by general obstetrician-gynecologists was 1 in 366 procedures. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1130-2.)

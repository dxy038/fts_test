BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal bruxism is considered as a major cause of temporomandibular disorders. Although nocturnal bruxism is normally diagnosed clinically, polysomnography is also a gold standard diagnostic test for this disorder. This study aimed to evaluate the physiological events in patients with nocturnal bruxism through polysomnography analysis.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on 20 patients who were diagnosed with nocturnal bruxism based on the sleep disorders questionnaires of the International Committee of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) and physical examinations. The sleep patterns and bruxism of these patients were also evaluated via polysomnography.
FINDINGS: In this study, 15-25% of the patients diagnosed with nocturnal bruxism reported various problems related to temporomandibular joint  (TMJ) involvement. In addition, 85% of the patients complained of facial pain and tenderness, and the most frequent symptoms during the examinations were TMJ clicking, joint noises and limited mouth opening.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the quality and quantity of sleep in bruxism patients are at a lower level compared to healthy individuals. 
KEY WORDS: Nocturnal bruxism, Polysomnography, Diagnosis.

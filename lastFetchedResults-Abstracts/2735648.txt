In this paper, traffic-aware sleeping control (SC) and power matching (PM) of a single base station (BS) in cellular networks are studied. The objective is to find the sleeping control and power matching configurations that achieve the Pareto optimal tradeoff between total power consumption and average delay. Two types of sleeping control schemes are considered: The BS goes to sleep whenever there is no active user, and wakes up when N users are assembled or after a period of multiple or single vacation time. We first discuss when to incorporate sleeping control into power matching energy efficiently. The explicit relationship between total power consumption and average delay with varying service rate is analyzed theoretically, indicating that sacrificing delay cannot always be traded for energy saving, and we also provide conditions under which the energy-optimal rate exists. Moreover, the optimal pair of sleeping parameter and service rate to achieve the optimal energy-delay tradeoff, and the energy consumption lower bound are also derived. Both the analytical and simulation results show that tolerable sacrifice of delay performance can be traded for substantial amount of energy saving given that careful designs were made according to our analysis.

The objective of this paper is to implement a receiver side beamforming technique using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a means of achieving better performance in Rayleigh multipath fading environment. The adaptive processor required for carrying out beamforming in a faded wireless medium is replaced by an ANN which helps in using the channel state information (CSI) better than the traditional techniques. The simulation results show employing an ANN to a traditional adaptive beamforming significantly improves system performance in a multipath environment.

Objective
The objective of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the umbilical cord twist direction.
Study design
Two hundred singleton third-trimester placentas with a right umbilical cord twist and 200 placentas with a left umbilical cord twist, which was determined by pathologic examination, were included. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared with the use of Fisher's exact and Mann Whitney U tests; a probability value of <.05 considered statistically significant.
Results
Placenta previa was more common in patients with a right umbilical cord twist compared with a left umbilical cord twist (6.0% vs 1.5%; P<.05). There was a trend towards an increased incidence of single umbilical artery in patients with a right umbilical cord twist (2.5% vs 0%; P = .06). The incidence of fetal demise, intrauterine growth restriction, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital anomalies, preterm delivery, infant gender, birth weight, maternal age, and parity were similar between the 2 groups.
Conclusion
Placenta previa is associated with a right umbilical cord twist.

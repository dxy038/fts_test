This paper presents the design of compact CPW-FED Dual band notched UWB square ring antenna. The main objective of this proposed research work is to reduce the size of antenna and avoid interference between UWB and WLAN (5.5GHz) and WiMax (3.4 GHz) application. The antenna consists of a square-ring metal patch and 50&#937; coplanar waveguide (CPW) strip with dimension of 35&#215;31 mm<sup>2</sup>. The antenna is then modified to possess dual band rejection by etching two symmetrical slots in the ground plane nearby the feed line and rectangular split ring slot in the square-ring radiating patch. The geometry parameters of antenna are investigated and optimized with HFSS. The result show that the proposed antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 3.110.6GHz with VSWR&lt;;2, except in the band of 4.8-6.2 GHz and 3.2-3.6GHz with an omnidirectional radiation pattern.

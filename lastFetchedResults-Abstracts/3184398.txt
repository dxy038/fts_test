This paper presents the results of a characterization study performed on the pulsed power system of the UNM Reltron, an ultra-compact, low voltage (&#8764;100 kV) high power microwave source. The results presented include vacuum system operation, full power operation of the pulsed power system, and initial operation of the tube. Since the electron beam modulator is essentially the heart of the Reltron, responsible for the efficient generation of the electron bunches in a short distance, we also present cold test measurements on the electron beam modulator and microwave extraction system. The main objective of the research was to characterize the electron beam modulator and identify a regime of stable operation.

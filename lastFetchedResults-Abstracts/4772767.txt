The effectiveness of the innovative input depends on the objective evaluation of the performance influence factors of the innovative talents. To raise the efficiency of the innovative input in Wuhan, the paper adopts the fuzzy synthetic evaluation method to make a study of the performance influence factors of the innovative talents. First, the paper sets up the indicator system of the factors, and then the fuzzy synthetic judgment model based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy processing (FAHP). Through FAHP, the paper has solved the relative importance weights of each factor in influencing the innovative performance by establishing the weight matrix between the indicator level and the sub-indicator level, and next, combining the assessment set and the value set, the paper makes a fuzzy synthetic judgment of the indicator level and the sub-indicator level and solves the overall influence level of all the factors to the innovative performance. In this way, the paper has found a relative scientific approach in evaluating the performance influence factors of the innovative talents and proposed comparatively objective conclusion for the input decision of the innovation in Wuhan.

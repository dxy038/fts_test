In recent years the electric power generation has entered into a new development era, which can be described mainly by increasing concerns about climate change, through the energy transition from hydrocarbon to clean energy resources. In order to power system enhance reliability, efficiency and safety, renewable and nonrenewable resources are integrated together to configure so-called hybrid systems. Despite the experience accumulated in the power networks, designing hybrid system is a complex task. It has become more challenging as far as most renewable energy resources are random and weather/climatic conditions-dependant. In this challenging context, this paper proposes a critical state-of-the-art review of hybrid generation systems planning expansion and indexes multi-objective methods as strategies for hybrid energy systems optimal design to satisfy technical and economical constraints.

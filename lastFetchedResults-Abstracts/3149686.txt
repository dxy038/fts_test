This paper presents the development of a fairly new neural network based method that aims at characterizing polar fleece fabric appearance for the purpose of objective quality evaluation. Co-occurrence matrix analysis is used to give the quantitative descriptions of fabric appearance properties; neural network model is used to establish the relationship between these essential features and the final rating grade of fabric appearance. The experimental results demonstrate that good correlation can be achieved between the actual rating grade and the predicted rating grade and reveals the possibility of the development of artificial intelligence system to simulate the functions of human eyes and brain.

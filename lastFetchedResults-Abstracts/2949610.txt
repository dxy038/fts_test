We relate information theoretic blind learning methods (infomax) and Bussgang blind equalization methods. The multipath extension of blind source separation methods can be seen in the frequency domain using FIR matrix algebra (matrices of finite impulse response filters). Three forms of Bussgang algorithms are given. The blind serial update method of Cardoso and Laheld (1994) is related to the infomax objective of Bell and Sejnowski (1995). The application emphasis is on speech separation. We demonstrate the robustness and power of the new techniques by blindly separating speech signals recorded in a multipath environment

Interference has the strongest effect on the available bandwidth of wireless local area network (WLAN) mesh networks. The channel assignment problem for multi-radio multi-channel multihop networks is complex NP-hard, and channel assignment, routing and power control are tightly coupled. To mitigate the co-channel interference and improve capacity in multi-channel and multi-interface WLAN mesh networks, an efficient system model based on objective optimization is proposed in this paper, which takes channel assignment, number of network interface cards (NICs), broadcast routing and power control in consideration. In order to appropriately assign channel, an efficient power control scheme and a linear programming formulation is introduced to achieve this objective. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach and scheme can get better performance than HLF.

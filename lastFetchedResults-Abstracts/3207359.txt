3GPP LTE networks can provide a higher capacity by adopting advanced physical layer techniques and serve users with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. However, unbalanced user distributions and strong inter-cell interference (ICI) still deteriorate network performances severely. Since fractional frequency reuse (FFR) technique is recommended to mitigate ICI, we investigate the load balancing problem in a 3GPP LTE multi-cell FFR network with heterogenous services in this paper. Firstly we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem, whose objectives are intra- and inter-cell load balancing index for users with QoS requirements and total utility function for users without QoS requirements. Then we analyze the complexity of the problem and propose a practical algorithm which includes QoS aware intra- and inter-cell handover and call admission control. Extensive simulations are conducted, the results show that our algorithm can lead to significantly better performances, i.e., a lower new call blocking rate for users with QoS requirements, a larger utility for users without QoS requirements at the cost of a bit degradation of total throughput.

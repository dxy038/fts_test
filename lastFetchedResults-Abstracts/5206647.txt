This study was designed to investigate the use of an antenna adapted for electromagnetic heating of a dissipative medium. The antenna studied was the asymmetrically center-driven dipole with concentric insulated layers, useful for microwave local heating in the extraction of heavy petroleum as well as in cancer therapy. The main objective of this work was the development of a numeric simulator for the antenna, in order to optimize the transfer of energy to the dissipative medium. The Hallen and Pocklington equations were solved for the current distribution on the antenna using the numeric technique of the moment method. Detailed integral expressions of the near electric field in cylindrical coordinates were developed and calculated using adapted methods of numeric integration, such as, Legendre-Gauss and adaptive Simpson rule. The mathematical models and the numeric techniques approached in this study were implemented in computational algorithms, gathered in application software with a good user graphic interface. The results obtained for the viscous oil reservoir were stable, presenting a good agreement with the models and results found in the literature

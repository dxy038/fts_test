This paper investigates single-machine coupled-task scheduling where each job has two tasks separated
by an exact delay. The objective of this study is to schedule the tasks to minimize the makespan subject to
a given job sequence. We introduce several intriguing properties of the fixed-job-sequence problem
under study. While the complexity status of the studied problem remains open, an O(n2) algorithm is proposed
to construct a feasible schedule attaining the minimum makespan for a given permutation of 2n
tasks abiding by the fixed-job-sequence constraint. We investigate several polynomially solvable cases
of the fixed-job-sequence problem and present a complexity graph of the problem.

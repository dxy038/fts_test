Growing concerns about environmental protection and oil prices have forced the transport industries to develop low emission, fuel efficient solutions. In the maritime sector, dc grids are being considered for commercial marine vessels to improve emission and fuel consumption. As a requirement for evaluation and optimization of the fuel consumption, this paper sets forth efficiency modeling and analysis of a shipboard dc power system. The studied dc hybrid power system includes diesel engines, synchronous generator-rectifier units, and a full-bridge bidirectional converter that incorporates an energy storage device into the system. Various loss components of different elements are analyzed in detail, which are finally simplified to be readily used in complex optimization algorithms.

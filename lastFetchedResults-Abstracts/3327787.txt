A pole-projection approach is proposed as a useful tool for multi-objective robust control design. Different load conditions or nonlinearities are considered in the design by simultaneously stabilizing a set of linear models. The idea is to repeatedly project the poles for each model (one at a time) to a generalized stability region until all models are stabilized. Similarly, pole projections are also performed for an auxiliary set of models. Stability of the latter gives guaranteed bounds on different sensitivity functions for the former. The method solves a benchmark problem for which a controller of lower complexity than has been reported before is obtained.

Objective
dy the effectiveness of a dentifrice containing polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic acid (PVM/MA) copolymer in a silica base in occluding dentin tubules for treatment of dentin sensitivity.
s
-two human dentin discs were divided into two groups and brushed in the morning for 30 s each to study the dentifrices with and without PVM/MA copolymer. Dentin tubule occlusion and dentin permeability were evaluated with a focus variation three dimensional vertical scanning microscope (IFM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After second brushing for 30 s in the afternoon the dentin discs were immersed in saliva for 16 h and then subjected to erosion using orange juice for 10 min. The effects of saliva and orange juice on tubule occlusion used in the study of dentifrices were further evaluated with IFM.
s
rage 97.7% of the dentin tubules were occluded after brushing in the PVM/MA group, as compared to 13.3% in the control group (p &lt; 0.0001). EIS showed that the impedance of the dentin disc increased after treatment with PVM/MA but not in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). After 16 h of storage in saliva and 10 min of erosion by orange juice, 86% of the dentin tubules remained occluded in the PVM/MA treated dentifrice. The sizes of the tubule openings were increased after orange juice erosion in the control group but not in the PVM/MA group.
sion
rice containing PVM/MA copolymer in a silica base effectively occluded dentin tubules. The intra-tubular plugs were resistant to saliva and orange juice challenges.

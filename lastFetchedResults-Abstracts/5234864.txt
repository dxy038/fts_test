Based on the analysis of dual-gantry turret machine, the optimization problem of placement process is decomposed to component allocation, feeder arrangement and component placement sequence. Through the engineering analysis, an integrated optimization model of dual-gantry multi-head turret placement machine is formulated. The minimum displacement of gantry and workload balance is objective. Combined with heuristic method and genetic algorithm (GA), hybrid GA (HGA) is adopted to optimize the placement process. A two-dimensional piece-wise coding method is proposed. In a chromosome, component allocation, feeder arrangement and component placement sequence is described simultaneously. HGA uses improved order crossover, adaptive mutation and contains a reasonable fitness function. Under the condition of constraint satisfying of movement mechanisms, HGA guarantee that the genetic research can enter the available solution space quickly and research the optimal solution. The component allocation, component placement sequence and feeder arrangement are optimized simultaneously to improve the PCB assembly efficiency.

Objective (s): To compare gain- and loss-framed message texting (SMS) on foot self-care behaviors among women with type 2 diabetes referred to Ahwaz diabetic clinic.
Methods: This was a randomized trial of 189 women with type 2 diabetes who randomly assigned to three groups: two experimental groups and control group. Two experimental groups received gain- and loss-framed educational message of foot care behaviors via mobile phone short message service for 2 months while the control group received nothing. Data were collected through interviews using demographic and disease characteristics questionnaires and the summary of diabetes self-care activities measure. The data were analyzed using paired t-test, one way analysis of variance, and chi-square.
Results: At baseline there were no significant differences among study groups in disease characteristics, individual variables and the average score of foot care behaviors. After the intervention, a significant increase was observed in mean score of foot care in experimental groups (P=0.001). It was also found that the increase in loss-framed message group was significantly more than the gain-framed message group (P=0.01).
Conclusion: Designing and implementing educational programs based on mobile phone short message service could be effective. However, in comparison it seems that loss-framed message could be more effective than gain-framed message.

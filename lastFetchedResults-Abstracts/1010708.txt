The multi-objective optimization of a vehicular fuel cell system was conducted in this study with the objective functions for maximizing the power output, both energy and exergy efficiencies, and minimizing cost generation (through exergoeconomics). The cases were investigated parametrically using varying operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, surrounding temperature and pressure, current density, humidity and membrane thickness. A computer program was developed (MULOPâ€“The Multi-Objective Optimizer) and a genetic algorithm based solver was applied to the program for dealing with the multi-objective problems. It was seen that the variation of the cost and work values at the same work, energy, and exergy fractions are in opposite directions. This study not only calculates the minimum result of cost and maximum results of work, energy and exergy efficiencies, but also improves the computer program for solving general multi-objective optimization problems. The selection of the optimum value depends on the requirements of the system that will be used The Pareto solution values of the multi-objective problem are 3.31 $/GW, 118 kW, 0.49 and 0.55 from the cost, work, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency points of views respectively.

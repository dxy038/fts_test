An algorithm for LPC parameter optimization in multipulse (MP)-linear-prediction-coding (LPC)-based speech coders is presented. It is shown that by taking the nature of the MP excitation signal into account in the LPC parameter computation, it is possible to improve the effectiveness of the LPC model. This results in a better quality of the reconstructed signal in terms of both objective and subjective criteria. The implementation details of the algorithm are discussed, and experimental results are presented. In particular, a comparison with standard MP LPC techniques is given

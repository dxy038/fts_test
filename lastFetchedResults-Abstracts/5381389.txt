In order to increase beam shapes and antenna gains, patch array feed for the shaped dielectric lens antenna is developed. Important technical progresses are summarized in the following. The array element patch antenna that has the similar radiation patterns as a rectangular horn is developed. Excitation coefficient of the patch array feed is obtained through the radiation pattern synthesis method. Designed radiation phase and amplitude patterns agreed rather well with the objective pattern. At the 30deg scanning beam, gain increase of 5.2 dB and excellent beam shapes are achieved.

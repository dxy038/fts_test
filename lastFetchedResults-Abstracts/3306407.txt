Forest vehicle routing is an important step in optimization of forest transportation system to minimize the total cost. To perform this work, we propose a mathematical model and use two metaheuristics approaches, a reactive tabu search and an extended great deluge. The objective is to minimize the total cost and respecting the time window of all customers which is sometime important in this field. Finally, the experimental results obtained with the two metaheuristics approaches of the named vehicle routing problem are showed, discussed and compared to identify the best solution.

A number of prefix delegation-based schemes have been proposed in the literature to solve the route optimization problem in mobile networks. The route optimization solutions generate overheads and affect the performance of mobile networks. However, currently there is no tool available to aid in the selection of an appropriate scheme for a given mobility scenario. The objective of this paper is to develop analytical models for prefix delegation based schemes and compare the performance of the schemes for different mobility scenarios. Results show that the performance of a scheme depends on the characteristics of the mobile network, and there is no single scheme which suits all mobility scenarios.

The TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement) mission comprises two nearly identical satellites: TerraSAR-X (TSX, launched in 2007), and TanDEM-X (TDX, launched in June 2010). The primary objective of the mission is to generate a worldwide and consistent digital elevation model (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy. During the first 3 months after its launch, the TDX satellite was tested and calibrated in monostatic configuration with both satellites flying in 20 km along-track distance, and it was proven that the system and acquisition performance is almost identical to TSX. Both satellites were then brought into close formation of a few hundred meters distance to begin the bistatic commissioning phase. Since then, TSX and TDX have acted as a large single-pass radar interferometer, which overcomes the limitations imposed by repeat-pass interferometry and allow the acquisition of highly accurate cross- and along-track interferograms. In December 2010, TanDEM-X began with operational global acquisition: bistatic and monostatic SAR images are simultaneously acquired in stripmap mode and processed to interferograms, from which a global DEM is derived. The key parameter in estimating interferometric performance is the coherence, which is deeply evaluated in this paper. The impact of different decorrelation sources as well as the performance stability over time is investigated by means of statistical analyses and dedicated acquisitions on defined test sites, demonstrating the outstanding interferometric capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission.

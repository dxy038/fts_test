The environmental acoustic reconnaissance and sounding experiment (EARS), is composed of two parts: the environmental acoustic reconnaissance (EAR) instrument and the environmental acoustic sounding experiment (EASE). They are distinct, but have the common objective of characterizing the acoustic environment of Mars.

incipal goal of the EAR instrument is “listening” to Mars. This could be a most significant experiment if one thinks of everyday life experience where hearing is possibly the most important sense after sight. Not only will this contribute to opening up this important area of planetary exploration, which has been essentially ignored until now, but will also bring the general public closer in contact with our most proximate planet.

s directed at characterizing acoustic propagation parameters, specifically sound velocity and absorption, and will provide information regarding important physical and chemical parameters of the lower Martian atmosphere; in particular, water vapor content, specific heat capacity, heat conductivity and shear viscosity, which will provide specific constraints in determining its composition. This would enable one to gain a deeper understanding of Mars and its analogues on Earth. Furthermore, the knowledge of the physical and chemical parameters of the Martian atmosphere, which influence its circulation, will improve the comprehension of its climate now and in the past, so as to gain insight on the possibility of the past presence of life on Mars. These aspect are considered strategic in the contest of its exploration, as is clearly indicated in NASA's four main objectives on “Long Term Mars Exploration Program” (http://marsweb.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/science).

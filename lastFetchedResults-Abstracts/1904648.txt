A novel method using a snare and bioptome to provide bidirectional control of a Gianturco coil for occlusion of a patent ductus arteriosus with a shallow ampulla and Pott's shunts is presented. This method greatly reduces the risk of coil embolization and optimizes coil position in difficult cases.

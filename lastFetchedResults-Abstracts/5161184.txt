The objective of this study is to develop (a) stable CaO insulator coatings at the liquid-Li/structural-material interface, with emphasis on electrically insulating coatings that prevent adverse MHD-generated currents from passing through the V-alloy wall, and (b) stable Be-V intermetallic coatings for first-wall components that face the plasma. Electrically insulating and corrosion-resistant coatings are required at the liquid-Li/structural interface in fusion first-wall/blanket applications. The electrical resistance of CaO coatings produced on oxygen-enriched surface layers of V-5%Cr-5%Ti by exposing the alloy to liquid Li that contained 0.5-85 wt.% dissolved Ca was measured as a function of time at temperatures between 250 and 600&#176;C. Crack-free Be<sub>2</sub>V intermetallic coatings were also produced by exposing V-alloys to liquid Li containing Be as a solute. These techniques can be applied to various shapes (e.g., inside/outside of tubes, complex geometrical shapes) because the coatings are formed by liquid-phase reactions

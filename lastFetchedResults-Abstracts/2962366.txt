A new VLSI design placement procedure is presented in this paper. The main feature of this procedure is that the placement problem is modeled as a nonlinear programming problem where the objective function uses a &#8220;target distance&#8221; approach to force cells &#8220;further apart&#8221;. An iterative construction method is proposed to place cells. This approach uses no partitioning techniques which are common in the placement approaches. This new approach is used on a set of proposed tested circuits

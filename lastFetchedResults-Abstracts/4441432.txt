A method is presented for optimization of a three-phase induction motor drive, followed by circuit configurations of a three-phase current source AC/DC converter for applications in AC drives. The objective is to improve the drive performance by using a control strategy for the inverter optimizing the quality of the rotational motion of the drive. This strategy is dependent upon motor operating conditions, and therefore it is developed in closed loop considering the nonlinear operation of the induction motor. The computational analysis of the complete system allows the accurate definition of the time response. The drive optimization, being dependent upon motor operation conditions, is defined by a pulse width modulation (PWM) technique that optimizes the output mechanical characteristics.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Background: Using Hospital Information Systems (HIS) is effective for reducing medical errors and provides timely access to high quality information. Therefore, all healthcare organizations are trying to implement them.
Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the success factors of hospital information system implementation. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 160 HIS users of educational hospitals in Urmia University of Medical Sciences in 2010 that were selected by multistage cluster random sampling. Data were collected by a self-developed questionnaire which its reliability and validity had been confirmed and results were presented by descriptive statistics. 
Findings: Among the four success factors of HIS implementation, the highest mean score was related to the project management (4.62±0.74) and the lowest mean score was related to the organizational factors (3.98±0.72).
Conclusion: With regard to the results, success in HIS implementation needs attention to the project management factors. Thus, the HIS implementation roadmap should be specified more precisely and the working group should be formed involving users and appropriate leadership.

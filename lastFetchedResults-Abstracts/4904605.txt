The evaluation of technical effects of connecting distributed generation to distribution networks is a complicated activity requiring a wide range of network operational and security characteristics to be qualified and quantified. This paper presents a Differential Evolution Algorithm for optimal allocation of distributed generation in distribution networks considering various technical and economical aspects of the problem. The optimization considers different technical issues like stability of systems voltage profile, capacity release of distribution system, voltage dependency of loads and different modes of DG operation as PV or PQ modes. Multi objective function that is to be minimized also consists of the costs associated with energy purchase from the grid and the DGs according to feed in tariffs and the cost of network upgrading.

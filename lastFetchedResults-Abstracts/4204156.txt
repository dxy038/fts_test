Promotion of distributed renewable energy sources is an economical off grid energy solution for remote locations providing both social and environmental advantages. Integration of different types of renewable energy sources presents challenge in terms of their power management, control &amp; stability. This paper presents power management of microgrid comprising of wind, microturbine as the sources, Battery energy storage system as stabilizer along with AC/DC load network connected by bidirectional converter. Control strategy and energy management of distributed sources is proposed for achieving smooth transfer of power and stable operation of system. Hybrid system consist of wind, Microturbine generator system and storage system is modeled and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK<sup>&#174;</sup> for different load and source variation scenarios. The simulation results shows that the system can maintain stable operation under the proposed method of control under varying conditions and also when the system is switched between autonomous and grid-tied modes maintaining voltage and frequency within limits.

The trajectory tracking control problem of a tracked vehicle with slipping is considered in this paper. The slipping effects are analyzed and modeled as three time-varying parameters, which can be estimated simultaneously with robotpsilas pose using nonlinear estimators such as unscented Kalman filter. Dynamic feedback linearization integrated with a globally exponential stabilizing state feedback is applied to achieve the tracking control objective. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

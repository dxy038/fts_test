Video shot partition is the first step towards content-based video analysis. The objective of this paper is to present a novel solution to this problem in detail. This solution is provided in the form of a combination of both spatial and temporal information that are interrelated to each other in video sequences. We model the required measure functions using a robust metric for visual and temporal content similarity and employ a seeded region growing based method to the visual and temporal features of video sequences. The experimental results are demonstrated regarding various transitions and the improvements are shown.

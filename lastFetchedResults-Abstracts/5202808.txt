In wireless sensor networks several constraints decrease communications performances. The main objective of this paper is to present a multi-objective routing algorithm RBCR that computes routing path based on the energy consumption and channel qualities. Additionally, the channel qualities are evaluated based on the presence of relay nodes. Compared to AODV and AODV associated to a cooperative MAC protocol, RBCR provides better performances.

The paper proposes a stable tracking fuzzy controller for a mobile robot (MR). Input to the vehicle are the reference position (x<sub>r</sub>, y<sub>r</sub>, thetas). The main objective is to propose a control algorithm to guide the robot from an initial position to a predefined target. One of the difficulties of this problem lies in the fact that the velocities posses two degree of freedom (translational (V) and angular (omega) although vehicles have three degree of freedom in the initial positioning. Another difficulty is the nonlinearity of the kinematicspsila relation between the translational and angular velocities on one side and between (x´, y´, thetas). The results obtained show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for practical use.

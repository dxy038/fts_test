Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPV) is a paroxysmal, non-epileptic, recurrent event characterized by subjective or objective vertigo that occurs in neurologically intact children. We recorded the history and the clinical aspects of 19 cases presenting with neurological problems to the outpatient clinic at the Pediatrics Department of Padova University between 1987 and 1998 and re-examined in 1999. Details were collected on the characteristics of their vertigo: age at onset, mode of onset, trigger factors, duration, frequency and recurrence of episodes, duration of symptoms in time and age at disappearance. An attempt was also made to establish any family history of migraine and kinetosis and the most important data were compared, when possible, with those reported in the literature. Differential diagnosis and pathogenetic hypothesis were also reported. It is worth emphasizing that it is important for pediatricians to be aware of these benign events to ensure a correct diagnostic approach, avoiding the child and family any pointless anxiety or costly and sometimes invasive diagnostic procedures

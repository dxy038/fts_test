A thorough analysis of a scalar control method for the operation of direct frequency changers (DFC) using bidirectional switches operating at high switching frequencies is proposed. The method allows full control over voltage and frequency at the output port and the input side power displacement factor, with little effect on the frequency spectrum of either the output voltage or input currents. The method uses the instantaneous voltage ratio of specific input phase voltages to generate the active and zero states of the various switches. A voltage transfer ratio as high as 0.87 is obtained under synchronous and asynchronous operation with a conventionally connected three-phase load. Analysis shows that the input power displacement factor is independent of load characteristics. The power displacement can be precisely controlled by proper adjustments of the timing sequence. Synchronization error in the timing sequence affects both the input power displacement and the voltage transfer ratio

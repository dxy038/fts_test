The goal of the research was to optimize the regression testing of the software application to address the identified problem of a missing, unclear or even contradictory requirement. The approach was mainly aimed at regression test prioritization and selection of regression test cases per test campaigns. A combination of subjective data based on expert knowledge and objective historical data were the inputs to the model where the output was determining the quality of test selection. Proposed model is aimed at finding newly introduced defects, and it could be extremely useful when the system is in the state of cleaning up or ordering requirements.

The objective of this paper is to compare and assess the performance of the conventional and hybrid high voltage direct current (HVDC) rectifiers based on the CIGRE benchmark model for both static and dynamic conditions with the phase lock loop (PLL) control replaced by PLL-less control. Traditional HVDC rectifier uses a 12-pulse thyristor bridge whereas the hybrid HVDC rectifier is based on one 6-pulse thyristor bridge and one 6-pulse diode bridge. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink. Some of the simulation results show that the hybrid option doesnÂ´t look too attractive in spite of the cost savings it offers.

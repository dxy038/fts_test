Precision in design of sprinkler irrigation systems and their proper management are very important for both development and also improvement of those systems. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the design and management of the solid-set sprinkler systems in Dehgolan plain located in Kurdistan province. For this purpose, 10 solid-set sprinkler systems were selected randomly and a few performance parameters such as: Christiansen's uniformity coefficient (CU), distribution uniformity (DU), potential application efficiency of low-quarter (PELQ) and application efficiency of low-quarter (AELQ) were estimated. The results of investigation showed the mean values of 66, 50.6, 44.8 and 43. 8%, for the above mentioned parameters, respectively. Also, the results of investigation showed both low PELQ values and water distribution uniformity of those evaluated systems compared to the recommended values by Merriam and Keller (1978). Moreover, due to deficit irrigation, except for one evaluated system, in all other systems, AELQ values were equal to PELQ. The results of our investigation also showed that non- suitable design and implementation of the evaluated systems were among the most important reasons for low values of PELQ, because of non-suitable operating pressure. The most important reasons for low water distribution uniformity were the simultaneous use of many sprinklers and also performance of different sprinklers models in a system. Finally, the results of our investigation showed poor operation for the evaluated systems in many cases.

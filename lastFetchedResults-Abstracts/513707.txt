Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between protamine deficiency, and acrosomal integrity with fertilization and pregnancy rate in patients undergone in vitro fertilization (IVF). Material &Methods: Semen samples from 70 infertile couples undergoing IVF at Isfahan Fertility and Infertility center were assessed in this study. Semen analysis was carried out according to WHO criteria. Protamine deficiency, Sperm morphology and acrosin activity were assessed by Chromomycin A3 (CMA3), Papanicolaou staining and Gelatinolysis tests, respectively. Coefficients of correlation and student t-test were carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Studies (SPSS 11.5) and Pvalue lower than 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Fertilization rate, percentage of halo formation, mean halo diameter and abnormal morphology show a significant correlation with percentage of CMA3 positivity. CMA3 positivity, percentage of halo, mean halo and sperm morphology showed a significant correlation with fertilization rate. Among the aforementioned parameters percentage of halo had the highest correlation. In the present study patients were divided into two groups according to pregnancy status. None of the studied parameters were significantly different between pregnant and non-pregnant patients. However, percentage of halo formation showed a slightly significant difference (r=0.306; P=0.058). Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that, even though sperm morphology, sperm protamine content and acrosome formation are events related to spermiogenesis, sperm acrosomal integrity assessed by percentage of halo formation has more profound effect on fertilization rate and pregnancy outcome during IVF procedure.

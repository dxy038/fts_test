Objective
The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of sociodemographic characteristics and environmental factors on self-reported menopause-related symptoms among middle-aged Swedish women.
Study design
Women who were born in the years 1935 to 1945 and who were living in the Lund area of southern Sweden were investigated. Each woman completed a generic questionnaire and underwent a personal interview that pertained to sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and current health-related problems. With these background factors, the frequency and intensity of hot flushes and vaginal dryness were determined; risk factor analysis was evaluated with the use of the multiple regression models.
Results
There were 6917 participants, with a response rate of 64%. A lower risk for hot flushes was related to older age, high education, and vigorous physical exercise. The major risk factors for vasomotor complaints were current weight gain, part-time employment, oophorectomy, unhealthy lifestyle, and concomitant health problems. Light smoking, late age of menopause, higher education, and excessive weight reduced the risk of vaginal dryness. However, older age, marriage, and chronic diseases negatively affected vaginal complaints. The background factors had less impact on symptoms in women who used hormone replacement therapy.
Conclusion
Sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and concomitant health problems appear to be important modifiable determinants for menopause-related symptoms.

The objective of this project is to extend the potential application of FMEA for a preventive purpose on a particular system. By measuring risk and planning preventing, scheduled maintenance for better decision making process operation and performance of a system is being observed and documented. The scope covers an existing project of a Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) project in Pulau Papan, Labuan Federal Territory. The project took advantage of rainwater as supplementary water source to meet needs of chalet users for non-potable water use despite having the principal water source delivered through pipeline that runs across the waters to its jetty. As failures of such for RWH projects were noted in Malaysia, the project team emphasized on aspect of `Total Maintenance Capability´ by applying FMEA unto the system as a major general attention on issue associated with poor maintenance processes.

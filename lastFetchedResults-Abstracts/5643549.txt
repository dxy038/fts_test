Image is an objective reflection of natural scenery. The light information of objects´ projection or reflection forms an impression or understanding in the brain after received by the human visual system. Image processing is to process and dispose by some mathematical operation on the image information in order to meet the human visual and physical needs. This paper analyzes and compares the existing Image enhancement algorithm based on fuzzy set theory and proposes a new image detection algorithm. This algorithm utilizing the generalized fuzzy enhancement ideas and considering the region characteristics of the image´s object area, background area and the edge area, proposes a faster and better enhancement operator of the edge detection which is especially for detecting low contrast images, images with finer part, and texture-rich images.

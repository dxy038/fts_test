A three-phase AC-DC converter is proposed to charge the battery or DC-link of Wireless Electric Vehicles (WEVs). The topology uses a current-feed, single-output matrix converter and a high frequency (HF) transformer together with an H bridge to obtain regulated DC output voltage, such that the galvanic isolation of the transformer may be used as the wireless link. The converter uses a variant of a predictive current control strategy by calculating a one-step ahead current sample, such that the input currents become virtually sinusoidal with unity power factor, offering the possibility of handling bidirectional power flow. The paper describes the principle of operation of the converter together with a numerical verification of the system under dynamic conditions.

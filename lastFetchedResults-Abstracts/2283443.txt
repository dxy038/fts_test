The objective of this study was to estimate nutritive values of Brassica carinata meal including rumen degradation kinetics profiles, intestinal and total digestion of each feed nutrient as well as predicted nutrients supply using the DVE/OEB system in comparison with canola meal. The nutritive value will be used for a new feed registration in Canadian Food Inspection Agency. B. carinata meal had significant higher (P &lt; 0.05) rumen degradation rate of organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) than canola meal. Intestinal digestibility of bypass OM was lower (P &lt; 0.05) for B. carinata meal than those for canola meal. The value of true protein digested in the intestine predicted by the DVE/OEB system was 153 g/kg DM, which was similar with that in canola meal, and B. carinata meal had a positive degraded protein balance (248 g/kg DM). In conclusion, B. carinata meal had similar characteristics on most of parameters related to rumen degradation, total digestion and metabolizable protein supply with canola meal.

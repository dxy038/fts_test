A novel real number encoding method of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Vehicle Routing Problem is proposed. Objective is to solve the vehicle routing problem with fuzzy demands (FVRP), in FVRP, a fuzzy chance constrained program model is designed, based on fuzzy credibility theory. numerical experiments are carried out, and the algorithm is compared with other heuristic methods for the same problem.

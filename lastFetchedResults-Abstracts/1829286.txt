Non-small cell lung Cancer (NSCLC) is extremely resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin. High expression of the inflammatory enzyme Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been shown to inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, but little is known about COX-2 regulation upon drug treatment. Recent data indicate the tumor suppressor protein p53 as an important regulator of COX-2. Therefore, TP53 status could change tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy through induction of the anti-apoptotic protein COX-2. The main objective of this work was to analyze the effect of chemotherapy on the expression of COX-2, according to TP53 status. We report herein that lung cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53, when exposed to cisplatin treatment, induced COX-2 (mRNA and protein), with concurrent synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2). In contrast, COX-2 expression was not changed after cisplatin treatment of cells containing an inactive form of p53. Further, after silencing of wild-type p53 expressed in A549 cells by RNA interference, cisplatin was no longer able to induce COX-2 expression. Therefore, we suggest that induction of COX-2 by cisplatin in NSCLC cell lines is dependent on p53. For paclitaxel treatment, an increase in COX-2 mRNA expression was observed in H460 and A549 (wild-type p53 cell lines). Moreover, paclitaxel treatment increased COX-2 expression in ACC-LC-319 cell lines (p53 null), showing a p53-independent effect. These data may have therapeutic implications in the selection of patients and strategy for future COX-2 inhibition trials.

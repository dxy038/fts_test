The stabilization problem of the upright position of the controlled spherical pendulum is treated in detail. This problem is reduced to the stabilization of the stable manifold &#937;<sub>st</sub> of the upright position of the unforced spherical pendulum. It is shown that for any smooth feedback control derived by the speed-gradient algorithm with the objective to stabilize &#937;<sub>st</sub> the closed loop system has a limit cycle &#915;, which does not belong to the desired attractor &#937;<sub>st</sub>. It is shown that &#915; is hyperbolic

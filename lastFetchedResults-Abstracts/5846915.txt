A local map based (LMB) network self-healing scheme is proposed. It uses the network topology information available in small-sized data tables known as local maps, stored in each network node to restore disrupted traffic. The size of the local maps can be varied to cope with different types of failures. The time-consuming alternate path seeking process in the distributed restoration is replaced by simple searching and sorting algorithms executed in individual DCS node. This allows localized restoration and leads to significant improvement in the failure recovery time, spare resource utilization and restoration message volume. Simulations with different sets of parameters have shown that the restoration time is well below the standard 2-second service restoration objective

Objective
e has an important role in the brain. Prolidase, a proline splitting enzyme, which is also involved in oxidative stress is not investigated in bipolar disorder (BD).
s
type I patients and 66 healthy controls were enrolled. Serum prolidase activity was measured in both groups via venous sampling. We have compared patients and controls as well as 3 subgroups of patients (24 euthymic, 22 manic, and 20 depressive patients).
s
ase activity was significantly higher in patients (p &lt; 0.001, t = 14.517). There wasn't any significant difference among euthymic, manic and depressives (p = 0.305, f = 1.211). Positive predictive value was 98.5% and negative predictive value was 92.4% above the cutoff point 502.9375 U/L of prolidase activity.
sion
ase activity is impaired in BD, which may be associated with oxidative stress. Prolidase activity may be a trait marker for diagnosing bipolar disorder.

This paper describes the processing at ONERA of part of the signals acquired during the Swedish-French bistatic airborne SAR experiment Lorambis. Though this campaign had for primary objective of assessing the interest of stationary bistatic configurations in UHF wide-band SAR imaging, the opportunity was taken to explore some innovative non-stationary configurations. This paper focuses on the processing of the signals acquired during these explorative acquisitions. Geometries of the acquisitions are described, specific SAR processing difficulties encountered are described and resulting images are shown.

In this paper an algorithm based on genetic algorithm is proposed to solve service restoration problem in power distribution systems with priority customers. In genetic algorithm new solutions are found in every next generation with probability of getting the better solution till the optimal solution is not found. Service restoration problem is formulated as multi-objective multi-constraint combinatorial optimization problem. The integer permutation scheme is used to generate the offspring in genetic algorithm. Integer permutation does not allow the hamming cliff problem. In case of partial restoration, including capacitor control action that increases the power transfer capacity reduces out-of-service area. The operating time of manual and automatic controlled switches is significantly different. Therefore both type of switches are considered separately. The comprehensive simulation results of proposed method including single fault and multi faults are presented for five test systems of different size

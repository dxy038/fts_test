Objective
Aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of carbamide peroxide (CP) on enamel fluoride uptake by comparing enamel fluoride uptake from a 1% amine fluoride (AmF) gel with the fluoride acquisition from a 10% carbamide peroxide agent supplemented with 1% AmF.
Materials and methods

Three enamel cylinders (4 mm in diameter) were prepared from the buccal surfaces of 60 bovine incisors. One sample of each tooth was used for determination of baseline fluoride content of the respective tooth. The two remaining samples were allocated to the experimental series 1 or 2, respectively. Each series consisted of five experimental groups (A–E, n = 12) and differed with respect to the length of the treatment period with the gels (A–D). The experimentally designed gels (pH 5.5) used in the study were as follows: A (10% CP), B (10% CP, 1% F− as AmF), C (1% F− as AmF), D (no CP, no F−) and were formulated on the same basis. The enamel samples were covered for 4 h with the respective gel at 37 °C and were then transferred to artificial saliva for 20 h (series 1). The samples of group E served as controls and were not treated with a gel. In series 2, treatment with the gels and storage in saliva was conducted seven times. Finally, the samples were assessed for KOH-soluble and structurally bound fluoride.
Results

Only the enamel samples treated with the fluoridated bleaching gel (group B) and with the amine fluoride gel (group C) exhibited significant fluoride acquisition. Thereby, both gels showed significantly lower uptake in series 1 as compared to series 2. Both KOH-soluble and structurally bound fluoride acquisition was significantly higher in group C than in group B.
Conclusion

Treatment with a carbamide peroxide gel supplemented with amine fluoride causes less fluoride acquisition in enamel than a pure amine fluoride gel. Under the conditions of the study, it is assumed that carbamide peroxide seems to influence enamel fluoride uptake.

Optimization of process parameters is an important aspect in manufacturing engineering. Multi-objective optimization of process parameters is a complex process. Pareto-optimal solution methodologies are widely used now-a-days. The present investigation focuses on the three objective multiple performance optimization of drilling parameters in drilling of composite drilling process. The objective of this research is to optimize the drilling parameters in drilling such as spindle speed, feed speed and drill diameter on maximizing material removal rate and minimizing thrust force and surface roughness in drilling of composites. The experiments are conducted on computer numeric control (CNC) drilling machine with carbide drill bit. Second order regressions are developed for responses. Based on the equations non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the drilling conditions. A non-dominated solution set has been obtained and presented in this study.

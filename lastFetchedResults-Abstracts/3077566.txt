In current very deep submicron (VDSM) circuits, incremental routing is crucial to incorporating engineering change orders (ECOs) late in the design cycle. In this paper, we address the important incremental routing objective of satisfying timing constraints in high-speed designs while minimizing wirelength, vias and routing layers. We develop an effective timing-driven (TD) incremental routing algorithm TIDE for ASIC circuits that addresses the dual goals of time-efficiency, and slack satisfaction coupled with effective optimizations. There are three main novelties in our approach: (i) a technique for locally determining slack satisfaction of the entire routing tree when either a new pin is added to the tree or an interconnect in it is re-routed - this technique is used in both the global and detailed routing phases; (ii) an interval-intersection and tree-truncation algorithm, used in global routing, for quickly determining a near-minimum-length slack-satisfying interconnection of a pin to a partial routing tree; (iii) a depth-first-search process, used in detailed routing, that allows new nets to bump and re-route existing nets in a controlled manner in order to obtain better optimized designs. Experimental results show that within the constraint of routing all nets in only two metal layers, TIDE succeeds in routing more than 94% of ECO-generated nets, and also that its failure rate is 7 and 6.7 times less than that of the TD versions of previous incremental routers Standard (Std) and Ripup &amp; Reroute (R &amp; R), respectively. It is also able to route nets with very little (3.4%) slack violations, while the other two methods have appreciable slack violations (16-19%). TIDE is about 2 times slower than the simple TD-Std method, but more than 3 times faster than TD-R&amp;R

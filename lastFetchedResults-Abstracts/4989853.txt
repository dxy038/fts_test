This paper proposes an energy efficient antennas allocation method for network-coded MIMO multicast communications. By means of the definition of a suitable objective function it is shown that it is possible to select the optimal number of antennas in transmission/reception and the most convenient modulation scheme in order to minimize both the overall mean energy consumption and delivery delay. Simulation results are provided in the paper in order to validate the proposed optimization method and to highlight its advantages in comparison with similar rate-based approaches already proposed in literature, where symbol error rate is evaluated as a comparing metric for MIMO performance.

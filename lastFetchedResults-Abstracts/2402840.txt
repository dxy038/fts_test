The Algero–Provençal and the Tyrrhenian extensional basins developed in two stages in a geodynamic setting characterized by the nearly N–S convergence between Africa and Eurasia. The spreading of the Provençal basin occurred in the early Miocene following a long period of rifting in the western Mediterranean area. A dramatic eastward shift of the active extensional deformation resulted in the Tortonian to Quaternary opening of the Tyrrhenian basin. In a companion paper, Carminati et al. propose that: a trench retreat process in a geodynamic setting locked by the continental collisions in the Alps and in the Betic chain is a viable mechanism for the late Oligocene–early Langhian opening of the western Mediterranean; a Langhian slab detachment episode along the north African margin is likely to have caused the end of the trench retreat along this part of the boundary determining the end of active expansion in the western Mediterranean and the beginning of active extension in the Tyrrhenian basin. The objective of the present paper is to quantitatively test this proposed scenario. We calculate, by means of a thin shell model, the effects of these plate boundary reorganizations on the European stress and strain field. We show that the two-stage opening of the western and central Mediterranean can be explained by the evolution proposed by Carminati et al. and that, in particular, the eastward shift of the active extension which produced the termination of the first opening stage and the beginning of the second is likely to have been triggered by the slab detachment episode along the north African margin.

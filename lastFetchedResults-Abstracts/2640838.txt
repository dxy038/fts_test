Background and Objective: The childhood obesity is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease throughout the lifecycle. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between adiponectin, leptin, cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels in the overweight girls after 12 weeks moderate intensity aerobic exercise training.

Materials and Methods: This research was conducted with a semi- experimental methodology with pre-test and post-test. Nineteen overweight girls (aged 9.8Â±1.5 years) after getting consent volunteered for this study. Subjects performed moderate intensity aerobic exercise training for 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected after overnight fasting, before and after 12 weeks of exercise training program. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed using an enzymatic colorimetric assay (GPO-PAP). Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Data analysis was performed by  paired sample t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, regression analysis and a significant level of p < 0.05 was considered. 

Results: Body fat percentage, circulating levels of triglyceride and leptin of participants as compared to baseline after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise decreased and adiponectin significantly increased (p < 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between leptin with body mass index (r=577, p < 0.01) and adiponectin (r=621, p < 0.025). Also, there was a significant correlation between adiponectin with cholesterol (r=592, p < 0.05), body fat percentage (r=612, p < 0.05) and body mass index (r=741, p < 0.05).   

Conclusion: Moderate intensity aerobic exercise training caused favorable changes in body fat percentage and obesity-related metabolic biomarkers in prepubertal overweight girls.

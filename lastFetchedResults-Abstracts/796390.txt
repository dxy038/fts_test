Abstract

Introduction: An ABA single-subject design study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of constraint induced movement therapy in improvement of quality and performance of in-hand manipulation skills for a 10-year old boy and a 9-year old girl with hemiplegic cerebral palsy as showed by Dickerson (2007) in arm movement and function.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of CIMT through C-statistic analysis and visual analysis.
Materials and Methods: The first step was to design a child-friendly intervention program for both clinical and home settings in order to involve the subjects in group therapy activities. During intervention period, the effectiveness of CIMT was evaluated by daily measurement and video recording of 6 sub-skills of in-hand manipulation in specific activities according to Pontâ€™s category (2009).
Results: For making the treatment more cost-effective, families can create a simple clinical setting at home and actively participate in their child treatment plan.
Conclusion: A client-centered intervention will facilitate the use and quality of finger and hand motion. Moreover, group activities can encourage clients to participate more and better in therapy.

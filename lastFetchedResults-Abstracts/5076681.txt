A modular multilevel converter (MMC) is one of the next-generation multilevel PWM converters intended for high- or medium-voltage power conversion without transformers. The MMC consists of cascade connection of multiple bidirectional PWM chopper-cells and floating dc capacitors per leg, thus requiring voltage-balancing control of their chopper-cells. However, no paper has been discussed explicitly on voltage-balancing control with theoretical and experimental verifications. This paper deals with two types of modular multilevel PWM converters with focus on their circuit configurations and voltage-balancing control. Combination of averaging and balancing controls enables the MMCs to achieve voltage balancing without any external circuit. The viability of the MMCs as well as the effectiveness of the PWM control method is confirmed by simulation and experiment.

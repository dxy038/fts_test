Moving the dialysis treatment from the nephrology clinic to the patientÂ´s point of need, instead of moving patients to the nephrology clinic, is a great challenge today. The main objective of work presented in this the paper is the development of a universal system, suitable for European environment, for the management, control and monitoring of wearable and portable dialysis devices. The paper discusses its design and presents briefly the main components of the experimental Personal Health System, emphasizing also the main advantages of using such approach. The results of implementing a dialysis device simulator based on standard IEEE specification are also discussed. The system proposal is created based on collaboration among the University of Applied Sciences Munich, Germany, the University of Padova, Italy, and the University of Groningen, the Netherlands with participation of partner universities, hospitals and companies from Germany, Italy, and Romania.

Mountains are usually formation origin of their neighbor land surface features such as hillsides and plains. some problems and errors may occur in application of RS technique for generation of geology maps and in separation of these units from other similar units. The main objective of this study is to integrate RS and geomorphology approaches for identification of different geomorphology units and finally separation of debris lime stones from massive lime stones in Bahadoran region, Yazd province. For this purpose, a Landsat ETM+ image was acquired together with band ratios, principal component analysis and factor analysis approaches to generate lime stone distribution map. Results of this study show that (integration of RS and geomorphology sciences) can better generate the lime stone distribution map compared with the first one

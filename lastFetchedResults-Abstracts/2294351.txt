The analysis of the mechanical capabilities and drawbacks of the main CMC's available at the moment highlights the potential of oxide/oxide composites for applications in turbine engines as combustor walls. New processing routes based on liquid infiltration using alkoxides or reaction-bonding techniques are presented with the objective to develop non-oxidable CMC's at lower manufacturing cost than SiC/SiC composites.

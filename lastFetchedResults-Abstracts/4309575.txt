This paper proposes the conditional replenishment algorithm (CRA) to improve the visual quality of hybrid stereoscopic 3DTV where the spatial resolutions of left and right views are mismatched. The basic concept of CRA is to determine the better replacement from disparity compensated view and simply enlarged view in generating the enhanced right view. The simulation results show that the proposed CRA can successfully improve the objective quality of the poor view and give positive effect on the final 3D visual quality.

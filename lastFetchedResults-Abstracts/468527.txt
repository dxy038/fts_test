Objective: We sought to investigate whether angiogenesis can predict the risk of recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after treatment. Study Design: Microvessel density was studied in 75 patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and in 20 patients with microinvasive squamous carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA1) of the uterine cervix by staining representative tissue sections with the specific endothelial marker anti-CD31. The microvessel density was determined with a digital image analyzer. The results were correlated with clinical and histopathologic data. Results: The mean vessel density was 264 per field (range, 86-674 per field) in grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 378 per field (range, 161-848 per field; P = .001) in microinvasive squamous carcinoma. Thirteen patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia had recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (microvessel density, recurrent vs nonrecurrent; not significant). Multiple regression analysis in the noninvasive group confirmed that the mean vessel density (P = .121) had no prognostic value. Furthermore, it showed that the age at diagnosis (P = .011), menopausal status (P = .052), and treatment modality (P = .022) proved to be independent prognostic factors for recurrence. Conclusions: During the progression from noninvasive to microinvasive cervical carcinoma, the microvessel density increases significantly. However, the vessel density does not predict recurrence of noninvasive lesions. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:554-9.)

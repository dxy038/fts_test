The optimization of schedule control subsystem, cost control subsystem, resource control subsystem and quality control subsystem is based on the technology of engineering network planning. According to the principle of system coordinating control, the model of coordinating function is established and the evaluation criteria system of coordinating degree is designed. With the combination of four targets-short time limit, low cost, proportionate resources and high quality and AHP method, we can get the most proportionate network planning whose validity is verified through illustration.

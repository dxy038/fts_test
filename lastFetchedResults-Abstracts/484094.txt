Barbus shunrcyi in family Cyprinidae is an endemic fish of the Khozstan province of
Iran. The Iranian Fisherie Organization (Shilau produces up to 1-5 million Ir) (1-2 g b.w. I
to restock the horal azcm and lagoon Shadgan population annuully.Thesc fish arc produced
by artificial breeding using carp pituitary extract (CPE). The objective of this study was to
assay the effectiveness of a gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue {D-Ala6, I'r09-NI't
CinRH) in combination with the dopamine antagonist dornpcridonc (DOM) on spawning
success, latency period, weight of stripped egg mass-weight of stripped egg rnaxstrcmnant
ovaries, and fertilization success in Barbus sharpeyi, Seventy \\\0 fish were divided into 12
groups and injected intraperitoneally as follows: 5 mg.kg, b.w. of CPE as positive control,
Gnkl la and nOM 30 Ilg/kg, b.w. double injection (10-9()'YO) 24 h apart. Propylene glycol
injected fish were used as negative controls. The results showed that the GnRIIa and DOM
in two injection lead to higher spawning success and weight ofstripncd egg mass.weight of
stripped egg mass, and fertilization success and spaw ning rate and latency period in
comparison with positive control (I' <().OS), while no significant differences inhaching
percent and embryo viability and masuring egg were found ( 1'<(),05). ihcrcforc, it can be
concluded that like many other cyprinids, dopamine inhibitory tone is activ C in Burbus
sharpcv! and it is necessary to combine GnRHa with a dopamine antagonist for spa\\ ning
induction.

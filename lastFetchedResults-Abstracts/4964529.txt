The objective of this paper is to propose an improved delta modulation (IDM) control scheme for DC-DC buck converters. The proposed IDM has various slope of carrier signal by feed forward the input control signal into the integrator of the delta modulator. It can overcome the drawback of the conventional delta modulation (CDM), which can not be applied to DC-DC converters. In this paper, the operation principle of the proposed IDM is introduced. The effect of the circuit parameter variation to the converter performance is presented, too. Finally, both the computer simulation and experimental results show that the proposed IDM control scheme can achieve very stable output voltages with fast transient response.

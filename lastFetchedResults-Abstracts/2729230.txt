This study proposes a man-in-loop control method to boost reactive power reserves (RPRs) while maintaining a minimum amount of voltage stability margin (VSM) bus voltage limits. The objective is to determine the most effective control actions in order to reestablish critical RPRs across the system. Initially, the concept of reactive power reserve sensitivity with respect to control actions is introduced. In the sequel, a control approach based on convex quadratic optimization is used to find the minimal amount of control necessary to increase RPRs above their pre-specified (offline) levels. Voltage stability margin constraints are incorporated using a linear approximation of critical RPRs.

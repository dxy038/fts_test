We have developed techniques for effectively incorporating Ga in CIGS within the confines of our manufacturing-friendly process. Near Cu/(In+Ga)=1 collection lengths of 1-2 &#956;m can be attained resulting in consistent Jsc´s of 40 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. As the metal ratio is decreased below 1, there is an unusual abrupt increase in Eg of 50 mV and a significant deterioration of electronic properties. These properties are discussed in terms of interplay between process control of kinetics and thermodynamics and the dictates of the phase diagram. A key objective which we have attained is the ability to independently optimize surface and bulk properties. Using these techniques we have raised our Voc´s above 500 mV for devices with band gaps of 0.95 eV and have achieved 13% device efficiency

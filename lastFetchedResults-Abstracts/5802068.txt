Objective Video Quality Measurement (VQM) overcomes inefficiency of subjective Video Quality Assessment (VQA) in time and resources of survey. It uses video attributes such as video signal, noise signal, and encoder parameters to assess user-perceived quality. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) as one of objective VQM has been widely used to measure video quality. However, this conventional PSNR demonstrates inaccuracy of measurement while applied to measure video stream over wireless and mobile network. It is due to packet loss issue in the wireless and mobile network. This paper discusses evaluation of MPSNR as preexisting solution for this issue. In this paper, a concept of dynamic window size is used to improve accuracy of frame lost detection. The concept is named Aligned-PSNR (APSNR). An experiment is conducted to evaluate accuracy of the APSNR. The result is benchmarked with conventional PSNR based on Pearson product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PMCC) value.

A low-loss, constant-frequency, zero voltage switching (ZVS) modulation strategy for bidirectional buck dc-dc converter, applied to hybrid energy storage system, is proposed in this paper. The synchronous rectification and soft-switching techniques are adopted to reduce the power conversion loss. As the modulation strategy is a software-only solution, there are no additional expenses for the active or passive components. The mathematical model and operation principle of the converter are presented respectively. Simulation and experimental results verified the theoretical analysis, and the highest efficiency of the proposed converter is about 95.5%.

The objective of the present study is to investigate the mechanical behavior of windshield laminated glass in the case of a pedestrian's head impact. Windshield FE models were set up using different combinations for the modeling of glass and PVB, with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm and 10 mm). Each windshield model was impacted with a standard adult headform impactor in an LS-DYNA simulation environment, and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results indicated that the behavior of the windshield model with a double-layered shell of glass and PVB and a tied element connection support test results from previous studies. Furthermore, the influence of glass fracture stress on the same windshield model was investigated, and the cracked area and the peak value of the headform's linear acceleration were determined by the critical fracture stress. It was observed that a 50-MPa fracture stress in the glass best predicted the observed headform's linear acceleration level and the cracks of the windshield at the time of impact.

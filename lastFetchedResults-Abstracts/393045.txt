The objective of the study is to describe an unusual case of bilateral nasal hamartoma. We report a 52-year-old male patient with a bilateral paranasal hamartoma of the ethmoid and maxillary sinus. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed to completely remove the masses.
The hamartoma is a benign rare tumor constituted by a mixture of tissue. It is very unusual in the nasal cavity.
The reported localization is unusual because the most common site in the nose is the posterior septum. Although hamartoma arising from the rhino sinusal region is very rare, head and neck surgeons must know this entity in order to differentiate it from inverted papilloma and adenocarcinoma. Misinterpretation of this lesion may result in aggressive surgery for a benign lesion.

Surface water pollution is one of the greatest environmental problems faced by large cities in China. Therefore, it is an important mission for these cities to enhance water environmental management, as well as preventing and remedying water pollution. With the worsening of water quality, there is a stricter requirement for water environmental management in cities and the relative areas. Consequently, the method of digital management is very requirement and development trend of regional environmental management. For systemically, speedy and effectively to improving the surface water quality and urban environmental quality, within the article, urban water quality information management system, based on Visual Basic 6.0, is explored and constructed on Arc GIS platform by the secondary exploitation of Arc Engine geographic information system. This article briefs the objective and constitution of these subsystems, and introduces the function of data management subsystem, outfall management subsystem as well as water quality prediction subsystem, which based on brief introduction about the aim and constitution of this subsystem. As a subsystem of urban synthetically information system, an urban water environmental information management system based on GIS and is also a complicated system relating to many social aspects. Moreover, the construction and the process of the system have quite reference-valued for the implementation of digital environmental management and reforming the water environmental quality in many cities.

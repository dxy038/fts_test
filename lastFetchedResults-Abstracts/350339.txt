The efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is well known to prevent the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by these agents. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the hemodynamic, biochemical, and morphological responses to Ang II receptor blockade with E-4177, 3-[(2â€²-carboxybiphenyl-4-yl) methyl]-2-cyclopropyl-7-methyl 3H-imidazol[4,5-b] pyridine, in rats with a healing myocardial infarction that had been induced by the surgical occlusion of the left main coronary artery. The left ventricular weight increased 8 and 12 weeks after infarction in comparison to that in sham-operated rats. Among the rats with experimental infarction, treatment with E-4177 significantly decreased the left ventricular weight. Although the infarct size was not affected by E-4177, its administration ameliorated the elevated end-diastolic pressure and reduced the systolic pressure. The effects of this agent on the levels of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor mRNA and ACE mRNA were evaluated in the non-infarcted myocardium by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and binding assays. Treatment with E-4177 reduced both the elevated AT1 mRNA and the number of Ang II receptors, but not the ACE mRNA or ACE activity. While the receptor affinity remained unchanged with this agent, the collagen concentration was decreased. On the other hand, the depressed Na+/Ca2+exchange activity was restored in the non-infarcted myocardium at 8 and 12 weeks after injury to the level seen in the sham-operated rats. These findings suggest that the AT1 receptor antagonist, E-4177, has a beneficial effect on the hemodynamics in spite of the lack of any improvement in the infarct size. These observations may be partly attributed to the prevention of angiotensin II formation during the period of post-infarction healing.

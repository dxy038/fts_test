The proposed algorithm is different from the classical DE in the process of mutation. The mutation is carried out with three vectors; one is the local best, other is the global best and third one is selected as randomly. The improved mutation operation is more explicit directional than classic ED, and it push the trial vector quickly towards the global optima. It effectively guarantees the convergence of the algorithm and the diversity solutions. On this basis, a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to handle the EED. The performance of algorithm has been examined over the standard IEEE 30 bus six generator test system, and other multi-objective evolutionary algorithm are compared. Testing and comparing results showed the effectiveness of the algorithm.

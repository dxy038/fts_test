We focus on the problem of scheduling n independent jobs on m identical parallel machines with the objective of minimizing total tardiness of the jobs considering a job splitting property. In this problem, it is assumed that a job can be split into sub-jobs and these sub-jobs can be processed independently on parallel machines. We develop several dominance properties and lower bounds for the problem, and suggest a branch and bound algorithm using them. Computational experiments are performed on randomly generated test problems and results show that the suggested algorithm solves problems of moderate sizes in a reasonable amount of computation time.
Scope and purpose
In this paper, we consider an operations scheduling problem in a real manufacturing system that produces printed circuit boards (PCBs). In the PCB manufacturing system, production orders are specified by the product types, production quantities and due dates. In a bottleneck workstation of the manufacturing system, in which there are multiple parallel machines, a job required for a production order can be split into basic processing units, each of which can be processed on a machine. We present an algorithm that can give an optimal schedule for a scheduling problem in the workstation for the objective of minimizing total tardiness of production orders. Since meeting due dates of customersâ€™ orders become more and more important for the survival of a manufacturing company in highly competitive market environments of these days, the algorithm may provide the company with a competitive edge in the industry.

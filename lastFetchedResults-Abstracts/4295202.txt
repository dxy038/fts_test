This paper provides a range of examples that can be used to support utilities prepare and engage with the requirements around PAS-55. The perceived benefits of PAS-55 are increasingly acknowledged to facilitate better decision- making and execution for all operations supporting the delivery of optimum life and/or capacity of assets, optimising capital expenditure and reducing whole life asset costs. We explore the aspirations behind the desire for asset management system alignment to PAS 55, beyond simply a management objective, to a desire to be best in class and the tangible benefits that accrue whilst on the journey. We include examples from organisations looking to gain PAS-55 certification, and their progression through the transitional phase, highlighting the re-alignment of process and culture as well as the organisational aspects necessary to deliver best value from implementation of a PAS-55 based system. The paper identifies the cultural shift as perhaps the most difficult and lengthy aspect of the transitional processes to embed, but nevertheless successful implementation holds the key to the realisation of greatest value from the process.

Background
Unilateral neck exploration (UNE) is a well-recognized approach in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP). The objective of this study was to review the success of an approach involving UNE guided by preoperative sestamibi (SM) scanning.
Methods

All data were gathered by retrospective chart review. All patients undergoing surgery for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism at a tertiary referral center over a 3-year period were included in the study cohort.
Results

Fifty-two of 80 patients (65%) had an SM scan consistent with a solitary adenoma and were eligible for a UNE, with 57.5% (46/80) undergoing a UNE. Seventy-seven of 80 (96.3%) patients were normocalcemic after initial neck exploration. UNE was curative in 50 of 52 (96.2%) UNE eligible patients and required less operative time than bilateral neck exploration (mean, 60 versus 87 minutes).
Conclusion

Selective unilateral neck exploration, guided by preoperative SM scanning, is an effective surgical approach for the management of primary hyperparathyroidism.

This paper deals with the optimal design of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Firstly, the general rules and principles of motor optimization are summarized, and a field-circuit coupled optimal design method is presented based on combined selection of variable parameters, objective functions and constraint conditions. Then, choosing multiple structural dimensions as variables, parametric analysis is made to research the influence of structural design parameters on performance of the PMSM. On this basis, an optimal design for a two-pole line-start PMSM is made, which can successfully reduce the dosage of permanent magnet and improve the performance-price ratio.

We propose an adaptive reservation scheme designed to operate in association with the Multiple Guard Channel (MGC) admission control policy. The scheme adjusts the MGC configuration parameters by continuously tracking the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by users, adapting to any mix of aggregated traffic and enforcing a differentiated treatment among arrival streams during underload and overload episodes. We provide two implementations of the scheme. The performance evaluation carried out verifies that the QoS objective is met with an excellent precision and that it converges rapidly to new operating conditions. Other key features of our scheme are its simplicity, its oscillation-free behavior, and its integrated strategy to deal with multiservice scenarios.

Wild Roses contain high content of some nutrients. They are of interest for the food, cosmetics and health industries. This paper discusses the chemical composition and physical parameters of the various species studied trying to relate compositional trends with specific varieties, as well as the effect of processing conditions on nutrient retention. For that purpose published data is reviewed, experimental values from nutrients content of Rosa eglanteria are obtained and the stability of these nutrients during the drying process is evaluated, in order to provide objective evidence for the analysis of wild roses fruits in the food manufacturing industry. Besides, the products that are mainly obtained from wild roses fruit, particularly that of the Rosa eglanteria would be presented.

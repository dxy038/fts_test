This paper addresses the management of photonic networks. It presents the first achievements of the ACTS-MEPHISTO project. The projectÂ´s general objective is to extend the principles of network management (TMN) to generic all-optical networks, in which wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) will be implemented far transmission and routing. This includes the development of information models for optical networks and network elements, of management applications and test platforms to demonstrate fault, configuration and performance management of optical networks, and the promotion of the developed models within ACTS and standardisation bodies. The functional architecture and early information models for the management of optical networks and network elements are described

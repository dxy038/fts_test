The objective of this article is to analyze the use of the WIKI model in a distance education program for education students taking a fourth semester course in distance education at the Federal University of Ceara&#769; in the second semester of 2009 (August though December). Involved in this study were nineteen students and five teachers who used the MOODLE system (Course Management System). Other tools outside WIKI were used to develop academic activities such as: group discussions; debates and developing writing skills: email, chat, electronic board, forums, etc. By observing the use of these tools (mainly WIKI) we concluded that it is very difficult to obtain learning objectives through models that demand collaboration and participation among students. Based on this research our study group surmised that inherited educational methods based on individual merits inhibit collaboration and dialog in learning processes both face-to-face and distance learning.

The present work consists of a three-phase induction motor speed control using the fuzzy set technique, and the classical control theories. A computational tool was developed from the induction motor dynamic model, which will be able to simulate the motor from steady state to transients.. The main objective of this work is to compare the proposed configuration with the classical PI controller. So, a comparative study was made between the fuzzy controller and the PI classical controller and the results obtained allowed checking of the efficiency of the former against the latter

Background and objective: This study was established to determine the lymnaea stagnalis snailsâ€™ infection with trematodes larval stage in one of the springs of the Shahrekord city in Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari.
Materials and methods: To determine the snail infection to trematodes larval stages, the snails were caught from the field, and transferred to the Parasitology department of   Razi Vaccine and Serum research Institute. Then stimulating of snails by light, tubing and squashing of them were used to detection and identification of the isolated cercariae.
Results: Of 400 collected Snails from the referred springs, 320 of them identified as lymnaea stagnalis. Observed cercariae were identified and classificated as order Plagiorchis, family plagiorchiidae and genus opisthioglyphe and plagiorchis.
In Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari province due to having more than 10% of water content of country, ecological conditions can play important role to developing sensitive snail especially Lymnaeidae and be considered as  a critical and suitable habitat for them.

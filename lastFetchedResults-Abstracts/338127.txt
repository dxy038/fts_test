Objective
One of the mechanisms for mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells is alternation of adhesion molecules. We investigated the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells in blood by administration of anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 antibody (Ab) in mice.
Materials and Methods
Twelve- to 14-week-old C57BL/6J mice were injected intravenously with anti-VCAM-1 Ab and anti-very late antigen (VLA)-4 Ab at a dose of 5 mg/kg for 2 days.
Results
The number of colony-forming cells (CFCs) in blood was increased 11.4-fold after anti-VCAM-1 Ab treatment, but the number of CFCs was not increased after treatment with anti-VLA-4 Ab. The number of colony-forming unit spleen (CFU-S) also was increased 21.6-fold in the peripheral blood by administration of anti-VCAM-1 Ab. The number of CFCs and CFU-S in the bone marrow of mice treated with anti-VCAM-1 Ab was decreased and that in the spleen also was decreased. On administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (125 Î¼g/kg twice daily) with anti-VCAM-1 Ab, the numbers of CFCs and CFU-S were increased 141.8-fold and 439-fold, respectively.
Conclusion
These observations demonstrated that administration of anti-VCAM-1 Ab induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells into blood from bone marrow and spleen and that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has synergistic effects on anti-VCAM-1 Ab-induced mobilization.

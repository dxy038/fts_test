Traffic congestion in the urban area occurs more frequent than the past due to rapidly increasing on road vehicle usage rates. It could seriously hinder the development of urban area if a well management system has not being established. These scenarios necessitate the development of advance traffic management systems to increase the performance of signalized intersection. Traffic signal timing management (TSTM) system which comprise of genetic algorithm based optimization is proposed. Using a proper TSTM system, network traffic flow can be improved with considerably less cost than other infrastructural improvements. The proposed genetic algorithm based optimization approach allows signal timing parameters such as offset, cycle time, green split and phase sequence to be optimized with objective of minimum delay and better traffic fluency. The proposed GATSTM system has the ability to handle and manage the dynamic changes of the traffic networks condition by calibrating the system parameters accordingly.

The problems associated to the modelling and optimisation of the chromatographic resolution of mixtures involving ionisable solutes at varying pH and acetonitrile content are discussed. Several retention models that separate the contributions of solute, column and stationary phase, were used. The retention was predicted with low errors in large pH domains (2–12), which was an essential requirement to face the optimisation of resolution. The selected mixture was particularly problematic under the viewpoint of resolution, owing to the excessively diverse acid–base behaviour of solutes. This variety led to sudden drops in retention at different pH for each solute, yielding numerous peak crossing, which made finding shared regions of high resolution especially difficult. Conventional resolution diagrams for these situations are scarcely informative, since both the overall and the worst elementary resolutions drop to zero if at least two compounds remain overlapped, even when all the others are baseline resolved. A new chromatographic objective function is proposed to address this drawback. This function, called “limiting peak count”, is based on the limiting peak purity concept, and measures the success in the resolution focusing on the resolved solutes, in contrast to conventional resolution assessments that attend mainly to the least resolved solutes. Limiting peak count yields the same result as conventional assessments when full resolution is possible, but it is also able to discriminate the maximal resolving power in low-resolution situations. It offers a different perspective to that given by the complementary mobile phases approach, and the computation is far simpler.

The direct AC/AC power converter has been the subject of active research for more than twenty years. The trend has been towards solving the switching problems associated with the original 9-bidirectional-switch matrix converter topology, as well as using converter topologies composed of only unidirectional switches, to realize matrix converters. In this paper, a new direct AC/AC converter topology based on current-source converter modules is proposed. It is shown, through analysis and simulation, that the proposed matrix converter topology is free of any switching difficulties and gives high-quality sinusoidal waveforms on both sides. Furthermore, with the same number of semiconductor devices as in the original 9-bidirectional-switch matrix converter topology, it is able to perform all aspects of frequency changing, real power flow control, and independent reactive power flow control on both sides. The new topology finds applications in electric drive industry, as an AC motor drive, and power system industry, as an asynchronous link

This article provides an overview of the proposed International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard (IEC 1508) entitled &#8220;Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems&#8221; which sets out a generic approach for all Safety Lifecycle activities for electrical/electronic/programmable electronic systems (E/E/PESs) that are used to perform safety functions. The emergence of this international standard should be a major step towards the adoption of a more rational and consistent technical policy for all electrically based safety-related systems. A major objective is to facilitate the development of application sector standards. The article also considers priorities for the future if both the safety and economic benefits are to be fully realised from the adoption of this proposed international standard

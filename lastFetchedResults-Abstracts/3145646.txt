We present a topology control algorithm for multi-hop wireless sensor networks with preferential attachment rule. Each node controls its transmission power, and decides its nearest neighbouring node set in order to preferentially link from a new node. Our objective is to use preferential attachment rule to establish a topology based on the scale-free model which has good overall performance in terms of fault tolerance and time efficiency.

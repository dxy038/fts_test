To solve chemical problems with variable and nonrigid constraints, a method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was presented. By mathematical analysis and transform, the variable constraints were regard as an item to be optimized. Then the item multiplied by penalty and combined with the primary objective function. So the primary problem was transferred to the multi-objective function, and can be solved by multi-objective PSO algorithm. With problems solved by multi-objective PSO and analysis of the solutions related with variable constraints, reasonable solution and optimal scheme can be obtained. The proposed method was used to optimize a chemical design problem and a parameter estimation problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.

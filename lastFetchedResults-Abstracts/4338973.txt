The paper presents and explains the architecture and the solutions adapted for supporting enhanced services in the integrated UMTS-WLAN environment of the WINE GLASS (wireless IP network as generic platform for location aware service support) project, included in the IST (Information Society Technologies) research program of the European Community. With the innovative solutions proposed not only for the architecture but also for network services like authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA), QoS mobility management issues and the location and service platform, this study aims to contribute to the technical innovation of 3G systems by exploiting the potential of IP-based wireless mobile multimedia networking in the evolution towards 4G systems. The main WINE GLASS objective is in fact to exploit and enhance new IP-based techniques to support terminal mobility and soft-guaranteed QoS in a wireless Internet architecture. The proposed framework incorporates both UMTS and WLAN access technologies, enhancing the UMTS backbone in order to support fully an all-IP solution.

Although the problem of k-area coverage has been intensively investigated for dense wireless sensor networks (WSNs), how to arrive at a k-coverage sensor deployment that optimizes certain objectives in relatively sparse WSNs still faces both theoretical and practical difficulties. In this paper, we present a practical algorithm LAACAD (Load balancing k-Area Coverage through Autonomous Deployment) to move sensor nodes toward k-area coverage, aiming at minimizing the maximum sensing range required by the nodes. LAACAD enables purely autonomous node deployment as it only entails localized computations. We prove the convergence of the algorithm, as well as the (local) optimality of the output. We also show that our optimization objective is closely related to other frequently considered objectives. Therefore, our practical algorithm design also contributes to the theoretical understanding of the k-area coverage problem. Finally, we use extensive simulation results both to confirm our theoretical claims and to demonstrate the efficacy of LAACAD.

The objective of this paper aims at the development of a decision support system for the risk assessment of coronary heart disease by leveraging the techniques of fuzzy expert system. The ANOVA analysis of statistical method and the multilayer perceptron of neural networks are taken respectively to identify the significantly impact factors for the risk assessment. The impact factors are then applied for developing the fuzzy expert system of risk assessment. Furthermore, the system is deployed to the cloud for the experiment and simulation to be used by the publics. The result of cloud deployment is also evaluated in terms of advantages, and disadvantages, and limitations for system tune-up and further development.

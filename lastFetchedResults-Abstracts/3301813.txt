Requirements Engineering (RE) is known to be one of the critical phases in software development. Lots of work related to RE is already published. Field of RE is maturing day by day, leading to exploration at its deeper level. It is argued that RE is subject to situational characteristics. This exposure becomes even more when RE is performed in global software development environment. There is a need to identify these situational characteristics based on RE literature. We plan to systematically explore situational RE based studies to distinguish and account state of the art in situational RE based reported research. This paper objective is to provide the systematic literature review (SLR) protocol to illustrate a process for combining the situational RE work that will ultimately present a state of the art of the field in global software development environment. This SLR aims to not only summarize the data related to situational RE in form of situational characteristics but will also be useful for RE practitioners specifically working in global software development environment by providing a check list base upon situational characteristics. It will also assist RE researchers to discover knowledge gaps to distinguish needs and probability for future research directions in the field of situational RE in global software development environment.

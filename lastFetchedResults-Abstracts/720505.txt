Initial screening of the cytotoxic and antibacterial properties of 6-substituted 2-oxopurines and dihydro-2-oxopurines revealed that several compounds exhibited cytotoxicity against K-562 cells in the same range as the well known antileukemic drug 6-mercaptopurine. Most compounds were also tested for inhibitory effect on a Gram-positive bacterium, Lactobacillus casei, as well as the mycobacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Generally the 2-oxopurines exhibited low antibacterial effect.

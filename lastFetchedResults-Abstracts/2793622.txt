The main objective of this paper is to analyse the operational performance of grid connected residential PV systems mainly in the Netherlands, but also in other European countries, by comparing the Performance Ratio and Annual System Yield indicators from small and medium size installations. So-called web scraping techniques were applied in order to meet the challenge of limited publically available high-resolution data. As a result data were collected of a total of 2914 systems from the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France and Italy were collected and analyzed. The installations were examined according to geographical and seasonal criteria and a further performance analysis was conducted in comparison with the type of the module technology and the inverter that was employed.

Due to the difficulty on teachers manually monitoring social interactions on the Collaborative Learning Environments (CLE), is expected some automatic support. The main objective of this work was to investigate and develop the architecture for monitoring social interactions called Amadeus-SIMA integrated with CLE Amadeus. This work validated two hypotheses through an empirical experiment: enhance the teachers´ awareness of the student´s social presence and predict the students performance based on social behaviors generated by Amadeus-SIMA.

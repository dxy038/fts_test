Objective: The effects of natural adjuvants were examined on total and differential WBC counts in lung lavage of sensitized guinea pigs. Materials and Methods: In three sensitized groups of guinea pigs including: untreated sensitized animals (S), sensitized animals treated with adjuvant G2 (S+G2) and G2F (S+G2F) as well as non-sensitized group (C) (n=6 for each group), total and differential WBC counts of lung lavage were examined. Sensitization of animals was achieved by injection and inhalation of ovalbumin (OA). Results: The results showed increased total WBC, eosinophil, neutrophil, and basophil counts, and decreased lymphocytes in lung lavage of sensitized animals compared with the control group (pConclusion: These results indicate important preventive effects of two natural adjuvants, especially G2, on lung inflammation of sensitized guinea pigs.

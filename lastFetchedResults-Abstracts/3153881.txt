From the viewpoint that most news items report on entities (person, organization and location), we propose a novel stakeholder model to represent and analyze news contents to explore special items in which there is inconsistency in the descriptions. By using this model, we can discover differences in multimedia news items from the perspectives of media types (text, video and audio) and description types (objective, subjective and relationship descriptions). We propose a method of extracting stakeholders as main participants (people, organization, etc.) of the described news event and detect inconsistency to explore the special items by comparing visual and textual descriptions on the exposure level of each stakeholder. A prototype system is implemented and we also show some experimental results to validate the proposed methods.

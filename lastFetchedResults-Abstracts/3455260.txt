New temperature-control strategies become readily available with the small low-priced digital computer. These are outlined with emphasis upon established processes embodying years of empirical experience, so that the introduction of new temperature-control strategies must be gradual. In most processes time-shared control will be the first objective, so the effect of sampled control upon classical control techniques is examined. New stability evaluation techniques are presented as displays that can be used in the design of processes and their control systems. Computer compensation for offset and disturbance is presented in a manner that does not affect these stability evaluations. The presentation is intended for professional engineers concemed with the practical control problems of a complex industrial plant.

The purpose of this work is to perform an experimental study and also modeling the plastic deformation of rectangular plates under a low-rate impact loading by the drop hammer system. In the experimental section, some experiments are conducted on the rectangular plates with different levels of energy to survey the mechanical behavior of the steel and aluminum plates according to the applied load. The modeling section consists of presenting an explicit function for the experimental data by singular value decomposition (SVD) based on dimensionless parameters, and also the multi-objective modeling and design of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) by genetic algorithm. Generally, the aim of modeling is a reliable and satisfactory prediction of the deflection-thickness ratio of plates under impact loads. A comparison is made between the modeling results and experimental data in order to validate the results. Investigation of the training and prediction data errors, which is based upon the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), shows that the results of the optimal design of ANFIS are closer to the experimental results of mathematical modeling by the SVD method, with the exception that a mathematical function based on the experimental data is presented by the SVD method.

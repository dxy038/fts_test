Mice infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis exhibit an age-related increase in susceptibility to disease. The basis of this susceptibility has previously been shown to reflect an inability of the aged host to generate protective CD4 T cells during the early course of the infection. The results of the present study, however, indicate that the emergence of interferon-Î³ secreting protective CD4 T cells in such mice is not absent, but merely delayed. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of such cells accumulating in the spleens of intravenously infected 24-month-old animals revealed that a large percentage of CD4 cells initially had poor or negative expression of the cell surface markers L-selectin and CD11a, molecules that may be important in the movement of T cells across inflamed endothelial blood vessel surfaces. During the course of the tuberculosis infection the numbers of CD4 cells in the spleens of old mice expressing high levels of these molecules rose to levels similar to those observed in young mice, but by that time the numbers of bacilli in target organs had reached close to fatal levels. These data suggest that the capacity of CD4 cells to cross inflamed endothelial surfaces and home into sites of mycobacterial infection may be deficient in old mice, and hence support the hypothesis that the ensuing delay in accumulating such cells within infected lesions contributes to the increased susceptibility of these animals to disease.

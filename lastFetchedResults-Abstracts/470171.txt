Objective
The study aims to investigate the prevalence of maternity blues and examine the risk factors involved in a group of Nigerian postpartum women.
Study design
Five hundred and two postpartum women who had a normal vaginal delivery in 5 health centers in Ilesa Township were assessed with the Maternity Blues Scale daily for the first 10 days' postpartum. They also filled a structured questionnaire detailing their sociodemographic and obstetric histories.
Results
The prevalence of maternity blues was 31.3%, and the symptoms peaked at the fifth day postpartum. The predictors of maternity blues include significant mood change during the pregnancy (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.42-6.11), past admission during the pregnancy (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.78-5.39), female baby (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.53-4.12), and single mothers (OR 3.35, 95% CI 2.26-5.64).
Conclusion
The prevalence and the significant risk factors for maternity blues seem to differ across culture. Obstetricians and midwives have to consider this in strategies for prevention and management of postpartum depression in new mothers in this environment.

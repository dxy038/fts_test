Objective: University students? mental health affects not only their educational achievements, but also their
professional future. The authors assessed the prevalence of suicidal ideation, depression, and aggression among
students of three major universities in Isfahan, Iran.
Methods: In 2008, 470 students were entered into the study using a convenience sampling method. The three
measurement tools applied were Aggression Questionnaire (AGQ), Beck Depression Inventor (BDI), and Beck
Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI).
Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 7.58% of the students, depression in 28.04%, and aggression in
30.11% of them. The ratio of depression to suicidal ideation was approximately 4:1. No significant difference in
the mean scores of aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation was observed between the three universities. No
significant relationships were found between mean scores of aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation with
age and gender. There was no meaningful relationship between the mean scores of aggression and marriage
status, but the mean scores of depression (P = 0.01) and suicidal ideation (P = 0.0001) were significantly lower
in the married students compared to the single ones. Aggression was significantly associated with depression and
suicidal ideation (P = 0.0001).
Conclusion: The frequency of suicidal ideation, aggression, and depression was less in our studied college
students than in previous non?Iranian studies. The decreasing trend in reported frequency of mild depression
during previous years is a noticeable finding. Yet, the findings seek more preventing programs among college
students.

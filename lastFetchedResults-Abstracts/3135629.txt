Aerosol quantitative retrieval from remote sensing over land surface is still a challenging task, especially for bright land areas such as desert, urban, coast, arid and semi-arid regions. A new aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface reflectance remote sensing retrieval model is developed by exploiting a kernel-driven BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) model and the SYNTAM (Synergy of TERRA and AQUA MODIS) model, which considered the surface BRDF effect while retrieving AOD. After applying this new model to Terra and Aqua MODIS data in the Heihe River Basin of China, AOD and surface reflectance of this region are retrieved. Results show that the multiple correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between retrieved AOD from MODIS and in situ measurements of CIMEL CE318 Sun-photometers is 0.92 at 0.55/zm. Using ASD Field Spec spectral radiometer measurements to validate retrieved surface reflectance, the RMSE values for band 1~3 are lower than 0.06.

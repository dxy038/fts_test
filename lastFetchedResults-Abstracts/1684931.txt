The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of a random corrosion thickness distribution on the ultimate strength of unstiffened rectangular steel plates subjected to uniaxial compressive load. Two new and distinct corrosion surface models are proposed and investigated. A total of 3575 corroded plate surface geometries are generated by Monte Carlo simulation for different degrees of degradation, location and ages and non-linear finite element analyses are carried out, using a finite element code. Based on a regression analysis, empirical formulae to predict strength reduction due to corrosion have been derived demonstrating a good accuracy.

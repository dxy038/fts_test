Blended Biogeography Based Optimization (B-BBO) is an extension to the Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) technique. Here the blending operator is used in the migration operation of BBO, inspired by the blended crossover operator in Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this paper, the B-BBO technique is applied on economic load dispatch (ELD) problems. Two sample systems are taken with quadratic and valve point cost functions respectively to analyze the effect of blending for the solution of this problem using BBO. Our analysis concludes that computational time decreases effectively with the blending but objective function value increases. B-BBO is suitable to the cases where huge computational burden is a big problem.

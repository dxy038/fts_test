The integration of automation associated with electricity resources (including transmission and distribution automation and demand-side resources operated by end-users) is key to supporting greater efficiencies and incorporating variable renewable resources and electric vehicles into the power system. The integration problems faced by this community are analogous to those faced in the health industry, emergency services, and other complex communities with many stakeholders. To highlight this issue and encourage communication and the development of a smart grid interoperability community, the GridWise<sup>&#174;</sup> Architecture Council (GWAC) created an Interoperability Context-Setting Framework. This &#8220;conceptual model&#8221; has been helpful to explain the importance of organizational alignment in addition to technical and informational interface specifications for &#8220;smart grid&#8221; devices and systems. As a next step to building a community sensitive to interoperability, the GWAC is developing a smart grid interoperability maturity model (SG IMM) based on work done by others to address similar circumstances. The objective is to create a tool or set of tools that encourages a culture of interoperability in this emerging community. The tools would measure status and progress, analyze gaps, and prioritize efforts to improve the situation.

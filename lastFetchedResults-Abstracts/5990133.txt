Evaluation of intelligent residential communities is complicated by the high aggregation of the multi-criteria and multi-dimensional perspectives of building intelligence. Till now, there have been no widely accepted approaches. Both the subjective evaluation method based on the analytic network process (ANP) and the objective method based on the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) have been proved to be helpful in prioritizing intelligent residential communities when used separately. However, the difference of evaluation results generated by applying the two methods to the same set of design alternatives is worthy of scrutiny. In the current work, the ANP-based method and the ART-based method were re-investigated and applied to the same set of design alternatives. The difference of the two methods in their application was analyzed and explained. Three aspects were identified to reflect their effectiveness and complementation.

Steering a car by hand means that the driver plans a path by preview and controls the lateral deviation of the vehicle from the planned path by the steering wheel. In an automatic car steering system, this path following is automated. The deviation is kept small by feedback control via the steering motors. The reference trajectory may be calculated from the data of a CCD camera and the compensation scheme is derived by the data of a gyro or a GPS. The desired system behavior in the car steering motion is primarily to obtain good damping and an almost disturbance decoupling property. A certain stability margin should be satisfied and the actuator activity should not be too high. This desired system behavior is to be made precise by formulating performance criteria. In the design process of controller, a design parameter is chosen for the optimization process, which results in good damping, our primary objective is to approximately keep this damping. At the same time the lateral acceleration should be better attenuated in the representative response due to a yaw rate initial value disturbance. In order to study automatic car steering, the steering model must be extended. For the extended steering model with output equation whose elements can be measured by equipped sensors, the optimal regulator is introduced so that the vehicle can tracks the reference path.

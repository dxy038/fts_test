Background
The optimal treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer remains controversial. The objective of this study was to determine if preoperative chemoradiation therapy (P-CRT) followed by esophagectomy for patients with clinical stage III adenocarcinoma of the esophagus offered any survival advantage as compared with esophagectomy alone.
Methods
Between January 1998 and June 2001, 75 nonrandomized patients with clinical stage III adenocarcinoma of the esophagus underwent either P-CRT and esophagectomy or esophagectomy alone. All patients were staged before initiation of treatment with computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound.
Results
P-CRT followed by esophagectomy was performed in 47 patients (63%) and esophagectomy alone in 28 patients (37%). Although the P-CRT group was younger (median age, 61 years versus 67 years), the two groups were otherwise similar for gender, comorbidities, and symptoms. Overall operative mortality was 4%. Follow-up was complete in all patients and ranged from 5 to 40 months (median, 20 months). Overall, one-, two-, and three-year survivals were 72%, 44%, and 42%, respectively. Three-year survival was identical (42%) for both the P-CRT and surgery alone patients (p = 0.70). Three-year disease-free survival for the P-CRT group was 29% as compared with 33% for the surgery only group (p = 0.51).
Conclusions
Patients with clinical stage III adenocarcinoma of the esophagus do not appear to gain an early overall or disease-free survival advantage when treated with P-CRT followed by surgery as compared with surgery alone. However, long-term follow-up is needed. A large, prospective, randomized trial is warranted to address the question of whether P-CRT offers any survival benefit or impact on pattern of recurrence in patients undergoing esophagectomy for locally advanced disease.

The APLC (active power line conditioner) is a type of active power filter that compensates voltage waveform distortion caused by harmonics in power systems. This paper presents a new approach, based on optimization theory, to investigate the determination of locations and sizes of APLCs. The objective is to minimize the new APLC injection currents and the voltage distortion while satisfying the harmonic standard. The test results for an 18-bus distribution system show the applicability of the proposed method

Background & Objectives: Different methods have been introduced to determine the cut-scores of exams. However, they have been rarely used in our country. In this study, we used four methods to set a standard for pre-internship objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
Methods: A pre-fixed score of 60% was considered in the first approach. In the Angoff method, a panel including 11faculty members was invited to estimate the probability of passing each station for a borderline student and mean of all estimations was considered as the station standard. In borderline regression method, a linear regression model for each station was calculated in which the students’ checklist scores and general scores were considered as dependent and independent variables respectively. The station standard was calculated based on grade 2 in Likert scale. In Cohen’s method, we set the standard at 60% of the 95th percentile point.
Results: The standards for the total test in the pre-fixed score, Angoff, borderline regression and Cohen’s methods were respectively 60, 49.15, 42.39 and 42.74. According to these standards, the percentages of passing students were respectively 21.9%, 67.6%, 93.3% and 92.4%.
Conclusion: Using four methods to set standard of an OSCE showed that this approach for determining exam’s cut-score has significant effect on the calculated standard and the percent of students passing the exam.

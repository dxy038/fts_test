When the information system risk is evaluated, it is of great importance to take various factors into account. Hierarchical fuzzy evaluation is a relatively valid method. However there is a great deal of difficulty in this algorithm. Therefore hierarchical fuzzy evaluation method based on bottom index clustering was introduced to assess information system in this paper. According to the attributes of the bottom indexes, atomic risk events of information system were clustered to calculate risk value of the bottom index. Then, use analytic hierarchy process to calculate the relative weight in every level of information system. Through these steps above, the comprehensive risk value of information system could be calculated by fuzzy logic method. The algorithm can solve the difficulty in combination evaluation practice and theoretical models preferably. It is more objective, effective and feasible than before.

The evolution of the Internet into a distributed Information access system calls for a paradigm shift to enable an evolvable future network architecture. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) proposals rethink the communication model around named data, in contrast with the host-centric transport view of TCP/IP. Information retrieval is natively pull-based, driven by user requests, point-to-multipoint and intrinsically coupled with in-network caching. In this paper, we tackle the problem of joint multipath congestion control and request forwarding in ICN for the first time. We formulate it as a global optimization problem with the twofold objective of maximizing user throughput and minimizing overall network cost. We solve it via decomposition and derive a family of optimal congestion control strategies at the receiver and of distributed algorithms for dynamic request forwarding at network nodes. An experimental evaluation of our proposal is carried out in different network scenarios to assess the performance of our design and to highlight the benefits of an ICN approach.

An account is given of listening tests conducted, with the co-operation of the Joint Co-ordination Committee on Radio Reception of the Edison Electric Institute, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and Radio Manufacturers Association, for the purpose of indicating how closely instruments made in accordance with the latest radio-noise-meter specifications of the Joint Co-ordination Committee meet the objective of giving readings proportional to annoyance for all types of radio noise. Thirty people participated in the tests which involved three types of radio noise and three different radio-noise meters. Standard statistical methods are used in analyzing the results, and these methods are explained in simple fashion for the benefit of radio engineers who are unfamiliar with statistical science. The general conclusion is that the new radio-noise-meter performance is very satisfactory.

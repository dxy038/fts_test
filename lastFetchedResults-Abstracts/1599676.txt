Electrothermomechanical MEMS are essentially microactuators that operate based on the thermoelastic effect induced by the Joule heating of the structure. They can be easily fabricated and require relatively low excitation voltages. However, the actuation time of an electrothermomechanical microdevice is higher than the actuation times related to electrostatic and piezoelectric actuation principles. Thus, in this research, we propose an optimization framework based on the topology optimization method applied to transient problems, to design electrothermomechanical microactuators for response time reduction. The objective is to maximize the integral of the output displacement of the actuator, which is a function of time. The finite element equations that govern the time response of the actuators are provided. Furthermore, the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization model and Sequential Linear Programming are employed. Finally, a smoothing filter is implemented to control the solution. Results aiming at two distinct applications suggest the proposed approach can provide more than 50% faster actuators.

This paper reviews some recent results in applying singular perturbations theory to obtain simplified power system models for analysis and control design. The topics include synchronous machine modeling, decomposition and aggregation of large power networks, aggregation of higher order dynamic models, and transient stability analysis using direct methods. The objective is to introduce power system engineers to singular perturbations as a tool for enhancing the understanding of time-scale dynamics and analytically deriving reduced models in power systems.

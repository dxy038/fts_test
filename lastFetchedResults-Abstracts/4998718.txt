Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal disturbance that poses major challenges for diagnostic procedures. It is marked by a constellation of symptoms, such as widespread pain, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, osteoarthritis, among others. This work is a pilot study that aims to validate a diagnostic tool by analyzing sEMG signals of specific muscles during the performance of isotonic tasks. This work is a pilot study that aims to validate a diagnostic protocol with people affected by fibromyalgia. The objective was to indentify the behavior of five fatigue indicators: RMS, ARV, MNF, MDF and IAF, at 30%, 60% and 80% of MCV with a cutoff parameter k of 60%.

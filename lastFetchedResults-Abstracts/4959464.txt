It is an urgent task to overcome challenge in interference management for macro cellular with low-power base stations (BSs), such as relay, pico, and femto called subnet nodes. In this paper, we develop a proper inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) scheme for downlink co-channel interference through cognitive sensing performed by subnet nodes in heterogeneous network (Het-Net). The more co-channel interference is avoided by cognitive interference model, the more power is saved for the macro BS and subnet nodes. The strategy framework of the cognitive critical ratio and power reward factor is set up for interference management aiming to get the maximum net saving power for the macro BS and subnet nodes. We use multiple objective non-linear programming (MONLP) and genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the global optimum solution. Finally, the practical implementation in Het-Net for long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) is designed. The numerical evaluation and system simulation results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed ICIC scheme.

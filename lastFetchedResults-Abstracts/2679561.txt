In this research, we investigate a three-stage supply chain with one supplier, several 
manufacturers and multiple retailers where the supplier provides a common raw material to 
each manufacturer, who in turn uses a single stage production facility to convert it into final 
products that are delivered at fixed lot sizes to retailers. An integrated economic procurement, 
production, and delivery model is developed whose objective is to find the common production 
cycle length, production sequences of final products at manufacturers and delivery frequencies 
of final products to retailers minimizing the total costs of considered supply chain. We propose 
an analytical solution procedure and an efficient heuristic solution method. The proposed 
heuristic solution algorithm is able to find the optimal solutions for the small and medium 
problem instances and consequently it is very promising for solving the large-sized instances in 
a reasonable time.

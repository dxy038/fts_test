The successful development of heat pump assisted water purification systems in Mexico has resulted from more than two decades of international co-operation in heat pump technology. The basis of this international technology transfer has been the development of postgraduate degree programmes initially with India and later with Mexico. An overall objective of these programmes was to match energy supply more appropriately with end use energy needs in order to minimise the unnecessary degradation of high grade energy sources. A further objective of the programmes was to retain high grade technical personnel in their own countries.

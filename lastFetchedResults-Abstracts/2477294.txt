<p><strong>B</strong><strong>ackground: </strong><em>Acanthamoeba </em>spp<em>. </em>are free-living amoebae commonly found in the environmental sources such as water, soil, and air. This ubiquitous amoeba is the causative agent of amoebic kerati- tis (AK). The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of <em>Acanthamoeba </em>spp. in water and soil sources in Ahvaz City, Khuzestan Province, southern Iran.</p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>ethods: </strong>In general, 110 samples of water and soil were taken from different localities of Ahvaz including agricultural canals, rivers, and swimming pools. Filtration and cultivation were carried out on non-nutrient agar medium (NNA). Axenic cultivation was performed for all of positive isolates. PCR analysis was conducted on positive samples. Sequencing was done for 15 PCR products. Geno - types were identified by Blast search and homology analysis.</p><p><strong>R</strong><strong>esult: </strong><em>Acanthamoeba </em>spp. was found in 43 (71.6%) of samples of water and 13 (26%) soil samples. Genotyping of 15 samples proved that <em>Acanthamoeba </em>belonged to T4 (86.6%), T2 (6.6%), and T5 (6.6%) genotypes.</p><p><strong>C</strong><strong>onclusion: </strong>TYI-S-33 medium could be better than PYG medium for <em>Acanthamoeba </em>axenic culture.</p><p>Â </p>

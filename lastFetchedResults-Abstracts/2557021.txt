In this paper, a new bidirectional buck-boost dc-dc converter with capability of
soft switching and zero input current ripple is proposed. The coupled inductor is used in the
proposed converter to eliminate the input current ripple. In the proposed converter, zero
voltage switching (ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS) can be obtained for the main
and auxiliary switches, respectively. In addition, the proposed topology is analyzed in all
operating modes and all equations of voltage and current for components are obtained.
Moreover, the required conditions for soft switching operation and also achieving zero
input current ripple are calculated. Finally, the acuracy performance of the proposed
converter is reconfirmed through simulation results in EMTDC/PSCAD software program.

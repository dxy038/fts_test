The design and construction of nuclear power plants has always involved much effort in the electrical area relative to that required in many other industries. This is a result of the relatively large quantities of components that are centrally controlled and plant variables that are centrally monitored, together with separation criteria imposed on safety - related circuits. The Floating Nuclear Plant has basically these same considerations in electrical design and construction as a land-based plant, but in addition has a much shorter plant manufacturing lead time as a design objective. Thus, the electrical installation -- which is typically on the critical path at peak effort near the end of the plant construction schedule -- could be a bottleneck if conventional electrical installation methods were used. This paper discusses a design for reducing electrical installation lead time by reducing termination time and maximizing simultaneous installation effort through use of a prefabricated control module.

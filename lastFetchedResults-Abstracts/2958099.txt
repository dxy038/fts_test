This paper introduces a novel concept of PMV (parity motion vector) into the MC-DCT (motion compensation-discrete cosine transform) coder, in order to improve its robustness to transmission errors over noisy channels. By inserting the redundant PMVs systematically into the compressed bitstream, the proposed algorithm is capable of recovering very severe transmission errors, such as loss of an entire frame. The proposed algorithm is implemented based on the H.263 coder, and tested intensively in a realistic error prone environment. It is shown that the proposed algorithm provides much better objective and subjective performances than the conventional H.263 coder in the error prone environment

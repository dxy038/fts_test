<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background:</strong> Cutaneous leishmaniasis constitutes a major public health problem in many parts of the world including Iran. The primary objective of this study was to identify <em>Leishmania </em>spe­cies in endemic districts of Kerman Province, south-eastern Iran<em>. <br /></em><strong></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Methods:</strong> This study was conducted by random sampling as cross- sectional descriptive between 2008 and 2010. Overall, 203 skin scraping smears were taken from the patients. Nested -PCR was performed to amplify variable minicircle fragments of <em>Leishmania </em>kDNA.<br /><strong></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Results:</strong> Bam was the most infected district (71.1%), followed by Kerman (14.7%), Jiroft (5.4%), Baft (2.7%), Sirjan (1.6%), Shahr-e Babak (1.5%) and others (3.0%).  <em>L. tropica </em>was the most common species identified<em> </em>(194 cases, 95.6%), while<em> L. major</em> was found in only 9 cases (4.4%). Of 203 identified patients, all species in Bam (l07 cases), Kerman (32 cases), Jiroft (l6 cases) and Shahr-e- Babak (l1 cases) were detected as <em>L. tropica</em>, whereas infected subjects in Baft and Sir­jan showed <em>L. tropica</em> or<em> L. major</em>. Characterization of <em>Leishmania</em> species resulted in generation of 750 bp and 560 bp fragments, corresponding to those of <em>L. tropica</em> and <em>L. major</em>, respectively.<br /><strong></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <em>L. tropica</em> is the main species (95.6%) caused ACL in endemic areas of Kerman Prov­ince; however <em>L. major</em> is present in low level (4.4%).</p>

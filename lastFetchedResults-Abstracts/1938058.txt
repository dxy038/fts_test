The main objective of this study was synthesis of proper ion sieves for selective extraction of lithium from solutions. Therefore, in the first stage, MnO2 nanostructure oxidizer, spinel type Li-Mn-O precursor and lithium ion sieve of MnO2 nanorods were synthesized under two different conditions of a controlled hydrothermal method and the structure characteristics and ion exchange ability were studied by XRD and SEM analysis. Then, the Li+ adsorption isotherm, kinetics and selectivity measurements were investigated, separately. The produced MnO2 nanorods, with the size about 30–60 nm in diameter and 0.5–2 µm in length, were found to have a remarkable lithium ion-sieve property. In addition, the study on equilibrium distribution coefficients (Kd) of synthesized ion sieve indicating high selectivity for Li+ ions in the presence of other coexisting ions such as Na+, K+ and Mg2. In addition, adsorption isotherm followed the Langmuir equation and the maximum monolayer uptake capacity of Li+ ions was 4.45 mmol/g estimated in the optimized condition. Consequently, it appears that the synthesized ion sieves have the adequate potential for extraction lithium from brines or seawater.

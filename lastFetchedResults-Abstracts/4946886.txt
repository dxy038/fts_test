This paper proposes a new shaped double-material lens for this objective and presents its design and performance when integrated into the reflector system. A parabolic reflector is used to prove the lens concept. Reflector optimization is out of the scope of this paper. Experimental results are presented for a fabricated scaled lens prototype at 62.5 GHz.

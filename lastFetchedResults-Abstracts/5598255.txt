A goal of the Tactical Human Integration of Networked Knowledge (THINK) Army Technology Objective (ATO) is to develop and test a proposed socio-cognitive network analytic method that aims to improve the effective understanding and execution of commander´s intent (CI), for a given echelon, based on the interpretation of the operational order (OPORD) and the monitoring of the warfighters´ activities, via their communications. Network Text Analysis is used to extract a meta-network model from OPORDs and operational discourse, such as email and chat logs. The contents of this meta-network model are coded using the Battle Management Language (BML), and Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA) techniques are then applied to the extracted data in order to determine the extent to which a Commander´s Intent is being accurately followed and to identify points and bases for departure. This will lead to the establishment of new requirements for instrumentation of the net-centric environment for detection of human behavior.

We address the problem of model-based fault diagnosis for hybrid numeric/symbolic dynamical systems. The objective is the systematic design of fault diagnosis algorithms, based on fault graphs provided by reliability analysis and on-board sensor data processing. We propose an approach, based on HMM ideas and a Viterbi algorithm. Experimental results of the proposed approach for a simulated mechanical engineering example are reported. Extensions for taking into account a discrete controller and fault concurrence are discussed

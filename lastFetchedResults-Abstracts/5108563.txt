Electrathon rallies are multi-vehicle competitions in which aerodynamic, lightweight electric vehicles meeting specific design and safety rules are raced. The objective is to travel the furthest distance in one hour on a limited charge, supplied by deep cycle marine type lead-acid battery packs. The rallies, open to any individual, club or educational institution, have been a popular sport in Great Britain and Australia for over a decade and have begun to grow in popularity in the United States. This paper describes how a University of Central Florida student design team is focusing on creating a vehicle capable of extending the current world Electrathon distance record. In addition to aerodynamic and safety concerns, the design focuses on minimizing energy losses in the electrical and drive systems. The completed design serves as the basis for fabrication of a vehicle to be raced in an upcoming Electrathon competition sponsored by the Florida Solar Energy Center

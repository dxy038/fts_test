The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a supported capillary membrane sampling-gas chromatography method for the analysis of trihalomethanes (THMs) in drinking water. The effects of experimental parameters, such as flow rate of carrier gas, water temperature, ionic strengths of solutions and transfer line temperature on the system performance were investigated. The results of method detection limit and accuracy and precision studies are reported.

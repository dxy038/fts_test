The extension method based on entropy weight is a new safety evaluation method. Entropy weight, which is an objective weight, was ascertained by entropy theory. As a result, the subjectivity in ascertaining the weights of more factors in lower hierarchy was avoided. The comprehensive correlative degree was taken as the evaluation criteria in this method. Therefore the subjectivity of evaluation model was also avoided. This method was applied in the safety evaluation of fully mechanized mining faces in 6th mine of Pingdingshan Coal Group Corporation Ltd. The safety order preference and safety differences of all fully mechanized mining faces are gained. At the same time, safety problems existing in man, machine and environment of fully mechanized mining faces are pointed out. The corresponding countermeasures to improve safety are put forward.

Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a fiber post on the fracture mechanics of zirconia crowns inserted over endodontically treated teeth with different extent of coronal damage.
Methods

Endodontically treated human molars with three types of coronal damage received fiber posts before cementation of zirconia-veneered crowns. Controls received composite resin cores without fiber posts. The specimens were loaded to failure and fractographically examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Results

Statistical analysis revealed that specimens with fiber posts demonstrated significantly higher failure loads and favorable fracture pattern compared to the controls. At fractographic analysis, specimens with fiber posts demonstrated delamination of the veneer ceramic from intact zirconia under structure. Meanwhile, the specimens that were restored without a fiber post demonstrated micro-cracking of the composite core build-up resulting in loss of the support under the zirconia crowns which was responsible for the initiation of radial crack and catastrophic damage.
Conclusions

Within the limitation of this study, the insertion of fiber post improved the support under zirconia crowns which resulted in higher fracture loads and favorable failure type compared to composite core build-up.

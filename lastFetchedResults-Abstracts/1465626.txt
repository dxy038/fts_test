The objective of this study was to determine the differences in carcass characteristics and sensory attributes of “barbacoa” (a traditional Mexican lamb dish), both of imported (New Zealand) and domestic lambs in Mexico. A total of 28 carcasses from Pelibuey, Pelibuey × Suffolk and imported lambs were used. Carcass composition was determined by dissection of primal cuts from the left half of each carcass. The “barbacoa” from each ovine group was prepared separately in order to perform a consumer sensory evaluation for aroma, taste and tenderness. Results showed that imported lambs had larger carcasses, greater fatness and had better conformation than national lambs. There was no difference between groups in terms of lean tissue percentage (muscle + others) or in total carcass fat. The sensory attributes of the “barbacoa” did not differ among breeds. Pelibuey lambs (rustic, prolific and adaptable to the wide variety of Mexican climates) show competitive production performance in relation to specialized breeds.

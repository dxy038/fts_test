Objective (s): To investigate whether the use of fetal monitoring had an effect on cesarean section rate at Mahdieh hospital.
Methods: This retrospective, analytical cross sectional study involved patients' data from deliveries occurring at Mahdieh teaching hospital, Tehran, in 1385 and 1387. During 1387 fetal monitoring was available and use for all mothers in the labor, whereas during 1385 it was unavailable. Data on cause of cesarean were collected in 1385 and 1387.
Results: 4346 deliveries used fetal monitoring and 4656 deliveries did not. 2133 Cesarean occurred in 1387 and 1739 cesarean occurred in 1385. Causes of cesarean were: Labor Dystocia, Meconium, Fetal Distress, CPD, Placenta Previa, Placenta Abruptio, Cord prolase, Preeclampsia, Multiple Pregnancy, Malpresentation, Abnormal Fetus, and Previous Cesarean. There was Statistical significance difference in Meconium(13/4 %, v/s 17/1%, P < 0.05), Fetal Distress(11/78% v/s 13/92% , P < 0.05), Abruptio  placenta (2/1% v/s 6/14% P < 0.05), Labor Dystocia (11/09% v/s 9/1%, P < 0.05) and Malpresentation (13/6% v/s 10%, P < 0.05). There was no significance difference in Previous Cesarean, Multiple pregnancies, CPD, Preeclampsia, Placenta Previa, and Cord Prolapse.
Conclusion: The Study shows 12% rising on cesarean rate from 1385 till 1387.Statistical difference was demonstrated in the rate of fetal distress that Cause cesarean section. Use of fetal monitoring detected any fetal distress in labor and cesarean performed for avoiding cerebral palsy and Low APGAR infant. There is no evidence that use of fetal monitoring improved newborn outcome.

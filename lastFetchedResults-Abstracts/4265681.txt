The MIT mobile robot project began in January of 1985 with the objective of building machines that could operate autonomously and robustly in dynamically changing environments. Five working robots, each progressively more intelligent and sophisticated, are now available. These robots are reviewed, focusing on their innovative aspects. These include novel ideas in the areas of control systems, sensors, actuators, power supplies, and power processing. Perspectives on mobile robotics are outlined, including objectives, experiences, mistakes, and future plans

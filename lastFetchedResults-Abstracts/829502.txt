Background and Objective: Due to contradictory effects of hormonal contraception products on the mental status, this study was done to identify the effects of these products on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) status.

Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort one on 80 women that were divided into 2 groups. A group used only a form of hormonal contraception over the last 2 years (as exposure group). Another group had used non-hormonal contraceptive methods (as non-exposure group). The demographic information were collected. Then, MMSE test was done as double-blind and data were analaized.

Results: The average age of subjects in the groups of exposure and non-exposure was 30.1± 3.3 and 30.5± 3.8 years, respectively. The overall mean of MMSE test for exposure group was 25.68 with a SEM of 0.581 and for non-exposure group was 26.7 with a SEM of 0.341. The differences were not significant (p=0.117). There were significant differnces between the two groups regarding recent memory, language functions, and the ability to visualize space.

Conclusion: The results of this study showed that hormonal contraception products had significant effects on some parts of MMSE, but it seems to require more extensive studies with a longer duration.

This paper presents the types and classes of sensing related information to be exchanged among the entities in cognitive radio systems. The information was extracted by analyzing distributed spectrum sensing use cases and has been checked for the consistence with available sensing techniques and sensorsÂ´ capability. This paper also introduces IEEE P1900.6 WG recent activities on standardizing the interfaces and data structures required for exchange of sensing related information. By explaining the objective, reference model, data structure, generic procedure, the paper describes in detail the technical aspects of the IEEE P1900.6 sensing interface. The paper also shows some implementation examples on how the P1900.6 interface can be used in real scenario.

The main objective of this work is to develop an indirect counting method acquisition system improvement called self-adaptive frequency based on acquisition converter, being integrated in a programmable system on chip developed by Cypress/sup /spl trade// MicroSystems. The classical external data acquisition mechanisms and digital to analogue conversion methods are being compared with the most recent powerful acquisition techniques (voltage to frequency-code converters). These topologies of conversion method give us a very versatile, precise and scalable structure of data acquisition. Our improvement, the new self-adaptive mechanism offers a superlative linear and precise response.

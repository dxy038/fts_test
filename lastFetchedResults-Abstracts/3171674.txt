A satisfactory goal programming and analysis method for fuzzy multi-objective optimization problem is proposed in this paper. For preemptive priority requirement, the order of satisfactory degrees denoting that the higher priority achieves the higher satisfactory degree is applied to the priority structure instead of lexicographic order. The strict constraints about satisfactory degree are relaxed to formulate parametric goal programming model. The existence of its optimal solution is guaranteed and the parameter analysis algorithm is presented. With the proposed method, the tradeoff between multi-objective optimization and priority is realized and the M-Pareto optimality of the solution is ensured. The numerical example demonstrates its effectiveness and sensitivity.

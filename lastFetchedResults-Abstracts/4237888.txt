Decentralized generation will become more and more important in the future electricity distribution system. This tendency is increased by promising solution to many power system problems such as voltage regulation, power loss, etc. This paper presents a new methodology using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) for the placement of Distributed Generators (DG) in the radial distribution systems to find the size and number of the DGs corresponding to maximum loss reduction and reduce capital and operational DG costs and to improve the voltage profile. The proposed method is tested on standard IEEE 33-bus test system and the results are presented and encouraging results are obtained.

The high blood rate that often occurs in arteries may play a role in artery failure and tortuosity which leads to blackouts, transitory ischemic attacks and other diseases. However, vibration and instability analysis of carotid arteries are lacking. The objective of this study is to investigate the vibration and instability of the carotid arteries conveying blood under axial tension with surrounding tissue support. Arteries are modeled as elastic cylindrical vessels based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) within an elastic substrate. The elastic medium is simulated with visco-Pasternak foundation. The blood flow in carotid artery is modeled with non-Newtonian fluid based on Carreau, power law and Casson models. Applying energy method, Hamilton principle and differential quadrature method (DQM), the frequency, critical blood velocity and transverse displacement of the carotid arteries are obtained. It can be seen that increasing the tissue stiffness would delay critical blood velocity. The current model provides a powerful tool for further experimental investigation arteries tortuosity. In addition, the dimensionless transverse displacement predicted by Newtonian model is lower than that of non-Newtonian models.

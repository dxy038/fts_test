In this paper, a minimum mean square error - bidirectional successive detection (MMSE-BSD) technique is proposed to mitigate the effects of interferences caused by time difference of arrivals (TDoAs) in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The proposed BSD technique can successfully reduce the error propagation phenomenon in successive detection with a low computational complexity by exploiting the subframe structure used in WMNs.

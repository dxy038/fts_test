The objective of this research is to implement a method for estimating the real missing data in heart disease datasets and to show how it affects the resulting knowledge. Missing data is common problem in knowledge discovery from database (KDD) processes that can lead significant error in extracted knowledge. We use hybridization of artificial neural network and rough set theory (ANNRST) to estimate the real missing data on heart disease from UCI (University of California, Irvine) datasets. ANN with reduced input features is used to estimate the missing data. RST is used to reduce the dimensionality of input features and to extract the knowledge as reducts and rules from heart disease datasets with estimated missing data. RST, decomposition tree, local transfer function classifier (LTF-C) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier are used to calculate the accuracy. Comparative study with k-NN estimation, most common attribute value filling and deletion of missing data are made to evaluate the extracted knowledge. ANNRST can be considered as the appropriate estimation method when strong relationship between original complete datasets and estimated datasets is important (the estimated datasets really represent the nature of original complete datasets) as it gives the best accuracy and coverage for almost all the classifiers.

This paper presents the core technology of novel enhancements to achieve toll quality at 4 kbps, our experiments and test results traditional CELP coding, coined eXtended CELP (eX-CELP). It is showed that this technology is also successful and suitable for centered on a combined and selective usage of closed-loop/open-both high and medium bit rates. Fig. I and Fig.2 illustrate the basic loop approach, and variant algorithm structure concept. The above structure of the eX-CELP encoder and decoder. two concepts are complemented by new features and refined One of the main themes of the eX-CELP technology is the existing technologies. The eX-CELP paradigm was used in judicious combination of the closed-loop approach and the open-several speech coding systems. It is the core technology of the loop approach, together with a careful selective usage of them. recently chosen candidate for the 3G-CDMA speech codec This mechanism is coined COLA, and its main objective is to standard. It was the best candidate for ITU-T 4 kbps codec intelligently employ the most appropriate approach for different qualification test, and became the basis technology for a types of input signals in order to preserve the perceptually consortium candidate to the ITU-T 4 kbps speech coding important contents. Another important feature in the eX-CELP competition

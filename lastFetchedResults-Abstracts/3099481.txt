A large orbit gyrotron (LOG) has been developed for generation of high-power far-infrared radiation. It uses pulsed relativistic electron beam with maximum electron energy of 400 kV. The studies were carried out through both experimental and simulation approaches. The objective is to demonstrate high-power radiation in terahertz range by using LOG.

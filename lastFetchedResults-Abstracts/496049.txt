Introduction & Objective: Now days a considerable progress in the production of instruments for canal preparation can be seen. Efficiency and resistance of files during canal preparation are very important. The aim of this study was to compare surface defects in Aryatec, Mailifer Stainless-Steel(ss) and Mailifer Nickle-Titanium(Ni-Ti) K-files before and after canal preparation.

Materials & Methods: This experimental study was done on the 3 groups consist of aryatec and mailifer ss K-files and Mailifer Ni-Ti K-file. In each group 30 files were selected. Each file pre and post instrumentation was observed for flextion, cracks, fracture, metal flashing, stretching, and partial clockwise using light streomicroscope at a magnification of 40x. The data were analysed using % and ANOVA.

Result: In all group no crack and partial clockwise were observed. Flexion in aryatec was more than the others (P<0.05). There is no significant differences, in metal flashing, fracture and stretching (P>0.05). 4 aryatec files had primary stretching and 1 mailifer Ni-Ti file were fractured after 5 times that differences were not significant(P>0.05).

Conclusion: There are no significant differences between surfaces defects in aryatec, mailifer ss and mailifer Ni-Ti before and after canal preparation.

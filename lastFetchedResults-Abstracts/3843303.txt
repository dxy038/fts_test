In this paper, two AC-AC reduced-switch-count drive systems for single- to three-phase applications are proposed. Both drive systems provide bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The operating principles of the topologies are presented, and a control strategy is proposed in order to reduce the DC-link voltage required by the converters. Moreover, the proposed configurations are compared with the conventional half-bridge (three legs) and full-bridge (five legs) topologies. These drive systems have the potential for reducing price and are suitable for applications in which the size of the system is a critical factor. Experimental and simulated results are presented.

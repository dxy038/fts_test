An adjustable laryngeal implant made of titanium has been developed for the treatment of unilateral vocal fold paralysis. The implant includes three parts: a plate that allows fixation to the thyroid cartilage, a block of titanium which includes the adjustable part, and a micrometric screw in the middle of the lateral side of the block, which moves the adjustable part. Precise medialization is accomplished by regulating the screw which also permits easy secondary adjustments, if needed in the future. This retrospective study assesses clinical outcomes of medialization laryngoplasty with the titanium adjustable implant, in patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. This study has the limitations of a retrospective study. However, preliminary results are encouraging. Analysis of subjective responses confirmed marked improvement in laryngeal function, speech, and swallowing. Objective voice analysis confirmed improvement in the aerodynamic measures. The adjustable laryngeal implant has many advantages including: precise medialization, ease of secondary adjustment, and preseveration of the mucosal wave. This implant is biocompatible, no migration is possible (it is fixed to the cartilage) and no extrusion of the implant has occurred. Titanium is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-safe.

The main objective was to investigate the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitory and antioxidant activities of sarcoplasmic proteins isolated from the brisket muscle (Pectoralis profundus) of 3 (Bos taurus) cattle and hydrolysed with papain for 24 h at 37 Â°C. Sarcoplasmic protein hydrolysates were ultra-filtered using molecular weight cut off (MWCO) membranes and 10-kDa and 3-kDa filtrates were obtained. The total sarcoplasmic protein extracts and the 3-kDa filtrates were tested for angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE-I) activities. The total hydrolysates, 10-kDa and 3-kDa filtrates were also tested for their associated antioxidant activities using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity assay, the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and the Fe2+ metal chelating ability assay. The peptidic content of the total hydrolysates, the 10-kDa and the 3-kDa filtrates were analysed using an ORBITRAP mass spectrometer, and mass spectral data obtained were analysed using TurboSEQUEST. Eleven peptides were characterised from the total hydrolysates, fifteen from the 10-kDa filtrate fractions, whilst nine peptides were characterised from the 3-kDa filtrate fractions. Similarities between the amino acid sequences of the peptides identified in this study and previously identified antioxidant and ACE-I inhibitory peptides detailed in the BIOPEP database were outlined.

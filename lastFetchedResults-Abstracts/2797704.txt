Artificial materials at optical frequencies have raised a strong interest in the last years, including photonic metamaterials, graded photonic crystals, and simple gradient index structures. The main common objective of these approaches is achieving a tight control of the electromagnetic guided-wave fields to play with light properties and propose versatile optical functions. In this general context, this work is focused on gradual photonic crystals (GPhCs) working in the diffraction regime, i.e. close to the photonic crystal (PhC) bandgap.

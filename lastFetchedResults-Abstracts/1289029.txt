As a continuation of our previous work that turned toward the identification of antimycobacterial compounds with innovative structures, two series of pyrazole derivatives were synthesized by parallel solution-phase synthesis and were assayed as inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), which is the causative agent of tuberculosis. One of these compounds showed high activity against MTB (MIC = 4 μg/mL). The newly synthesized pyrazoles were also computationally investigated to analyze their fit properties to the pharmacophoric model for antitubercular compounds previously built by us and to refine structure–activity relationship analysis.

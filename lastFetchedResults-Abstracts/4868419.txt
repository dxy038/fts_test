We have proposed to use a directly modulated tunable fiber ring laser based on reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOA) and tunable optical filter (TOF) as an upstream source in multi-wavelength shared (UMWS) time division multiplexing-passive optical network (TDM-PON) configuration. Downstream signal is broadcasted in TDM way while upstream signals are multiplexed in hybrid time/wavelength division multiplexed way, which upgrades the upstream capacity greatly. Bidirectional transmission of downstream data at 10-Gb/s and upstream data at 1.25-Gb/s per wavelength over 25-km single mode fiber (SMF) is demonstrated with a power penalty of ~0.5 dB at both ends. A stable performance is observed for the upstream wavelength tuned from 1530 nm to 1595 nm.

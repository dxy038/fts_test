The objective of this research was to investigate the macroscopical effect of high concentration nitrite and nitrate denitrification on waste decomposition and to evaluate the kinetics of NO 3 - –N and NO 2 - –N removal. Two reactors loaded fresh refuse were fed 4000 mg NO 3 - –N/L or 4000 NO 2 - –N/L every 48 h, respectively. Results showed that NO 3 - –N addition was more effective on promotion of the waste degradation process as compared to NO 2 - –N addition. In the initial stage, NO x - –N removal was mainly contributed by adsorption rather than denitrification. NO x - –N reduction rate data obtained from microcosm experiment were fit to Monod kinetics, with specific removal rates of 1.625 mg NO 3 - –N/(g dry waste d) and 1.125 mg NO 2 - –N/(g dry waste d) and nitrogen removal half-saturation constants of 1250.5 NO 3 - –N/L and 125.5 NO 2 - –N/L, respectively.

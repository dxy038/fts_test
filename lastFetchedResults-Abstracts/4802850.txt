Robotic platforms are becoming increasingly important and have their utility and cost completely justified during missions which require substituting humans. In this paper, we present our ongoing work in developing a multi-sensor robotic platform intended for deploying in an indoor environment in hazardous situations. The prime objective of such portable robots will be to conduct surveillance missions and provide a perception of its surroundings to the human-in-loop to ascertain the uncertain environment. Therefore, the robotic platform needs to be equipped with various sensors to create 3D visual maps of its surroundings. However, given the compact size and hazardous nature of the missions expensive LIDAR equipment may not be always suitable. We propose developing an integrated platform comprising of low cost optical cameras, acoustic localization via microphones and low cost alternatives are explored albeit with limited functionality and ultrasonic acoustic imaging arrays and augmenting these 3D maps with thermal imagery data. The aim of such a system will be to perform well even in dark and smoky environments via active ultrasonic imaging. A decision support system will equip the robot with the ability to prioritize appropriate sensors depending on the scenario. The choice of various proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors are based on their significantly lower price tag as compared to the systems available in the market. This robotic platform will serve as a test-bed for performing various complex tasks such as discovering occluded objects, improved perception in dark and smoky environments as well as thermal source detection.

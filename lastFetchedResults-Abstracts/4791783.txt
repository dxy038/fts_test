This paper describes the component technology developed in the IST COMPARE project (www.istcompare.org). The objective of the COMPARE research was the construction of a reference model and an implementation framework for the implementation of component-based embedded systems. In our context, both them have been profiled for their application in the construction of embedded distributed controllers using OMG specifications. Both the model and the framework are based on the OMGÂ´s Lightweight CCM specification. The central design guideline is the separation of functional aspects to be provided by components and the nonfunctional aspects to be provided by the execution platform in order to maximise component reusability while keeping the predictability and reduced resource consumption needed in embedded systems.

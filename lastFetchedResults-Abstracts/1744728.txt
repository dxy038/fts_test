Background and Objective: Studies have shown that estradiol and Portulaca oleracea extract have analgesic effects. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of co-administration of estradiol and Portulaca oleracea seed hydroalcoholic extract on pain induced by writhing test in female mice.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 78 female balb c mice were randomly divided into control and test groups receiving low, moderate and high doses of Portulaca oleracea extract and estradiol and their combination. Following intraperitoneal administration of the hormone or extract, pain threshold was measured using writhing test and data were analyzed using ANOVA. 

Results: Administration of low, moderate and high dose of estradiol resulted in increased number of writhing (p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The number of writhing increased in the group receiving a low dose of Portulaca oleracea extract (p < 0.01), however, it decreased in groups receiving moderate and high doses of Portulaca oleracea extract (p < 0.001). Co-administration of low doses of estradiol and Portulaca oleracea extract and co-administration of high doses of estradiol and Portulaca oleracea extract resulted in lower number of writhing as compared to groups receiving low and high doses of estradiol (p < 0.001). 

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that appropriate doses of Portulaca oleracea seed extract and estradiol have pain lowering effects. Portulaca oleracea seed extract and estradiol have also synergistic effect on reducing of pain.

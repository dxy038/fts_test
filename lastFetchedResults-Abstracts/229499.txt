We propose a new technique for efficiently rendering bidirectional texture functions (BTFs). A 6D BTF describes
the appearance of a material as a texture that depends on the lighting and viewing directions. As such, a BTF
accommodates self-shadowing, interreflection, and masking effects of a complex material without needing an
explicit representation of the small scale geometry. Our method represents the BTF as a set of spatially varying
apparent BRDFs, that each encode the reflectance field of a single pixel in the BTF. Each apparent BRDF is
decomposed into a product of three or more two-dimensional positive factors using a novel factorization technique,
which we call chained matrix factorization (CMF). The proposed factorization technique is fully automatic and
suitable for both BRDFs and apparent BRDFs (which typically exhibit off-specular peaks and non-reciprocity).
The main benefit of CMF is that it delivers factors well suited for the limited dynamic range of conventional
texture maps. After factorization, an efficient representation of the BTF is obtained by clustering the factors into
a compact set of 2D textures. With this compact representation, BTFs can be rendered on recent consumer level
hardware with arbitrary viewing and lighting directions at interactive rates

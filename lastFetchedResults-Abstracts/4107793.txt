In this study, a novel voltage droop scheme for the parallel operation of voltage source converters (VSCs) in an islanded multibus microgrid is proposed. In this scheme, the voltage droop coefficient is defined as a function of respective VSC active and reactive power outputs. Thus, each VSCs voltage reference is adaptively drooped as a non-linear function of its active and reactive power outputs. This approach leads to reduction in the reactive power sharing dependence on real power control and system parameters such as mismatched connecting and line impedances. A multiobjective index is introduced for evaluating the scheme performance. The index is used as an objective function in an optimisation problem that is employed to obtain optimal parameters of the scheme. The detailed analysis shows that this scheme has a superior behaviour compared to the conventional voltage droop method, in view of the reactive power sharing and loads voltage control under all loading conditions. Simulation and experimental results show the good performance of the method for three paralleled VSCs in a multibus microgrid system.

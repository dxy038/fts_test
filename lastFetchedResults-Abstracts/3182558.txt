This paper presents the results of a study on evaluation of mechanical properties and identification of deformation behavior and mechanisms in a titanium alloy. Titanium is used due its excellent properties in medical and aircraft areas. With the objective of exploiting better mechanical properties, not altering its biocompatibility, it was intended to add niobium and tantalum to the titanium, being formulated alloy Ti-25Nb-25Ta produced by SPD method. The chemical analysis of the samples was accomplished by the microstructural evaluation by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The mechanical tests were: tensile strength. Mechanical and physical properties are changed dramatically by cold working. The alloy has a low elastic modulus (51 GPa), high strength (more than 1030 MPa), high elastic deformability (6.4%) and super-plastic like deformability at room temperature without work hardening. We developed a new titanium alloy with high strength, low elastic modulus, high elasticity and plasticity after cold working. The results allowed characterizing the alloy as a &#946; type.

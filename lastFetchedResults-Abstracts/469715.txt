Objective
Our aim was to determine the reduced function of endothelial nitric oxide in preeclampsia by use of noninvasive techniques in vivo.
Study design
With the use of a high-resolution ultrasound transducer, diameters of brachial artery were measured after reactive hyperemia in 20 nonpregnant women, 20 normotensive pregnant women, and 15 women with preeclampsia. The concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate were measured in samples of platelets from all groups.
Results
Flow-mediated vasodilation at 1 minute after deflation was higher in the normotensive pregnant women (115.1% ± 6.5%) than in the nonpregnant women (108.7% ± 3.9%); flow-mediated vasodilation was lower in women with preeclampsia (106.8% ± 2.7%) than in the normotensive pregnant women. The concentration of platelet cyclic guanosine monophosphate was higher in the normotensive pregnant women than in the nonpregnant women (2.21 ± 1.10 pmol/mL/108cells vs 0.746 ± 0.381 pmol/mL/108cells). There was no difference between the normotensive pregnant and the preeclamptic group (2.81 ± 1.82 pmol/mL/108cells). Furthermore, the increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate by sodium nitroprusside in platelet samples that were obtained from the normotensive pregnant women was larger than the samples from the nonpregnant women (6.20 ± 4.2 pmol/mL/108cells vs 1.62 ± 0.81 pmol/mL/108cells). The increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate from the women with preeclampsia did not differ from that in the normotensive pregnant women (5.84 ± 3.73 pmol/ml/108cells).
Conclusion
These results indicate that reduced endothelial nitric oxide activity might be due to a reduction of nitric oxide–cyclic guanosine monophosphate activity rather than its production in preeclampsia.

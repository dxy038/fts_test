Objective
To report a rare case of dengue fever presenting with reversible encephalopathy and burst suppression in the EEG.
Methods
We describe an 85-year-old man with dengue encephalopathy and EEG burst suppression and review the related literature.
Results
The patient presented with an acute comatose state and absent brainstem reflexes. Blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature and oxygen saturation were 94/49 mmHg, 82 beats/min, 34.7 Â°C, and 83% respectively. Thrombocytopenia and skin rash were found initially. Oxygen saturation was 100% immediately after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. On the second day he remained comatose with EEG burst suppression but blood pressure and temperature were within normal limits. He regained consciousness and was alert on the 12th day and there was normalization of EEG and thrombocytopenia.
Conclusions
Patients with dengue fever may present as encephalopathy with EEG burst suppression.
Significance
EEG burst suppression does not necessarily suggest a poor prognosis in patients with dengue fever.

A series of naturally occurring and synthetic biflavonoids was evaluated for inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb). Compounds 6, 24, and 25 demonstrated 96, 95, and 87% inhibition, respectively, at a screening concentration of 12.5 Î¼g/mL. The type of linkage and the presence of methoxy- and nitro-substituents in biflavonoids may contribute to the observed inhibitory activity. The results of this study represent the discovery of biflavonoids as a potential new class of antituberculosis agent.


Although Crimes have unfortunate impact on the lives of all people, women’s crime who are the main eeducators of children in the family, is of significant importance, therefore considering women’s specific crimes and efforts to address its underlying factors is so critical. In this research with the objective of the effect of social factors on women’s delinquency, we have studied theories associated with crime and derived four hypothesis from them which were tested by survey method. The population of sample consists of the fifty delinquent women – who were arrested by Robat Karim security police due to committing crime within one month- and non-delinquent women who have almost the same living conditions as delinquent women but they were covered by Robat-Karim Welfare Organization. Findings show that there is significant difference in terms of addiction of the husband and disruption of the family between these two groups, however no significant statistical difference appears in terms of denial of access to educational facilities and suitable job, place of residence and suburbanization. Both groups had almost the same situation but one is criminal and the other hasn’t committed any crime.

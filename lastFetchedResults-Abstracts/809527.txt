A new multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) algorithm is proposed for optimizing network topology. In this paper, the MOSA algorithm is used to perform two-objective simultaneous optimization. The two objectives examined in this paper are the critical packet generation rate, and average number of overall packet loads. Our results indicate that homogeneous networks can support a large critical packet generation rate under the congestion-free state, but the networks must be able to sustain relatively heavy packet load pressure if the same packet generation rate is assigned to a more heterogeneous network. At the same time, it is also found that heterogeneous networks can relieve packet load pressure, but the network is likely to become congested due to an abrupt increase of packet loads. We find that when the network size is large, lowering the average number of packet loads and raising the critical packet generation rate need not to be compromised too much. We also point out that networks can be more robust to abrupt increase of packet loads if networks are structured more homogeneously in the process of network size increment.

The objective of this paper is to present an approach to behavioral modeling that can be applied to predict the nonlinear response of power amplifiers with memory. Starting with the discrete-time, complex-baseband full Volterra model, we define a novel methodology that retains only radial branches that can be implemented with one-dimensional finite impulse response filters. This model is subsequently simplified by selecting a subset of directions using an ad hoc procedure. Both models are evaluated in terms of accuracy in the time and frequency domains and complexity, and are compared with other models described in the literature. The evaluation is conducted using a low-voltage silicon RF driver amplifier and a 5-W PA, which are characterized at different levels with diverse modulation formats, including wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signals. In all cases, comparison of the measured and simulated responses confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The presence of heavy metals in the aqueous waste streams is
a problem due to its harmful effects on human health and on
the fauna and flora which receives water bodies. Metal
immobilization through adsorption and precipitation is
considered as a common mechanism to decrease the hazards
of heavy metal. The objective of this study is the uptake of
Cu2+ from aqueous solution by ?-Al2O3/carbon nano tube
composite with thermodynamic viewpoint. The adsorption
equilibrium data follow the Freundlich model better than the
Langmuir and DKR models and the adsorption equilibrium
was described well by the Freundlich isotherm model with
maximum adsorption capacity of 17.20mg/g for Cu2+.
Various thermodynamic parameters, such as ?G°, ?H° and
?S° have been calculated. The thermodynamics of the
adsorption of all ions onto the nanocomposite of ?-Al2O3
/CNT system indicates spontaneous and endothermic nature
of the process.

The reaction of 2,6-diacetylpyridine (dap) and isonicotinoyl- or benzoylhydrazide leads to bishydrazones H2dapin (1a) and H2dapb (1b), respectively. The condensation can either take place as a bimolecular kinetic process between the two reactants or as a monomolecular metal-templated synthesis in the presence of nickel(II) ions. In the latter case the reaction products are charged 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(hydrazone) nickel(II) complexes, which can be easily deprotonated to neutral hydrazonates. Diffractometric analysis of one of these [Ni(dapb)]2 (8b) has shown a binuclear structure with two octahedral nickel(II) ions bridged by two helicoidal dap (bishydrazonates) in a spheroidal structure of C2V symmetry. The synthesized complexes 8 are promising as antimycobacterial agents against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In particular, 8b displays significant activity (MIC=0.025 Î¼g/mL) 10-fold higher than rifampin and equal to isoniazid, while its ligand is ineffective. Compound 8b is also capable of reducing HIV-induced cytopathogenic effect in human T4 lymphocytes.

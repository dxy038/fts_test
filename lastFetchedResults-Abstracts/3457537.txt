A model of automatic neonatal respiratory control constructed as an aid in the investigation of a possible maturation in respiratory control loops during the newborn period is discussed. The primary objective was to provide a framework for investigating the hypothesis without the need for external stimuli or invasive measurements. Spontaneous sighs provide a physiological disturbance to the respiratory system by transiently altering the levels of the blood gases. The dynamic ventilatory response following such a disturbance was modeled. A change from a highly damped to a less damped pattern was found when model parameter values were varied to mimic maturation in the neonatal period. A perturbation model analysis demonstrated that the dynamic ventilatory response is most sensitive to factors affecting the gain of the peripheral chemoreflex loop. It is concluded that the model provides valuable insight into the hypothesis that the peripheral chemoreflex matures during the neonatal period and provides a viable method for testing this in the human infant.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The objective of this paper is to present a method of inspecting electrical characteristics for a printed circuit board (PCB) on a manufacturing assembly line. The inspection is facilitated by the use of two robots, a simple laboratory-made vision system, a linear conveyor transfer belt, a general purpose interface bus system, and a personal computer. The result indicates that this system is more efficient, economical, and accurate than human-operated systems.

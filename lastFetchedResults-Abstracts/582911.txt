Purpose: To determine the factors responsible for patient delay
and treatment delay in newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive
pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients.
Methods: Study subjects (N = 150) were randomly selected from
municipal health centers in Mumbai, India. Duration of symptoms,
treatment, and reason for delay were assessed using interviews and
medical records. We defined patient delay as presentation to a health
care provider (HCP)  > 20 days of the onset of TB-related symptoms
and treatment delay as therapy initiated more than 14 days after the first
consultation (for TB-related symptoms) with an HCP.
Results: Of the 150 subjects, 29% had patient delays and 81% had
treatment delays. In multivariable analysis, patient delay was significantly
associated with the self-perception that initial symptoms were due to
TB [odds ratio (OR) = 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1–12.6]
and perceived inability to pay for care (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.2–7.1).
Treatment delay was significantly associated with consulting a nonallopathic
provider (OR = 12.3, 95% CI = 1.4–105) and consulting  > 3
providers (OR = 5.0, 95% CI = 1.4–17.4). Patient interval was half the
treatment interval (median days: 15 vs. 31). Women were slightly more
likely to experience patient and treatment delays than men. For twothirds
of the patients, another TB patient was a source of TB-related
knowledge, while health education material (16%) and television (10%)
played a smaller role.
Conclusion: Treatment delay, primarily due to diagnosis delay,
was a greater problem than patient delay. Expanding public–public
and public–private partnerships and regular training sessions for
HCPs might decrease treatment delay. Media coverage and cured
TB patients as peer advocates may help to reinforce TB-related
health education messages.

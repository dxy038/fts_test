This paper classified the body motion which is not distinguished when an electric wheelchair is operated by Human Body Motion Interface (HBMI). HBMI uses the body motion which is caused by the voluntary motion. This research focuses on the operation of an electric wheelchair as a practical application of HBMI. It has been confirmed that HBMI, which uses the center of weight on the pressure sensor attached on the backrest as the body motion index, has the ability of an interface. However the problem has also remained. The system cannot distinguish different body motion when the center of weight is the same position even if the subject takes the different body motion, because the pressure data converge on the one position which is the center of weight. We call such motion, whose center of weight is the same, &#8220;Confused motion&#8221;. The objective of this paper is to solve &#8220;Confused motion&#8221;. In this paper we classified &#8220;Confused motion&#8221; by using Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The result showed &#8220;Confused Motion&#8221; had been solved.

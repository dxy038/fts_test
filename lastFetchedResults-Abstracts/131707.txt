Objective: Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is commonly used in topical formulations for the treatment of acne. Skin irritation is a common side effect, and it has been shown that controlled release of BPO from a delivery system to the skin could increase patient compliance and reduce the side effect while reducing pencutaneotrs absorption. Method: In this study, MMA/EGDM copolymer was prepared by monomers methyl methacrylate and ethylene glycol dinaethacrylate. After in pregnating copolymer MMA/EGDM, microsponges were evaluated in respect to morphology, particle size, volume, pore size and molecular weight characteristics. Releases of drug from microsponges were investigated using Cell-Franz with dialysis membrane and drug release was determined by HPLC. Results: The results showed that the cumulative amount of release increased with an increase in the concentration of the active ingredient in the formula. The amount of drug released at the first hate was higher compared to its released amount at 2nd h. This could be due to the presence of non encapsulated BPO in these formulations. When the free BPO was released, the flux remained constant for the next 7 hrs. CONCLUSION: This flux represents the release of entrapped drug from microsponges. Released BPO in different dosage forms was respectively lotion < gel < cream. The topical microsponge delivery system can clearly maximize the amount of time that an active ingredient presents on the skin surface within the epidermis, therefore, into the body.

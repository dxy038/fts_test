We consider the NP-hard problem of assembly line balancing with station paralleling. We assume an
arbitrary number of parallel workstations can be assigned to each stage. Every task requires a specified
tooling/equipment, and this tooling/equipment should be available in all parallel workstations of the
stage to which the task is assigned. Our objective is to find an assignment of tasks to stages so as to minimize
sum of station opening and tooling/equipment costs. We propose two branch and bound algorithms:
one for optimal solutions and one for near optimal solutions. We find that optimal solutions
can be found quickly for medium sized problem instances; for larger sized problems we find high quality
solutions in reasonable solution times.

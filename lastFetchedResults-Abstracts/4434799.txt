In the domain of process automation there exist two upcoming standards for the modeling of plant data, namely ISO 15926 and IEC 62424 (CAEX). Both standardsÂ´ objective is to describe the plant over the whole lifecycle. Within this contribution both standards will be compared. By using an example application of the automation domain, i.e. a belt conveyor, the application of both standards will be shown exemplarily. Applying a list of criteria, both standards will be compared in order to identify strengths and weaknesses.

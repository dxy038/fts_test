The objective of the paper is to implement topology control by maintain minimum degree and connectivity between nodes from the Virtual-Backbone (VB) updates. VB construction is very familiar, to reduce flooding and broadcast storm problem in wireless networks. Nodes in MANET, move anywhere at any time, it requires strong topology and connectivity maintenance between VB and other nodes. To overcome this problem we provide the topology maintenance procedure and connectivity maintenance using 2-connected graph approximation. Stable topology is achieved by connection maintenance between virtual backbone nodes by providing minimum rerouting and connection balanced routing between nodes. We proposed a localized algorithm (Backbone based Topology Control Algorithm, BTCA) to support minimum degree nodes, by reducing the number of connections in one VB and maintain network topology. Our results are witnessed by simulation.

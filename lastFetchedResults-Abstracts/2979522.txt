This paper presents a method of compensating for harmonics and reactive currents generated by nonlinear and/or reactive loads, by employing a bidirectional switch-mode rectifier. In this way, VAR compensation is achieved as a by-product while operating a switch-mode high power factor rectifier. Most bi-directional switch-mode rectifiers are suitable for such an application with some modifications of the control scheme and quantities that need to be sensed. A new switch-mode high power factor rectifier is introduced which has a bi-directional power flow capability and makes it possible to cancel harmonic and reactive currents

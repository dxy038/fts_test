Application of appropriate methods for planning and decision making in land evaluation is very important for the optimization of mankind activities. The objective of this study is land suitability evaluation using fuzzy and multi criteria decision making methods to develop agricultural and range management land uses in parcel A of Gheshlagh dam watershed in Kurdistan province, west of Iran (in 2011). Following data collection and weighting effective criteria for land suitability evaluation for three types of the land uses including irrigation farming, dry farming and range management based on fuzzy triangular function; fuzzy simple additive weighting (FSAW) method was applied to overlay maps and data analysis in GIS environment. Then, the prioritization of land uses was done based on quantitative analysis. The results showed that weighting of decision criteria and zoning of land from ecological perspective can be done easily and more accurately by using fuzzy method. Additionally, it was found that development of irrigation farming, dry farming and range management land uses is allocated in 3.1, 14.8 and 28.5 percentages of the study area, respectively, while the rest of the region (53.6 %) is unsuitable to develop above mentioned land uses

A stepwise recursive search algorithm (SRSA) is proposed for adaptively controlling the electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antenna. By calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF), the algorithm is shown to obtain a higher gain for output SINR than the normalized steepest gradient method (SGM) when the iteration number is small and the objective function is calculated precisely.

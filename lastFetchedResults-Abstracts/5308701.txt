In the distributed systems there are various distributed consumers who negatively influence the power quality indices (parameters), many disturbance-sensitive loads and also various distributed controlled devices are intended for improving power quality. The main objective of the paper is to present a central control system which, on the basis of the set of input signals (mainly voltages and currents measured at selected points of a power system), will generate reference signals for individual controlled, distributed devices to be used for the supply improvement. The authors take on the task of analysis of an example power system and design a power quality improvement system, optimized by means of genetic algorithms.

The per-node throughput capacity of hybrid radio frequency and free space optics (RF/FSO) networks is studied and the benefit of using this hybrid network architecture over the pure RF wireless networks is evaluated. The hybrid RF/FSO network consists of an RF ad hoc network of n nodes, m of them (so called super nodes) are equipped with an additional FSO transceiver. Every RF and FSO transceiver is able to transmit at a maximum data rate of W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> bits/sec, respectively. All the super node are connected by the FSO links and thus can form a stand-alone FSO network. With a minimum transmit power objective, an upper bound on the per node capacity of radic(1/n log n) + c<sub>2</sub>W<sub>2</sub> radic(m log m)/n is derived. In order to prove that this upper bound is achievable, we design a hybrid routing scheme in which the data traffic is divided into two classes and use different routing strategies: a portion of data will be forwarded with the (partial) support of super nodes in a hierarchical routing fashion, and the rest will be purely routed through RF links in a multi-hop fashion. By properly balancing the load between these two classes of traffic, it is shown that this upper bound is tight when the maximum data rate ratio of FSO and RF transceivers, W<sub>2</sub>/W<sub>1</sub>, grows slower than radicn. Under such circumstances, the capacity improvement with the support of FSO nodes, as compared with the results for RF wireless networks in [1], is evaluated. A significant capacity gain will be achieved if W<sub>2</sub>/W<sub>1</sub>m log m = Omega(n). The results characterize the number of super nodes and/or the FSO data rate necessary in order to cause a non-trivial increase in the per-node throughput.

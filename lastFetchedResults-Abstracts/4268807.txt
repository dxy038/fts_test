Survivable service provisioning design has emerged as one of the most important issues in communication networks in recent years. In this work, we study the problem under a scheduled traffic model in wavelength convertible WDM optical mesh networks. In this model, a set of demands is given, and the setup time and teardown time of a demand are known in advance. We propose an efficient capacity provision matrix based algorithm that uses different demand scheduling policies to solve the problem effectively under the scheduled traffic model. The objective is to minimize the total number of wavelength-links used by working paths and protection paths of a given set of demands by maximally exploiting network resource reuse in both space and time while 100% restorability is guaranteed against any single failures. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is very effective in terms of total network resources required and computational time used compared with Integer Linear Programming based methods proposed in our previous work.

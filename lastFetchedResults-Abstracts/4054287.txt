A novel fuzzy multiobjective model is proposed for service restoration of shipboard power systems. In this model, the objective functions of different dimensions are normalized to interval [0, 1], and these objective functions are integrated by using analytic hierarchy process. Meanwhile, the priorities of load and switch are taken into account. The heuristic rule of replacing switch operation with load switching is implemented by using a generalized load-branch matrix method, and generator capacity bound, branch current limit, node voltage limit, connectivity and radial configuration constraints are all considered. The convergence performance can be well improved by utilizing an adaptive genetic algorithm based on cloud theory. Numerical results based on a typical shipboard power system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the fuzzy multiobjective model.

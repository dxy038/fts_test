In this contribution, a real experience of rapid design and deployment of context-aware services for an exhibition hall is detailed. The prototype has been built on a combination of a commercial system (which has been customized and improved to satisfy the prototype needs) with an in-home developed context acquisition framework. In order to partially overcome device fragmentation issues, we have focused on the development of web-based context-aware applications. The whole system has been deployed from scratch under real constraints of time and environment. The objective has been to test the integration problems of context-aware systems, in order to infer some conclusions on what it is needed to generalize them.

Regulatory T cells (Treg) are increased and directly infected by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and likely play a role in other feline autoimmune, neoplastic, and infectious diseases. Phenotypically, Treg are best characterized by surface expression of CD4 and CD25 and intranuclear expression of the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3. Our objective was to clone and sequence feline FOXP3 for the purpose of developing assays to enhance studies of feline Treg. We determined the feline FOXP3 is 1293 nucleotides in length and codes for a protein that shares high homology to other species. A splice variant devoid of exon 2 was also identified. A real-time PCR assay was developed and used to show Foxp3 mRNA expression occurs primarily in CD4+CD25+ T cells. Two cross-reacting antibodies were identified by immunocytochemical staining of HEK293 cells transfected with feline FOXP3. The antibody labeling confirmed the nuclear localization of the protein. A flow cytometric assay was also validated and used to correlate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of feline Treg induced by treatment of lymph node lymphocytes with flagellin or LPS in combination with mitogen or IL2. Together, these studies provide useful tools to further investigate Foxp3 and Tregs in cats.

In supply chain management, distribution routing is a key transportation routing function. This function involves determining the geographic route a vehicle will travel to reach the delivery destination. In this paper we develop a solution procedure to guide the problem-solving process and quickly leads to a good routing solution of the distribution operations with an objective of minimizing the transportation cost via minimizing the total distance travelled while satisfying demand and capacity constraints.

introduction & Objective: Cobalt element contributes in the structure of vitamin B12 and can interfere with Fe+3 ions absorption. It is also important for the synthesis of hemoglobin and red blood cells. The aim of this study was to determine the level of cobalt in drinking water and crude vegetables in Yazd city.
Materials & Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed for this study. The types of vegetables which were tested in this study were spinach and cabbage. Samples from drinking water were taken as well. For determination of cobalt, synthetic spectrometric method was used based on the catalytical effect of cobalt on red-Pirogallol hydrogen peroxides (at pH 7) reaction. Results: Results of this study showed that the amount of cobalt was 3.49x10-2 p. p. m for cabbage, 0.041x10-2 for spinach and 0.0121p. p. m for drinking water.Conclusion: Findings of this study revealed that at present the amount of cobalt in these vegetables is less than the minimum allowed.

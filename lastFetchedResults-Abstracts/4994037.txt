This paper describes the goals of the MODENA project, aiming at a fine description of the maritime environment by means of electromagnetic sensors. The main steps of the project go through a modeling of the ocean surface, the man-made objects on the surface as well as of the interaction between the electromagnetic waves with this surface and the objects. The project is scheduled to last 4.5 years. The final objective consists of providing a view of the dynamic simulation of the ocean surface and moving objects following a script and constrained by the selected radar parameters (frequency, polarization, speed and altitude of the carrier, etc). We will discuss the different parts of the project and present the actual state of development achieved by the partners and the expected results.

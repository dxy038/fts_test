The traditional Canny operator does not have the adaptive ability in the selection of the variance of the Gaussian filtering. Filtering requires human intervention, and the selection of the variance of Gaussian filtering affects the edge preserving and denoising effect. An improved edge detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The Gaussian filtering is replaced with the morphological filtering. Experimental results show that the improved Canny operator can filter the salt &amp; pepper noise effectively, improve the accuracy of edge detection, and achieve an ideal effect of edge detection. The experiment results show that the objective evaluation and visual effect are good.

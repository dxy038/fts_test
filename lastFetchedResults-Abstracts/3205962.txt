The recent advances in information technology have simplified voice data transmission but brings with it major security threats. Voice data transmission not only conveys confidential information but also convey information about the speaker. Most of the security domain complements secrecy about speaker identity. This paper presents a method that deals with the subject of hiding speaker identity. Alteration of acoustic features mainly pitch, and energy of speakers voice is necessary for making it difficult for adversary to infer about the speaker. Speaker normalization approach is used to accomplish this. An evaluation of subjective and objective tests confirms that the normalized signal allows speech waveform to sound intelligible without revealing information about the speaker. This technique can be used in medical, in military and in those domains in which maintaining secrecy about the speaker is a major security concern.

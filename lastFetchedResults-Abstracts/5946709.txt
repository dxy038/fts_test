Methods: Different concentrations of n-butanol extraction layers of Geranium Wilfordii were used to affect HepG<sub>2</sub> cells cultured in vitro. SRB assay was used to determine inhibition rate of cell growth, and flow cytometry assay was used to determine apoptosis. Fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM was used to observe changes of concentration of intracellular calcium ion of tumor cells, and flow cytometry was used to determine changes of intracellular active oxygen species of tumor cells. Results: n-butanol extraction layer could significantly inhibit growth of HepG<sub>2</sub> cells and induce occurrence of apoptosis, and the IC50 was 83.51 ug/ml. After effects of n-butanol extraction layer for 48h, the amount of HepG<sub>2</sub> cells significantly reduced. Under the effect of Fluo-3/AM fluorescent probe, stronger green fluorescence appeared. At the same time, detected intracellular ROS more significantly increased. Conclusion: n-butanol layer of Geranium Wilfordii could inhibit growth of HepG<sub>2</sub> cells and induce occurrence of apoptosis, which was possibly realized by means of the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion of HepG<sub>2</sub> cells and the increase of intracellular active oxygen species.

Global warming and global climatic changes have attracted many concerns. The objective of this research was to examine greenhouse gas emission and its resultant global warming potential (GWP) in wheat production in Gorgan, north-east of Iran. To do this, six wheat fields were selected and during three consecutive growing seasons, data were gathered on input and energy use in all production practices. The production practices were classified into eight categories, i.e. seed bed preparation, plant protection, weeds control, irrigation, harvesting and transportation for storage. Results showed that GWP for wheat production was between 268 and 923 kg equivalent CO2 per ha which was equal to 104 to 272 kg eq-CO2 per t wheat production. Among different production activities, nitrogen fertilizer with GWP of 291 kg eq-CO2 ha-1 had the greatest contribution. Using fuels in field operations with a GWP of 213 kg eq-CO2 ha-1 occupied the next position. Comparisons showed that wheat production in Gorgan results in more GWP than some other locations around the world.

According to the nature of high order cumulant, defines the four order cyclic cumulant to solve the signal separation problem. If the mixed signals are independent of each other, its four order cyclic cumulant matrix is diagonal matrix. Taking use of this performance to modify the iterative learning rate of the objective function can separate the cyclostationary signals from the mixed signals effectively, simulation results prove the effection.

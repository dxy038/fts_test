Background & Aims: Epidural fibrosis (EF) is part of natural physiological tissue response to laminctomy
and it may be an important cause offailed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). There is still no effective medical
or surgical therapy for EF. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble member ofthe tumor necrosis factor receptor
family that might playa role in postoperative EF. The objective ofthis study was to evaluate the relationship
between serum OPG level and EF after laminectomy.
Results: SerumOPG level ranged from 0-4 Pmolll with a median of 1.5 Pmol/l in group A, 0-6 Pmolll with
a median of 2.42 Pmolll in group Bland 0-6 Pmolll with a median of 2.15 Pmolll in group B2. There was
notany significantdifference in OPG levelsamong these 3 groups.
Conclusion: This study showed no relation betweenOPG level and existence ofpostlaminectomyEF after8
weeks.
Methods: Sixty rabbits were employed and divided randomly into two groups. Group A contained 20
rabbits as controls and group B contained 40 rabbits that underwent bilateral laminecyomy at L4 and L5
lumbar levels under an approved surgical protocol. Serum sample was obtained after 8 weeks from all
rabbits and then the animals in group B were killed in accordance with the guidelines for euthanasia. The
spine segment from L3 to L6 was removed en bloc. The amount ofscar tissue at the laminectomy defect was
scored on an ordinal score from 0 to 3 with a scoring system similar to that of He et al. According to the
amount of scar the rabbits in group B, were divided into two groups: B1 with low fibrosis (grade 0, 1) and
B2 with high fibrosis (grade 2, 3). The serum OPG level of groups A, BI and B2 were determined using
ELISA method. The one way ANOYA was used to assess significant difference among groups.

Target tracking and obstacle avoidance are demonstrated for uncalibrated visual servoing. An objective function is designed that encourages target following by a robotic end-effector while discouraging movements near an obstacle. The objective function incorporates the error between the target and the end-effector and a potential function related to the obstacle. This objective function is minimized using a dynamic nonlinear least squares optimization method in conjunction with a recursive least squares Jacobian estimation algorithm. The approach is generic and can be applied to a variety of systems. Calibration is unnecessary after a reconfiguration or disturbance to the robotic workcell. This type of control has the potential to provide a low-cost, low-maintenance automation solution for unstructured industries and environments. Experimental results demonstrate both target tracking and obstacle avoidance for an uncalibrated robotic system

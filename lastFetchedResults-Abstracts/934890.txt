The objective of this study has been to investigate the effects of two ingredients i) acetylated potato starch (APS) and ii) sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) on the textural attributes and eating quality of instant noodles. Using low-protein soft wheat flour (Australian Soft) as the base material, samples of noodles incorporating varying proportions of APS and CMC were evaluated for product texture, colour and fat uptake. The variables were studied using a central composite design and textural characteristics were assessed using the TA-XT2, colour by the Minolta Chroma Meter. The results were analyzed by response surface methodology and showed that the two variables enhance the hardness and reduce adhesive values of cooked instant noodles. Electron microscopy also demonstrated the development of a more continuous network structure within the noodles. The addition of CMC had weakened the noodle inner structure and reduced the cohesiveness values of the cooked instant noodles. In contrast, APS provides hardness but does not affect cohesiveness. Marginal observable difference was found in product colour for the various treatment combinations, with a slightly dull appearance, viz less white and less yellow compared with the control. Trials to produce the lowest fat uptake rating indicated that 10% APS was optimal. The results may provide a basis for modifying formulations for use with low-protein soft wheat flours to provide eating quality and colour attributes to meet the preferences of specific customer groups. The conclusion of this study is that the combined use of APS and CMC primarily affects the textural attributes of hardness and adhesiveness rather than the other quality parameters of instant noodle that have been assessed. In addition, APS has the potential to enhance the performance of low-protein soft wheat flours for instant noodle manufacture.

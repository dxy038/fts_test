We consider the Multiple Cluster Scheduling Problem (MCSP), where the objective is to schedule n parallel rigid jobs on N identical clusters, minimizing the maximum completion time (makespan). MCSP is 2-inapproximable (unless P = NP), and several approximation algorithms have already been proposed. However, ratio 2 has only been reached by algorithms that use extremely costly and complex subroutines as &#8221;black boxes&#8221; which are polynomial and yet impractical due to prohibitive constants. Our objective within this work is to determine a reasonable restriction of MCSP where the inapproximability lower bound could be tightened in almost linear time. Thus, we consider a restriction of MCSP where jobs do not require strictly more than half of the processors of a cluster, and we provide a 2-approximation running in O(log(nh<sub>max</sub>)n(N + log(n))), where h<sub>max</sub> is the processing time of the longest job. This approximation is the best possible, as this restriction (and even simpler ones) remains 2-inapproximable.

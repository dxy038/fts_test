Abstract  
Background and Objective: Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common sexually transmitted protozoal infection and is associated with several adverse outcomes such as preterm labour, delivery of a low-birth weight infant, and facilitation of sexually transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. In Iran, the prevalence of trichomoniasis has been reported between 2 to 8%. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of this infection among women referred to a laboratory in Zanjan.
Material and Methods: In this Cross-sectional study, 328 women were selected via convenience sampling. Because of vaginal discharge, itching, burning and malodor, they were referred to a laboratory by a gynecologist. After preparing a demographical check list, the vaginal specimens were examined by wet smears for Trichomonas vaginalis, in 2010. To analyze the data, we use chi square and fisher exact test.
Results: The clients (54.43%)  are 25- 34 years old, homemaker (87%), illiterate or   primary school education  (48%). The prevalence of T.  Vaginalis infection is  6.4%.  there is no significant relationship between T. Vaginalis infection and factors like age, education level, marriage age, contraceptive method, occupation, dwelling place and number of labour.
Conclusion: In comparison with other studies, the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis in Zanjan is moderate.  Because of co-existing with other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), we suggest conducting further studies about the prevalence of other STDs in Zanjan.

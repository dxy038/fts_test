The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of topical administration of honey in prevention of or reduction in post-surgical peritoneal adhesions in dog. The study was conducted on 18 adult female mixed-breed dogs with a mean ± SD weight of 20 ± 4.25 kg. A standardized surgical trauma (serosal trauma model) was made in the dogs' descending colon to induce adhesion formation. The control group (n = 9) received saline treatment. In the experiment group (n = 9), the lesions were covered with honey. Three weeks after laparotomy, the dogs were sacrificed and the adhesions were graded according to the Evans's scoring system. Overall, 67% (n = 6) of the control and 22% (n = 2) of the experiment animals presented with moderate (grade-2) and severe (grade-3) adhesions. In the control group, there were 3 (33%) dogs with grade-0 or grade-1 adhesions, while in the experiment group there were 7 (78%) dogs with the same grades of adhesions. The difference between the two groups was significant (PO.05). It was concluded that honey is a useful covering for damaged peritoneal surfaces and has high effectiveness in reducing post-operative adhesions.

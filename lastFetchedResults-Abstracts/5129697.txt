Modeling the thermal environment of data centers, including prediction of the air flow and temperature distributions can be computationally intensive using CFD. Reduced order models or data-driven meta-models are necessary to provide real-time assessment of optimum operating conditions for data centers to reduce energy usage. Here, a simulation-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach is employed as a predictive tool. A model for a basic single cold aisle data center configuration is analyzed using the commercial CFD software FloTHERM. The simulation results are used to generate a database for training and cross validation of a primary ANN corresponding to a specific set of input and output operating conditions. Good agreement is achieved between the CFD and ANN based model predictions for maximum rack inlet temperatures over a range of operating conditions. In addition, by combining the ANN with a cost function based Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), the operating conditions can be inversely predicted for desired outputs (e.g. rack inlet temperatures). The total simulation time for the ANN-MOGA approach is reduced significantly compared to a fully CFD-based optimization methodology.

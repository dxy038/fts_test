This is the third set of recommendations in a series&#194;&#191; which has the objective of influencing uniformity in the presentation of information on the features, characteristics and performance of electronic measuring instruments and thus assisting in their comparative assessment and selection by potential users. The establishment of standards of performance is not an objective of these recommendations. For the present purpose low-frequency signal generators are defined as laboratory instruments which produce unmodulated frequencies in the range 0 to 500 kc/s. The basic instrument is generally a sine-wave generator but the variants have to some extent been covered in these recommendations. In the case of many of the features the method of expression is very similar to the recommendations for amplitude-modulated or frequency-modulated signal generators which have already been published.

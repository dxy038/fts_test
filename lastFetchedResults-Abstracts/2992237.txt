Models for equipment selection and schedule changeovers for multiple periods are developed. Because of high capital costs and short depreciation cycles for surface mount technology (SMT) placement machines, the target application for the paper, high capacity utilization, is the primary objective in solving the models. A solution procedure is presented for the described model, which first determines a rough set of machines to be added or removed for each machine-line, then applies a branch and bound heuristic to rough sets to obtain a near optimal solution to the problem

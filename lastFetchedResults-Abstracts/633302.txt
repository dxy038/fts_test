Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of coriander seed powder (CSP) on the atherosclerotic and cardioprotective indices in type 2 diabetic patients. 
Materials and Methods: In this study, fifty type 2 diabetic patients consumed 2 capsules of the CSP /day for a period of 6weeks. Blood samples were collected from the patients before and after the course of CSP consumption after 12 h of fasting .The plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C , HDL-C ,urea and creatinine were measured before and after the CSP consumption for 6 weeks. Atherosclerotic and cardioprotective indices were calculated. 
Results: The CSP consumption for 6 weeks in type 2 diabetic patients significantly reduced plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-C (p <  0.001), but HDL-C was not significantly changed (p? 0.05).But there was no significant effect on urea and creatinine concentrations. Atherosclerotic index decreased while cardioprotective indices increased. 
Conclusion: Since the CSP consumption reduced several components of metabolic syndrome and decreased atherosclerotic and increased cardioprotective indices, the CSP may have cardiovascular protective effect in type 2 diabetic patients.

Objective
To study the risk profile associated with surgical revascularization for mixed left main and left main equivalent diseases.
Methods and results

Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who underwent CABG from January 1997 and December 2002 were studied. 210 patients were included of which 30.5% (64) had left main, 49.5% (104) had left main equivalent and 20% (42) had mixed type of stenotic disease. The mixed type left coronary disease was associated with very high post-operative mortality. The factors associated with mortality were degree of left main artery stenosis, cardiopulmonary bypass pump time, no. of packed cell units transfused during surgery, post-operative low cardiac output, re-exploration of chest and no. of days spent as intubated. Low cardiac output, chest re-exploration and no. of days intubated were independently associated with mortality.
Conclusions

“Mixed left main and left main equivalent disease” makes a large proportion of left sided CAD. It is a unique subtype associated with very high risk, and it should be treated with extra caution. Characterization of its risk profile should be done with larger studies to improve the outcome.

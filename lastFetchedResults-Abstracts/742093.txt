Objective: We investigated if blockade of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) abolishes the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning (IP) on myocardial metabolism and ischemia-induced reactive hyperemia (RH) in pigs. Methods: IP was elicited by a single cycle of 5 min occlusion and 5 min reperfusion of coronary artery, followed by 15 min of test ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Vehicle or the ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) blocker, glibenclamide (3 or 6 mg/kg; G3 or G6) was administered before IP (groups; IP, G3+IP, G6+IP). As respective controls, the same treatment was performed in groups without IP (groups; C, G3, G6). Tissue levels of ATP, creatine phosphate (CP) and intracellular pH (pHi) in the area at risk were measured by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RH after 5 min of preconditioning ischemia was assessed by regional myocardial blood flow. Results: ATP and pHi were preserved after 15 min of ischemia in the IP group [C/IP; ATP=57±4/76±10% of baseline, pHi=6.18±0.08/6.66±0.03, P<0.05, C vs. IP]. Both doses of glibenclamide completely abolished the ATP sparing effect of IP. The high dose completely abolished pHi preservation (G6+IP=6.33±0.06), while the low dose showed only a partial effect (G3+IP=6.48±0.03). Glibenclamide did not adversely affect myocardial metabolism in groups without IP. Glibenclamide attenuated RH after 5 min of ischemia by 30% in both subendocardium and subepicardium. Conclusions: Blockade of KATP abolished the preconditioning effect on myocardial metabolism, and partially attenuated post-ischemic reactive hyperemia in pigs. These results indicate that KATP activation might be involved in the mechanisms of these phenomena, reactive hyperemia is not sufficient to induce IP protection.

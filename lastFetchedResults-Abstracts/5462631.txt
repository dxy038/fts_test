This paper presents a two-stage local search method for synthesizing finite precision FIR filter coefficients, with the aim to reduce the number of addition/subtraction in the realization of linear phase FIR filters. In the first stage, an initial set of coefficients is formed by taking into consideration the sensitivities of coefficients on frequency response. In the second stage, a tree search algorithm is utilized to achieve the objective function specified by the desirable Normalized Peak Ripple. The size of the search space is also studied.

Objective: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the psychometric characteristics and perform a factor analysis of McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL) in a sle of recovered depressed patients.
Methods: Present study was a cross sectional research. Data were obtained from a sle of recovered depressed patients. A total of 354 participants (67 males, 287 females) were assessed using the structured clinical interview for DSMIV disorders (SCID) to ensure their full recovery from their most recent episode of depression. Then, they completed a series of selfreport
measures, including the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL8.54 and Cronbachrsquo s alpha using SPSS16 were done for analyzing data.
Results: Descriptive statistics for the MQOL were performed, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the fitness of the hypothesized factor structure. The Cronbach alpha  coefficients were calculated for the questionnaire and its each subscale to examine the internal reliability, which was found to be high for the overall questionnaire as well as its each subscale, as alpha 
coefficients ranged from 0.58 (for the physical scale) to 0.88 (for the existential scale).
Conclusion: MQOL can be employed as a tool for assessing quality of life in research and practice in these patients.

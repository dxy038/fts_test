The users can get the knowledge from centralized shared resources at any place and any time in e-learning by means of cloud computing technology. However, it is not clear the influence of Quality of Service on the e-leaning environment. In this paper, we investigate the influence on e-learning under Virtual Desktop Infrastructure by using a network emulator. In each case that we set the various values as QoS parameter, we observe subjective and objective responses of users. The purpose is to clarify the relationship between network quality of service and e-learning usability.

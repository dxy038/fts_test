In this paper, we present a new method to measure the jitter caused by noise in a communication system. First, we show some conventional jitter measurers and after we present the new proposed method. We will test the new jitter measurer on the analog PLL (phase lock loop). The objective is to show that the results measured by the new process are correct, rigorous and coherent with the well known theoretical and experimental values.

Objective: Periventricular leukomalacia, a common neonatal brain white matter lesion, is a major risk factor for cerebral palsy. Subclinical chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for the development of periventricular leukomalacia, and inflammatory cytokines have been implicated as central mediators of brain injury in this disorder. To elucidate the relationship between the local expression of cytokines and periventricular leukomalacia, we studied neonatal brains to determine whether high expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 was observed in these lesions. Study design: Immunohistochemical staining for cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) was performed in 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain sections of 17 cases with periventricular leukomalacia. Specimens were obtained from autopsies performed between 1987 and 1994. Brain sections from 17 cases of neonatal deaths without periventricular leukomalacia lesions matched for gestational age at birth, duration of postnatal survival, and presence or absence of infection-related morbidity were used as controls. Results: The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, or interleukin-6 was demonstrated in 88% (15/17) of cases with and in 18% (3/17) of cases without periventricular leukomalacia (p < 0.001). Cytokines were expressed mainly in hypertrophic astrocytes and microglial cells. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 was identified in 82% (14/17), 29% (5/17), and 71% (12/17) of cases of periventricular leukomalacia, respectively. However, a significantly lower proportion of cases without periventricular leukomalacia expressed tumor necrosis factor-α (18%, 3/17) and interleukin-6 (6%, 1/17) than those with the disorder (p < 0.005 for each). Conclusions: Expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 was observed more frequently in brain lesions with periventricular leukomalacia than in those without periventricular leukomalacia. These findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that proinflammatory cytokines play a role in the genesis of periventricular leukomalacia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:406-11.)

A bidirectional antenna with the directivity enhancement is realized by arranging the element of a probe-fed elliptical ring antenna to form the three configurations of the linear array. From the investigations, the side-by-side array affects the beam in the H-plane whereas the collinear array influences the E-plane pattern. However both E- and H-plane patterns were impacted by the face-to-face configuration. Moreover, it is found that the collinear arrangement provides optimum directivity and it can achieve the bidirectional pattern for any array spacing. Although. the face-to-face arrangement accomplishes high directivity, the bidirectional beam can be realized only in some cases of the spacing. Therefore, all of these configurations have to be considered in the design of the planar array for further works.

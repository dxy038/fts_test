The object of this paper is to share experiences on deployment and tuning of real-time advanced applications for distribution and distribution state estimator at BC Hydro control center. During past 4 years, BC Hydro has been engaged in the project to procure Distribution Management System (DMS) with objective to enable real-time power system monitoring and control of distribution network in an optimal manner. The emphasis was placed on advanced network applications such as Volt-Var Optimization that are expected to improve the performance and reliability of distribution network. However, a key application that provides basic inputs to advanced applications is distribution state estimator that calculates power system state of distribution network in the real-time. Deployment of state estimator is a difficult process that relies on a number of prerequisites that include, establishing of distribution network model, calibrating and mapping real-time telemetry, extensive software testing and application tuning.

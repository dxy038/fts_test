In present scenario parallel database systems are being applicable in a broad range of systems, right from database applications (OLTP) server to decision support systems (OLAP) server. These developments involve database processing and querying over parallel systems. A means to the success of parallel database systems, particularly in decision-support applications (Data warehousing), is parallel query optimization. Given a SQL query, parallel query optimization has the goal of finding a parallel plan that delivers the query result in minimal time. Various useful and competent, optimizing solutions to be implemented For the parallel databases. Parallel DBS attempt to develop recently in order to make highperformance and high-availability database servers at a much lower price for multiprocessor computer architectures than mainframe computers. The objective of this paper is define a novel approach on how to achieve parallelism for relational database multithreaded query execution use to maximum resource utilization of CPU and memory. This technique offer a solution to the problem of minimizing the response time of input queries against parallel databases.

Although brain neurotransmitter (BN) won Nobel Prize in 2000, their non-invasive measurement had been a challenge for internal secretion maladjustment of human brain. Our objective is to study indirect and non-invasive BN measurement validity through novel combination methods of auricular pointÂ´s infrared image and wavelet analysis. For 10-subjective with half of male graduate students we made three kinds of contrast experiments in inducement condition of cognitive lie psychology, medicament and mobile phone radiation hitting 90% validity. The conclusions are that an interesting and important solution based on Chinese standard of auricular point mapping had been found to a nicety and this new work will lay a foundation for SoC design of brain chemistry test aiming at sub-health people with highlight on biomedical microelectronics

Recent years witnessed growing concerns regarding scalability of todayÂ´s Internet architecture. Universality of the single IP numbering space is one cause of unbound growth of entropy and inter-domain routing tables in the core network. Recently, the IAB proposed to review the Internet addressing architecture to separate name and location spaces. In this paper, we propose an instance of VIN-based IPv6 addressing, compatible with other Future Internet efforts, to tackle this issue with regards to the vehicular communications. We design a global hierarchical identification space of up to 2<sup>35</sup> unique and distinct vehicles per manufacturer (2<sup>16</sup> manufacturers). An original method of mapping these identifiers to addresses and guarantee the uniqueness conservation is proposed. The objective is to create a sustainable addressing architecture for vehicular communications and introduce the manufacturer as a new vehicular services provider. We also propose a network architecture design that allows to use pseudonyms as a way to tackle identity privacy concerns.

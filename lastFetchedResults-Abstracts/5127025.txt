An algorithm for the diagnosis of phase faults in array antennas from amplitude only far-field or near-field data is presented. The technique allows one to diagnose the faults affecting only the phase of the excitation coefficient. Whose amplitudes are then assumed equal to the nominal values. Discretised phase values, typical of digital phase shifters, are considered. The proposed approach is based on the optimization of a suitable objective functional via an hybrid evolutionary algorithm. The main results of an extensive numerical analysis are presented in order to show the performance of the method.

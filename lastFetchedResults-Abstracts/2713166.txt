This paper presents a new strategy to control the generated power from energy sources existing in autonomous and isolated microgrids. In this particular study, the power system consists of a power electronic converter supplied by a battery bank, which is used to form the ac grid (grid former converter), an energy source based on a wind turbine with its respective power electronic converter (grid supplier converter), and the power consumers (loads). The main objective of this proposed strategy is to control the state of charge of the battery bank limiting the voltage on its terminals by controlling the power generated by the energy sources. This is done without using dump loads or any physical communication among the power electronic converters or the individual energy source controllers. The electrical frequency of the microgrid is used to inform the power sources and their respective converters about the amount of power that they need to generate in order to maintain the battery-bank charging voltage below or equal its maximum allowable limit. Experimental results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.

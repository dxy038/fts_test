A method for spectral analysis of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PRVEPs) that results in spectral peaks of uniform width in the frequency domain for signals with a wide range of time-domain duration is presented. Uniformity of spectral peak width is necessary for accurate comparison of spectra. The desired frequency domain characteristics can be achieved through the application of tunable data windows prior to transformation. The I/sub o/-sinh (Kaiser), Gaussian, and cosine-taper (Tukey) windows were evaluated as to their ability to produce power spectra with uniform spectral peak width. Objective comparison of power spectra is based on the spectral parameter, which is a numerical index of power distribution. Application of the method to PRVEP waveforms of normal subjects and to a population of AlzheimerÂ´s disease patients showed the I/sub o/-sinh window to be the most effective method, yielding correct classification of all normal and abnormal subjects. The Gaussian window also performed well, with only two misclassifications. Use of the rectangular window resulted in seven misclassifications. The tapered-cosine window was very limited in its applicability, and was about equal in performance to the rectangular window.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

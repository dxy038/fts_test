The research on comprehensive benefits evaluation of smart distribution grid self-healing, mainly analyzed the effects from technology, economic, society and practicality. By this method, it could express the benefits of this program totally. For example, to power users, this project could improve the power quality. To society, it may increase the whole social welfare. To Adjacent power grid, it strengthens the reality of entire power grid, etc. All of them show the comprehensive benefits of power grid self-healing project. Therefore, firstly, based on the quasi-public goods and monopoly features of this project, it built the externality matrix by welfare economic and externality theories. From this matrix, it showed the influences of social economic and other objects under this program. Then, considering the SMART measure and principle of &#8220;practical, objective, typical and comprehensive&#8221;, it proposed series indexes by LCAM method, created comprehensive evaluation system by triangle fuzzy function. This system related to the aspects of technology, economic, society and practicality, it included over 20 quantity and quality indexes from the series conditions, such as safe, reality, economical, low-cost, social environment and target achievement. The method was examined by an example. According to this system, it could promote foundation for objective judgment of power grid self-healing project.

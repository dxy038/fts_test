The objective of the present study was to investigate absorption of copper from wastewater using the synthesized magnetite (Fe3O4) bentonite nanoadsorbent. Synthesized magnetite-bentonite nanoparticles (20â€’40 nm) were produced using the coprecipitation method and subsequently subjected to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) for analysis and evaluation. The nanoparticles were finally used as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment. Experiments were also designed using the Design of Experiment (DOE) software. Absorbent quantity, contact time, Cu+2 concentration , and pH were the most important factors selected for investigation. In a second step, the CCD design model was used to identify the optimum conditions for achieving the best metal ion absorption (removal) efficiency. It was found that 89% of Copper metal ions were absorbed under optimum conditions. Finally, experiments were performed on the inorganic effluent (from the Sarcheshme Copper Mines) under the optimum conditions. Results revealed a sorption content of 30% for Cu2+..

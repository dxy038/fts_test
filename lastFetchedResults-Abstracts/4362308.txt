A realistic 3D anatomical model of human atria has been designed to study and better understand electrical propagation mechanisms. Besides normal sinus beat, pathological phenomena such as atrial flutter and fibrillation have been simulated. Having initiated atrial arrhythmias, the authorsÂ´ main objective is to test different defibrillation techniques by means of electrical shock application. Varying intensity and duration of electrical shocks, as well as the area of excited tissue, the authors were able to reproduce a curve of defibrillation success versus shock strength comparable to the ones obtained in human atria

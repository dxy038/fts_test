New advanced transmission protocols are required to fulfill the cost-efficiency objective of next generation mobile communications systems. This paper presents the study and performance evaluation of a two-relay assisted cooperative transmission protocol which could make a good candidate technique to improve the capacity and the quality of service of future cellular networks. Simulation results obtained in a realistic radio environment confirm the superior efficiency of this protocol over both its non-cooperative counterpart and conventional direct transmission, provided that the relaysÂ´ positions are adequately chosen and that an interference cancellation mechanism is implemented in one of the two relays.

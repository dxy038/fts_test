Software engineering (SE) and human-computer interaction (HCI) are often regarded as two separate entities while the fact is the two share many similarities and should affect each other to produce a better product or software. In this paper, we compare two component frameworks that integrate both HCI and SE together. Our aim is to understand how each framework considers usability in the software development, and, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of both frameworks. The two component frameworks are IKnowU and UBAF. Comparison of these two frameworks can be useful for researchers as we can the four important criteria - model, architecture, usability work and process, that make of a framework which has usability as its paramount objective.

Summary
othionein (MT) is important for heavy metals and free radical protection in the kidney. MT is responsive to zinc and primarily localized within the renal cortex. However, site-specific renal responses to dietary zinc repletion are understudied. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of dietary zinc deficiency and repletion on renal MT concentration and immunolocalization in rats. Weanling male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either a zinc-deficient, zinc control, or pair-fed to zinc-deficient group. Half of the zinc-deficient and pair-fed rats were repleted with the control diet ad libitum for an additional 24 h. Renal tissue samples were assessed for total zinc, MT concentrations and MT immunostaining. Dietary zinc deficiency reduced renal zinc and MT concentrations, and attenuated intensity and localization of MT. Dietary zinc repletion for 24 h restored renal zinc and MT concentrations, the latter primarily in the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex. Concentrations of renal MT, but not zinc, were elevated by diet restriction and MT (Î¼g/mg protein) and partially normalized by 24 h diet repletion. In conclusion, renal MT modification due to zinc deficiency or diet restriction can be rapidly normalized in a site-specific manner with normal dietary zinc intake. The results support a role for MT in kidney homeostasis, in particular at the level of the proximal tubules in the cortex. The speed of MT repletion may have clinical implications for dietary zinc in the treatment of acute and chronic renal pathology due to toxins and free radicals.

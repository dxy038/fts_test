We consider a single-machine scheduling problem with equal-sized jobs. The objective is to minimize the maximum weighted earlinessâ€“tardiness and due-date costs. We present an algorithm to solve this problem. Our algorithm makes use of bottleneck jobs and priority queues, and has a computational complexity of O(n4logn). This complexity is a significant improvement of the existing algorithm in the literature.

The objective of the study is to apply linear matrix inequality (LMI) method for helping the analysis of power system transient stability. LMI method is used for parameter determination of Lure type Lyapunov function. Two types of Lure function are taken into consideration. In this paper, a method for computation of critical value of the function is also studied. This method can be implemented using LMI package. In this study, in order to derive the method, a simple multi machine model which can include network transfer conductances, uniform or nonuniform damping is considered. It can be verified by a simulation that the proposed method can improve the conservativeness of energy function and conventional Lure type Lyapunov function

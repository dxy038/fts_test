The main objective of present work was to observe the performance of 3D C/C–SiC composites with the exposure of oxy-acetylene gas flame in open atmosphere. Duration of exposure time was increased to measure the weight loss, elastic modulus, microhardness and thermal degradation. Also, XRD pattern was obtained to compare the behaviour of oxidized and unoxidized C/C–SiC composites. The amount of heat transferred to the base material depends upon the torch distance from the materials. The results clearly indicate that the excess amount of carbon was oxidized with the oxygen to form carbon mono oxide. The matrix materials undergo pyrolysis reactions within short periods, which generate volatiles and leave behind a porous skeleton of carbon fibres. The thermal properties (microvolt) microhardness, tensile stress and elastic modulus of C/C–SiC composite was reduced abruptly with increase of exposure time. XRD pattern also shows that the number of peaks and height of signals reduced with the increase of exposure time, which clearly indicates that the morphological changes were induced within the short period and losses carbon and silicon particles.

Biomedical research involving human beings is subject to codes of ethical conduct that mandate review, approval, and monitoring of clinical trials by research ethics committees (RECs). The role of RECs in public dissemination of results of research is not addressed explicitly in international codes or national regulations governing human research. I contend that RECs should have a prominent role in ensuring that trial results are publicly disseminated. I also propose specific responsibilities and actions that should be assumed and implemented by RECs to promote this objective.

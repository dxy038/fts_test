On basis of HLA distributed simulation extension with web services and data collection objective analysis, a method of distributed simulation temporal data collection based on web services is proposed and corresponding architecture is designed. In combination with simulation temporal database model of single attribute, rapid collecting and real-time query of HLA distributed simulation temporal data is realized under service oriented architecture. The prototype and corresponding tests indicate that application of simulation temporal database model of single attribute can take high efficiency of collection and query; the key factors which affect overall performance of data collection are network transmission delay of bottom runtime infrastructure and parsing efficiency of SOAP engine.

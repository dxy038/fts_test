The objective of this study was to investigate the protein, amyloid A3 (AA3), in equine colostrum and early milk. We hypothesized that AA3 was consistently present in equine colostrum and early milk, that no correlation existed between serum and colostrum concentrations of this protein in individual mares at parturition and that colostrum/milk concentrations of this mammary protein may be affected by age, breed, length of gestation and/or induction of parturition.

-eight peripartum mares and seven non-pregnant, non-lactating mares were included in the study. Mean serum concentrations of this protein in the pregnant and non-pregnant mares were consistent with previous reports. Amyloid A3 was found in all colostrum and early milk samples at consistently higher concentrations than in peripartum maternal serum. There was no correlation between serum AA and colostrum AA3 concentrations at parturition. Age and breed effects were not significant. Increased gestation length and induction of parturition were associated with decreased colostrum and milk AA3 concentrations. We conclude that AA3 is consistently present in equine colostrum and early milk. The production of this protein in the mammary gland is likely to be under different stimulus to the production of serum AA, and may have protective effects in the neonatal intestine.

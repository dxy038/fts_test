Microgrids are the platforms to integrate DERs into distribution systems. The optimal management of such systems has gained importance in the era of competitive power market. This paper mainly concentrates on functional and logical modelling of various components and strategies of microgrids, thereby proposes an objective function to get economic sizing and scheduling of DERs in a microgrid. A case study has been conducted in order to support and strengthen the proposed method.

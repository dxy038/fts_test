Instantaneous fuelling and plasma exhaust flow rates for the reduced technical objective/reduced cost version of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (RTO/RC-ITER) are similar to those described in the Final Design Report (FDR) of ITER, despite the reduction in fusion power by a factor of about two. However, the reduced pulse length and the lower fraction of campaign time spent in burn mode, together with the lower integrated operating lifetime proposed, will generate cost savings in several systems of the fuel cycle. As the quantity of tritium handled per pulse is now smaller, this could be buffered, allowing systems in the tritium plant still to operate in steady state mode as in the FDR design, thereby increasing the potential for downsizing of system capacities. The lower operating time fraction will increase performance margins for some systems, for example, the Torus Exhaust Gas Processing System (TEGPS) which was designed to meet a specified daily release rate for the FDR design conditions which were more onerous than RTO/RC-ITER. As no break through of tritium into cooling water is now expected, the duties of the Water and Atmosphere Detritiation Systems are considerably reduced, and design concepts which are simpler, cheaper and more amenable to modular implementation can be adopted.

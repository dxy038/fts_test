A continuous-time mean–variance model for individual investors with stochastic liability in a Markovian regime switching financial market, is investigated as a generalization of the model of Zhou and Yin [Zhou, X.Y., Yin, G., 2003. Markowitz’s mean–variance portfolio selection with regime switching: A continuous-time model, SIAM J. Control Optim. 42 (4), 1466–1482]. We assume that the risky stock’s price is governed by a Markovian regime-switching geometric Brownian motion, and the liability follows a Markovian regime-switching Brownian motion with drift, respectively. The evolution of appreciation rates, volatility rates and the interest rates are modulated by the Markov chain, and the Markov switching diffusion is assumed to be independent of the underlying Brownian motion. The correlation between the risky asset and the liability is considered. The objective is to minimize the risk (measured by variance) of the terminal wealth subject to a given expected terminal wealth level. Using the Lagrange multiplier technique and the linear-quadratic control technique, we get the expressions of the optimal portfolio and the mean–variance efficient frontier in closed forms. Further, the results of our special case without liability is consistent with those results of Zhou and Yin [Zhou, X.Y., Yin, G., 2003. Markowitz’s mean–variance portfolio selection with regime switching: A continuous-time model, SIAM J. Control Optim. 42 (4), 1466–1482].

Urge incontinence (UI) is the most common clinical types of urinary incontinence in elderly women. In neurolohically normal patients, detrusor instability (DI) is a common cause of UL Treatment of this condition is primarily pharmacologic(Anticholinergics, Calcium antagonists), with surgical options being reserved for selected patients. In an experimental double- blined placebo- controlled study the symptoms, micturation variables and cystometry results were compared before and after of treatment. Twelve of 30 (40%) in drug group(D) considered themselves improved and 60% unchanged. Of the 30 women in the placebo group(P) only 16.7% considered themselves improved, a statistically significant response in favor of the drug group(p=0.00I ). Micturation variables were statistically changed in favor of magnesium hydroxide. In drug group, number of nocturnal episodes changed form 1.8 to 1.3 times per daytime, frequency changed from 12.4 to 10.4 and daytime incontinence changed from 3.2 to 2.3 times. In placebo group these changes is not significant(P=0.096). Among drug and placebo groups changes in detrusor pressure rise and first sensation volume before and after treatment is statistically significant but other parameters showed no statisically significant differences in any category. In conclusion magnesium hydroxide was more effective than placebo but note that this improvement was mush more apparent on subjective assessment than on objective evaluation of cystometric and micturation data.

As part of the new Underwater Warfare Program, DRDC has started a new project on Task Group Mine Field Avoidance. While the long-term objective of the work is to demonstrate a Task Group Mine Field Avoidance capability using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Autonomous Air Vehicles (AAVs), the first project is focused on developing a realizable and cost effective concepts of operations for this system. This involves looking at a variety of sensor and vehicle configurations, and for predefined mission scenarios, determine the systems measures of effectiveness (MOEs).

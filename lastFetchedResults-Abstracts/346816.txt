Objective: To review findings from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials in normal subjects, in various neurological diseases and with pharmacologic manipulation.
Methods: MEDLINE was searched to identify pertinent articles and articles referenced therein were also reviewed.
Results: TMS is a safe and non-invasive technique which has been used widely in the study of corticospinal and corticocortical connectivity as well as in the assessment of basal ganglia disorders, diffuse diseases, and neuropharmacology.
Conclusions: TMS motor measures have utility in examination of brain structure and function within and beyond the corticospinal tract. These measures have both research and clinical applications.

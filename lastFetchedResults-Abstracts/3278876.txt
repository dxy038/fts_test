For future innovative RFID and radar applications like precisely tracking tools or objects in large environments, miniaturized modulated active backscatter transponders enhanced with bidirectional communication functionality are proposed as a versatile but yet low complexity and low power solution. In this paper, an active backscatter transponder at 5.8 GHz based on a switched injection-locked oscillator as sole RF component is extended by pulse width based received power level detection and enhanced backscatter modulation techniques in order to provide a complete AM transceiver with minimal additional and overall hardware effort. This concept delivers an attractive combination of a high efficiency super-regenerative communication circuit and a powerful regenerative sampling radar transponder in the same RF circuit consisting of a single oscillator. Its implementation (24 &#215; 17 mm) is verified experimentally and shows a high receiver sensitivity that enables communication over the full radar operating range.

It is intended to provide low cost tracking and navigation services in Jamaica. These services will be possible using the University of the West Indies Cellular Based Error Correction System (UWI-CBECS) (Scarlett et al., 2003). The UWI-CBECS system incorporates the Global Positioning System (GPS) (El-Rabbany, 2002 and Kaplan, 1995), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which is able to provide position information anywhere on earth. The GPS system by itself cannot provide the accuracy needed, due to uncontrollable factors. The UWI-CBECS system will have means to significantly reduce or eliminate the errors introduced by these factors, thus significantly increasing the accuracy of the system. The UWI-CBECS system will require a reliable low cost bidirectional communication network in order to provide the services at low cost. Bidirectional capability will help in significantly reducing the cost to users as it will allow error correction to be done at a centralized location and thus eliminating the need for expensive receivers. This work will introduce a multi-node communication network that is built incorporating an existing cellular phone network. A network like this would eliminate the cost of setting up expensive broadcast sites and reduce maintenance and operational cost significantly. In addition, the network will also allow bidirectional communication which is required by the UWI-CBES system. Bidirectional communication is very valuable; it makes additional features, such as, remote control, possible. Although a cellular network offers such great advantages there may be a possible disadvantage when it comes to reliability. The cellular system is used by many cellular subscribers and at times when the traffic is high on the network the system is unable to handle a large number of subscribers, thus a number of subscribers will be denied access to the system.

This paper presents an optimal path planning for planar hyper redundant robot manipulators in presence of circular obstacles with a new analytical collision avoidance approach. To generate the robot's trajectory, a dual genetic algorithm for rapid achievement to the optimal solutions in complex space is offered. A polynomial based on cubic spline interpolation is applied to approximate trajectories in joint , space. The GA determines the parameters, which are the interior points to be interpolated to formulate the polynomial representing the trajectory, it is to minimize the fitness of the desired objective function. The effectiveness and capability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation studies.

Living Crassostrea gigas oysters of different ages and sizes were collected in three estuaries of Cantabria (Bay of Biscay, Spain): San Vicente de la Barquera Estuary, Santander Bay, and Marismas de Santoña Estuary. The main objective was to determine different shell responses to variable environmental parameters. A shell morphological study, based on three biometric indices, indicates that oysters of Santander Bay have two significant shell anomalies: abnormal thickening of the right valve and loss of vital cavity volume. These shell abnormalities are related with the presence in these waters of the chemical tributyltin. In the other two estuaries, the oysters show no detectable anomalies. Four shell microstructures have been distinguished: Regular Simple Prismatic, Regular Foliated, cone-Complex Cross Foliated, and Chalk. In Santander Bay oysters, the Chalk forms a “root-type” framework, whereas in the other two estuaries it forms a more compact microstructure. It is proposed that exposure to tributyltin has produced this modification. High-spatial-resolution geochemical transects have been carried out on the Regular Foliated microstructure in the umbo region in order to evaluate the distribution of Mg, Sr, and Na. The elements analysed exhibit clear cyclic variations in San Vicente de la Barquera Estuary and Marismas de Santoña Estuary oysters, related with seasonal periods, and characterised by broad maxima during months in which the waters are warmer and have higher salinity. These patterns are buffered in Santander Bay oysters. Our results demonstrate that biometric, microstructural, and high-resolution trace element studies in oyster shells can provide information about contaminants and seasonal variations in the estuarine environment.

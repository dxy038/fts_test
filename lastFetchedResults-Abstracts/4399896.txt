Aiming at solving the subjectivity and uncertainty of service quality elements classification in Kano model and combining with fuzzy theory which is effective to cope with uncertainty and ambiguity, a Kano model based on fuzzy theory is proposed. This study will apply an approach of fuzzy questionnaires to modify Kano questionnaires which considered as subjective. Furthermore, this study will also develop a mathematical calculation performance according to the quality classification of fuzzy Kano model. ItÂ´s more objective than traditional Kano model to realize the service quality elements classification. With this method, the accurate mentality can be fully reasonable reflected in unknown circumstances. Finally, an empirical study in Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd, the largest manufacturing industry in China, to testify its feasibility and validity.

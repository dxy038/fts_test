The objective of this research is to develop a small-size large-aperture antenna for microwave power transmission. Directivity of synthesized spherical wave is confirmed by calculating the power density. Each order of spherical wave corresponds with multi-pole radiation, which has spatial angular frequency. Multi-pole is interpreted as a converged radiation component. In this paper, we have proposed spherical dielectric resonator as an antenna element replaced with multi-pole. Radiation fields made from spherical dielectric resonator correspond with spherical waves, and they are orthogonal to each other. As an example, we have designed a multilayered spherical dielectric resonator which can make spherical waves of order &#8467; =1 and 2. It is composed with combination of dielectrics with permittivity of 40 and 140. The cross section of designed antenna is 21% smaller than the size of effective aperture.

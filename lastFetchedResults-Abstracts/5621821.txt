The paper concerns energy management in low voltage grid-connected microgrid integrating renewable and controllable energy sources, loads and storage systems. The central control system is presented which optimize the microgrid operation by minimizing the costs of energy in the time horizon. The system determines set-points for controllable sources and storage units. In formulating the objective function constraints regarding the network capacity are taken into account, i.e. voltage limits in the network nodes and load carrying capacity limits of lines and the supplying transformer. The management system enables the integration of energy sources into existing networks without re-designing the network itself and microgrid operation at minimum costs.

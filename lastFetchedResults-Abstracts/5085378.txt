As an alternative to centralized autonomous photovoltaic systems, this paper proposes a modular configuration that utilizes a distributed input energy processing, maximum power point tracking and a bidirectional converter to control the battery bank power flow. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system presented an increase of 16% on the generated energy at the DC bus, for the solar irradiation levels analyzed, in which one or more photovoltaic panels are shaded, damaged or aged.

Our objective is to study the link between
hotel registration and suicide. Clark County,
which contains Las Vegas, drew our interest because
of its extremely large number of hotel rooms. Case
files of suicide from the Clark County Coroner were
reviewed for years 2003â€“2005. The suicide rate of local
residents registering in local hotels was 271/100,000.
This is greater than the suicide rate in the general
population of Clark County, 16.6/100,000, P < 0.0001,
Poisson distribution. Hotel guests from outside Clark
County had a reduced rate of suicide, 4.6/100,000,
P < 0.0001. Residents of Clark County registering in
local hotels have an increased suicide risk that is
statistically significant. Possible explanations for the
results are provided.

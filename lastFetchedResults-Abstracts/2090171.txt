Background: Pentoxifylline (PX) is a methyl xanthine derivative that influences the sperm motion characteristics and L-carnitine (L-C) is an amino acid that is naturally produced in the body. In general, separate administration of PX and L-C has been reported to be effective on preserving sperm motility in vitro, and also when is consumed orally by the Idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (IOAT) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate any possible effect of a combination of L-C and PX on sperm characteristics and improving the type of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in a group of patients with unexplained oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.
Materials and Methods: Two hundred twelve infertile men with IOAT in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial were allocated for this study. They randomized to four groups. Group I received PX/ and L-C (each one, twice daily), group II, PX and placebo, group III, L-C with the placebo, and group IV, received placebo tablets. Finally, we compared pre and post intervention sperm parameters and ART procedures between groups.
Results: While the use of PX and L-C are only improved sperm motility, but their combined uses improved all sperm parameters, especially the sperm count. Also the combination of PX and L-C was effective on improving the ART procedures (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the combination use of PX and L-C is useful in improving of sperm parameters in IOAT patients and also, improve ART procedures in this group of patients

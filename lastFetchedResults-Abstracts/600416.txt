Objective: Isolated distal radioulnar instability may remain unrecognized during the acute peri¬od of trauma as it is difficult to diagnose, and does not become obvious until later when it has become chronic. We present early results in patients who underwent stabilization with extraar- ticular ligament reconstruction (Fulkerson-Watson reconstruction). Methods: Four women and 1 man underwent surgery for chronic isolated distal radioulnar joint instability demonstrated in X-rays and magnetic resonance images. Arthroscopy revealed avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex from the point of insertion in 3 patients, and peripheral tears in 2 patients. The peripheral tears were debrided arthroscopically. All patients had an ade¬quate sigmoid notch and therefore underwent ligament reconstruction using the Fulkerson-Watson method. Postoperative evaluations were done with MRI. Results: Mean follow-up was 15.5 months (range 6-26 months). Stability was achieved in all patients. The mean Quick-DASH symptom score decreased from 18.63 (15.90-22.72) to 6.81 (2.27-9.09) after surgery. A mean visual analogue score to assess pain decreased from 7.32 (6.30-8.40) to 1.88 (1.50-2.30) after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative measurements were 26° (passive 44°) and 47° (passive 65°) for active supination, 18° (passive 45°) and 49° (passive 68°) for active pronation, 20° (passive 43°) and 42° (passive 60°) for active wrist flex¬ion, and 38° (passive 52°) and 45° (passive 59°) for active wrist extension. Conclusion: Surgical revision of distal radioulnar joint instability using Fulkerson-Watson reconstruction is easier than intraarticular techniques and satisfactorily re-establishes stability, provided that the sigmoid notch is adequate.

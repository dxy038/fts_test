Fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) retrieved by NDVI-isoline based linear mixture model (LMM) suffers from systematic biases due to difference in spatial resolution among sensors, known as ´scaling effect´. Scaling effect of the FVC has been investigated analytically in a previous work under the two-endmember assumption. It implies that the scaling effect (systematic bias) will be minimized by using a certain combinations of endmember spectra. The objective of this study is to examine influence of endmember spectra on the scaling effect of FVC with LANDSAT7/ETM+ data. The results demonstrated that there exists endmember spectrum of vegetation and non-vegetation which mitigate the scaling effect. Findings in this study should contribute to cross-sensor calibra tion of FVC estimation necessary to improve consistency and accuracy in monitoring of vegetation cover.

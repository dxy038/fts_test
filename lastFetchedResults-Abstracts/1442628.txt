The objective of this study was to investigate differences in adipose tissue fatty acid composition among stress genotypes as well as to determine relationships of those fatty acids with performance, carcass and meat quality traits. Haplotypic analysis of parents and offspring was employed to assign 48 pigs to three stress genotypes of swine. Individual fatty acid profiles were determined on subcutaneous backfat. Stress genotype had a significant effect on the proportions of C14:0 (P&lt;0.05), C16:0 (P&lt;0.10), C16:1 (P&lt;0.05) and C18:0 (P&lt;0.05) fatty acids. After adjusting for stress and gender, there was a negative correlation between backfat thickness and essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic) (P&lt;0.001). In contrast, the correlation of loin muscle area with C18:2 (P&lt;0.01) and C18:3 (P&lt;0.001) was positive. The degree of fat firmness was negatively correlated to the proportion of total unsaturated fatty acids (P&lt;0.01). No significant correlations were observed between fatty acid contents and lean meat quality traits.

The objective of this research is to propose a new and practical LQG control method for the vehicle active suspension. The novelty lies in optimizing the LQG controller without road input signal for the active suspension to improve practicability of LQG control method. Taking a quarter-vehicle model as an example, the control parameters of LQG controller without road input signal for the active suspension are optimized based on genetic algorithm (GA) with the suspension quadratic performance index taken as the fitness function. Comparative simulations show the optimized LQG controller proposed can achieve a better comprehensive performance and is more practical than the normal LQG one for the active suspension.

The paper presents an original device of collocated sensors designed for the implementation of array processing considering applications within the UHF band. The main objective is to reduce the volume required by a classical multi antennas solution based on space diversity. The proposed solution associates a group of collocated monopoles with different orientations ; it induces a significant reduction of the inter channel correlation under the assumption of a multi path propagation with non stationary polarizations. A low complexity array processing is then tested and improves the performances of the reception if compared to a single channel solution.

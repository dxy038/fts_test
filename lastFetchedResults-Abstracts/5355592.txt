In this work we present a heterogeneous architecture consisting of a network of sensors and cellular networks. We started from cellular networks in which we succeeded a successful integration of a variety of low power sensors. Data collection is a major objective of sensor networks and various methods for the efficiency of the collection have been proposed. We have also developed framework for processing the data captured in this network and the network management.

This paper illustrates the importance of the assessment of warning of the safety and stability of regional grid. Through the specific analysis of the major factors influencing the safety and stability of grid, the comprehensive and sound assessment indicator system of warning is established. By the use of expertsÂ´ weight method and variation coefficient method, the subjective weight and objective weight of warning indicator are determined respectively. By the further use of linear comprehensive scoring method, the assessment score of warning is calculated. Then the warning and assessment model for the safety and stability of regional grid based on combined weight is formed. The case studies of five regional grid corporations prove that the indicator system and assessment model of warning have good applicability and can provide theoretical guide to practical work to a certain extent.

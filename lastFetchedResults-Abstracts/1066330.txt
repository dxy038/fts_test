In arid and semi-arid areas, significant share of water might be lost due to wind and evaporation. Thus, proper understanding of influential factors affecting on evaporation and drift losses in sprinkler irrigation is important for developing water conservation strategies. The objective of this paper includes proposition of predictive equations by characterizing wind and evaporation losses under different weather conditions and operating pressures (such as 45 and 50 m) for semi-portable hand-move sprinkler system in south western region of Iran (Khouzestan province). The standard ISO 7749/2 has been taken into account to determine evaporation and drift losses. A field test was conducted under single sprinkler. The result shows that sprinkler pressure (45 and 50 m) did not influence evaporation and drift losses. Also, the results showed that evaporation and drift losses were more than 20.8 percent when wind speed exceeded 15 k/hr. Therefore sprinkler irrigation is not recommended in this condition.

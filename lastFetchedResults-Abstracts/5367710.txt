In allusion to the problem of flood disaster classification, this paper proposes a modified differential evolution algorithm for dealing with a fuzzy clustering iterative model. By using variable index weight vector and penalty function, the objective function can be solved more perfectly. The new algorithm has been examined and tested on a practical flood disaster. The results show that the obtained fuzzy clustering matrix is much close to clustering center and the flood disaster classification is more clear in comparison with traditional fuzzy clustering algorithm.

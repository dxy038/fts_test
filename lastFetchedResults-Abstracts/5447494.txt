In this paper, we present a novel objective video quality metric that captures the trade-off between the picture quality and the temporal resolution of a compressed video. The proposed metric is based on PSNR, frame rate as well as spatial and temporal activity measures that are obtained from the video. The content-independency of the metric makes it useful for the dynamic optimization of wireless video transmission. With the proposed metric, it is possible to adjust the trade-off between spatial and temporal qualities such that the user satisfaction is maximized. Our metric is very accurate, as verified by statistical analysis with data from subjective tests. We integrate the metric into a real-time wireless video transmission system and show in our experiments that the system, with our metricÂ´s ability to predict perceptual quality, can deliver significantly improved perceptual quality for arbitrary videos over a wide range of channel conditions.

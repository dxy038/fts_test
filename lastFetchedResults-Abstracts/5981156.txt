In this paper we consider the problem of ultra wide band (UWB) electromagnetic wave scattering by a dielectric cylinder. Our main objective is to study the possibility of using UWB radar for the detection of objects in noise and clutter. UWB radars utilise a very wide bandwidth to ensure that the target scatters energy at very long, as well as at very short wavelengths. This provides information about the shape and material structure of the object which can be utilised for detection and classification. We examine the details of the various phenomenological wave contributions to this solution, with a view to using very short pulse radar to isolate the mechanisms in time, amplitude and polarization. We consider only the case of backscatter. The use of FDTD to generate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is also discussed

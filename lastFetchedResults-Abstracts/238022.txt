Waste products such as biosolids and wood wastes have been frequently used in container production of plants. The use of biosolids in agriculture is a beneficial mean of recycling the by-products of waste-water treatment. However, care must be taken to avoid environmental or human health problems via run-off and leaching.
The objective of this work is to compare the retention capacity of cadmium, lead, zinc and nitrate between pine bark (PB) and coconut fibre (F) when mixed with increasing amounts of composted sewage sludge (CSS) (0%, 15% and 30% (v/v)). Substrates were packed into leaching columns and irrigated with deionised water every 2 days. Leachates were collected during 1 month, and nitrate, Zn, Cd, Pb, EC and pH were monitored along the experiment. PB columns leached lower amount of nitrate than the coconut fibre ones. The same trend was observed for Zn, Cd and Pb. It could be said, that in order to minimize the environmental risks of using sewage sludges our results indicate that it is preferred to mix the sludge with pine bark instead than with coconut husk.

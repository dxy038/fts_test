Instability of models used in long term planning of large scale industrial projects is demonstrated. The uncertainty band around the balance set is introduced to account for unpredictable variations of important parameters or utilities created by instability in multi-objective optimization of large scale projects. Then, instability of dynamic models of growth is considered including population dynamics with saturation and long term optimal planning in social and economic spheres. A method of successive refinement in a synthetic multi-model system is proposed, and application of the sequence of refined models is illustrated on a real-life example of construction of a dam with yearly refinements of the initial model, based on past history of project realization.

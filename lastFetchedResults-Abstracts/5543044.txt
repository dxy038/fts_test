The aim of this paper is to study a simulation optimization approach for the control of logistics flows. For this purpose, we evaluated the feasibility of integrating the Taguchi method and the response surface methodology (RSM). An academic case study which inspired from the literature is provided; the objective is to determine the optimal lot size for each manufactured product in the SC. The comparative results with others metamodels methods indicate that this study presents a good performance of the Taguchi method combining with the RSM.

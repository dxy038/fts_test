This paper gives a demonstration of the integration of monostatic repeat-pass and bistatic single-pass high resolution InSAR stacks for complex urban area monitoring and by-passing scattering scenarios, for instance, radar layover. The technique exploits DSs to estimate the topography and full deformation time series using an advanced high resolution SBAS algorithm. It first utilizes motion-free and atmosphere-free single-pass interferograms and then, utilizes small baseline repeat-pass interferograms (no external DEM is used). The objective of this paper is to present the fusion technique and a test case using high resolution spotlight mixed TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data of Las Vegas, US.

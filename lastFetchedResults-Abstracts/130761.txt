Objective: To study the clinical and histopathological clangs caused by an anionic detergent on the gill of gold fish. Animals: One hundred and fortcy Gold fish (with the length of 18 - 20 cm) divided into four groups.
Procedture: Fish in groups 1 to 3 received anionic detergent, 5 ppm, l0ppm and 15 ppm respectively. After 21 days, 7 fish were selected from each group randomly and gills were fixed in 10 percent buffered formalin.
Statistical analysis: Comparison of non - parametric data by scaling system based on the type and severity of the lesions.
Results: After exposing to the anionic detergent, all groups showed increased movement of the opcrcul un and increased mucus secretion. Fish of groups 2 and 3, showed emication, petechial heamorrhage on skin, fin rot, keratitis, dermal ulcers and iuappctitc. Histopathologic lesions included epithelial necrosis of lamela, chloride cell hyperplasia and infiltration of inflammatory cells which were more prominent in groups 2 and 3.
Clinical implications: From the results of this study it seems that the anionic detergent which used in this study can cause many pathologic changes in the gill of Gold fish especially with the concentration of 10 ppm and 15 ppm respectively. The gills are important organs for examination means. They are sensetivc to a number of initants, parasites and chemical agents present in the water. J. Face Vet. Med. Univ.

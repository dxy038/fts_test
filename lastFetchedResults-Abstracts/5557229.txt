The objective of this project was to design a system to use magnitude normalization as a method of adaptive equalization. The system is targeted at equalizing a room response. The method used is to decompose the signal into its frequency components (N frequency bands) and normalize each band to obtain a flat frequency response of the entire signal path. This path consists of the amplifier, the speaker box and the room. This paper presents four methods of magnitude normalization. Normalizer -cell2.2- was selected as the best normalizing element for this project. This cell is implemented digitally on a microcontroller. The stability of the system is discussed in the paper which shows a trade off between the rate of convergence and the deviation from the optimal solution achievable by the hardware. Finally, other implementations of the system are discussed

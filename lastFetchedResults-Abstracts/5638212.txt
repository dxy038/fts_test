In recent years, singular value decomposition has become a popular tool for image watermarking. In this paper, we propose a new blind watermarking scheme by quantizing the singular values of wavelet component. To optimize the system performance, we treat the image watermarking as a multi-objective optimization problem based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Based on this new perspective, the inherent conflict existing in image fidelity and watermark robustness for image watermarking can be objectively handled. The experimental study shows that our method indeed provide superior performance.

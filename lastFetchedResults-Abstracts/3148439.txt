In this paper we simulated 24 GHz short range, wide band automotive radar. The simulation was done using matlab. The main objective of this work is to reduce traffic accidents and potential danger that faces the driver and the vehicle as a result of the sudden collision. The model consist of six sensors distributed in different sides of the car, these devices provide exact measurement of distance and relative speed of objects in front, beside or behind. Each sensor sends signals to predict, if there is any body around the car to alarm the driver about it. These signals cover distance reach to 30 m. However, if the distance between car &amp; object was less than 2 m the car produce sound like alarm to alert the driver of danger near and the driver can present to take the appropriate decision to avoid collision.

This paper presents the development of a simplified dynamic model for air-conditioning systems taken the energy, mass, and momentum balances between room air and surroundings into account. The newly developed dynamic simulation model is referred to as "Kamimura-Kurosu" (simply "KK") model in association with developer\Â´s name. In this paper, the objective is to illustrate the application of the "KK model" to the actual air-conditioning control system. To demonstrate the control performance for various control strategies in the air-conditioning control, the following validation simulations are performed: reset control of supply air temperature, and speed control of fan-inverter. The inherent advantages of the "KK" model over improved control strategies for air-conditioning systems are highlighted. This work leads to a better understanding of the air-conditioning control systems which provide more stable and comfortable building environment in a variety of applications

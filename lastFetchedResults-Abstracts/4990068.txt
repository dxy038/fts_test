The design of large interconnected power systems to ensure stable operation under wide variety of disturbances is a complicated problem. In recent years, technologically developments in Flexible AC Transmission Systems or FACTS devices provided better performance in enhancing power system stability. This paper has provided a general description of Single machine infinite bus system (SMIB) small signal stability in case of using Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). In this study, the small signal stability of the system is converted to a multi-objective optimization problem which leads to design a controller of UPFC in order to make higher damping torque. The Shuffled frog leaping algorithm or SFLA is used as an optimization tool to find the optimum parameters of the controller. Furthermore, the designed controller is compared with similar ones using PSO and QPSO optimization approaches and in addition with a PSS controller to show the remarkable robustness and higher performance of the method.

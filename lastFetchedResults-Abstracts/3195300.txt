One of the most important factors that determine the performance of hybrid vehicles is the energy management and power distribution between the different energy sources. This paper reports on a project whose objective is to examine the potential and compare the performance of intelligent control strategies as applied to a fuel cell/battery hybrid electric auto rickshaw. A previous study found that a novel fuel cell load following strategy (FCLS) showed better results when compared to an equivalent consumption minimization strategy. In this paper, a fuzzy control strategy (FCS) is benchmarked against FCLS using a realistic drive cycle. It was found that after careful tuning, FCLS and FCS were equivalent in terms of achievable fuel economy.

Seafood is considered by nutritionists to be a high source of omega 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) which are involved in prevention of cardiovascular diseases, but little data is available concerning fatty acids and especially n-3 LC-PUFAs composition of seafood. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the n-3 LC-PUFAs composition of representative fish and seafood consumed in France. A total of 159 fish, mollusk and crustacean samples were collected in four French coastal areas taking into consideration methods of preservation (fresh, frozen, canned…) and supply habits (fishing or collecting, fish shop, supermarket…) of the high consumers, according to a total diet study approach sampling. Food samples were analyzed for total lipids and fatty acids, especially n-3 LC-PUFAs. Eel, salmon, swordfish and halibut are the richest fish in total lipids and n-3 LC-PUFAs (EPA, DPA, DHA), with respective average levels of 20.4, 13.5, 12.4 and 11.7 g lipids/100 g fresh weight (fw) of edible portion, and 1434, 3625, 3358, 2654 mg n-3 LC-PUFAs/100 g fw. These original results are consistent with the literature and will be useful in risk/benefit assessment of fish consumption recommendations in general and in French subgroups of population such as pregnant women or children.

Objective
The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility and the value of real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) in quantitative evaluation of the size of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) and to correlate with the surgical findings.
Methods

Thirty eight patients with ASD and/or VSD were examined with RT3DE. Three-dimensional image data-base was post-processed using 3D work-station. The results were compared with the results measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography and surgical findings.
Results

RT3DE produced novel views of congenital septal defects and improved quantification of the size of the defect. The sizes obtained from 3DE have better correlation with surgical findings than diameter measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography (r = 0.69 vs r = 0.92).
Conclusions

RT3DE offers additional special information in congenital heart disease without extending examining time, permits quantitative recording of septal defect dynamics, and enhances the understanding of complex cardiac anatomy and elucidation of the disease mechanism. It is a potentially valuable clinical tool for diagnosing and managing patients with congenital heart disease.

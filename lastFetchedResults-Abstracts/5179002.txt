The indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is examined from the prospect of an occupantpsilas acceptance in four aspects: thermal comfort, indoor air quality, noise level and illumination level. This paper proposed a fuzzy synthetic evaluation with changeable weights to approximate the overall IEQ acceptance of a certain indoor environment. Different evaluation factors have different influences in FSE, and it is more apparent when one factor becomes worse, modify the preformed objective weights made by experts in accordance with the subject weights made by occupants and the status of evaluation factors, the changeable synthetic weights were formed, thus the evaluation of IEQ can be get. The development of this integration method for assessing the environmental quality of indoor environments is described and an illustration of its application is presented, and the validity of proposed method is proved.

Objective: We sought to evaluate the capacity of a new thoracic electric bioimpedance system to estimate cardiac output in patients with preeclampsia. Study Design: We performed a prospective comparison of thoracic electric bioimpedance and echocardiographic M-mode volumetric estimates of cardiac output (in liters per minute) in preeclampsia. Subjects with preeclampsia who were chosen by means of strict criteria (either a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or both, and proteinuria ≥300 mg in 24 hours or ≥+1 on repeat dipstick measurement 6 hours apart) were asked to participate in an institutional review board–approved study. Thoracic electric bioimpedance and echocardiography were performed with the patients in the left lateral recumbent position. Thoracic electric bioimpedance estimates were recorded at bedside; investigators were blinded to 3 simultaneously obtained echocardiographic M-mode estimates of cardiac output. Means were entered as the estimate for each patient. To satisfy the assumption of independent samples, only 1 estimate from each technique was used for each patient. Data were analyzed by Bland-Altman comparison. Hemodynamic and demographic variables are presented as mean ± SD. Results: Fifteen patients were enrolled. Mean maternal age was 25.9 ± 4.8 years, and mean gestational age was 34.0 ± 3.5 weeks. Mean arterial pressure was 112 ± 14 mm Hg. There was good agreement of thoracic electric bioimpedance–derived and M-mode–derived cardiac output estimates. Conclusions: In patients with preeclampsia, thoracic electric bioimpedance estimates of cardiac output compare well with echocardiographic M-mode estimates. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:911-3.)

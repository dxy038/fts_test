Objective: Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite drug commonly prescribed for the
various cancers and autoimmune diseases. Despite its considerable therapeutic effects,
nephrotoxicity is the most important side-effect of treatment with MTX. Aquaporin1 (AQP1)
is a water channel proteins which is present in mammalian kidney. Raspberry fruit with
antioxidant properties is able to protect biological systems from the harmful effects of free
radicals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of raspberry extract on
expression of AQP1 and the MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 60 adult male Wistar rats were divided
into nine groups including control, sham, MTX treated group [single dose of 20 mg/kg
of body weight (BW) MTX at the third day], raspberry treated groups [intraperitoneal (I.P)
injection of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg of BW raspberry extract for ten consecutive days], MTX
and raspberry treated groups. At day 11, rats were sacrificed via chloroform inhalation and
kidney tissues were fixed in formalin solution for histological and immunohistochemistry
analysis. The serological assays for urea, creatinine, uric acid and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
levels were also performed.
Results: MTX elevated serum level of the urea, creatinine, uric acid, IL-6, renal tissue
damage and decreased the AQP1 expression level. Raspberry fruit extract improved the
kidney function and reduced side effects of MTX in treated rats. Expression of AQP1, in a
dose dependent manner was also ameliorated, as compared to control group.
Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that biological activity
of compounds presented in raspberry fruit extract especially anthocyanins may have
chemo-protective effect on kidney function and AQP1 expression in rats treated by MTX.

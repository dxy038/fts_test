Nowadays, a new paradigm is emerging: the challenging integration of Peer-to-Peer into mobile Ad hoc networks (MANETs). In this context, this paper proposes to combine two Chord extensions for MANETs. Its main objective is to reduce the lookup failures. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme has an improved performance in comparison with the two Chord extensions, the Backtracking Chord protocol and the Enhanced Mobile Chord.

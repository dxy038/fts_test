We consider the problem of scheduling n groups of jobs on a single machine where three types of decisions are combined: scheduling, batching and due-date assignment. Each group includes identical jobs and may be split into batches; jobs within each batch are processed jointly. A sequence independent machine set-up time is needed between each two consecutively scheduled batches of different groups. A due-date common to all jobs has to be assigned. A schedule specifies the size of each batch, i.e. the number of jobs it contains, and a processing order for the batches. The objective is to determine a value for the common due-date and a schedule so as to minimize the sum of the due date assignment penalty and the weighted number of tardy jobs. Several special cases of this problem are shown to be ordinary NP-hard. Some cases are solved in O(n log n) time. Two pseudopolynomial dynamic programming algorithms are presented for the general problem, as well as a fully polynomial approximation scheme.

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the operation of memory cells with a bidirectional engineered tunneling barrier: a triple layer Variot stack. Furthermore, these memory cells also have an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interpoly dielectric and achieve 10 years of data retention up to 120degC

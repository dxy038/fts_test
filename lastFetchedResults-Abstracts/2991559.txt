A new method for the synthesis of neural networks with BAM (bidirectional associative memory) features, based on the ART structure, is presented. Intended for pattern classification, it contains a new procedure for the correct usage of the relation matrix, and avoids the inherent defects of the BAM and its misclassifications with appropriate actions on the thresholds of the neurons of the ART layers. The results clearly indicate that this method leads to a good improvement in the performance that is achievable in a BAM, with a 0% error rate found in a test on the well-known NIST 19 character database

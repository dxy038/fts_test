Ubiquitous computing environment requirement needs information sharing of sensors based on sensor network technology, situation-aware and determination functions and other related technologies ranging to appropriate and effective action processing. The sensor field independent information access is most important issues in everywhere under the ubiquitous computing environment. We already proposed UbiMDR framework that is a supporting application-independent semantic interoperability for ubiquitous applications. However, the functions of the UbiMDR are limited only to identification and recognition of objects. The chief objective of our proposal is to let extending the UbiMDR supporting situation-aware access control about objects consistently and independently on various application fields (companies/ systems). This paper fist describes the current UbiMDR, and presents our proposed model for supporting situation-aware of UbiMDR. Also conceptual architectures of situation aware are shown.

The medical tracking of patients carried out from a distance by means of wireless technology, incorporating various sensors simultaneously connected to the body of an individual, can promote health in suitable time. This article proposes a simulator for the monitoring of human health. This prototype simulates the workings of a BSN (Body Sensor Network) functioning as a sensor (electrophysiological signal) that is to be monitored, which utilizes a strategy based on the concept of data fusion. This tool incorporates a policy of economizing energy which has as its main objective increasing the operating time of the system.

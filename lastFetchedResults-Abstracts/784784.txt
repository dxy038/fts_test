Objective: We aimed to investigate the appropriateness of the Mini Nutritional Assessment
(MNA) in predicting functional ability in older adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants
were recruited from the Kahrizak Charity Foundation (KCF). Measurements: Nutritional and ability status
were examined using the MNA and the Barthel Index (BI). Participants were divided according to MNA
(≤23.5 and > 23.5). Results: Two hundred and thirty-five ≥ 60-year-old subjects were studied. The MNA
and BI were positively correlated (r = 0.199; P = 0.001). The optimal cut-off point for BI with the highest
sensitivity and specificity derived from the ROC curve was approximately 91.5 for males and 83.5 for
females. The BI was significantly associated with MNA (odds ratio (OR): 1.89; 95% CI: 1.17-3.05, P =
0.009), mobility (OR: 6.39; 95% CI: 3.43-11.89, P < 0.001), consuming ≥ 2 servings of fruit and vegetables
(OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09-4.72, P = 0.02) and self-view of nutritional status (OR: 4.15; 95%CI: 1.26-13.63, P
= 0.01). The sensitivity (62.9% in males; 68.2% in females) and specificity (51.4% in males and 52.9% in
females) of these cut-off points justifies the appropriateness of the MNA for determining functional ability.
Conclusion: The MNA is potentially able to verify functional status among the elderly (as BI ≥ 91.5 with
those of < 91.5 in males and ≥ 83.5 with those of < 83.5 in females) of KCF. It is suggested that this
relationship should be further studied in a larger prospective population-based study.

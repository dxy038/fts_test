Objective (s): There is corroborating evidence to substantiate redox imbalance and oxidative stress in sepsis that finally leads to organ damage or even death. Gamma oryzanol (GO) is one of the major bioactive components in rice bran has been considered to function as an antioxidant. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antioxidant activity of gamma oryzanol in vitro and its efficacy in sepsis. Materials and Methods: To induce sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method was performed on the rats. A study group of forty male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: sham group; CLP group; 50 mg/kg GO- treated CLP group and 100 mg/kg GO- treated CLP group. GO was administered with an oral gavage 2 hr prior to inducing sepsis. Tissue and blood samples were collected 12 hr after CLP to prepare tissue sections for histopathological study and assay the oxidative stress biomarkers including: SOD (Superoxide Dismutase), TAC (total antioxidant capacity), MDA (Malondialdehyde), MPO (Myeloperoxidase) and PAI-1 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1). Data are given as mean Â± SD. The ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test was used to determine the differences between groups and P Results: TAC level increased in GO- treated CLP groups (P<0.05). Inflammation score of lung tissue and MPO activity were significantly lower in GO treated CLP group (P<0.05). Conclusion:It seems that GO has a protective effect on lung inflammation and improves the body redox capacity during sepsis.

The optimal control of a single machine processing a certain number of jobs and modeled as a discrete-event dynamic system is considered. The number of jobs and their sequence are fixed, whereas their timing and sizes represent the control variables of the system. The objective function to be optimized is a weighted sum of the quadratic earliness and tardiness of each job, and of the quadratic deviations of job lot sizes and actual machine service speeds from those specified by the production demand and by the regular machine speeds. An optimization problem with quadratic cost function and nonlinear constraints is stated and formalized as a multistage optimal control problem. Necessary conditions to be satisfied by an optimal control sequence are derived. A simpler model is also considered in which the machine speeds are fixed; in this case, the control problem is solved by a procedure making use of dynamic programming techniques. The optimal control laws at each stage are thus obtained.

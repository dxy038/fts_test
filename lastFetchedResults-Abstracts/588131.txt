Social science sources and literature have offered various views on the issue of growth and development of sociology in Iran. Some scholars believe sociology in Iran has required a desirable expansion due to lack of theory making and it has not grown in accordance to the present needs and challenges.
However, given the present circumstances and the conditions of human sciences and sociology in Iran, there are some others who believe sociology has had the sufficient expansion. Mentioning to the amount of scientific productions in this field they give a good credit to its existence. These scholars make a rosy picture for the future of sociology in Iran. Different factors could be considered in explaining this subject. Without involving in development or under development debates of sociology of Iran, this article aims to give an analytical model for further expansion of sociology in Iran. It has done by using interviews with a number of sociology scholars and by looking at different theoretical approaches associated with sociological growth in a particular society such as Iran. Through this model some hypotheses can be deducted which can be used in other objective and systematic studies. Theories of Emile Durkheim, Tomas Kuhn, Karl Manheim and Michael Mulkay, the outstanding theorists in area of theory and thought in knowledge and science sociology, have been used in this article. The paper has applied mainly analytical-documentary and qualitative method and structured interview.

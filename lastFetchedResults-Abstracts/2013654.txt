The objective of this article is to present a new
method for identifying the damage location in a multi-story
shear building by direct model updating method. In this
regard, structural perturbation matrices should be determined
that are directly defined as the discrepancy between
mass and stiffness matrices of undamaged and damaged
structures. As a result of expanding the dynamic orthogonality
conditions, mass and stiffness perturbation matrices
are formulated by the initial information of undamaged
structures as well as the structure’s modal parameters
before and after the occurrence of damages. These matrices
cannot easily detect the damage site. Therefore, a more
explicit determination of damage location is performed
dividing the amount of change in these matrices’ diagonals
by the physical properties of undamaged structure. This
modification facilitates the damage localization process
and yields precise and preferable results in comparison
with applying classical methods such as natural frequencies,
mode shapes and structural properties changes. Subsequently,
the applicability and effectiveness of the
proposed damage detection method are verified numerically
and experimentally. For numerical verification of the
proposed methods, a six-story shear building is utilized as a
discrete system. Then, the experimental verification of
proposed methods is conducted detecting the location of
damages in a simple laboratory frame. It can be deduced
that the proposed damage localization method can reliably
detect and also localize the structural damage.

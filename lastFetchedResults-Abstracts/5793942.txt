Increasing the efficiency and accuracy on dynamic optimization choosing of Web service composition is the key point of researching on service composition. In allusion to 1 the way that we use a shortest path based on a weighted tree to describe the Web service composition question, users can set the Qos attribute weight to translate their preference and satisfaction into certain constraints on service composition. We can build an optimal Web service composition path tree through a multi-objective optimization Web service choosing technique, and finally use a low cost shortest path algorithm to achieve better service composition.

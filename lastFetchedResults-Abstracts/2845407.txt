Remote voltage controls adjustment algorithm based on optimal voltage scheduling is proposed in the paper. Optimal voltage schedule is determined in the day-ahead or the hour-ahead planning phase as a result of the standard optimal power flow algorithm. Optimization objective is minimization of transmission losses with respect to the power system security constraints. Voltage controls include set points for generatorsÂ´ automatic voltage regulators, compensation devices reactive power production and tap positions of on-load tap changing transformers. Simulations have been performed for the Croatian transmission network in order to determine the most adequate voltage controls adjustment sequence based on the results of standard optimal power flow calculation. Three control variables sequence adjustment cases have been analyzed. Results are presented and elaborated.

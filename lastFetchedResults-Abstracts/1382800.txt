This paper deals with the relationships between objective and subjective results of an acoustic survey in the historical opera house of Bordeaux, called the Grand Theatre de Bordeaux. The comparison of the ordinary listeners' answers with the objective results shows that the auditive sensations are fitting with the measured criteria obtained in the opera configuration with the opened pit and sceneries on the stage. The aim of this study was to test in real conditions of performance a questionnaire designed for ordinary listeners. The obtained results allow us to accord a good reliability to the questionnaire.

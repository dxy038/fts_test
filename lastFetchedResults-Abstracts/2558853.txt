Abstract

Background: Today the usc of medicinal plants to improve the immune system function and against pathogenic bacteria has been considered.
Objective: In  this study, the effect of methanol extract of the aerial parts of Agrimonia eupatoria on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) ami 12 pathogenic bacteria were investigated.
Methods: The methanol extract of branches, stems, seeds and leaves of Agrinwnia eupatoria were prepared and the effect or different concentrations of 50, lOll, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 "g/ml of the extract on proliferation of PBMC was evaluated by MTT assay. Also the effect or concentrations of I, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 10 mglml or the extract was tested on 12 pathogenic bacteria by disc method and on nutrient agar media.
Results: The methanol extract of the branch, stem  and seed of Agrimonia  eupatoria showed the most stimulatory effects 011 immune system and induced  the proliferation  of PBMCs up to 8 times. tethanol extract of AJ?rimonia eupatoria showed antibacterial effects against gram­ posith-'e  bacteria  anf.! the most antibacterial effect was on Bacillus suhtilis at a concentration  of 4 mg/m1 and Stupltylocoecus aureus at t:oncentra tion of 7 mg/ml.
Conclusion: The Agrimonia eupatoria methanol extract showed stimulatory effects on the immune system and also antibacterial properties •gainst certain gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. These finding indicate that Agrinwnia eupawria can be considered to use ror immunodeficiency patients and moreover to control some bacterial infections.

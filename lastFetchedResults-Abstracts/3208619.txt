Control problems with multiple, competing performance requirements are often encountered in the design of vehicle systems. These multi-objective control problems can be efficiently handled in the qLPV framework. The design process, however, is a challenging task due to the encountered numerical difficulties. The paper provides a series of methods to facilitate the design process with efficient tuning possibilities. The proposed method is illustrated through a multi-objective design example of a quarter-car suspension system that provides sufficiently insight in the design process.

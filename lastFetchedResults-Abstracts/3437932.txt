Optical coherent multicarrier systems with highly selective tunable optical heterodyne receivers can be used for transmission and switching of broadband signals. Some technical solutions for coherent bidirectional subscriber lines, a ten-channel distribution system, and a switching setup with computer-controlled receiver tuning are presented. The laboratory experiments, including carrier-frequency stabilization, multiplexing, and demultiplexing, as well as the fiber components used, are described. The influence of fiber nonlinearities on multicarrier transmission is considered.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

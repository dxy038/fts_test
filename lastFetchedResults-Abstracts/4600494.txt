The isolated-type symmetrical half-bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter has simple structure and can easily achieve zero voltage switching, but the criterion of designing the resonant devices to implement Zero voltage switching is obviously lacking. Based on the analysis of the circuit topology and operating principle, the equivalent circuit of soft switching is presented, and the mathematical expressions of the resonance parameters to achieve soft switching are conducted. The simulation results verify the illustrated conditions.

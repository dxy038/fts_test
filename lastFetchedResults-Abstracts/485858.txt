Introduction & Objective: Lead is one the world wide using metals it has been used since ancient time. It is also a toxin, known to have adverse effects on the body even at low level of exposure and it induces a bread range of physiological, biochemical, and behavioral dysfunctions. Studies have been showed that this metal has harmful effects on several tissues such as: nervous system, blood tissues, and cardiovascular system, reproductive and urinary system. Because it damage human, animal and plants. Nowadays has been attended on this metal.
Materials & Methods: White male rabbits of New Zealand race were used and divided into two groups. Experimental groups (N =10) 6.5 Mg/Kg of lead acetate were injected intraperitoneal^ every other day to each animal for 7 weeks as chronic dose and control group (N=10) were injected only with demonized water. After taking biopsy from testis tissues of each group, tissue preparation was performed for LM and EM studies as standard method. Morphologic study was carried out on electron micrographs. Data have been compared using statistically methods.
Results: Morphological findings showed that testis tissue in experimental group that chronic dose has been sever changed histologically compared with control group. Seminifar tubules diameter showed significant decrease (p<0.05). Primary spermotocyte nucleus showed heterochromatin and mitochondria showed vacuelaution
Conclusion: These results (based on present study findings) revealed that lead acetate could have vivid effects on testis tissue during chronic dose.

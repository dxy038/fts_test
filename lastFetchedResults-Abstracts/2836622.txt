This paper presents a new design method of a fractional order PI (FO-PI) for time delay systems based on the min-max numerical optimization. The proposed method uses a constrained optimization algorithm to determine the unknown parameters of the controller and has an objective to improve the transient response, stability margin, stability robustness and load disturbance rejection. A simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method for a First Order Plus Dead Time system (FOPDT).

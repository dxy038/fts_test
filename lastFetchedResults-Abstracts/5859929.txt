After providing a new representation of the solution for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), a bidirectional evolutional algorithm is given. This algorithm will firstly find the solutions with potential good properties and then use these selected solutions to guide the searching process. All the searching operations are applied in the two direction problems that are the original problem and the reverse problem which is created by reversing the precedence constraints in the original problem and keeping the resource constraints unchanged. The simulation results reveal the efficiency of this algorithm.

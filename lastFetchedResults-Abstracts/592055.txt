Introduction: Cardiac surgery has many physiological, psychological, emotional, growth and spiritual potential consequences due to stress. Identifying and understanding the nature of stress can help nurses in controlling and reducing it. However, few studies have been conducted to identify the stressors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine nurses' perceptions of patients' stressors associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. Methods: During a two month investigation, qualified nurses (n = 68) of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass were selected on the third to fifth day after surgery. With the use of Revised Cardiac Surgery Stressors Scale (RCSSS), interpersonal, intrapersonal and extrapersonal stressors were determined. Results: The findings showed that the most interpersonal, intrapersonal and extrapersonal stressors were; “the need to have cardiac surgery”, “death due to illness or surgery”, “needing assistance with various activities”, “doctors and nurses discussing about other patients”, “having chest tube” and “Payment of hospital and medical bills”. Conclusion: Identification of stressors in patients with coronary artery bypass graft helps nurses in taking better care of them. It would make a better ground for the officials and practitioners towards managing the stressors, especially interpersonal and extrapersonal stressors. Thereby patients are helped to cope with stressors.

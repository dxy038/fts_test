This paper focuses on a multi-objective model of Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), where the total distance, the vehicle number, and the time penalty of customers are taken into account. NSGA-II has been performed as an efficient algorithm in solving multi-objective problems, and the Or-opt heuristic is well-known as one of the classic optimization algorithms. A hybrid algorithm involving both two algorithms above is introduced in this article. Data from the distribution center in Utica (Michigan, US.) has been tested with this hybrid algorithm in MATLAB. Faster running speed has been proved and some improvements in solutions have been shown.

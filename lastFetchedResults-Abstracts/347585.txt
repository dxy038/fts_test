Objective: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a slowly progressive ataxia and dysarthria. Anatomically, SCA6 was said to affect only the cerebellum. However, it has been argued that SCA6 may involve widespread regions of the brain. This study was designed to investigate the electrophysiological functions of the central nervous system in patients affected with SCA6.
Methods: Nine patients with SCA6 and 10 normal, age-matched control subjects were included in the study. The motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and long latency reflex (LLR) of the hand muscle were measured to evaluate the functions of the central nervous system.
Results: Significantly delayed LLR, as well as prolonged cortical relay time (CRT) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) of the hand muscle, were noted in the patients with SCA6.
Conclusions: The prolongation of CMCT and CRT suggested that SCA6 disturbed the functions of the corticospinal tract and the transcortical polysynaptic pathways from the sensory to motor cortices. It seems likely that the CNS dysfunction caused by SCA6 is not limited to the structures that are anatomically abnormal. Furthermore, the prolongation of CMCT alone does not seem to suffice to differentiate between various types of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Molecular analysis is indispensable for the diagnosis of different genetic types of SCA.

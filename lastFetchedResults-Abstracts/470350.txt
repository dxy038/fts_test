Objective
Maternal infections may induce placental, amniotic and, potentially, fetal inflammatory responses. As cytokine responses may be mediated by oxidative stress, we determined whether the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), can attenuate maternally induced amniotic and placental cytokine responses to maternal infection (modeled by lipopolysaccharide [LPS]).
Study design
Gestation day 18 pregnant rats were (1) treated with LPS (100 μg/kg, body weight; intraperitoneally) alone; (2) pretreated with NAC (300 mg/kg body weight; intraperitoneally) 30 minutes before LPS; (3) posttreated with NAC 120 minutes after LPS; or (4) treated with NAC 30 minutes before and 120 minutes after LPS. Six hours after LPS administration, maternal serum and amniotic fluid interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 levels, and placental IL-6 messenger RNA levels were determined.
Results
LPS increased maternal serum IL-6 (50 ± 25 to 3444 ± 584 pg/mL) and IL-10 (40 ± 20 to 958 ± 339 pg/mL) and amniotic fluid IL-6 (59 ± 25 to 891 ± 128 pg/mL). Pretreatment and/or posttreatment with NAC attenuated IL-6 in the maternal serum and amniotic fluid and IL-10 in the amniotic fluid. LPS also induced placental IL-6 messenger RNA that was inhibited by treatment with NAC before and after LPS.
Conclusion
NAC inhibition of inflammatory responses may protect the fetus from potential long-term sequelae.

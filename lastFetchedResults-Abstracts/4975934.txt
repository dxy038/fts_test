In this paper, we propose a visual tracking control method of a hand-eye robot for a moving target object with multiple feature points. The hand-eye robot is constructed from a three-DoF planar manipulator and a single CCD camera that is mounted on the manipulatorÂ´s end-effector. The control objective is to keep all feature points of the target object around their desired coordinates on the image plane. In many conventional visual servo methods, it is assumed that the target object is static. Consequently, the visual tracking error arises in the case of a moving target object. Although we have already proposed the visual tracking control systems in consideration of the target object motion, this method can deal only with a single feature point. Therefore, this paper extends such a visual tracking control method to multiple feature points. The validity of our control method is evaluated by an experiment.

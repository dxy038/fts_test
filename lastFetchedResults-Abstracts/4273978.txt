Behavior synthesis and optimization beyond the register transfer level require an efficient utilization of the underlying platform features. This paper presents a platform-based resource-binding approach using a distributed register-file microarchitecture (DRFM) that makes efficient use of distributed embedded memory blocks as register files in modern FPGAs. A DRFM contains multiple islands, each having a local register file, a functional unit pool and data-routing logic. Compared with the traditional discrete-register counterpart, a DRFM allows use of the platform-featured on-chip memory or register-file IP blocks to implement its local register files, and this results in substantial saving of multiplexing logic and global interconnects. DRFM provides a useful architectural template and a direct optimization objective for minimizing inter-island connections for synthesis algorithms. Based on DRFM, we propose a novel binding algorithm focusing on the minimization of the inter-island connections. By applying our approach, significant reductions on multiplexors and global-interconnections are observed. On the Xilinx Virtex II FPGA platform, our experimental results show a 2times logic area reduction and a 7.8% performance improvement, compared with the traditional discrete-register-based approach

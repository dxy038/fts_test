The Internet has become a source of vast range of financial information from financial institutions. The existing financial data provider such as Google finance, Yahoo finance, Bloomberg and Reuters are those leaders in providing financial data for all company in the world. Currently, these providers only provide financial data without any financial analysis. In order to do a financial analysis, users would have to browse the web sites of these providers and calculate manually the financial ratios. The application developed in this project aims to address this predicament. The main objective of this project is to develop an application that integrates financial data from various providers and calculate the important financial ratios of public listed companies (PLC). The ratios provided in this application will identify the financial performance of the PLCs. The requirements of this application are given by Bursa Malaysia. For the scope of the project, ten financial ratios were identified for this application.

The significance of this application is that it allows users to compare financial ratios of PLCs. The application ease the users to compare these ratios and assist them in deciding which companies stocks that they want to pursue.

Based on the clinical witnesses, in the IMRT some of the parameter are fuzzy. In the paper, the best treatment was shown as a solution of an optimization problem with quadratic objective function, where the prescribed target dose vector is fuzzy. Then the defuzzying procedure was done and since the solution set was non-convex, the optimal solution was obtained by relaxation method. Two clinical numerical example was given.

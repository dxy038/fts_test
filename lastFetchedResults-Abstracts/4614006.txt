The geological disaster evaluation index weights will directly affect the accuracy and effectiveness of the evaluation results. This paper interprets in detail how to determine index weight methods, compares three methods - fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), entropy and combination weighting method) - to analyze their dissimilarity by using the data of geological disaster monitoring in Jilin province. Its result shows that the combination weight is an objective evaluation method combining the information with expert judgments, and that it is better than fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and entropy value method. It is given to validate the validity and feasibility of index weight in spatial data management decisions.

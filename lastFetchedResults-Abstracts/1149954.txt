This paper presents a study of the behaviour of the brass/steel pair in the presence of friction and wear. A plan of experiments, based on the techniques of Taguchi, was performed on a pin-on-disc machine. The objective was to establish a correlation between load, sliding velocity and temperature in contact with the wear and coefficient of friction. These correlations were obtained by multiple linear regression. Finally, confirmation tests were performed to make a comparison between the foreseen results from the mentioned correlations and the experimental results.

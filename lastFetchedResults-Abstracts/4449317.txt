A centralized Air Traffic Management prediction model is developed. The main objective of this model is to be used for evaluating conflict detection and resolution algorithms as well as providing the flexibility for the model to be extended in order to resolve conflicts in a De-centralized manner. The model consists of many flights with different dynamics, flight plans and flight management systems. Wind effects are modelled as a random field assuming that it is gaussian, stationary and zero mean and the data is readily available to the public. The structure chosen for the model is unique in that it provides the ability to add metrics to compare the projected state and the initial state. This model is coded in MATLAB and it can act as a test environment for different conflict detection &amp; resolution control algorithms such as stochastic MPC.

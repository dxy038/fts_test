Background & Aim: Recent studies suggest that patients' perceptions might be more important than objective clinical assessments in determining quality of life (QOL) in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). The aim of this study was to determine QOL in patients experiencing ESRD and its related factors.
Methods & Materials: In this descriptive-correlational study, we recruited 202 hemodialysis patients from Iran University of medical sciences' hemodialysis units using convenience sampling method. Data were collected using "Fcrrans and Powers quality of life Index- dialysis version" instrument and analyzed using SPSS-14.
Results: Findings showed that the patients had a high perceived QOL. Lowest satisfaction mean scores were for the items "your health" (M=3.80, SD=1.74), "being able to take care of your financial needs" (M=3.31, SD="1.85), "achieving your personal goals1' (M=4.02, SD=1.63), and "your family's happiness" (M=4.96, SD=1.27). It was reported that "probably you will get a kidney transplant" (M=4.22, SD=2.15), "neighborhood" (M=4.32, SD=2.09, "personal appearance" (M=5.67, SD=0.91), and "your spouse" (M=5.84, SD=0.61) also had lowest mean score for importance from patients point of view. Financial status, educational levels, marital status and number of children were all associated with the QOL (P<0.05). There were no relationship between age, sex, occupational status, with duration of dialysis treatment (P>0.05).
Conclusion: This study denoted financial status, educational levels, marital status and number of children is related to QOL of hemodialysis patients. So, these factors that affect quality of life may promote health and wellbeing and may increase survival in hemodialysis patients. The findings of this study can assist providers in planning and implementing educational and support programs for patients and their family.

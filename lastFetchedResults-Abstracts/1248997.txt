Development of the rheological model of copper based alloys, accounting for the state of the solid solution prior to deformation, is the objective of the paper. Two alloys are considered, Cu-1%Cr and Cu-0.7%Cr-1%Si-2%Ni. Plastometric tests were performed at various temperatures and various strain rates. Different preheating conditions before the tests were applied aimed at investigation of the effect of the initial microstructure on the flow stress. Three different rheological models for the investigated alloys were developed using inverse analysis of the tests results. Accuracy of the inverse analysis for various models was compared and the best model was selected. This model allowed comparison of the flow stress for various preheating schedules at different temperatures and strain rates, including also those which were not applied in the plastometric tests. Developed models were implemented into the finite element code FORGE based on the Norton-Hoff visco-plastic flow rule and simulations of forging of the alloys were performed.

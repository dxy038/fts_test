This paper presents a novel Unit Commitment (UC) formulation with wind power considering production cost of every generator. In the proposed formulation, the subsidies will be provided for those generators whose production cost per MWh rises due to wind power integrated into power system. In order to avoid exorbitant subsidies for inefficient generators, the objective function of the proposed UC formulation is to minimize the sum of the total production cost and subsidies. In addition, two improved models considering storage devices and demand response are proposed in order to reduce the impact of the anti-peak regulation characteristics of wind power. The simulation results of conventional UC show that the power production cost per MWh of most generators rises remarkably owing to the integration of wind power, and the proposed UC formulation is more reasonable and effective. Meanwhile, the improved models are effectual to overcome anti-peak regulation characteristics of wind power and reduce total production cost and subsidies, while the model considering demand response seems to be more promising.

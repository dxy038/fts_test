Nowadays the growing attention to environmental issues has produced a higher interest on the transport service energy consumption. The main objective of this article is to explain the development phase of a driver advisory system (DAS) for public transportation, thus enhancing the energy effectiveness driving of trams and busses. The basis of energy consumption reduction is the control and management of vehicle acceleration. DAS takes into account the condition of the path and gives suggestions to the driver about the optimal speed and reaching it by using a minimal amount of energy. The system is based on a non-built-in solution, which can be flexibly adapted to the specific transport systems of a city, using different vehicles and data transmission models.

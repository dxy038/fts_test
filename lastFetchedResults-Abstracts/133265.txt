Objective: To Find out the effect of betaine on number of oocysts which excreted in feces of coccodiosis infected broilers and its effect on feed intake, feed conversion ratio and body weight gain. Design: The experiment was conducted by 2x4 factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design (RCBD).
Animals: Three hundred sixty Ross male broiler chicks. Procedure: Chicks were divided into 8 groups of 45 birds in 3 replicates of 15 birds in each. In a factorial experiment to examine effect of dietary betaine at levels of 0 and 66 ppm. At age of 28 days the birds were challenged with 200000 oocysts per bird through digestive tract. From 35-39 days of age three samples of feces were taken from each replicate for determining the number of ooysts per gram feces (OPG). To evaluate the effect of betaine on performance of the birds, body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were measured weekly.
Statistical analysis: Using SAS statistical programe a number of analysis including Duncan's test and ANOVA were carried out. Results:The experimental results showed that betaine increased feed intake and body weight gain significantly (P<0.05) in coccidial infected birds. The results indicated that combination of betaine with salinomycin has greater effect (P<0.05) on broiler performance in comparison with betaine or salinomycin alone. The effect of betaine on number of oocysts per gram of feces of birds was not significant (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Results of this experiment showed that betaine increased feed intake and body weight gain in coccidiosis infected broilers, but it does not affect the performance of healthy birds. Betaine also has no effect on number of oocysts in feces of the birds. J. Fac. Vet. Med. Univ. Tehran. 58, I: 49-52, 2003.

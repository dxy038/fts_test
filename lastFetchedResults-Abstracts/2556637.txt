The obtained data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics, and independent t test through using SPSS version 13.Results The results showed that cognitive-movement exercise improved mobility problems of students with ADHD. Therefore it is recommended to increase the physical fitness of children with ADHD in schools and, thus for improving motor impairment, cognitive-movement training exercises be performed.Conclusion Based on research findings, it can be concluded that cognitive-movement exercises improves mobility problems of students with ADHD.

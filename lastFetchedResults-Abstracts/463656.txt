OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the neonatal outcomes of 1804 very-low-brith-weight (≤1500 gm) infants delivered between November 1989 and October 1990 in the participating centers of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research.
STUDY DESIGN: In an observational study sociodemographic, pregnancy, and delivery data were collected soon after birth, and neonatal and outcome data at discharge, at 120 days, or at death.
RESULTS: Maternal and birth weight characteristics included 64% black, 29% white; 71% single mothers; 18% no prenatal care; 17% antenatal steroids; and 12% multiple gestations. Birth weight distributions included 18% weighing 501 to 750 gm, 23% 751 to 1000 gm, 28% 1001 to 1250 gm, and 31% 1251 to 1500 gm. Survival was 39% at < 751 gm birth weight, 77% at 751 to 1000 gm, 90% at 1001 to 1250 gm, and 93% at 1251 to 1500 gm. Survival was 15% to 18% at ≤ 23 weeks' gestation, 54% at 24 weeks, 59% at 25 weeks, and 71% at 26 weeks. Surfactant was administered to 45% of the 56% of infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Morbidity, including intraventricular hemorrhage (40%), septicemia (24%), symptomatic poatent ductus arteriosus (22%), and necrotizing entercolitis (8%), increased with decreasing birth weight. Oxygen was administered for ≥ 28 days to 82% of < 751 gm infants, 49% of 751 to 1000 gm infants, and 10% of> 1001 gm infants. Steroids were admiistered to 28% of infants who required oxygen for ≥ 28 days. Mean hospital stay was 62 days for survivors and 18 days for infants who died. There were large intercenter variations in mortality and morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Mortality and morbidity in very-low-birth-weight infants improved in 1989 to 1990 without an increase in morbidity or length of hospital stay. The threshold of the improved survival was ≥24 weeks and 601 to 700 gm. Although such data are reassuring, the rate of major morbidity in < 1001 gm birth weight infants continues to be high.

This paper aimed at the case of nonisothermal pixels and proposed a daytime temperature-independent spectral indices (TISI) method to retrieve directional emissivity and effective temperature from daytime multiangular observed images in both middle and thermal infrared (MIR and TIR) channels by combining the kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model and the TISI method. Four groups of angular observations and two groups of MIR and TIR channels with narrow and broad bandwidths were used to investigate the influence of angular observations and bandwidth on the retrieval accuracy. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that the new method can generally obtain directional emissivity and temperature with an error less than 0.015 and 1.5 K if the noise included in the measured directional brightness temperature (DBT) and atmospheric data was no more than 1.0 K and 10%, respectively. The analysis also indicated that 1) large-angle intervals among the angular observations and a larger viewing zenith angle, with respect to nadir direction, can improve the retrieval accuracy because those angle conditions can result in significant difference for componentsÂ´ fractions and DBT under different viewing directions; 2) narrow channels can produce better results than broad channels. The new method was finally applied to a multiangular MIR and TIR data set acquired by an airborne system, and a modified kernel-driven BRDF model was used for angular normalization to the surface temperature for the first time. The difference of the retrieved emissivity and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) emissivity was found to be approximately 0.012 in the study area.

Public distribution system is backbone for delivering benefits and other resources to needy population sections. However in developing countries, PDS system is presently not in good state as it is suffering from problems like resources wastage, corruption, leakage, ghost beneficiary, non-accountability, non-transparency, inefficiency, ineffectiveness and delay in resources and services distribution. Governments in developing countries are spending resources in large amount but benefits are not being distributed properly due to severe problems in public distribution systems. Social innovation is required to understand the problem on the basis of facts collections then providing solution with newly available technologies. Existing PDS mechanism is basically sequential or linear transmission systems of benefits delivery. Functioning of PDS mainly works from top to down process which struggles in quickly adapting to changes in social environment, market dynamics and globalization. Information and communication technology can provides social innovational solutions which could be out of intersection of existing PDS, top down to bottom up approach of services and goods delivery of the systems. Most of the fastest growing developing countries are passing through phase of demographic changes where population demands good governance and more of resources from government systems and organizations. In this paper we did empirical study on the basis of prototype of integration ICT framework with existing PDS (IICTF) developed to improve existing PDS system and collected some results which surely can be useful in solving certainly problems of PDS. We are proposing an integrated ICT framework (IICTF) with the existing PDS that can help in solving above mentioned problems. Paper is discussing ways with the help of developed integrated ICT platforms for very effective and efficient, transparent, accounted way of benefit transfer with bidirectional feedback recording.

Objective
Studies on lateralization of cerebral metabolism during Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a well-known paradigm of category learning, have shown mixed results. Moreover, sorting dimension (number, color and shape) is a cofounder of laterality in WCST. Functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) has a high temporal resolution and allows the measurement of mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle (MCA) and anterior cerebral arteries (ACA), which supply lateral and medial parts of the frontal and parietal lobes, respectively. We used fTCD to investigate CBFV changes occurring in both MCA and ACA during WCST and different sorting dimensions.
Methods
Twenty-one subjects underwent twice two distinct phases of the WCST, namely maintaining a rule (maintaining set) and searching for a new rule (set shifting), during bilateral fTCD of the MCA and ACA.
Results
There was a left-sided dominance of CBFV during maintaining set and set shifting in the MCA. CBFV was not associated with test performance. The sorting dimension number caused the highest CBFV increase in both MCA and ACA during maintaining set, and the sorting dimension shape caused lowest CBFV decrease in both MCA during set shifting.
Conclusions
This study confirms results that cerebral blood flow (CBF) lateralizes to the left side during WCST. The 3 sorting dimensions provoked distinct processing speed during maintaining set and set shifting, but caused no effect on hemispheric lateralization.
Significance
Functional transcranial Doppler sonography can be used to assess CBFV during WCST and different sorting dimensions, and the latter modulate reaction time and cerebral hemodynamics

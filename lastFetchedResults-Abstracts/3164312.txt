Ten reinforced concrete columns strengthened by carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) were tested under bidirectional eccentric load to study the bearing capacity. In this study, eccentricity, amount and bonding mode of CFRP were analyzed. The results show that bearing capacity of reinforced concrete column strengthened by CFRP under bidirectional eccentric load increase from 5.7% to 45.7%, bearing capacity of reinforced concrete column with larger eccentricity increases more significantly than one with smaller eccentricity in longitudinal bonding, bearing capacity of reinforced concrete column with smaller eccentricity increases more significantly than one with larger eccentricity in circumferential bonding, and bearing capacity of reinforced concrete column with larger or smaller eccentricity increases obviously in longitudinal and circumferential composite bonding. Besides, the bearing capacity of reinforced concrete column increases with the CFRP amount.

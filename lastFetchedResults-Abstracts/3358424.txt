The workshop on Recent Advances in the DependabIlity AssessmeNt of Complex systEms (RADIANCE), in its first edition, aims to discuss novel dependability assessment approaches for complex systems and to promote their adoption in real-world settings through industrial and academic research. The main objective is to promote and foster discussion on novel ideas, constituting a forum where researchers can share both real problems and innovative solutions for the assessment of complex systems. The workshop focuses on assessing complex evolving systems, where increasing complexity and changes are due to the introduction of new components and sensors, and to the extensive usage of software OTS components or black box components in general. In this macro area, the workshop welcomed a broad list of applications ranging from agile development in critical systems to model-driven assessment approaches as well as new needs for verification, validation and certification of dynamic and evolving systems, which also includes solutions for automating the verification and validation processes. Finally, the workshop was interested in

An application of optimization methods to real-time voltage control of power systems is presented. A method of applying the OPF (optimal power flow) methodology in the real-time mode to remove voltage violations and to minimize active transmission losses is described. The method adopts a priority scheme to select the optimization objective based upon the security level of the system state. Provisions are made to ensure the compatibility of the control with the practical real-time operational requirements. Simulation rest results on an actual system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as certain important aspects of the implementation

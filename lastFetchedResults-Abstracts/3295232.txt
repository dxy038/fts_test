Especially vascular dysfunctions seem to play an important role in the development of glaucoma. The objective of this study was to investigate if the blood pressure regulation is impaired in glaucoma patients. Therefore, 30min ECG and continuous blood pressure were recorded from 10 healthy controls (CON) and 19 patients with glaucoma (GC). The time series of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were extracted and analyzed applying univariate linear and nonlinear univariate and bivariate methods (symbolic dynamics and joint symbolic dynamics) to separate the groups. The index plvar2_Dia (symbolic dynamics) from diastolic blood pressure variability revealed high significant differences between GC and CON leading to a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 80%. The combination of this parameter plvar2_Dia with SP101 (joint symbolic dynamics, coupling systolic blood pressure with heart rate) led to an increased specificity of 90% while the sensitivity was maintained at 90%. Parameters from the symbolic dynamics were able to characterize the diastolic blood pressure and the coupling between heart rate and systolic blood pressure and separated the GC and CON. The changes in short term blood pressure regulation patterns and the coupling with heart rate are a sign of a vascular dysfunction. Therefore, this method might contribute to an improved and preterm diagnosis of glaucoma.

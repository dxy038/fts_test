Brazil´s National Plan on Climate Change (PNMC) was developed by the country´s Inter-ministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM) in December 2008. The main objective is to identify, plan, and coordinate the actions and measures that can be taken to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Brazil, as well as those necessary for the adaptation of society to the impacts of climate change. It covers energy (renewable/clean energy, biofuels, consumption reduction, oil and gas); forests and agriculture (ecosystem conservation, agriculture and ranching, strengthening sinks); and other sectors (industry, waste, transport, and health).

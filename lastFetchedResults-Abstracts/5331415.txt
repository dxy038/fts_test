With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, crime prevention issues become serious in China each day. Although various security facilities have played a positive role in the field of crime prevention, defects exist in poorly designed systems targeting personnel protection, physical protection, and electronic protection. Therefore, it is a major strategic task to improve risk assessment techniques and promote the objective evaluation of the risk in such area. In this paper, we present the concept of risk entropy based on the Shannon information theory, derive the risk entropy model of security node, and further analyze the expression and calculation of security node risk entropy. On the other hand, we generate the abstract security network simulation model to study the path dependence of the calculation method on security network risk entropy with a broad crime prevention system formed by connecting security node with traffic network. Finally, we complete the risk assessment of crime prevention system according to the security network. The results show that the risk entropy model is in line with the objective reality. We believe this model can not only break through bottlenecks in the technology of objective risk assessment but also bear important scientific significance in the applications of scientific prediction and effective prevention for public safety emergency response system.

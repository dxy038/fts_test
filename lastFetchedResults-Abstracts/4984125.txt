Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a new and promising architecture that can provide better security and much improved content delivery service than the current Internet. Each router in CCN has a content store that caches objects according to a replacement algorithm and a pending interest table that stores pending requests waiting for matching objects. We propose a novel and flexible resource management system where the content store can store objects as well as pending requests. To each pending request, we add control fields that can be used to control caching resources according to a given objective function. We examine several applications that can benefit from using the proposed resource management system. The experimental results quantify key performance improvements.

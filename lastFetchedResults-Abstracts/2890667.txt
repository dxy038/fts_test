This paper discusses the design of an experimentation platform intended for prototyping low-cost neural networks for on-chip integration, towards supporting built-in self-test, post-production self-calibration, and trust evaluation capabilities. Particular emphasis is given to cost-efficient implementation reflected in stringent area and power constraints of circuits dedicated to neural networks, which, however, should not compromise their learning ability and correct functionality throughout their lifecycle. Our chip consists of a reconfigurable array of synapses and neurons operating below threshold and featuring sub-&#956;W power consumption. The synapse circuits employ dual-mode weight storage: (1) a dynamic mode, for fast bidirectional weight updates during training and (2) a non-volatile mode, for permanent storage of learned functionality. The chip architecture supports two learning models: a multilayer perceptron and an ontogenic neural network. The system performance and learning ability are evaluated on the XOR2 benchmark.

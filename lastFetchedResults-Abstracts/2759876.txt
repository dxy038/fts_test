The coordination of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) has been formulated with different optimization algorithms (deterministic, heuristic, swarm, and evolutionary). The surge of studying coordination problem using heuristic, swarm and evolutionary optimization methods became popular. Because the coordination optimization problem is highly complex and non-linear, some algorithms may result in undesired operation time of DOCRs and also violation of coordination constraints. Therefore, the primary objective is to focus on the use of Trigonometric Differential Evolution (Tri-DE) algorithm in solving complex and non-linear DOCR coordination. The secondary objective is to improve the Trigonometric Differential Evolution algorithm in the coordination problem and compare it with the original Tri-DE algorithm.

Objectives
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of two adhesively retained composite core materials and compare them with a metal-added glass ionomer. The main objective evaluated was total or partial loss of build-ups during the treatment prior to crown cementation.
Methods

In 187 patients, 315 vital and non-vital teeth were built up after randomisation with either Rebilda D (RD), Rebilda SC (RSC) or Ketac Silver Aplicap (KSA). The composites were applied in the total-etch-technique with the corresponding dentin bonding agent. The metal-added glass ionomer was used with a conditioner. One group of patients was treated by experienced dentists, the other by dental students, in order to evaluate the effects of different levels of experience. Data were analysed using Mannâ€“Whitney-U-Test and binomial logistic regression.
Results

The early failure rate (partial or total loss) of core build-ups before crown cementation was significantly higher for KSA (28.8%), as compared to RSC (15.3%, p=0.037) and RD (15%, p=0.025). Most failures were observed during the removal of the temporary crowns. The rate of replacements was between 3.0 (RD/dentists) and 20.4% (KSA/students). Furthermore, we found that build-ups made by students had a significantly higher risk of loss than those made by dentists (p=0.028).
Conclusions

Adhesively retained self-curing composites show a better clinical short-term performance and can be recommended as core build-up materials.

This paper presents a method that can be employed with IEEE 802.11 backoff schemes. Objective of the paper is to obtain a high short-term fairness performance and support different QoS requirements without any saturation throughput degradation. From the result, it illustrates that the mathematical analysis of this paper is valid and precise. Moreover, the suggested mechanism can enhance the short-term transmission fairness of the IEEE 802.11 DCF schemes while sustaining high efficiency of bandwidth usage.

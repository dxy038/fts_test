Objective This study assessed the prevalence
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
other psychological consequences of an explosion
disaster in a residential area in Kolding, Denmark, in
November 2004. Method A community sample of 516
evacuated adults and a control group of 119 residents
situated near the disaster area, but not affected by the
explosion were assessed 3 months after the disaster
by standardized instruments. Results Of the evacuated
sample, 13% met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD in
contrast to 1% in the control group; 35% of the exposed
sample and 7% of the control group were
identified as ‘probable cases’ by the GHQ-30 (both
p’s < 0.0005). Conclusion The study provides evidence
of the negative impact of a technological
disaster on mental health and the need of preventive
interventions.

This paper gives environmental/economic load dispatch model which considers cost and emission function coefficients with uncertainties and the constraints of ramp rate. The uncertainties are represented by fuzzy numbers, and the model is known as fuzzy dynamic environmental/economic load dispatch model (FDEELD). A novel weighted ideal point method (WIM) is proposed to solve the FDEELD problem. The WIM convert the FDEELD problem into the single objective fuzzy nonlinear programming problem. Hybrid evolutionary algorithm with quasi-simplex techniques is used to seek optimal solution of the single objective problem corresponding to the FDKKLD; fuzzy number ranking method is applied to compare fuzzy weighted objective function. The experimental results shows that FDEELD is more practical model; the algorithm and techniques proposed are efficient to solve the FDEELD problem.

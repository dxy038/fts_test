We have developed a miniature ultrasonic lysing system for the rapid release and extraction of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) DNA. The prototype consists of two key sections, a disposable plastic manifold that hold sputum slides and a plastic cartridge with five fluidic DNA extraction channels. The MTB vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Gue&#769;rin (BCG) was used as a simulant for MTB for all the lysing studies. The slide manifold houses up to five individual sputum slides and is processed by a computer to fill and load the cartridges with sputum suspensions from each slide. The plastic cartridge was developed to facilitate acoustic coupling through the bottom interface such that MTB/BCG can be lysed remotely. The disposable cartridge eliminated cross contamination problems and additional cleaning time. Due to the high power density, only 66 mW was required to lyse microliter BCG samples at the same level as the positive control (i.e. boiling for 30 minutes at 95 &#176;C).

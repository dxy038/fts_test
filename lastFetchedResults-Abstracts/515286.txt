Tourism industry as an economic activity over the past few years has drawn the attentions to the extent that attempts are made to boost this industry to prevent its slow down. In the light of the definition of the word geopolitics, the utilization of tourism opportunities in a region can strengthen access to power. Such concepts as strategic planning, strategy and tactic were forged in an attempt to offer practical policies in management and decision-making to be able to encounter complicated, vague and unpredictable environments. Tourism strategic planning is capable of accommodating grounds of decision-making, expressing the reasons behind the decisions and presenting the decisions as practical policies as an effective process in the field of tourism.

The objective of the present case study is to study the method of application of the process of strategic planning in tourism planning at trans-local and regional levels. Relying on the process of strategic planning and its related techniques in tourism activities of the City of Chadgan and Fereydon Shahr (regions of Kohsavar Tarar) in Isfahan Province, attempts have been made to study the problem as a case study.

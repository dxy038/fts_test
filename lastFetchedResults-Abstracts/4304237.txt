Reactive power optimization has an important role to play in operation of power system. Optimum scheduling of reactive power reduces system losses. In this paper reactive power optimization function is taken with the objective to minimize active power losses in transmission network. This objective function is subjected to power system inequality constraints and equality constraints of active and reactive power balance. Genetic Algorithms are very popular in complex optimization problem solving. Because of their fitness for parallel computing, ease of implementation and universality. In this paper reactive power optimization is done on IEEE-14 &amp; IEEE 30-bus bus test system, for this a MATLAB program is developed based on Binary type of Genetic Algorithm.

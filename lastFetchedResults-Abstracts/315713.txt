The objective of this study was to find out if the age-standardized incidence of hip fractures has changed in 10 years in Central Finland. Patients with acute hip fracture admitted to Jyväskylä Central Hospital in 1982–1983 (n = 317) and in 1992–1993 (n = 351) were selected from the hospital discharge register and from contemporaneous records of the Department of Anesthesiology and the ward of traumatology. Earlier studies in Finland have indicated that there has been an increase in incidence rates. The results of this study show no change in the age-standardized incidence of hip fractures of men and women during the last 10 years. However, because of the change in the age distribution of the population, the number of hip fractures has increased by 11%. The mean age of the hip fracture patients increased from 75.4 years in 1982–1983 to 78.4 years in 1992–1993. In 1982–1983, 18.0% of the patients were ≥85 years. The corresponding figure in 1992–1993 was 30.2%. Therefore, we summarize that there has been a dramatic change in age distribution and no change in age-adjusted incidence within the last 10 years in central Finland.

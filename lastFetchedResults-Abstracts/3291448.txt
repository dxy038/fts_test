This paper deals with the optimal digital controlling the roll of some unmanned aerial vehicle in the presence of an arbitrary unmeasured disturbance. The control objective is to minimize the upper bound on the absolute value of the difference between the desired and true roll angles. It is achieved by means of the two separate discrete-time control algorithms. The first algorithm is designed as the optimal PI control law allowing to stabilize a given roll rate. This variable is formed by the second optimal P control algorithm. Results of the simulation experiments are given to illustrate the properties of the proposed algorithms.

Most of previous interpolation methods cannot consider the sufficient edge information, and that result in unwanted artifacts. To remove or reduce the problem effectively, we propose a new image interpolation scheme based on weighted edge pattern analysis (WEPA). Proposed algorithm finds the accurate edge direction at current pixel by using the spatial direction vector (SDV) which is result of WEPA of the neighboring pixels. After direction refinement, we interpolate the current pixel along obtained final SDV direction. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits a better performance than previous methods in both objective and subjective results with a variety of still images.

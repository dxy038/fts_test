OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the impact of early and late amniotomy on labor induction with continuous oxytocin infusion at term.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 209 women admitted for labor induction were randomized to early or late amniotomy. The early amniotomy group (n = 106) had membranes ruptured as soon as it was deemed safe and feasible. The late amniotomy group (n = 103) had membrane rupture performed at â‰¥5 cm dilatation. The first 103 women received a continuous oxytocin infusion with incremental adjustments at 60-minute intervals as required. The next 106 women had adjustments every 30 minutes as required. Statistical analysis was confined to concurrent groups.
RESULTS: Early amniotomy was associated with shorter labor (13.3 vs 17.8 hours, p = 0.001), chorioamnionitis (22.6% vs 6.8%, p = 0.002), and significant fetal umbilical cord compression (12.3% vs 2.9%, p = 0.017). The benefit regarding shortening of labor was limited to women having oxytocin increments every 30 minutes as required (13.3 vs 17.8 hours, p = 0.001). Alternatively, the increase in chorioamnionitis was confined to the 60-minute group (39% vs 11%, p< 0.001), which also demonstrated a trend toward increased moderate and severe variable decelerations (19.6% vs 6.4%, p = 0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: When a protocol of 60-minute inrements in oxytocin infusion rate is desired, amniotomy should be performed late in labor to reduce chorioamnionitis and significant umbilical cord compression. Alternatively, if early amniotomy is necessary, oxytocin should be adjusted every 30 minutes as tolerated.

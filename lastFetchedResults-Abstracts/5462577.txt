Ad hoc networks are being used in applications ranging from disaster recovery to distributed collaborative entertainment applications. Ad hoc networks have become one of the most attractive solution for rapid deployment of interconnecting large number of mobile personal devices. The user community of mobile personal devices are demanding a variety of value added multimedia entertainment services. The popularity of peer group is increasing and one or some members of the peer group need to send data to some or all members of the peer group. The increasing demand for group oriented value added services is driving for efficient multicast service over ad hoc networks. Access control mechanisms need to be deployed to provide guarantee that the unauthorized users cannot access the multicast content. In this paper, we present a topology aware key management and distribution scheme for secure overlay multicast over MANET to address node mobility related issues for multicast key management. We use overlay approach for key distribution and our objective is to keep communication overhead low for key management and distribution. We also incorporate reliability using explicit acknowledgments with the key distribution scheme. Through simulations we show that the proposed key management scheme has low communication overhead for rekeying and improves the reliability of key distribution.

In a smart grid, the economic dispatch problem is an optimization problem whose objective is to reduce the total generation cost, subject to some constraints. The Incremental Cost Consensus (ICC) algorithm and Leaderless Incremental Cost Consensus (LICC) resolve the economic dispatch problem in a distributed fashion. Unlike prior work that implements ICC and LICC in simulation, in this paper, we implement ICC and LICC in a smart grid system: the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) system. In FREEDM, energy resources are managed through the Distributed Grid Intelligence (DGI), which provides coordinated control by applying distributed algorithm. Message complexity and total time of ICC and LICC in DGI are reported and shown to correspond to the simulation.

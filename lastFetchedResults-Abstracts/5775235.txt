This paper presents the design of fixed structure Preview Controller with multiple objectives in constrained environment as min-max problem. The paper explains the novel MOCC-PSO (Multi-Objective Constrained Co-evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) procedure to solve this optimization problem, with techniques to handle infeasible solution. The proposed procedure is tested and verified for control problems using MATLAB platform. The system models are taken from the literature. The results validate the ability of the procedure in terms of the quality of solution obtained in the constrained environment and the ease to implement the non-conventional objectives and constraints.

The prevalent difficulty with harmonics is voltage &amp; current waveform distortion. The Electronic equipment like, computers, battery chargers, electronic ballasts, variable frequency drives, and switching mode power supplies generate perilous harmonics. Issue of Harmonics are of a greater concern to engineers and building designers because they do more than distort voltage waveforms, they can overheat the building wiring, cause nuisance tripping, overheat transformer units, and cause random end-user equipment failures. Thus power quality has become more and more serious with each passing day. As a result active power filter (APF) gains much more attention due to excellent harmonic compensation. But still the performance of the active filter seems to be in contradictions with different control techniques. The main objective of this paper is to analyse shunt active filter with fuzzy and pi controllers. To carry out the analysis, we consider active and reactive current method (i<sub>d</sub>-i<sub>q</sub>). Extensive simulations were carried out; simulations were performed with balance, unbalanced and non sinusoidal conditions. Simulation results validate the dynamic behaviour of fuzzy logic controller over pi controller.

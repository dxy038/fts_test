Objective: Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, has been suggested to play a role in preventing preeclampsia. Our aim was to determine whether consumption and plasma levels of vitamin E are lower in preeclamptic than in normal women.
Study Design: A case-control study design was used. We identified 48 women with preeclampsia (late-pregnancy hypertension, proteinuria, and hyperuricemia). Ninety normal women served as the control group. Vitamin E consumption was estimated by use of a previously validated dietary recall questionnaire administered by a single trained research nurse to 42 of the preeclamptic women and all 90 of the control women. Blood was drawn from all women and stored until assayed at −70°C. Plasma vitamin E concentrations were determined by use of high-pressure liquid chromatography.
Results: The mean dietary vitamin E consumption was similar for both the preeclamptic and control groups (11.74±9.39 vs 11.34±7.51 mg/24 hr, p=0.73). When the analysis also included estimations of vitamin E supplements, the total consumption was found to be higher in those who had preeclampsia than in controls (37.20±20.54 vs 22.3±27.24 mg/24 hr, p=0.003). The mean plasma vitamin E concentration was significantly higher in preeclamptic than in control patients (1.41±0.39 vs 1.15±0.32 mg/dl, p<0.001). Among the preeclamptic patients, those with severe disease associated with HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome (n=11) had the highest plasma vitamin E concentrations.
Conclusions: We found no evidence that low vitamin E consumption is related to the development of preeclampsia. Higher plasma vitamin E concentrations in preeclamptic patients are speculated to represent a response to oxidative stress.

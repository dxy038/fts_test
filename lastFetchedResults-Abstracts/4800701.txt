Speech quality is one of the most important dimensions of the QoS from all points of view: customer, service and network provider. The perceptual domain measures are the most common methods for objective speech assessment. A number of algorithms implement and combine almost the same building blocks, but in different ways. Thus, performance differences subsist between algorithms. Some of these algorithms pre examined using a comprehensive mobile network database. The presented results point out valuable conclusions regarding how these measures perform in a mobile environment

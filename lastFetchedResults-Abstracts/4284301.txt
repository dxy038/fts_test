The objective of this paper is a comprehensive discussion of the global "sustainability" concept with regards to technological innovations in the electronics industry. It is intended to analyze future requirements for technological development on a theoretical level. With the WEEE/RoHS in the implementation phase and the EuP-Directive on the horizon some specific business challenges are examined. We will use the experiences from the lead-free transition process as an benchmark to show the difficulties for companies conforming to new legislation. Reflecting these industrial experiences and theoretical findings we have formulated strategies which will support the sustainable development of technological innovations and their application.

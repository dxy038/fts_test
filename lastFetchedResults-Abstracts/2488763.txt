Objective: Genitourinary tract infections play a significant role in male infertility. Infections
of reproductive sex glands, such as the prostate, impair function and indirectly
affect male fertility. The general aim of this study is to investigate the protective
effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on prostatitis in male rats treated with ciprofloxacin
(CIPX).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we randomly divided 72 two male
Wistar rats into 9 groups. The groups were treated as follows for 10 days: i. Control (no
medication), ii. Sham [(normal saline injection into the vas deferens and oral administration
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)], iii. Ginseng, iv. CPIX, v. CIPX+ginseng, vi.
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) (UPEC), vii. UPEC+ginseng, viii. UPEC+CIPX,
and ix. UPEC+ginseng+CIPX. The rats were killed 14 days after the last injection and the
prostate glands were removed. After sample preparation, routine histology was performed
using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated
dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was used to determine the presence of
apoptotic cells.
Results: The severity score for acinar changes and inflammatory cell infiltration in the
UPEC+CIPX group did not significantly different from the UPEC group. However this
score significantly decreased in the UPEC+CIPX+ginseng group compared to the UPEC
group. Apoptotic index of all ginseng treated groups significantly decreased compared to
the UPEC and CPIX groups.
Conclusion: These results suggested that ginseng might be an effective adjunct in CIPX
treatment of prostatitis. The combined use ginseng and CIPX was more effective than
ginseng or CIPX alone.

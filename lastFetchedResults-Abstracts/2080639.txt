Objective
jective of this paper was to analyse the effects of bisphosphonates and their influence on orthodontic therapy.
ources
terature was systematically reviewed using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Ebsco Host, Scirus and Cochrane databases up to December 31, 2008.
selection
es were independently selected by two different researchers based on previously established inclusion and exclusion criteria, finding a good concordance (kappa index of 0.862). The methodological quality of the reviewed papers was assessed. The search strategy identified 205 titles. Thirteen articles were selected after application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and only one of these had a high methodological quality. Bisphosphonate applications in orthodontic therapy were divided between two main groups: tooth movement and skeletal relapse.
sions
l or systemic application of bisphosphonates decreases orthodontic tooth movement and reduces orthodontic tooth movement relapse and skeletal relapse after maxillary expansion or mandibular distraction and similar procedures. Further longer-term studies are required to assess possible adverse effects after bisphosphonate treatment for these purposes.

While the air traffic flow management (ATFM) system is difficult to solve the problem that the sharpening contradiction between flight demand and airspace resource, this paper proposed a dynamic air route management model. This model has a cost-based objective function which takes into account constraints such as the shortest occupancy time o, opening fee of route, which are not considered in ATFM models. The dynamic air route management model has considered the dynamic using temporary routes on the condition that weather and military activities, optimizes routes capacity and decreases flight delay. And we can get a optimal scheme by solving the dynamic air route management model.

The objective of this investigation was to study effects of Cr(III) stress on antioxidative system in Leersia hexandra Swartz. Seedlings of L. hexandra were grown in pots with five Cr(III) levels (0, 5, 30, 60 and 100 mg/L), Cr(III) showed inhibition on the growth of L. hexandra, and the inhibition was increased with the increase of concentration, 100 mg/L was the optimal concentration. L. hexandra had the capability to protect themselves by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme SOD, CAT, POD at the Cr(III) press, even at high concentration of Cr(III) press (100 mg/L).

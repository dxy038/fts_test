Objective
Dental implants are usually made from commercially pure titanium or titanium alloys. The aim of this investigation was to determine the influence of surface treatments of commercially pure titanium samples on in vitro bioactivity.
Methods

Commercially pure (cp) titanium (Ti) sheets were submitted to three different surface treatments, including, for all samples, etching with an HCl/H2SO4 solution. Part of each etched sample was further submitted either to anodic oxidation by using an H3PO4 solution or to thermal oxidation. Treated and non-treated samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), profilometry and photoelectron X-ray spectroscopy (XPS). The in vitro assessment was carried out through the immersion of samples in simulated body fluid (SBF). In vitro testing was carried out by SEM and by the determination of calcium (Ca) content in solution by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The non-treated titanium samples were used as the control group.
Results

This study has shown that, after up to 7-day exposure, a calcium phosphate layer precipitated only on samples submitted to at least one of the three treatments used. This result, based on SEM images, is in good agreement with Ca content and XPS analysis, in which remarkable effects of surface modifications on Ti samples are highlighted.
Significance

These results suggest that suitable surface treatments, such as employed here, may improve in vitro titanium bioactivity in a SBF solution at 37 Â°C. This behavior suggests a possibility of a further favorable in vivo response.

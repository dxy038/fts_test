Abstract

Background and Objectives: Soil pollution by oil compounds is a serious environmental and ground water problem throughout the world. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) are a combination of many distinctive compounds. Some of these compounds in exposure with human and animal can cause cancer, disorder central nervous system, liver and lungs affects. The objective of this research was to investigate gasoline removal (C10 â€“ C 28) using Brij 35 and Tween 80 from polluted soil.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the efficiency of soil washing with nonionic surfactants (Brij 35, Tween 80) for remediation of gasoline polluted soils was studied. The effects of soil washing time, agitation, surfactant concentration, and pH on the removal efficiency were studied.
Results: The results showed that gasoline removal efficiency increased with increasing agitation speed and washing time. In addition, it was found that removal efficiency of gasoline was decreased by increasing surfactant concentration. But, increasing pH did not have remarkable effect on removal efficiency of gasoline. The efficiencies of Tween 80 and Brij 35 for removal of gasoline under optimal condition were 70 -80 and 60- 65% respectively.
Conclusion: The results showed that soil washing with non ionic surfactants was effective in removal of gasoline from polluted soil and it can be recommended for treating surface soil polluted.

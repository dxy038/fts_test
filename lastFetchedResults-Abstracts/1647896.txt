Cost optimisation of reinforced concrete flat slab buildings according to the British Code of Practice (BS8110) is presented. The objective function is the total cost of the building including the cost of floors, columns and foundations. The cost of each structural element covers that of material and labour for reinforcement, concrete and formwork. The structure is modelled and analysed using the equivalent frame method. The optimisation process is handled in three different levels. In the first level, the optimum column layout is achieved by an exhaustive search. In the second level, using a hybrid optimisation algorithm, the optimum dimensions of columns and slab thickness for each column layout are found. In this hybrid algorithm, a genetic algorithm is used for a global search, followed by a discretised form of the Hook and Jeeves method. In the third level, an exhaustive search is employed to determine the optimum number and size of reinforcing bars of reinforced concrete members. Cost optimisation for three reinforced concrete flat slab buildings is illustrated and the results of the optimum and conventional design procedures are compared.

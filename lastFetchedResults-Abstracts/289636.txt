Objective
To investigate cutaneous sympathetic functions in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using sympathetic sweat responses (SSwRs) and skin vasomotor reflexes (SVmRs).
Methods
In 29 hands (20 patients) with idiopathic CTS, SSwRs were recorded with a sudorometer from the thenar eminence, and SVmRs were used to measure cutaneous blood flow using a Doppler flowmeter placed on the index finger tip. Normal data were obtained from 15 volunteers of similar age.
Results
SSwRs or SVmRs were abnormal in 23 (80%) hands; SSwRs were absent in 38%, whereas SVmRs were abnormally decreased in 59%. Autonomic symptoms were present in 18 (62%) hands; finger edema (38%) and dry hand (35%) were frequent symptoms. Autonomic symptoms, and abnormal SSwRs and SVmRs did not correlate with results of nerve conduction studies.
Conclusions
Skin sudomotor or vasomotor sympathetic function is frequently impaired in CTS. Susceptibility to compression ischemia may be different in sympathetic unmyelinated and large myelinated fibers.

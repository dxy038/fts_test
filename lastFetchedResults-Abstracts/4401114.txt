In this paper, we study and analyze cooperative cognitive radio networks with multiple secondary users (SUs). Each SU is considered a prospective relay for the primary user (PU) besides having its own data demand. The proposed scheme leverages the spectral efficiency of the system via allowing two SUs to transmit simultaneously thanks to dirty-paper coding. We propose a power allocation policy that minimizes the average transmitted power at each SU. Moreover, we are concerned with enhancing the throughput of both primary and secondary links. Towards this objective, we investigate multiple opportunistic relay selection policies. We develop a mathematical framework for deriving stability conditions for the queues involved in the system using outage probabilities. Results reveal that we achieve better performance in terms of average power and throughput as compared to uniform power allocation schemes proposed earlier in literature. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

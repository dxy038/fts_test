In todayÂ´s IC production, the design processes of chips, packages, and boards are typically separate from each other. The lack of information from other domains causes signicant design convergence problems and greatly reduces design quality. In this paper, we propose the first chip-package-board codesign methodology that provides true bidirectional information interactions among the three design domains. The codesign adopts a two-pass flow of board-package-chip followed by chip-package-board routing interactions to facilitate the overall design integration. Experimental results show that our codesign flow succeeds in the routing for all test cases, while a traditional flow and two board-driven flows fail all cases.

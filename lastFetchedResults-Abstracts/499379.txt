Background and Objective: It is well established that carbohydrate (CHO) feeding post-exercise has an impact on hormonal and immune responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of CHO on selected hematological indices after a single session of aerobic exercise.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-two non-athlete young volunteer college men (21.96±1.95 yr, 177.64 ± 5.61 cm, 75.44 ± 8.39 kg, and 23.92 ± 2.27 in BMI)  were randomly assigned into water (W)( n=8), glucose(G)(n = 8), fructose (F)(n= 8) and sucrose(S)(n =8) groups. Subjects asked to perform an aerobic exercise (one-mile running, 3 sets with 3 minutes inter-sets rest). Blood samples were obtained 30 min before, immediately after exercise and 90 min after exercise. CHO (1.5 g/kg of BW) were given immediately after the second blood sampling. Water group received an equal volume of tap water.

Results: WBC counts were significantly higher only in G and F groups, but RBC, platelets counts, and HGB concentrations significantly decreased in W, G and S groups after recovery period. Neutrophil counts and HCT and lymphocyte counts were significantly higher and lower respectively in all treated groups at the end of recovery period.  

Conclusion: The current results indicated that S might be effective more than G and F in prevention of an exercise-induced lymphocytosis and F as a low-glycemic index and CHO had no significant impact on post-exercise WBC, platelets counts and HGB concentrations.

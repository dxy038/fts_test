An assessment of management effectiveness of Kenya's oldest marine protected areas (Malindi and Watamu) was conducted within the framework of a regional assessment in Kenya, Seychelles and Tanzania. Biophysical, socio-economic and governance indicators were used to assess the delivery of MPA management objectives. Results indicate that the Malindi and Watamu marine parks that are no-take areas are making progress towards meeting their stated objective of biodiversity conservation. The 1997â€“1998 ENSO related bleaching event caused the greatest single measurable impact on the coral reefs of the marine parks leading to very high levels of coral mortality. The marine reserve where fishing is regulated was less effective in meeting its objective of sustaining community livelihoods. The weakest trends were related to the development of governance structures. A combination of management inefficiencies due to overlapping mandates, financial and administrative constraints, and inadequate stakeholder participation interacted to reduce the ability of the MPAs to fully achieve their objectives.

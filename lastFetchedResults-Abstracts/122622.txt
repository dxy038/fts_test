To provide an optimal plan for future development of cellulosic industries of the country using bagasse as raw material, some executive limitations such as capital, potential market, and the quantity of existing raw material must be taken into consideration. To this end, the results obtained from multi attribute decision making models (MCDM) were utilized. Hence, the utilities resulted from using TOPsIs model in fuzzy state were considered as technical coefficients of objective function in Integer Linear Programming model. The resulted integrated model, including 15 variables and 25 executive constraints, was used to determine production capacity as well as consequence of establishing and exploiting cellulosic industry units in a five-year period. Based on this research, production of 350,000 MT printing & writing pulp & paper, 133,500 MT Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF), and 66,750 MT Particleboard (PB) was planned.

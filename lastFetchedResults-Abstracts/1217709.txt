Since individual's compatibility in hard conditions of life increases with high self-efficacy, this study aimed to determine the effect of life quality training on self-efficacy in patients under hemodialysis treatment.
Materials and Methods: In this research clinical trial study, was conducted on 90 patients under hemodialysis treatment (45 ones in each group) who were selected randomly among patients referred to dialysis centers of Kerman city, Iran. The data collection instrument consisted of demographic questionnaire, SUPPH (Strategies Used by Patients to Promote Health) and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument which were categorized to 3 levels, high, medium and low. The data were collected in two steps, before and two months after training intervention. The data were analyzed by SPSS 15, Chi-square, Paired t and Independent t tests.  
Results: There was no significant difference in life quality and self-efficacy between the two groups before training but after training, the quality of life (P = 0.001) and self-efficacy 
(P = 0.001) increased in intervention group.
Conclusion: The results of research show that life quality training program affects self-efficacy of patients under hemodialysis treatment. So, it is recommended that life quality training programs become as care programms in hemodialysis units.

We propose an adaptive bandwidth allocation algorithm with multi-level transmission rate requirements to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of multi-services based on multi-thresholds reservation mechanism. With the bandwidth reservation mechanism by setting multi-thresholds in each network for each traffic, the adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme can be formulated as an optimal problem with the constraints of the bandwidth allocation matrix for each traffic and all users based on the multi-homing technology. The defined optimized objective function is maximizing the real-time network throughput according to the variations of resource availability under bandwidth reserving thresholds and network capacity constrains. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm not only meets the transmission rate QoS requirements, but also maximize the real-time network throughput of the entire heterogeneous wireless network.

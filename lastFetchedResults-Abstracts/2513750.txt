Migratory birds can become long-distance vectors for a wide range of microorganisms. The
objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of Cryptococcus neoformansin the cloacae, crop
and nasal cavity of migratory birds in order to assess their role as potential reservoirs and/or mechanical vectors
of human and animal cryptococcosis. A total of 700 samples (cloacae, crops and nasal secretions) of 300 wild
migratory birds (with the permission of the local Department of Environment) were collected and inoculated on
Niger seed agar (NSA), incubated for two weeks at 30 ?C and daily observed for the presence of brown yeast
colonies, which is presumptive for C. neoformans. The species identification was confirmed using conventional
and molecular methods. Out of 700 samples, 4 samples (0.6%) from cloacae of 2 Anascrecca (2 cases),
Anasplatyrhychos (1 case) and Fulicaatra (1 case) were positive for C. neoformans. To the best of our knowledge,
due to low isolation rate of C. neoformansfrom cloacae, crops and nasal secretions, transmission from these
samples could be as a minimal risk factor for human and animal cryptococcosis, unlike the dry excreta of wild
pigeons.

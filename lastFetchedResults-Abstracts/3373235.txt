A university student is treated as an entrepreneur in his pursuit of education. In spite of this, he is not furnished with the entrepreneurial type of information on the state of his enterprise. Objective and subjective kinds of information about students and their progress are reviewed. Two functions of time called Relative Accomplishment and Relative Standing are defined; they characterize the learning progress of each student in relation to the respective progress of his colleagues. Values of these two functions can be periodically passed to students. Each student so informed can review his learning performance and manage his efforts at the school in an intelligent and more efficient way.

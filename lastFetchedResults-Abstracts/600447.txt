Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of haemostatic agents used at the autograft donor sites in spinal fusion. Methods: The study included 66 patients (26 men, 40 women; mean age: 42.9 years) who underÂ¬went spinal fusion surgery between March 1999 and October 2002. Patients were randomly assigned to 4 different groups according to the haemostatic agents used during surgery. In Group 1, bone wax was used on the graft donor site. In Group 2, spongostan was used. In Group 3, spon- gostan was applied to the donor site and removed after 10 minutes. Group 4 was the control group and no haemostatic agent was applied. Age, sex, diagnosis and incision shape were not taken into consideration during the selection of patient groups. Closed suction drainage systems were used for the evaluation of drainage amount. The drainage system was removed after 48 hours in patients with a daily drainage of less than 30 cc. Results: In Group 1, there was significantly less drainage than the other groups. Group 2 and Group 3 had less drainage than the control group. When a separate incision was used for graft harvesting, keeping the spongostan at the application site (Group 2) was more effective than its removal (Group 3). Conclusion: The application of bone wax and spongostan to bleeding cancellous bone surfaces at the donor site is a safe and effective method to reduce bleeding and hematoma. Bone wax is more effective than spongostan for haemostasis.

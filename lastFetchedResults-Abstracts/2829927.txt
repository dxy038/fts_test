Failure of power electronic systems plays a substantial role in the breakdown of hybrid vehicle electric drive systems. Early detection of faults can avoid aggregation of the failure and prevent catastrophic consequences. The aim of this paper is to test the sensitivity of statistical moments on power semiconductor faults in a bidirectional DC/DC converter interfacing the main hybrid energy storage system and the electric drive system in hybrid electric vehicles. Time domain analysis of current and voltage signals obtained from sensors at the input/output terminals of the converter is used to detect system faults in the power converter system.

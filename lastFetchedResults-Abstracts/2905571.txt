The Switched Z-source Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC Converter (SZIBDC) is a novel topology that inherits the advantages of Dual Active Bridge (DAB) while overcoming its disadvantages. This paper presents the small-signal model of open-loop SZIBDC firstly. After that, five kinds of close-loop control strategies based on PI-regulator or Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) are theoretically analyzed and validated by simulation results. Their performance has been investigated from the perspective of steady and transient states. Finally a comparative study is made and relevant conclusions are drawn.

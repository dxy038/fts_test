Many organisations are evaluating their supply chains because they are perceived to be an area for both cost cutting and increasing competitiveness. The objective is apparently very simple; optimise the supply chain via effective and efficient operating practices. This paper will demonstrate via the statistical analysis of 32 industrial case studies that the route to this desired fully integrated, effective supply chain is long established. The solution has been renamed, repackaged and adapted many times over the years, but what remains constant are the underlying principles of simplified material flow. The output of this paper includes the vision, design principles, and rules for action needed to enable effective supply chain integration.

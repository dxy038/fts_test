health of deaf adults and lead to depression, anxiety, isolation, suspicion and stress of them. Cochlear implantation has positive effects on behavioral and emotional status of postlingually hearing impaired adults. This study is aimed to compare dizziness, depression, anxiety and mental health in adult cochlear implant recipients and candidates,

Materials & Methods: This case- control and comparative study was conducted on 49 patients, 24 cochlear implant recipients (as case group) and 25 severe-profound hearing impaired adults (as control groups) whom were selected by simple and convenient sampling. Beck Depression Inventory, Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and General Health Questionnaire were completed to determine and compare cochlear implant effects. Data were analyzed b> MANOV.V Results: Mean depression and anxiety scores in cochlear implant candidates were more than cochlear implant recipients. This difference was significant in depression (P=0.001). There was no significant difference between two groups in general health (P=0,415). The results of this study also showed that dizziness is more in cochlear implanted group (P=0.004).

Conclusion: It seems that cochlear implant use leads to decrease of depression and anxiety. It leads to increase of dizziness.

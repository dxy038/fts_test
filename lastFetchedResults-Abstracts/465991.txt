Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the birth outcomes of a multifetal pregnancy reduction population with those of other patients delivered at Hutzel Hospital, Detroit, and to determine the fiscal impact of the multifetal pregnancy reduction program. Study Design: In a retrospective review patients who were delivered after multifetal pregnancy reduction were compared with a general obstetric population who were delivered at Hutzel Hospital from January 1, 1986, through June 30, 1998. Outcome data were determined through a comprehensive perinatal database. The Ï‡2 analysis was used to examine the relationship between gestational age and delivery group. Financial data were estimated from published reports of neonatal intensive care unit admissions, cost estimates for neonatal intensive care unit care, and charges for multifetal pregnancy reduction. Results: Pregnancies reduced to triplets, twins, and singletons had outcomes at least comparable to unreduced pregnancies starting at these numbers and substantially better than unreduced pregnancies with the same starting number. Financial estimates of hospitalization costs averted in the multifetal pregnancy reduction population exceeded $28 million. Conclusion: Use of multifetal pregnancy reduction improved obstetric outcomes for pregnancies with multiple gestations and also was associated with significant fiscal savings.

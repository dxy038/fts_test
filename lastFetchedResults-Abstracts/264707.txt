Some recent work in the development of a high energy density lead–acid battery for electric vehicle application is described. Two separate methods are used to achieve this objective. Significant total cell weight savings can be achieved by the use of an electrolyte management system. This minimises the quantity of water used in the electrolyte. The second feature concerns the form and utilization of the lead–paste active materials. The positive and negative pastes are carried as a slurry and are agitated during the charge/discharge cycle. This maximises the utilisation of the active materials and reduces premature sulphation.

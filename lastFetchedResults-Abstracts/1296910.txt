In this paper, a multiobjective quadratic programming problem having fuzzy random coefficients matrix in the objective and constraints and the decision vector are fuzzy pseudorandom variables is considered. First, we show that the efficient solutions of fuzzy quadratic multiobjective programming problems are resolved into series-optimal-solutions of relative scalar fuzzy quadratic programming. Some theorems are proved to find an optimal solution of the relative scalar quadratic multiobjective programming with fuzzy coefficients, having decision vectors as fuzzy variables. At the end, numerical examples are illustrated in the support of the obtained results.

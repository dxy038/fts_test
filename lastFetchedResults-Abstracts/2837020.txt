This paper presents a study on elaboration and characterization of biohybrides materials LDH-Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDh). The chosen LDHs are (MgAl and ZnAl with R = 2), were synthesized by a coprecipitation method with pH constant. The lactate immobilization in these matrices was obtained by exchange reaction and coprecipitation. A comparative study shows that the coprecipitation method allows a more important rate of immobilization. The structural and morphological modifications are dependent on the preparation methods, showing a loss of crystallinity and an important disorder of LDH structure due to an exfoliation phenomenon of LDH layers for coprecipitation mode. The preservation of the spatial configuration of the enzyme showed that LDHs can be like host matrices for the immobilization of lactate with the objective of developing a lactate biosensor or lactate biofuel cell.

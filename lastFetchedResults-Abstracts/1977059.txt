Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) can be used as potential fat replacers; both are non-digestible fibers. The objective of this study was, therefore, to assess the impact of added CMC/MCC on the microstructural/functional characteristics of beef patties. Therefore, low-fat beef patties were formulated with CMC/MCC at concentrations of 0.5–3.0 wt%. For this formulation, 10 wt% of the ground beef was replaced using a dispersion of CMC or MCC in water. The influence of the addition of MCC and CMC on the sensory characteristics, such as the texture, color, taste, flavor, and juiciness, of fried beef patties was evaluated by using a hedonic scale from 0 to 10 (5 = optimal). The confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) measurements and sensory evaluation all indicated that addition of CMC (&gt;1 wt%) led to destabilization of the microstructure, sensory quality and texture of fried beef patties, which, upon heating, could no longer be converted into a protein network with coarse meat and fat particles, a fact that was also revealed in the CLSM images. By contrast, the CLSM images prove that MCC was highly compatible with the matrix and improved the texture in the sensory evaluation with increasing concentration compared to the control. The best sensory evaluation achieved was with the beef patties containing 2 wt% MCC. Generally, hot samples containing MCC had more juiciness than the control and had a fat-like mouthfeel. Contrarily, CMC is not suitable as a fat replacer in concentrations more than 0.5 wt%.

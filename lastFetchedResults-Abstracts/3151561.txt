This paper focuses on care plans of aged persons in care houses and addresses the trade-off relationship between care plans for efficient workloads of care workers and those for different lifestyle of aged persons. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes Indicator-based Directional-biased Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Through intensive simulations of 0/1 knapsack problem as an example for care plans, the following implications have been revealed: (1) IDEA can find the solutions which is close to optimal solutions in the specified objective function; and (2) IDEA can also find the solutions which are very close to the Pareto front in comparison with the conventional methods.

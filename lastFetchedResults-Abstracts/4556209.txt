In this paper, we firstly analyze Lingras algorithm with respect to its objective-function, numerical stability of the clusters. Then we point out its shortcoming in adjusting the three coefficients omega<sub>iota</sub> , omega<sub>upsi</sub> and epsiv . To tackle this problem, a rough k-means clustering method is finally presented with adaptive parameters. This algorithm is used in a testing sample and obtains a less error clustering rate.

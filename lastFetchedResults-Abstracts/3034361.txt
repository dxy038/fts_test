Forest roads play an important role in conservation of forests. Harvesting of forest produce has been a major activity to realize revenue for the government and proper utilization of the matured crop. While extracting the forest produce the economic viability of the extraction has to be looked into to maximize the profits keeping the market value and extraction cost in view. Transportation of the forest produce from the extraction points to the selected depots takes a major share of extraction costs. The objective of the present study is to identify the least cost paths to extract bamboo, in Kollapur sub-division of Achampet forest division, to lay new roads where there are no existing ones from selected points. In the present study an attempt has been made to find out various alternatives of the extraction paths from each coupe to the selected depot, taking landuse/landcover, slope, drainages, rivers, existing roads and their condition and bridges into consideration. These roads help in development of ecotourism, fire management and better communications.

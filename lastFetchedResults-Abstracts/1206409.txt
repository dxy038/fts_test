In this work, the objective was to synthesize a compatibilizer that can electrostatically adsorb onto cellulose fibers, in fiber-based composites, to enhance the interaction between the fibers and non-polar polymer matrices. This physical route to attach the compatibilizer onto and thereby modify a fiber surface is convenient since it can be performed in water under mild conditions. Polystyrene (PS) was used for the high molecular weight, non-polar, block and poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA) was used as the polar block, which was subsequently quaternized to obtain cationic charges. The block copolymer self-assembles in water into cationic micelles and the adsorption to both silicon oxide surfaces and cellulose model surfaces was studied. The micelles spread out on the surface after heat treatment and contact angle measurements showed that the contact angles against water increased significantly after this treatment. AFM force measurements were performed with a PS probe to study the adhesive properties. The adhesion increased with increasing contact time for the treated surfaces, probably due to entanglements between the polystyrene blocks at the treated surface and the probe. This demonstrates that the use of this type of amphiphilic block copolymer is a promising route to improve the compatibility between charged reinforcing materials, such as cellulose-based fibers/fibrils, and hydrophobic matrices in composite materials.

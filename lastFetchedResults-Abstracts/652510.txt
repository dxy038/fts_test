The objective of this study was to determine mean blood lead levels and prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among 1- to 5-year-old children in Wuxi City, China. By use of a representative cross-sectional survey that included measurements of capillary blood lead, 1117 children aged 1–5 years were examined from October through December, 1997. The geometric mean blood lead level for children 1–5 years of age in Wuxi City was 8.2 μg/dL (0.40 μmol/L); 27.3% had blood lead levels ≥10 μg/dL and 1.0% had blood lead levels ≥20 μg/dL. Blood lead levels were significantly higher for males and for those living in industrial areas, particularly the Beitang, Mashan, and Xinqu districts. Residence in these districts and in the Jiaoqu industrialized district also increased the likelihood of an elevated blood lead level, with odds ratios ranging from 2.59 to 4.53. In conclusion, blood lead levels among Wuxi City children are high enough to be of concern, particularly in industrial areas. Further studies are needed to better define the extent of lead exposure among children in China. In addition, national standards for blood lead collection and measurement methods should be applied in China.

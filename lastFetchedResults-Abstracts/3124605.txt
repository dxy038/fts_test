This paper presents the developed methodologies for the optimization of underground distribution systems with grid network designs. This type of system is used to guarantee high quality and reliability for important loads, keeping the interruption time inferior to the average of the aerial networks. For the maintenance of this standard of service, it is necessary to use complex electric networks with complicated operation. The objective of this study was to develop a software program for the analysis of distribution networks with this level of complexity, with meshes between the circuits and different tension levels connected to each other.

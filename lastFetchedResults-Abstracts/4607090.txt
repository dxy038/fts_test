How to consider the objective information of interesting responses in the course of new product design and development is discussed, when the subjective information cannot be accurately expressed by decision-makers. A modified desirability function approach is proposed to achieve robustness and optimization for multi-response optimization (MRO) problems. Because the modified desirability function is usually with multi-peak distribution, multi-constraints and high nonlinearity, the traditional gradient search algorithms are not suitable for searching the maxima of the function. So a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) is proposed to find optimal solutions. The example shows that the proposed method can obtain more effectively solutions for MRO problems.

After decades of evaluation, the role of lymphadenectomy in the management of renal cell carcinoma remains a controversy. Contemporary series suggest that the true incidence of isolated lymph node metastases in clinically localized disease is small, and the location of such metastases is unpredictable. While several institutional series have suggested a therapeutic benefit for extended lymphadenectomy, there remains a lack of randomized data to support its routine use. Despite this, there remains a role for lymphadenectomy in individuals with high risk of lymph node metastasis or known lymphadenopathy in whom few other options exist for aggressive, potentially curative therapy.

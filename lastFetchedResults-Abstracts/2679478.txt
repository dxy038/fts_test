Background and Objective: From the perspective of molecular studies، since the relationship between high intensity interval training and apoptosis-related proteins in the lungs has not investigated, aim of this study was immunohistochemical detection of apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl-2 in the lungs alveoli after 6 weeks of high intensity interval training.

Materials and Methods: This research was an experimental study. Samples of this study were 14 male Wistar rats (4 weeks old، 72±8 gr weight), healthy and no history of disease that divided into training and control groups (exercise training=7، control=7). The high intensity interval training program was carried out for 6 weeks. Training program was started with 25 m/min and ended with 70 m/min speed at the final stage. In each training session, rats completed the 1-min activity with 10 repetition and work to rest ratio was 1:2. Lung tissue was extracted for Immunohistochemistry tests and protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were measured. To analyze data، independent t- test was used (P < 0.05).

Results: After 6 weeks of high intensity interval training، level of Bax protein significantly increased. Also, after 6 weeks of high intensity interval training، level of Bcl-2 protein also significantly increased (P < 0.05).

Conclusion: It seems that intensity interval training period causes significant changes in expression of pulmonary alveolar apoptotic proteins and its accurate interpretation that it may be helpful or harmful require further researches.

This paper proposes power assist controllers that realize control input minimization using resonance of passive elements. To satisfy the objective, two types of systems are considered and controllers are proposed for each system. These controllers require no biosignals and satisfy causal manner. Convergence of the controllers is discussed theoretically. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed controllers. Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed controller when the systems are used by a human operator

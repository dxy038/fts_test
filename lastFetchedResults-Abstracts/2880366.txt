This article presents a simple reconfigurable antenna concept based on the mutual couplings between parasitic elements. The developed antenna operates in the Industrial Scientific and Medical band (ISM) at 2.45 GHz. The objective of this work consists in the development of a generic and low cost reconfigurable antenna, with a 1D or 2D layout. The parasitic elements are loaded with varactor phase shifters and the global synthesis is performed through different radiation pattern objectives. In this contribution, we have limited these objectives to two opposite directions. The design has been manufactured and measured. The comparison with simulations shows a very good agreement.

The development of efficient parallel algorithms based on mixed mode programming represents one of the most popular lines of research in current bioinformatics. By exploiting hardware resources at inter-node/intra-node level, we can address grand computational challenges which involve the optimization of multiple objective functions simultaneously. In this sense, the inference of evolutionary trees represents one of the most difficult NP-hard problems in the field. Tackling such a problem requires efficient parallel designs to take advantage of the characteristics of modern multicore clusters. In this paper, we aim to solve the phylogenetic inference problem by applying MPI/OpenMP schemes to two multiobjective metaheuristics: fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and multiobjective firefly algorithm. In order to assess the performance achieved by these proposals under different system and problem sizes, we have conducted experiments on six real nucleotide data sets according to a statistical methodology. Our parallel and multiobjective metrics point out the relevance of combining hybrid programming and novel bioinspired designs with regard to other parallel and biological approaches from the literature.

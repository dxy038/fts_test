Objective: Most people of the community are un-intentionally exposed to electromagnetic fields produced by microwave, mobile phone, computer and television. On the other hand, infertility is considered as complex problem in the modern societies, which could be produced by environmental factors. Therefore knowing the exact effect of electromagnetic field as an environmental factor on organs especially reproductive organs is important. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields on structure of spermatogonia in mice.

Materials and Methods: In the present study, 30 male, 3 months old NMRI mice weighting 25-30 g were used. The mice were randomly divided into 3 groups of control, sham and experimental (n=10 in each group). The mice in experimental group were exposed to 5 mT electromagnetic field 4 hours/day for 2 months. The mice in sham group where place in a space similar to experimental group without exposure to electromagnetic field. Control group was kept in standard condition. After the experimental time, the mice in all three groups were sacrificed and testicular specimens were prepared for light microscopy.

Results: Light microscopic observations revealed that the thickness of germinal epithelium and the concentration of spermatozoa in the lumina of seminiferous tubules was reduced in experimental group. The nuclei of spermatogonia were also condensed in this group. Morphometric study showed that nuclear diameter of spermatogonia and diameter of seminiferous tubules were significantly (P<0.01) reduced in experimental group in comparison to control and sham groups. However, the number of spermatogonia cells was not different among three groups. Conclusion: It is concluded that exposure to 5 mT electromagnetic field would interfere with fertility by significant reducing of 1) the diameter of nuclei of spermatogonial cells, 2) the thickness of germinal epithelium in the seminiferous tubules.

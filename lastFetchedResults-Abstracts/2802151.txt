Some professional e-mails contain knowledge about how actor face problem in order to realize projects. This type of knowledge is produced in cooperative activity. Representing project knowledge leads to structure link between coordination, cooperative decision-making and communication. The main objective of our work is to extract knowledge from daily work. So the main questions of our research are: Can we extract knowledge from professional e-mails?; If so, which type of knowledge can be represented?; How to link this knowledge to project memory? We present in this paper our first work in this aim. Our hypothesis is tested on a software development application.

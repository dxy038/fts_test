In this paper we present the design overview of the UAV-based P- (repeat-pass) and X-band (single-pass) interferometric SAR system of OrbiSat, Brazil. The main objective is to built a compact and flexible InSAR system capable of performing accurate topographic survey and differential interferometry. To our knowledge, this is the first UAV-based In-SAR system with such characteristics, multi-band and fixed-baseline (X-band), to be projected. The status, and some main project results and solution are described and depicted.

The objective of present communication is to discuss the effect of mass convective condition on the peristaltic transport of viscous fluid in an asymmetric channel. Analysis has been carried out in the presence of Soret and Dufour effects. Comparative study of temperature and concentration fields in the presence and absence of convective conditions through heat and mass transfer is carefully examined. Numerical values of heat and mass transfer rates are computed and analyzed.

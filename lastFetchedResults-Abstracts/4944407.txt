Operation and implementation of the novel, space vector modulated, zero-voltage transition, three phase voltage source inverter/boost rectifier is presented. The converter is intended for high performance, medium power applications requiring bidirectional power flow. The proposed modified space-vector modulation allows all switches to be operated with soft-switching and constant frequency. The modulation algorithm also eliminates any low frequency distortion caused by the zero-voltage transitions and can be applied to any soft switching PWM three-phase converters. A simple, digital signal processor based implementation of the modulator and current regulators, operating with 30 &#956;s sampling time, is described. Measured efficiency of the 30 kHz, IGBT prototype is around 95%, and distortion of the three-phase currents is extremely small

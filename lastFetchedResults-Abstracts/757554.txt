Objective: To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic treatment for acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APTE), especially in the hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular afterload stress. Methods and Results:  In a total of 221 patients with APTE, the association between thrombolytic treatment and the clinical outcomes were investigated. Thrombolysis was given to 121 patients (Thrombolytic Group), and the remaining 100 patients were treated with anticoagulation alone (Anticoagulation Group). In both patients with prolonged shock and patients who were hemodynamically stable without right ventricular afterload stress, the rate of death and recurrence of APTE in Anticoagulation Group were similar to those in Thrombolytic Group. In patients with right ventricular afterload stress, better outcomes were observed in Thrombolytic Group than in Anticoagulation Group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference in the rate of major bleeding episode between these two groups. Conclusion: Our results suggested that performing thrombolytic treatment in APTE patients with right ventricular afterload stress should be considered even in Japan.

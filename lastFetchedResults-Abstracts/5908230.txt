The present work explores the use of a specific method, called non linear hybrid watermarking to watermark High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. The non linear hybrid technique combines both additive and multiplicative watermark embedding and is based on a square root embedding equation. We evaluate the robustness and objective quality of HDR tone mapped watermarked images on two different HDR databases. The experimentations show that the watermark is imperceptible and successfully survives tone mapping attack.

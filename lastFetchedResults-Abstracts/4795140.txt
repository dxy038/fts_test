This paper demonstrates a system that performs multi-objective sizing across 100,000 analog circuit topologies simultaneously, with SPICE accuracy. It builds on a previous system, MOJITO, which searches through 3500 topologies defined by a hierarchically-organized set of 30 analog blocks. This paper improves MOJITOÂ´s results quality via three key extensions. First, it enlarges the block library to enable symmetrical transconductance amplifiers and more. Second, it improves initial topology diversity via optimization-based constraint satisfaction. Third, it maintains topology diversity during search via a novel multi-objective selection mechanism, dubbed TAPAS. MO-JITO+TAPAS is demonstrated on a problem with 6 objectives, returning a tradeoff holding 17438 nondominated designs. The tradeoff is comprised of 152 unique topologies that include the newly-introduced topologies. 59 designs across 12 topologies designs outperform an expert-designed reference circuit.

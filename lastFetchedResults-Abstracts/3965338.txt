When we decided to tackle the article about the three Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) engineers (p. 69), our colleagues told us it would be a &#194;&#191;no-win&#194;&#191; situation for Spectrum. The case, now under litigation, presumably could be &#194;&#191;won&#194;&#191; by one side or the other, they noted, but Spectrum, if it published the article, would make friends on neither side. However, our objective wasnÂ´t to make friends or to curry favor, so we forged ahead, hoping to illuminate issues of some consequence to members of IEEE.

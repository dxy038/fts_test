A 2-semester course sequence was developed to fulfill the major design experience in a small civil engineering program in a rural area. The goal of this major experience is to emulate the practice of planning and designing of a civil engineering project in a typical engineering office. To achieve this goal, we have involved students from freshman to senior level classes, faculty, and the engineering community. The objective of this paper is to share our first year\Â´s experience in "teaching" this course.

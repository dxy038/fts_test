This paper describes a transmission expansion planning method based on multi-objective optimization (MOOP). The method starts with constructing a candidate pool of feasible expansion plans, followed by selection of the best candidates through MOOP, of which multiple objectives are tackled simultaneously, aiming at integrating the market operation and planning as one unified process in the market environment. Subsequently, reliability assessment is performed to evaluate and reinforce the resultant expansion plan from MOOP. The proposed method has been tested with the IEEE 14-bus system and analyses and discussions have been presented.

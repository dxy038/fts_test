The problem of cooperative trajectory tracking for multiple dynamic positioning vessels, that synchronizing the movements of the group vessels and keeping a desired formation pattern with bidirectional communication, is considered in this paper. The authors show how formation reference point strategy and cross-coupling control technology are combined to produce a new synchronization control algorithm. The proposed novel synchronization controller is designed as follows. Define the desired trajectory for each vessel using the respective formation reference vector in order to form and maintain the desired formation. Subsequently, design the distributed synchronization controller using the state feedback information from the adjacent vessels based on the cross-coupling control approach to realize synchronization trajectory tracking. The globally asymptotically stability is proved using the Lyapunov direct method. Finally, the simulations of proposed synchronization control strategy are carried out and the results illustrate the designed controllers are effective.

Objective: We sought to formulate fetal and birth weight references for twins from longitudinal data. Study Design: This historic cohort study was based on 1831 pregnancies of twins born alive at ≥28 weeks’ gestation from Baltimore, Maryland; Miami, Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Results: When we compared singletons and twins, the percentiles of twins fell substantially below the 10th percentile of singletons by 28 weeks’ gestation, below the 50th percentile by 30 weeks’ gestation, and below the 90th percentile by 34 weeks’ gestation. The difference at the 50th percentile was 147 g (10%) at 30 weeks’ gestation, 242 g (14%) at 32 weeks’ gestation, 347 g (17%) at 34 weeks’ gestation, 450 g (19%) at 36 weeks’ gestation, 579 g (22%) at 38 weeks’ gestation, and 772 g (27%) at 40 weeks’ gestation. Conclusion: This new reference demonstrates that, although the overall pattern of fetal growth is slower for twins versus singletons from about 30 weeks’ gestation, well-grown twins and singletons do not differ as much as previously believed.

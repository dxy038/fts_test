In this paper we present a new formulation for the timing-driven placement problem based on net delay budgeting. The net delay budgets ate used to generate physical net constraints used by the placement algorithm. Our budgeting criterion uses a convex programming formulation with special structure to generate the initial net budgets. We formulate a combined placement and delay budget refinement problem which simultaneously improves the timing budget and the placement. Our formulation uses the same objective function during the placement and the refinement stages. We propose a placement algorithm that searches for timing feasible placement by iterating between placement and refinement steps

The problem of partitioning a cellular network into several disjoint parts is central to the design of cellular systems. The objective is to partition the network of cells into two or more parts such that the amount of handover between cells that belong to different parts (or any other cost function) is minimized. All the cells in each part are assigned to the same mobile switching center (MSC). We present a model and fast algorithms that obtain partitions that minimize the handover (or any other cost function) between cells that belong to different MSCs

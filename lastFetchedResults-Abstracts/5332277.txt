This paper presents the application of genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the location and compensation level of SVC in power systems. The loading margin of the system has been selected as objective function and real code GA has been used for chromosome presentation. The proposed method has been implemented on the IEEE 14-bus system. The results show the effectiveness of this method

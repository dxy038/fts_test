Objective: To find out the current practice of consultant maxillofacial surgeons in the United Kingdom regarding the advice that they give to patients after the treatment of zygomatic fractures. Materials and methods: We sent a postal questionnaire to 261 consultant maxillofacial surgeons in the United Kingdom. They were asked what advice they gave to patients about the length of time that they should refrain from contact sports after a zygomatic fracture. Results: A total of 184 replies were received (70%). Advice about the length of time to refrain from contact sports ranged from none to 13 weeks; 165 (90%) of respondents based their advice on common sense and traditional practice. Conclusions: Advice given to the patients after the treatment of zygomatic fractures varies widely. Most consultants base their advice on traditional practice and common sense. No widely accepted evidence-based guidelines exist about post-operative advice concerning duration of avoidance of contact sports after zygomatic fractures.

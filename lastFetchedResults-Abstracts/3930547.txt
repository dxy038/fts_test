New L<sub>2</sub> objective functions for the design of quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks are proposed. They are based on the derivative information of the reconstruction error. Simple and explicit matrix-form formulas for the proposed objective functions are derived. Efficient design methods are proposed by incorporating a separability technique into the derived optimality conditions on prototype filters. The proposed design methods need only solve linear equation iteratively without nonlinear optimisation. Design examples demonstrate that good low-delay QMF banks and linear-phase QMF banks can be obtained in only a few iterations. Compared with the conventional approach, the new approach leads to QMF banks with larger stopband attenuation and smaller reconstruction errors

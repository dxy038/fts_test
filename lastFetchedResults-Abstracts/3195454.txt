Advancements in mechatronic system technology has allowed the realization of adjustable automotive steering systems which can better meet customer preferences. Drive-by-wire systems use servo-motors, with accompanying sensors and control algorithms, to regulate the vehicleÂ´s operation. In this paper, a multi-modal human-vehicle haptic interface has been developed for ground vehicle steer-by-wire systems. The mathematical model and control structure offer tunable gains that allow the emphasis of different feedback factors including steering stiffness, damping, power assist, aligning torques, end stop, and static friction. Three steering system factors were assessed: control and confidence, ease of use, and perceived vehicle safety. As measured, driver performance improved with the provision of aligning torque plus stiffness and damping effects. Subjective and objective operator-in-the-loop results demonstrated that the driver experience can be positively impacted using a reconfigurable force feedback formulation.

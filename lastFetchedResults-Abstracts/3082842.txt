In this paper, we introduce a novel oblivious routing scheme based on valiant load-balancing for the model of polyhedral uncertainty (i.e., hose model), and the scheme is implemented with traffic-grooming approach in WDM mesh networks. Considering that a high-speed connection request in optical networks is difficult to be divided into low-speed connections, we propose the method of hose-model separation to support the multi-granularity connections for valiant load-balanced oblivious routing in WDM mesh networks. Our Objective is to minimize total network cost. Two fast heuristic algorithms-MPCF and MRUF are proposed. Simulation results show MRUF performs better than MPCF

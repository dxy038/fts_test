Objective
sure the salivary flow rate, osmolality, electrolyte and total protein concentrations in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP).

-eight individuals with CP were divided according to the neuromotor abnormality type (total, spastic and dyskinectic) and compared to 22 nondisabled children (control group). Whole saliva was collected under slight suction. The salivary parameters studied were salivary flow rate, osmolality, sodium, potassium, chloride and total protein concentrations.
s
ividuals, with both neuromotor abnormality types (spastic and dyskinectic), presented an increase in salivary osmolality, total protein, potassium and chloride concentrations compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a reduction in salivary flow rate was verified in spastic individuals (p &lt; 0.05).
sion
duction in salivary flow rate and increase in osmolality, total protein and electrolyte concentrations of saliva from cerebral palsy individuals could be caused by hypohydration status.

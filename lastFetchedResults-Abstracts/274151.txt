This paper deals with the optimum design of vibration absorbers utilized to reduce undesirable vibrational effects which
are originated in linear structures by seismic excitations. The single linear tuned mass dampers problem is treated and it is
assumed that earthquake can be represented by a stationary filtered stochastic process. In the present problem, the objective
is to minimize the maximum of the dimensionless peak of displacement of the protected system with respect to the
unprotected one. Moreover, the constrained optimization problem is also analysed, in which a limitation of tuned probability
of failure is imposed, where failure is related to threshold crossing probability by the maximum displacement over
an admissible value. Examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The variation of the optimum
solution versus structural and input characteristics is analysed for the unconstrained and constrained optimization problems.
A sensitivity analysis is carried out, and results are presented useful for the first design of the vibrations control
strategy.

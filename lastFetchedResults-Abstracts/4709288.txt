The underpinning of much of the understanding of electrical signals and systems relies on a proper foundation in some relatively simple concepts. The objective of the paper is to illustrate how computer based learning (CBL) material can be used to support and teach these concepts, thereby enhancing the students understanding of material which has traditionally relied almost entirely on mathematics for its comprehension. Electrical signals are difficult for students to grasp in the beginning as we cannot see the signals. In order to make it easier for the early student, books introduce the phasor, which is a useful concept, but limited in that it cannot show the dynamic situation. By using a computer we are able to make full use of both colour and movement which leads to a much stronger relationship between time and frequency domain representations of signals. As part of the TLTP ´Interact´ project a suite of applications has been developed which address showing some of these concepts

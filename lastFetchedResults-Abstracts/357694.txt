Objective The objective of this study was to compare the initial and long-term outcome of elderly and younger patients after coronary stent implantation. Methods  The evolutions of 76 patients aged >75 years and of 860 patients aged ≤75 years who underwent consecutive stenting (from June 1991 to June 1997) were compared in a cohort study. Results The elderly patients had lower left ventricular ejection fractions (0.58 ± 0.14 vs 0.61 ± 0.13; P = .03) and more frequently had unstable angina (78.9% vs 55.3%; P <.0001), previous heart failure (10.5% vs 4.9%; P = .03), and multivessel disease (68.4% vs 58.3%; P = .08). After the procedure, the elderly patients showed a higher inhospital mortality rate (6.6% vs 2.4%; P = .03) and myocardial infarction rate (5.3% vs 1.7%; P  = .04). The long-term follow-up period (mean, 3.2 ± 1.4 years; median, 3.0 years) showed in the elderly a higher mortality rate (15.4% vs 5.8%; P = .006), a lower rate of repeat revascularization (9.2% vs 19.7%; P = .04), and a similar incidence rate of major adverse cardiac events (27.7% vs 28.2%; P = .93). Multivariate analysis of the elderly group identified female gender (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.06; P = .012) and presence of multivessel disease (hazard ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.26; P = .037) as independent predictors of further events. Conclusion  Patients aged >75 years have a less favorable baseline profile and higher inhospital and 3-year mortality rates. However, the incidence rate of major adverse cardiac events in the long term is acceptable and similar to that of younger patients. (Am Heart J 2002;143:620-6.)

Background and Purpose: An important factor involved in infertility is reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage sperm DNA, and involve lipid per-oxidation. ROS elevation is under the influence of leukocyte activation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of ROS as well as leukocyte, in normozoospermic (NO) and ologoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) ejaculates.

Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 75 individuals who were referred to the Research and Clinical Center, regarding infertility in Yazd, for semen analysis. Fifty (50) out of Seventy-Five (75) men were NO, and the remaining was OAT. ROS was measured with laminator, while leukocyte concentration was analyzed with the ENDTZ test

Results: The results showed that ROS levels in OAT was significantly higher compared with NO (1253.49±200.95 vs. 75.64±149.52; P=0.00). Furthermore, men with OAT were divided into 2 groups, with sperm morphology and motility >5% and <5%. In group >5%, ROS level was significantly higher than the group with <5% (3627.55±407.79 vs. 81.29±100.48; P=0.007). In addition, leukocyte concentration in NO was 0.07±0.22xl06; while it was 0.12±0.20xl06 in OAT samples; P=0.35).

Conclusion: The results indicate although ROS is present in normal seminal samples, it is significantly higher in OAT. This shows the vital role of antioxidants, which may improve the sperm quality. Further clinical studies will pinpoint the antioxidant capacity in improving the seminal contents.

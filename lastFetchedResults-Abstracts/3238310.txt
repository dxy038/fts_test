This work proposes a methodology for induction motor torque estimation based on the stator flux model. The presented methodology just relies on line voltages, line currents and nameplate data; and it adopts a modified stator resistance, which already comprises the mechanical losses effect. This modified stator resistance is estimated through a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, which is a kind of artificial intelligence applied to optimization problems. The PSO presented objective function aims to minimize the torque error at the rated operation point. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the presented methodology.

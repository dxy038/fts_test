The objective of this study is to derive the noise models of automotive electronic systems. The design and calculation requires a noise parameter estimate of an integrated operational amplifier and even a multistage integrated operational amplifier. It is shown that the equivalent input noise voltage (E<sub>n</sub>) and equivalent input noise current (I<sub>n</sub>) are the reasonable expression for the noise characteristics of a multistage amplifier. This paper presents algorithms of the E<sub>n</sub>-I<sub>n</sub> noise model for integrated operational amplifiers of automotive electronic systems. This noise equivalent circuit model is derived by the noise correlation matrix, which represents the feedback network of an automotive electronic system. By conventional method for noise analysis of an electronic network, the output noise power is calculated with the sum of individual noises, and then the parameter is translated into the equivalent input noise voltage and input noise current. The novel approaches are based on the integer of all the noise sources and the noise relativity, so that the accuracy and efficiency are greatly improved and the algorithms are guaranteed to be more canonical. The algorithms may yield a better design of the low noise network of an automotive electronic system. A practical implementation for the extraction of the noise figure of a network is described in this paper. Simulated and calculated results of performance parameters of a network are presented. Thus, one may apply spectral parametric modeling to this power spectral density (PSD) for the estimation of noise figure and for the design of low noise automotive electronic systems

Development of the decision-making systems has been highly demanded to provide objective evidence for the decisions of experts, especially in medicine, and a variety of systems have been developed by means of the state-of-the-art technology. In orthodontics, there has been no objective criterion for the decisions of whether or not to perform one of the invasive treatments, tooth extraction. Therefore, the prediction system for the extraction-nonextraction decisions was developed by intuitive implementation of expertise knowledge in this study. The system was successfully optimized with respect to knowledge descriptions and an inference algorithm to provide the prediction accuracy of 90.5% and simulations of the decision-making process on the optimized model were performed to obtain the terse representation of the expertise knowledge elements that are assumed to affect the decision-making of experts.

This paper presents zero-voltage switching (ZVS) dual inductor-fed DC-DC converter integrating a conventional dual inductor-fed boost converter (DIFBC) and a parallel bidirectional boost converter. Most of current-fed type boost topologies including dual inductor schemes have crucial defects such as a high voltage spike on the switches when it comes to turning off, an unattainable soft start-up due to the limited range of duty ratio, and considerable switching losses due to the hard switching. By adding two auxiliary switches and an output capacitor on the conventional DIFBC, the proposed circuit can solve mentioned problems and improve the efficiency with a simple method. The operational principle, theoretical analysis, and comparative features of the proposed converter have been included. Experimental results based on a 42 V input, 400 V/1 A output, and 50 kHz prototype are shown to verify the proposed scheme.

This paper presents a micro manipulation platform based on several cm<sup>3</sup>-sized mobile micro robots. The proposed platform consists of a high resolution XY stage with the mobile micro robots on top of it, a camera with a microscopic objective for the local view and a second camera for the overview and tracking of the robots. The concept of such a manipulation platform is discussed and the realized platform is described into detail. Two applications of AFM measurements with an onboard AFM-tool and micro manipulation by adhesion, realized with a similar setup, are discussed

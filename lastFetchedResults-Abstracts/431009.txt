Background
The extracardiac Fontan procedure (ECF) usually requires cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In this report, the results and techniques of this procedure without CPB at a single institution are presented.
Methods

Between August 1992 and December 2001, ECF without CPB was achieved in 24 of 44 patients undergoing an ECF. Mean age at surgery was 5.9 ± 2.9 years, and mean weight was 20.7 ± 12.6 kg. Diagnoses were tricuspid atresia in 9 patients, single-ventricle with pulmonary outflow tract obstruction in 7, pulmonary atresia/intact septum in 5, and other complex single-ventricle physiology in 3. Initial palliation was by arterial to pulmonary artery shunt in 21 and pulmonary artery banding in 1. A bidirectional cavopulmonary connection was created in 23 patients. A temporary inferior vena caval–to–atrial shunt was used to complete the procedure without CPB. Median graft size was 16 mm (range 14 to 20 mm).
Results

There was no early mortality, and 68% of patients were discharged without complications. Complications included persistent cyanosis in 4 patients, persistent pleural effusions in 2 (one chylous), and phrenic nerve injury in 1. Median postoperative hospital stay was 16 days (range 10 to 50) days. At a mean follow-up of 44 ± 28 months, there was no conduit obstruction. One patient died 11 months postoperatively, and 1 patient received a heart transplant 26 months post-ECF.
Conclusions

At intermediate term follow-up, the ECF without CPB appears to be safe and technically reproducible in selected cases. Ongoing follow-up of these patients is necessary to document the theoretical advantages of avoiding CPB.

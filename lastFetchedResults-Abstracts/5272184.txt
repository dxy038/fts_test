In this paper, we focus on analyzing video streaming service performance on real networks. We propose a non intrusive methodology based on mobile devices as clients, instead of using them as modems. Our objective is to provide a more realistic test environment using actual mobile devices in real conditions of network load and radio propagation while taking into account the intrinsic mobility of mobile subscribers. This solution allows us to follow the end to end performance even when handover between different access technologies is performed. Using this methodology we carry out a study of video streaming behavior over GPRS and UMTS networks. Outstanding results related with delays, jitter, lost packets and sequence errors have been obtained. Also other conclusions about video quality, such as PSNR, have been achieved. Moreover, we analyze the impact of mobility issues such as handover or cell reselection.

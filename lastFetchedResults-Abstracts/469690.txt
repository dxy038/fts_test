Objective
This study was undertaken to identify whether ultrasonography with color Doppler can identify and triage the patients with adnexal masses to the most appropriate surgical approach.
Study design
Four hundred fifty-three pelvic masses were included in the study and underwent ultrasonography before surgical treatment for adnexal masses. Masses that showed a typical benign pattern at B-mode ultrasonography (very low risk of malignancy) were treated by conventional laparoscopy without further evaluation. Masses that extended above the umbilicus were consider at very high risk and treated by laparotomy. All other adnexal masses were evaluated with power Doppler. Masses with central vascularization (high risk of malignancy) were submitted to laparotomy or laparoscopy with additional tools, whereas masses with peripheral or absent flow (low risk of malignancy) were submitted to conventional laparoscopy.
Results
Among 284 very low-risk, 32 low-risk, 46 high-risk, 91 very high-risk masses, the rate of malignant masses were 0%, 0%, 52%, and 78%, respectively. The use of color Doppler increases the diagnostic accuracy of B-mode ultrasonography in the diagnosis of adnexal malignancies because of a significantly higher specificity (0.91 vs 0.82, P< .001).
Conclusion
The evaluation of vessel distribution by color Doppler seems a safe diagnostic procedure, permitting to treat by laparoscopy 91% of benign masses.

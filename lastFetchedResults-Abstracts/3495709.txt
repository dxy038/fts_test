This paper shows the usefulness of response surface methodology (RSM) for optimal design considering multiple responses. Moreover, full factorial design, one of the experimental design methods, is proposed to establish more reasonable and objective design area for applying RSM. The slotless-type permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor is optimized to develop larger average thrust and lower thrust ripple than the prototype, and the optimally designed one is manufactured. In the end, all analysis results are obtained by space harmonic method for fast and efficient design, and the validity of the results is verified by comparison with finite-element analysis and test

In this paper, we propose a method for improving the accuracy of the previously extracted natural frequencies. After using the existing natural frequency extraction method, we use the extracted natural frequencies as an initial guess for the nonlinear sets of equations. The objective is to improve the accuracy of the previously extracted natural frequencies using the Newton method. The final residues and natural frequencies are obtained from the successive update of the initial residues and natural frequencies. The validity of the scheme is illustrated using the numerical results.

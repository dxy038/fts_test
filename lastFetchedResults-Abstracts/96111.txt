Frames (and more general beam systems) subjected to monotonic loading are modelled by conventional finite elements with the traditional assumption of possible plastic deformations concentrated in pre-selected "critical sections". The inelastic behaviour of these beam sections, i.e. the development of "plastic hinges", is described by piece-wise-linear constitutive models allowing for hardening and/or softening, in terms of generalized stresses and conjugate kinematic variables. The following topics are discussed: step-by-step analysis methods, both "exact" and stepwise holonomic; path bifurcations and overall stability; limit and deformation analyses combined, as an optimization problem under complementarity constraints apt to compute the safety factor (with respect to global or local failures); numerical tests of nonconventional algorithms by means of simple representative applications. The objective of the paper is to provide a unified methodology and to propose novel procedures for inelastic analyses of frames up to failure, in the light of recent results in mathematical programming, particularly on complementarity theory.

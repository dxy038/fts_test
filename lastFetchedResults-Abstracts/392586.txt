Objective: The benefits of plastination specimens in temporal bone surgery (TBS) were evaluated. Methods: A formalin-preserved human temporal bone was drilled and dissected with the middle cranial fossa approach or the translabyrinthine (or transcochlear) approach. The specimen was thereafter subjected to silicon impregnation. Results: The flexibility of the dura mater after plastination was maintained, and not only bony structures such as the auditory ossicles and semicircular canals but also soft tissues such as the facial nerve, internal carotid artery and the sinus attached to the dura mater were easily discriminated. Conclusion: The technique furnishes a persistently dry, odorless and durable specimen that allows handling and may serve as the most ideal specimen for anatomical learning of various approaches of TBS.

In this work, an approach to transmit high resolution medical images based on a double blind CDMA technology is proposed and investigated. The approach assumes that multiple users are transmitting images from one site to another. The images are encoded over a two steps procedure: 1) pixels coding using a spatial Optical Orthogonal Signature Patterns (OOSP) and 2) bit coding using time orthogonal basis functions. Then, the encoded images are multiplexed and the results are transmitted over a multi-core fiber optics. The approach is devised to achieve a fast transmission (parallel transmission) from one site into another. The transmitted images are perturbed by noise, such as user interference, and are de-multiplexed at the receiver end. That is, the images are decoded using the same double blind Orthogonal Signatures that are used for encoding purposes. Its performance is quantitatively evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques by studying different objective criteria, such as the Root Mean Square Error, the Bit Error Rate and the Pixel Error Rate.

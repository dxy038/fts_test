This paper applies a combination weight method to scientifically evaluate the renewability of water resources and rationally determine the weight of evaluation indexes. The approach integrates subjective and objective factors, in which the minimum sum of square of deviations is used as objective function, the optimal model is established to determine weight, and fuzzy pattern recognition theory is combined to set up a new model, i.e., the combination weight fuzzy recognition model. This model is used to evaluate the water resources renewability of nine administrative regions along the Yellow River Basin. Evaluation results are compared with findings generated by the other evaluation method. Results show that the water resources of the Yellow River Basin have weak renewability. The proposed evaluation model is more reasonable and feasible.

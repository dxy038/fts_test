BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hemodynamic changes following laryngoscopy and intubation of trachea is one of the main problems in anesthesia. Different methods and drugs are used to lower this problem. The aim of this study was to survey the effect of alfentanil, which is a short acting opioid on hemodynamic changes.
METHODS: Hundred patients with ASA class I were divided into two groups of 50 patients. Both groups received diazepam 0.1 mg/kg, morphine 0.1 mg/kg and faxedil 20 mg/kg as premedication. Three minutes before induction, alfentanil group received 10 mg/kg alfentanil and control group received normal saline as placebo. Both groups received sodium thiopental and succinyl choline for induction. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before and after premedication, 1, 3 and 5 minutes after intubation of trachea. The data were compared together.
FINDINGS: Changes in heart rate and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) before and after premedication had no meaningful difference in both groups, but average of changes in heart rate and blood pressure in the patients in the alfentanil group after laryngoscopy and intubations were less and there was statistically significant difference. Hemodynamic features in both groups after 5 minutes were stable.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, alfentanil is effective in reducing heart rate and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after laryngoscopy and intubations of trachea. So, using alfentanil before laryngoscopy in general anesthesia is recommended.

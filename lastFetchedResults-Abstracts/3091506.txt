The main objective of this research is to design a generalized framework for knowledge based management system (KBMS). This proposed system captures the knowledge of experts and the knowledge acquired is used for designing new systems. Wind Tunnel Test data of missiles has been taken into consideration for knowledge management in this research work and the interpolation of wind tunnel data is done using neural network. The existing data are preprocessed to store them in the database and the aerodynamic characteristics of the missiles are plotted to have the preliminary knowledge of the existing data. Interpolation of missile test data has been attempted using neural network technique and tried with General Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) training algorithm. The results produced by neural network training methodologies are validated with the existing test data and found to be satisfactory. The knowledge extraction using neural network is found suitable for interpolation and it reduces the cost by reducing the number of test runs in wind tunnel testing.

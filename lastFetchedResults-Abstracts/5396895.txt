Chord has proved to be a robust and efficient self-organizing structured Peer-to-Peer overlay. In this paper, we show that with the addition of super-peers, bidirectional communications, and two novel routing improvements, Chord can safely operate in environments with firewall-protected peers at a considerably reduced end-to-end message delay. Our concept, ChordNet, is suitable for high-traffic applications including video streaming supporting broadcast, multicast and high-volume point-to-point communications created automatically on demand. We demonstrate by means of simulation that ChordNet is superior to related approaches including bidirectional Chord.

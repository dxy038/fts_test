Deinterlacing is well known as an ill-posed problem of video restoration. In this paper, a self-validation framework is proposed to solve the problem. First, various algorithms with different assumptions will be performed to generate candidate results. Then, a method called double interpolation is applied to test the consistency of each algorithm. Finally, the value of each missing pixel will be chosen among the results of those algorithms according to their performances in the previous test. By doing so, each situation can be handled by the most suitable algorithm and the overall result can be better than any of them. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework in both subjective and objective assessments.

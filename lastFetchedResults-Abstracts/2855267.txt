This paper presents a study on crystalline Grid Connected Photovoltaic system conducted at Green Energy Research Centre UiTM Shah Alam. The analysis of the crystalline PV performance was simulated using MathCAD tool; which will present the electrical parameters with respect to meteorological data such as solar irradiance, module temperature and ambient temperature. The simulation output will be compared to calculated data using mathematical approach. The analysis will then used to verify the hypothesis of various effects of GCPV to the utility grid. The widespread application of PV system depends on several important issues such as identification of technical requirements for grid connected type of PV system, solution for harmonic problems, also any electromagnetic interference. The objective of this research is to develop a platform to evaluate performance of both Monocrystalline and Polycrystalline module in the GCPV system along with various cases that considered to have an effect to the electrical parameters at the grid.

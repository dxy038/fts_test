Objective: This research compares the Naming Speed and performance in three components on three component of working memory in dyslexic and normal children. Method: The studied participants consists of 60 male students (30 normal, 30 dyslexia) from three grade of  primary school, selected via cluster accidental sampling, from six district of Tehran. In this pursue, data was collected with Number Naming Speed Test for evaluating the skill of Number Naming (Denckela, Rudel,1974, 1976) and working memory tests; the latter includes Forward Recall Digit test for examining phonological loop, Backward Recall Digit, and Counting Recall test for evaluating central executive, block recall test for evaluating visual-spatial sketch pad (vssp) and Wechsler verbal intelligence on children for evaluating verbal intelligence of participants(Shahim, 1373). Results: The result revealed that there is a meaningful difference in performance of each of dyslexic and normal groups on three of working memory tests (except Block Recall Test). Conclusion: We can conclude that comparing with normal, dyslexic ones have much slower performance on naming speed, and on working memory test.).

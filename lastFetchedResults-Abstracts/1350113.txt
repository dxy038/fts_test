Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is highly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There are extensive ethnic differences in the clinical manifestations, pathological changes, and ovarian changes in women with PCOS.
Objective: To investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of NAFLD in Chinese women with PCOS.
Materials and Methods: Non-pregnant women with PCOS (N= 602) and matched controls without PCOS (N=588) were recruited. Basal endocrine, oral glucose tolerance test, insulin release level, lipid level, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) were measured. Liver biochemical and B-hepatitis and C-hepatitis indices were determined.
Results: NAFLD was significantly more prevalent in women with PCOS than controls (32.9% vs. 18.5%) and included 113 (57.1%) mild, 75 (37.8%) moderate and 10 (5.1%) severe cases. Luteinizing hormone was significantly lower in PCOS women with NAFLD than without NAFLD. In the PCOS group, NAFLD prevalence and severity increased with BMI. The liver index was significantly higher (p < 0.001), and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the PCOS group than controls. Insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, diabetes mellitus, abnormal glucose tolerance, liver dysfunction, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome were significantly more prevalent in the NAFLD group than controls.
Conclusion: Chinese women with PCOS have a high prevalence of mostly mild and moderate NAFLD, not significantly associated with hyperandrogenism that increased significantly with BMI. Insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities are important factors associated with NAFLD. Chinese women with BMI ?24 kg/mP2P should be screened for NAFLD

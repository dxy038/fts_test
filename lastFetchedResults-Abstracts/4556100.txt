This paper investigates the transmitted waveform optimization issues for wideband Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) cognitive radio. For cognitive radio, a spectral mask for the transmitted waveform is determined on spectrum sensing, and arbitrary transmitted spectral shaping is required. Meanwhile, the interferences from primary radios should be canceled at the receiver of cognitive radio. The contribution of this paper is to optimize the MISO cognitive radio communication link by jointly considering the optimization objective, the spectral mask constraint at the transmitter and the interference cancellation at the receiver. Meanwhile, reduction in transmitted peak power and quantization is still very desirable, being concerned about implementation complexity and power consumption. These motive us to consider various practical constraints for waveform optimization in the context of MISO cognitive radio. A number of solutions are provided in this paper in conjunction with numerical results showing the optimal wideband waveforms.

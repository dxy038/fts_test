In the design of mechatronic systems the predefined functionality is generally reached by a coupling of elements from mechanics, hydraulics, and electrical engineering, combined with information processing. This leads to complex and extremely heterogeneous systems based on the most diverse physical principles. One of the problems with the design of mechatronic systems is the variety of the models need to be studied. To solve it the present approach introduces two conceptions of object-orientation, namely inheritance and polymorphism, into the model description language Objective-DSS and make them available to the user. The resulting advantages are exemplified by an application in vehicle dynamics

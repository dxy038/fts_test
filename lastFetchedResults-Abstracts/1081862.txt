The present work summarizes the MEDâ€“TVC (multi effect desalination with thermal vapor compression) technique associated with the state of the art of modern desalination. In addition, a computer simulation model for all types of evaporation processes is presented. This program provides engineers with cost-effective tools for designing, developing and optimizing thermal desalination plants. It is the objective of this article to develop a mathematical model which would predict the influence of all factors on heat transfer coefficients, temperature and pressure, total capacity and performance ratio of the system under design and operating conditions. The transient nature of temperature during the seasons is modeled by ordinary differential equations based on mass and energy balance. Heat exchangers and thermo-compressor are designed based on the results of mass and energy balance. The validated model is further used to test the effect of variations in certain parameters in the process in order to investigate their influence on the total capacity of the plant. By means of parametric study, the computer simulation tool developed will help designers to achieve the best setting for the desalination process to minimize energy consumption. The comparison between the simulation results and experimental data well proves the program validity.

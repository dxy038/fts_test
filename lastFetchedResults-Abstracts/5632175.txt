The primary objective of this work is to detail the architecture for a F.I.R. digital filter block and to examine the application of this architecture to video composite to component decoding. A brief discussion is first undertaken of possible filter architectures. This is followed by a more detailed description of the implementation used. Possible extensions of the basic concept to include decimation and interpolation are examined. The second portion of the work focuses on the application of the ZR33481/881 to the problem of separating luminance and chrominance information using digital techniques. The underlying theory is first examined and a practical design example given. Two configurations are developed and the effect of each on system performance discussed. The paper concludes with some suggestions for other applications of the System Processor in related areas.

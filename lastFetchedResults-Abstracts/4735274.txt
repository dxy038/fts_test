This paper reveals some new structural properties of a rigid robot with state and output-based controllers. Applications of these properties allow one to design a controller that ensures both, global asymptotic stability of the nonlinear system and eigenvalues assignment of the resulting linear approximation within the stable region of the complex plane. Hence, required global and local control objective can be attained. Applications of the results to spacecraft attitude control are demonstrated.

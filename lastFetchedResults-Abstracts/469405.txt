Objective
This study was undertaken to evaluate the risks and pregnancy outcome in women with prosthetic heart valves on different anticoagulent regimens.
Study design
A retrospective chart review of 82 pregnancies in 33 women with mechanical valve prostheses at a tertiary referral center from 1987 to 2002. The main outcome measures were major maternal complications and perinatal outcome.
Results
The valve replaced was mitral (60.6%), aortic (18.2%), and both (21.2%). Fifty-four pregnancies (65.9%) resulted in live births, 9 (11.0%) had stillbirths (all on warfarin), and 12 (14.6%) had spontaneous and 7 (8.5%) therapeutic abortions (all on warfarin). The rate of spontaneous abortion was highest in women on warfarin throughout pregnancy (P< .01). The live birth rate was higher in women on heparin compared with those on warfarin (P< .01), and in those on heparin/warfarin compared with warfarin alone (P< .01). There were no maternal deaths; however, 3 patients had mitral valve thrombosis (2 on heparin and 1 on warfarin) necessitating surgery in 1 patient and medical thrombolysis in 2 patients. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 5 patients, 4 of whom required transfusion.
Conclusion
No single anticoagulant regimen confers complete protection from thromboembolic phenomena in pregnancy. Despite a high maternal morbidity rate, the perinatal outcome is acceptable when pregnancy progresses beyond the first trimester.

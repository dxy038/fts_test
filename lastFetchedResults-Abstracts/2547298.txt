Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Development of the drug resistance is becoming a threat to disease control, which underscores need for new agents targeting M. tuberculosis. In this study, analysis of gene expression was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). Results of the current study showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration value of cinnamaldehyde against M. tuberculosis was 200 Âµg/mL. Moreover, RT-PCR data showed that a total of 25 genes were regulated by the cinnamaldehyde. Of these, 12 genes were up-regulated, and 13 genes were down-regulated. Cinnamaldehyde is a pattern to expand the new anti-TB drugs, because the targets of the cinnamaldehyde are different from those of anti-tubercular agents.

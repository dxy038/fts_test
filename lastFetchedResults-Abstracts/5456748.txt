The paper presents a novel solution methodology for optimal planning of high-voltage transmission network investments. This objective of the problem is to minimize capital costs needed for new network elements while meeting imposed operating constraints. The chaotic particle swarm optimization is proposed as the problem solution. A case on transmission network planning problem is presented to show the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency, compared with the existing optimal planning methods, the search time of the particle swarm optimization method is shorter and the result is close to the ideal solution, simultaneously.

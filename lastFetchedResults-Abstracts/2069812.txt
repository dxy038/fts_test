Because of the radionuclide long half-life, Sr 90 + Y 90 , plane or concave sources, utilized in brachytherapy, have to be calibrated initially by the manufacturer and then routinely while they are utilized. Plane applicators can be calibrated against a conventional extrapolation chamber, but concave sources, because of their geometry, should be calibrated using relative dosimeters, as thermoluminescent (TL) materials. Thin CaSO 4 :Dy pellets are produced at IPEN specially for beta radiation detection. Previous works showed the feasibility of this material in the dosimetry of Sr 90 + Y 90 sources in a wide range of absorbed dose in air. The aim of this work was to study the usefulness of these pellets for the calibration of a Sr 90 + Y 90 concave applicator. To reach this objective, a special phantom was designed and manufactured in PTFE with semi spherical geometry. Because of the dependence of the TL response on the mass of the pellet, the response of each pellet was normalized by its mass in order to reduce the dispersion on TL response. Important characteristics of this material were obtained in reference of a standard Sr 90 + Y 90 source, and the pellets were calibrated against a plane applicator; then they were utilized to calibrate the concave applicator.

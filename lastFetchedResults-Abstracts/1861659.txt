Objective
esent study examined the inhibitory effects of pyrophosphate, etidronate, and phytate on bovine pericardium calcification in vitro.
s
 pericardium was glutaraldehyde fixed and then placed in a flow chamber in the presence of a synthetic physiological fluid alone (control) or the fluid plus various concentrations of pyrophosphate, etidronate, or phytate. Following a 96-h incubation, fragments were removed and assayed for calcification by measuring calcium and phosphorus levels.
s
ta indicated that both pyrophosphate and etidronate at 1 mg/l (5.75 and 4.95 μM, respectively) inhibited bovine pericardium calcification, whereas neither agent had an effect at 0.5 mg/l (2.87 and 2.47 μM, respectively). Phytate was the most potent inhibitor of calcification, and the effects of this agent were apparent at levels as low as 0.25 mg/l (0.39 μM).
sions
pyrophosphate, etidronate, and phytate were all able to inhibit bovine pericardium calcification in vitro, phytate was found to be the most effective.

One way to avoid the problem of time inconsistency is to follow, the delegation approach. According to this approach, for any executive monetary or fiscal decision making and planning, an independent monetary or fiscal planning institution or sector is established, a part from the executive one. Objective evidences such as these institutions in metropolitan cities of our country, are formation of the planning deputy as a new municipal organization of the metropolitan cities such as Isfahan municipality.
 In this survey, we first, estimate approved and performance budget efficiency of fourteen municipalities with central municipality of the aria of Isfahan metropolitan city from 2009 to 2012 by Parametric method of Timmer and WinQSB software.

Objective: Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defenses of the body. The use of antioxidants can have preventive effects in diabetes. The present study aims to show the effects of Biarum Bovei extracts on lipid profile, lipid peroxidation in streptozocin induced diabetic male rats.
Materials and Methods: Animals were randomly assigned to the control group, diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ 60 mg/kg) and 5 diabetic groups rats which have received hydro-alcoholic extract Biarum Bovei (50, 100, 200, 400, 800 mg/kg) via gavages for two weeks. Blood glucose, serum lipid profile and malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissue were measured at the end of experiment.
Results: The results indicate that blood glucose in diabetic group increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in comparison with the control group. Biarum Bovei extract at a dose (100 and 200 mg/kg), causing a significant decrease in blood glucose levels (P < 0.01). The MDA significantly decreased in the hippocampus in the group receiving 100, 200 mg/kg Biarum Bovei extract (P < 0.001, P < 0.01) respectively.
Conclusion: Hydro-alcoholic extract of Biarum Bovei may have antioxidant properties which reduce blood glucose and complications of diabetes such as lipid peroxidation and lipid profiles. It can be used from this plant to improve diabetes along with medication.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the response of autonomic nervous system to different auditory stimuli rhythms in rest, exercise and recovery conditions. For this purpose, 14 physical education students with an average age of 21.5 ± 0.79 years, weight 64.9 + 88.42 kg, body mass index 20.2 ± 72.25 kg/m2 and height 176.3 ± 83.99 cm were recruited and evaluated at four separate sessions (without music, metronome, regular auditory stimulus, irregular sound stimulus). In each occasion, during three phases of rest, exercise and recovery, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded. Heart rate variability was measured with a total recording time of 10 min at rest, 10 min at exercise and 15 min at recovery phases. Analysis of repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant effect of auditory stimulus on heart rate variability during rest phase. In contrast to the resting phase, during exercise phase auditory stimuli significantly reduced heart rate variability. Especially, the effects of syncopated and regular auditory stimuli were more prominent. Similar to rest phase, during recovery phase, heart rate variability indices did not change significantly. The findings of this study showed that entrainment with auditory stimuli  affected heart rate variability. Also, the heart rate variability response was influenced by the auditory stimuli structure. In sum, entrainment with auditory stimuli decreased heart rate variability.

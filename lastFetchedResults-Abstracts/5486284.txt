This report presents the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) for analysis of the traffic capacity of a telephone line. The objective of this paper is to forecast the network capacity (traffic) of a telephone line and identify traffic flows for the network in Shah Alam and Petaling Jaya. In this project, the back propagation ANN algorithm of has been chosen to train and test the data. The back propagation technique is selected since a large number of researchers have used it for many applications and reported its successful results in numerous technical conferences. Inputs of the analysis are weekday, weekend, public holiday and weather. A network with three and four inputs is tested and results obtained are compared in terms of analysis errors.

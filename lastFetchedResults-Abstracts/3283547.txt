This paper describes preliminary findings of research on the use of Distributed Energy Storage devices for Renewable Energy integration. The primary objective is to describe the effect of different storage scheduling strategies, and namely the benefits from intraday intraday scheduling on the storage performance in renewable energy integration. Optimal schedules of Distributed Energy Storage devices are based on forecasts of Renewable Energy production, local consumption and prices, along with other criteria. These forecasts tend to have a higher uncertainty for higher time horizons, resulting in losses due to errors and to the underutilization of the assets. The use of frequent schedules updates can reduce part of these drawbacks and this paper aims at quantifying this reduction. The importance of the quantification of the benefits arising from different rescheduling frequencies lies in its influence on the ICT infrastructure necessary to implement it and its cost.

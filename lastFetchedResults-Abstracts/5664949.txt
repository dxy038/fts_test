The objective of the CISAL project is to provide the designer with a new computer tool for interactive product and assembly line design. It is subdivided into three main modules: product analysis, operation modes and assembly techniques, and line layout. We present the second module which is used to select the assembly technique (screwing, bonding, ...) then will evaluate the operation times and costs in order to select the operation mode (manual, flexible or dedicated). We also present the object oriented database used in the project

A prototype has been realized and metrologically characterized in order to be utilized to test infant pulmonary ventilators in in-vitro use. The adopted design for the proposed tester is capable to simulate and to regulate independently the characteristic values of respiratory system compliance and functional residual capacity of pre-term infants. Compliance values lower than 0.10 ml/cmH<sub>2</sub>O in a tidal volume range lower than 10 ml have been obtained. Functional residual capacity can be varied between 20 and 50 ml with a 3 ml resolution. Expansion tidal volume and alveolar pressure can be continuously monitored. The realized device is inexpensive and shows acceptable accuracy values associated to the simulated parameters. Thus, it can be considered a valuable tool in the estimation on objective basis of the actual performances of neonatal ventilators.

The objective of this study is to investigate remote-learning methods in the context of mechatronics education, and in particular, for the study of brushless DC motors, which are extensively employed in robots, information devices, home appliances and other areas. While hypermedia-based courseware and computer-assisted instruction are widely used in conventional desk-type learning, very few examples exist of remote learning that involve experiments. The authors therefore developed a prototype client-server system for remotely conducting experiments on brushless DC motors, including Web-based courseware and other software. The server computer is connected to the motor laboratory, and the visual image and sounds of the experiment are transmitted to the client computer in real time. The remotely located user can operate the motors and conduct experiments through the client computer. Through demonstrations to a class, the authors conclude that the remote lab combined with a simulation of the motorÂ´s dynamic behavior can be a quite effective teaching aid for the study of precision motors

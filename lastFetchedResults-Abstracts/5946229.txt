Learning, teaching and training processes are increasingly relying on the Web. Different types of educational web applications are indeed available and provide to learners and trainers a considerable number of online educational resources. In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning objects indexing and retrieving in online learning environments, and propose to use an ontology-based description model, whose main objective is to improve access, search and reuse of learning resources. The ontological concepts and relations that we propose provide a means of guided navigation within an e-Learning system resources. They also allow performing multilingual search in these resources. An implementation of this model in a multilingual learning portal, where we used the proposed ontologies to perform trilingual search within a database of Arabic, French and English learning resources, is described.

Ferula assa foethica (F.foethica) is an important species of medicinal plant that has been used in traditional medicine as an anticonvulsant herb. So the present study has investigated anti-convulsion effect of F.foethica gum extract using PTZ-induced kindling method.

PTZ, 3, 4 and 5. treatment groups which received the extract in 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg; i.p, respectively, and 6. positive control group which received VA (100 mg/kg) as an anticonvulsant drug. All groups were kindled by 11 period injection of PTZ (35 mg/kg; i.p.). In the 12th injection, all groups were tested for PTZ challenge dose (75 mg/kg). However, exhibited phase of seizure (0-5) were observed and noted till 30 min after PTZ injection.

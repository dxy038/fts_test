The purpose of this paper is to present a system for dynamic scheduling of manufacturing orders using a product oriented approach, to be used in an integrated manner for dynamic, inter-active and iterative scheduling under a scheduling decision support system. Here is described a due date based scheduling method, where al the operations of one task are scheduled before the next task is considered, a task is considered to be the set of all the operations needed to produce one product. The referred method is to be applied to solve real world dynamic scheduling problems in a multi-order multi-resource environment, where the products to be processed have release times and due dates, and the resources are available in a limited amount. Some realistic constraints are considered, such as multilevel tasks, shared resources, alternative resources and temporal constraints. The objective is to meet the deadlines for all the tasks. Yet there is one limitation, pre-emption is not allowed.

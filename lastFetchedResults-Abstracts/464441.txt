OBJECTIVE: We performed a metaanalysis of seven published randomized clinical trials to estimate more precisely the effect of prophylactic antibiotics on neonatal mortality, clinical sepsis of the neonate, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. STUDY DESIGN: To evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment unaffected by other forms of treatment such as tocolytics or corticosteroids, investigations in which these additional measures were used were not included. We analyzed study patients and methods and abstracted quantitative outcome data. For each outcome both odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 657 patients from seven trials published between 1989 and 1994, antibiotic therapy significantly reduced the risk of neonatal sepsis by 68% (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.65, p = 0.001) and that of intraventricular hemorrhage by 50% (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.89, p = 0019). In contrast, no significant effect of antibiotics on overall neonatal mortality (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 1.81), respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.22), or necrotizing enterocolitis (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 2.62) was found. CONCLUSION: This metaanalysis supports an improvement of neonatal morbidity in mothers with preterm premature rupture of membranes treated prenatally with different antibiotic regimens.

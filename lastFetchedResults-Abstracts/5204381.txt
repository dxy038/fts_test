The basic objective of the current paper is to present a remote laboratory for a combined solar-energy system. The system generates electrical energy as well as heat energy. The remote laboratory facilitates the Internet-based access to the electrical and thermal parameters during the operation of the system. Even external intervention to operation is possible for the remote clients. The virtual laboratory can be considered as an extension of an earlier started international collaboration, called Yoto project, where contributors from Europe, Japan and Australia are trying to increase the academic and industrial education by multimedia-rich e-learning tools and virtual laboratory. It can have an important role in the distance education too.

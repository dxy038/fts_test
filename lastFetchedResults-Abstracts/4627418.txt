Although finite element (FE) analysis is a powerful analytical tool for electric machines, it is rarely used in iterative machine design optimization programs since it is computationally intensive, requiring excessive calculation times. This paper describes an approach for overcoming this obstacle using a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment that harnesses the parallel processing capabilities of large numbers of computers to evaluate many candidate designs simultaneously. Differential evolution has been selected as the optimization algorithm that applies FE analysis to maximize the electromagnetic performance according to an objective function in a computationally-efficient manner. This software has been applied using available HTC resources to optimize the design of a 30 kW (continuous) fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW) surface permanent magnet (SPM) machine for high torque density. Tests comparing the computational speeds achieved using the same optimization software with the HTC resources and a single computer have demonstrated a major reduction (approx. 30:1) of the computation time using the HTC approach.

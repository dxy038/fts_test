The objective of this work was to construct an electroplating cell in order to study the main process variables such as current density and electrolyte flow rate. The application of high current densities, 130 A/dm2 or higher, is possible because of the high flow rate. The influence of the current density and of the electrolyte flow velocity on the morphology and texture of zinc coating was evaluated. Three different crystallization forms were observed for the current density values studied. The increase in current density results in the reduction of diffracted intensities of the (00.2)Zn, (10.5)Zn, (10.4)Zn and (10.3)Zn crystallographic planes, and in the increase of the diffracted intensities of the (10.1)Zn and (11.2)Zn crystallographic planes. A method for evaluation of thin film zinc feature coating, using X-ray diffraction, and a method for determining the coating thickness were developed.

There has been a lot of development in Biped walking around the world. Biped walking is a very complex problem in robotics and control domain. This paper describes the (small scale) design and implementation of bipedal system for humanoid. The system is intended for an autonomous robot, and has a total of 13 degrees of freedom of with 3 DoF for hip joint, 1 Dof for knee joint and 2 DoF for ankle joint for each leg. The objective of this work is to design bipedal walking system prototype. Realization and implementation of control strategy in MATLAB environment. for straight and inclined plane walking.

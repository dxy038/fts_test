Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology offers a promising solution to the RF spectrum drought by allowing new services to coexist with current radio systems with minimal or no interference. This coexistence brings the advantage of avoiding the expensive spectrum licensing fees that providers of all other radio services must pay. In Ultra Wide Band technology, the conventional analog waveform is a simple pulse which in general is directly radiated to the air. These short pulses have typical widths of less than 1 nanosecond and thus bandwidth of over 1 GHz. Due to this wide bandwidth, Federal Communication Commission(FCC) has imposed certain restrictions on the emission limits of UWB systems. Inorder to fit well to the FCC mask, the basic pulse shapes have to be modified. So pulse shaping is very much relevant in UWB domain. The immediate objective of this paper is to design an optimal pulse shaping technique. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for UWB pulse shaping which utilises ideas from existing two techniques.

This article outlined several optimization techniques applied in different steps of the synthesis of filters and multiplexers. The importance of the subject has been appreciated by more and more researchers and engineers in this community. As it is impossible to cover all technologies available, the objective here is to provoke a broader thinking beyond basic filter synthesis. Established computer-aided design methodology is a true blend of both synthesis and optimization. In most cases, to meet a set of well thought-out specifications, the science of filter synthesis and trade-off applies. In other cases, the optimization of design is an art which creates opportunities and new possibilities.

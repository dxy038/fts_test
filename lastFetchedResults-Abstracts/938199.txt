The objective of this study was to investigate the association between chromium ŽCr. concentrations and sister
chromatid exchanges ŽSCE. formation in Cr workers and to assess the effects of susceptible genes Žglutathione
S-transferase M1 and T1. on the frequency of deletion and SCE cell. Urinary Cr concentration was significantly
elevated in Cr workers Ž3.67 3.89  g g creatinine. compared to control group Ž1.21 1.16  g g creatinine,
P 0.01.. There was also a significant difference of superoxide dismutase ŽSOD. levels between Cr workers
Ž6.86 0.80 U mg Hb. and controls Ž7.16 0.53 U mg Hb, P 0.01.. The frequencies of SCE and high frequency
cells ŽHFC. were significantly correlated with smoking habits and with duration of exposure to Cr. A significantly
higher percentage Ž50%. of Cr workers had both the null GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype as compared to 10% of the
controls ŽP 0.01.. However, the chromosomal DNA damage effect of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes, individually
or in combination, was not revealed in Cr exposed workers.

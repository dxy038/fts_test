Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, highly prevalent
neurodevelopmental disorder which affects 9% of school-age children. Triple P-Positive Parenting Program is an
evidence-based parenting program reported to be useful in the management of this disorder. The aim of this
randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of Triple P in mothers of ADHD children.
Methods: In this study, 30 mothers with ADHD children aged between 6 to 10 were randomly assigned to
two groups (15 participants in each group). Parenting style, mother-child relationship, maternal depression,
anxiety and stress, and childrenâ€™s behavioral problems were evaluated. The intervention group received 120
minute sessions for 5 weeks and 15-30 minute telephone contacts for 3 weeks while no intervention was done for
the control group.
Results: Analysis of covariance revealed that mothers of the Triple P group showed significant (p  <  0.01)
improvements in parenting style, mother-child relationship, and considerable decrease in depression, anxiety and
stress. Women trained in the Triple P group also reported significantly lower rates of child misbehavior than
women of the control group.
Conclusion: Triple P-Positive Parenting intervention is effective and acceptable for mothers of
ADHD children

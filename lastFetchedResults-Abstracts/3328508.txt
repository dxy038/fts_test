Heart attack is a global occurring phenomenon. In recent years the footprints of heart attacks are massively seen in India. About 60% of daily deaths are due to this. The objective of this paper is to give rank to the parameters which give birth to this disease and the arrangement of parameters is based upon the prognosis of the heart diseases. Combining such parameters can detect weather the person has become the patient of this disease or not. Ten risk factors have been identified for the risk stratification of CHD. These risk factors have been clinically validated by a group of cardiologists as per their medical experiences.

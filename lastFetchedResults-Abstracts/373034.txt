An International EUROMET exercise, Action 721, was organized with the objective of obtaining more reliable decay data on the disintegration of 65Zn. Nine laboratories participated, sending their results relating to activity measurements and 1115-keV gamma-ray emission intensity. Participants mainly used the 4πβ-γ  coincidence method for the activity measurement, the resulting values and uncertainty budgets are described. New gamma-ray emission intensities were also measured in this exercise and, taking into account previously published values, the intensity of the 1115-keV gamma-ray emission has been determined to be 50.22(11)%.

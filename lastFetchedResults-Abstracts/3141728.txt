A new fuzzy method for multi-objective decision-making is proposed, in order to resolve the incomplete fuzzy preference relation problems, and the specific algorithm is presented on the basis of the fuzzy consistent relation. To decrease the subjectivity in the process of decision-making, it is discussed how to do with the appropriate weights and how to optimize multi-objective sorting. It is concluded that it is feasible to apply the fuzzy consistent relation to multi-objective decision-making analysis, and the improved fuzzy method is workable.

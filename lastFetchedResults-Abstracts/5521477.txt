A risk assessment method is introduced to the estimation of network security. The method, which combines AHP method and fuzzy logical method, is applied to the risk assessment. AHP method and fuzzy logical method are improved according to the actual condition of the risk assessment of network security. Each risk factor is estimated in the aspect of the probability, the impact severity and uncontrollability. The important degree of each risk factor is obtained. By comparing the important degree of each factor, which risks will be controlled by some means are known. On the other hand, by applying entropy-weight coefficient, the risk degree of the whole network system is obtained, the method of entropy-weight coefficient is applied to objective computation, and subjective judgment is overcome. The study of the case shows that the method can be easily used to the risk assessment of the network security and its results conform to the actual situation

When a composite material is subjected to a time-harmonic stress field (homogeneous
or inhomogeneous), different phases undergo different temperature fluctuations due to the wellknown
thermoelastic effect. As a result irreversible heat conduction occurs within each phase and
between phases, and entropy is produced. This entropy production is the genesis of elastothermodynamic
damping, and manifests itself as a conversion of work into heat. This is one of
a large number of sources of damping in a real composite.
Mechanics-based analytical methods for predicting damping due to various relaxation mechanisms
have not been reported. Therefore, it becomes difficult to divide the total (experimentally
measured) damping into its various constituents. This defines the objective of the present work : we
present a methodology for predicting the elastothermodynamic damping of an N-layer laminated
composite. The stress field may be quite general so long as the resulting heat conduction occurs
only in the direction orthogonal to the laminae. By way of illustration, numerical results are
presented for a symmetric three-layer plate in biaxial bending. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

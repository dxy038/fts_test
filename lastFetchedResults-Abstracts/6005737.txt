The driving system of cutter head is the key part of shield machine, it is also a technological bottleneck in the design and production of tunneling shield currently in China. This paper combines reliability design and optimization design to produce a reliability optimization scheme of main driving gear transmission of shield machine. It uses Kriging model for approximation and Bayesian analysis algorithm for global design optimization. A mathematical model is established for the reliability optimization design. Design variables include the modulus, the tooth number of small gears, the face width and the helix angle; objective function contains the total volume of gears and the constraint conditions of reliability. Based on that, a mathematical model of the reliability optimization design of main driving gear transmission is constructed, and design parameters that satisfy the constraint conditions and minimize the total volume of gears are derived. The paper contributes to driving ChinaÂ´s self-production of main driving gear transmission of shield machine and the design enhancement.

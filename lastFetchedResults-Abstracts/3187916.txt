Recently, urban renewal projects are actively being pursued to reactive the depressed cities, restore the function of towns and develop the local economyin Korea. Most of urban renewal projects are mega projects and should be managed at the level of program which is integrated a lot of projects for coordination. For the reason, Korea government has developed i-PgMIS (intelligent Program Management Information System) focused on benefits, stakeholders, and governance for supporting decision-making and management of urban renewal mega projects over life-cycle about cost and schedule. Especially, since this system has to support the decision-making regarding the investment cost to various stakeholders through objective information, budget estimate in the earlier phase is critical. Until now, the methods such as CBR(Case Base Reasoning), MRA(Multiple Regression Analysis), and NN(Neural Network), have been introduced for estimating budget. However, there are three problems. Firstly, they strongly depend on the quality and the quantity of data accumulated from previous similar projects. Secondly, until now, it is not easy to deduct the budget estimate in the earlier phase of the project. Finally, in case of the stakeholder who is not an expert in construction, it is difficult to understand those methods. Thus, this paper presents an alternative method to estimate the budget based on BIM(Building Information Modeling) concept in i-PgMIS because BIM is not case-based budget estimation tool but consisted of a set of attribute to estimate budget. By applying the concept of BIM in the earlier phase, detail properties of buildings (e.g., purpose, area, height and materials) maintained in virtual model are specified. Then, the budget of urban renewal project is calculated based on the defined building models and the unit price database.

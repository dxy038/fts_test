The mission of the Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau International, is to improve the health of the world's people through nursing leadership and scholarship in practice, education, and research. When I say that, I receive many different responses. Some people seem impressed and inquire how we go about doing that. Others observe that it is an ambitious objective. Still others, I suspect, see it as an unattainable notion. This is why my organization wholeheartedly involves itself in the health of the community and uses its knowledge base to empower nurses to engage in public policy. These needs were uppermost on the minds of our founders and will continue far into the future as a modern-day priority of our board of directors.

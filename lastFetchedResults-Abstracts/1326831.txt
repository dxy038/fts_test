Efficient on-site data collection is important for ensuring timely information flow and successful project management. Although applying information technologies and electronic devices to reduce time-consuming manual paperwork has been valued, one previous study has indicated that asynchronous operations with unnecessary subprocesses still affect information production and transmission. Implementing synchronization-based processes is a solution to enhancing on-site data collection performance. However, these synchronized processes based on worker cooperation still have room to improve their efficiency. Continuous improvement is essential to satisfying this objective. This study thus develops a synchronous system integrated with wireless and speech technologies to enhance the cooperation between construction workers and application devices. System tests and efficiency evaluation in a material management case study demonstrate that this system increased productivity, reduced operation time and simplified subprocesses for activity completion. The synchronous system not only represents a novel application for on-site material management, but also provides a framework for applying wireless and speech technologies for similar on-site information management.

In this paper a novel optimization algorithm based on imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is used for the design of a low speed single sided linear induction motor (LIM). This type of motors is used increasingly in industrial process specially in transportation systems. In these applications having high efficiency with high power factor is very important. So in this paper the objective function of design is presented considering both efficiency and power factor. Finally the results of ICA are compared with the ones of genetic algorithm and conventional design. Comparison shows the success of ICA for design of LIMs.

The orbit accuracy of TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X radar satellites is in the range of centimeters. This information is useful to carry out high precision surveying from space. The objective of this study is the quality assessment of ground control points (GCPs) retrieved from TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X imagery. The focus is put on the optimized stereo constellation for the GCP retrieval procedure. GCPs are important inputs for precise orthorectification of other image sources. Depending on the input image parameters it is possible to retrieve GCPs with a 3D accuracy up to 1 m.

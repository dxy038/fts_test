Isolated microgrid power systems are prone to large frequency and voltage deviations, since they have limited generation and finite inertia and may include pulse power loads and large proportion of dynamic loads. Thus, they require effective power management methods to operate optimally, while satisfying operating and security constraints. In this paper, a novel integrated security-constrained model-based power management approach is proposed for isolated microgrids in all-electric ships during the normal/alert operating state. The new power management method was formulated as a multi-objective optimal control problem. A method based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II was developed to solve the problem. The developed integrated security-constrained power management approach was applied to a notional all-electric ship computer model. The simulation results, conducted in PSCAD, showed the effectiveness of the new power management method.

Metal vapor has a significant influence on dielectric recovery behaviors after interrupting a high vacuum arc. The objective of this paper is to study breakdowns in copper, chromium and copper-chromium vapors employing the PIC-MCC method. A 2d model with a given DC voltage is applied to study the breakdown processes in the metal vapor after vacuum arc extinctions taking into account thermal-field emission, secondary electron emission, plasma and neutral transport. The results confirm that the breakdown voltage decreased with the increase of the surface temperature. At the same surface temperature, the breakdown voltages for different metal vapors follow the trend of copper&gt; chromium &gt; copper-chromium.

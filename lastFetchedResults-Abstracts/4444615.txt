The objective of this work is to present a fast parallel incompressible Navier-Stokes code simulating blood flow in main arteries. Our method relies on the proper combination of three techniques that are the L<sub>2</sub> penalty method to deal with complex geometry, a level set method to compute the geometry, and a fast domain decomposition solver. Our long term goal is to provide a close to real time simulator that can used automatically MRI data in clinical conditions. This simulation will output main quantities of interest in hemodynamic for cardiovascular diseases such as the wall shear stress.

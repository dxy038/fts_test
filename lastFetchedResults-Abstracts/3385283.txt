The primary objective of this paper is the study of the design and development of the SXGA network and multimedia high-resolution large screen projector system specifically designed to hook to and operate from an intranet or Web connection. The main electronic components of this projector are three LCOS panels, a video decoder, a dual interface and a image processor with advanced video processing for the next generation front projector. The basic structure and issues in the implementation of the next generation networkable multimedia projector which displays computer images from VGA to SXGA and supports NTSCr PAL video sources with a 4:3 aspect ratio and 16:9 aspect ratio sources such as DVD or HDTV are discussed

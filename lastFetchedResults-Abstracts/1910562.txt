Objective
roduce a new classification scheme of juxtaglomerular cell tumor (JCT) of the kidney for differential diagnosis of hypertension and renal cell carcinoma.
s
ases of JCT have been diagnosed and treated surgically in our hospital during the last 4 years. Through a search in PubMed, we incorporated 7 large series of case reports of JCT into a review of 71 cases previously published in the literature. Clinical presentations (blood pressure), laboratory examinations [serum potassium, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALD), and renal venous sampling for renin assay], and imaging examinations [ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), excretory urography, and selective renal angiography] were summarized.
s
 cases of JCTs can be classified into 3 types, which are typical type, atypical type, and non-functioning type. The 57 typical cases had the typical characteristics of hypertension, hypokalemia, hyperaldosteronism, and high renin. The 12 atypical cases had hypertension with normal potassium levels, and the 2 non-functioning cases had normal blood pressure and normal potassium levels.
sions
assification of typical, atypical, and non-functioning JCTs depends on blood pressure and serum potassium. JCT of the kidney should be considered in patients with hypertension and renal tumor, and nephron-sparing surgery is the first choice.

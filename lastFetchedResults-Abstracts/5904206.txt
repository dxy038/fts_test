The unit commitment problem is to reduce the total generation cost as much as possible while satisfying future power demands. Therefore, optimization must be performed based on correct predictions of future demands. However, various uncertain factors affect these loads making an exact forecasting unsuccessful. This study mitigates this difficulty by applying fuzzy set theory and the objective is to build a two-stage multi-objective fuzzy programming model. to define the supply reliability effectively, we propose a new concept of maximal blackout time based on the fuzzy credibility theory. in addition, an improved two-layer multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed as the solution. Finally, the performance of this study is discussed in comparison with experimental results from several test systems.

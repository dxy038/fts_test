Robotic applications are complex, require hardware prototypes and thus are usually a costly endeavor. The research field of eRobotics has been established recently in order to help to cope with the inherent complexity, facilitate the development and significantly cut down the cost of advanced robotics and mechatronics development. The objective is to effectively use electronic media - hence the "e" at the beginning of the term - to achieve the best possible advancements in the development of the robots respective fields of use. The aim of developments in eRobotics is to provide a comprehensive software environment to address the robotics-related issues for the next generation robotic applications.

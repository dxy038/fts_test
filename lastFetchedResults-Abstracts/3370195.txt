The paper investigates the power control problem in a frequency-selective interference channel. A centralized power control algorithm is developed with the objective of maximizing the achievable rate region given an average power constraint for each user. The proposed algorithm is based on the multi-user discrete bit-loading algorithm that considers the power allocation over frequency and users simultaneously. Simulation results for very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) systems show that the proposed algorithm achieves a larger rate region than that achieved by a power control algorithm based on iterative waterfilling.

In view of the current problems of Waveguide structure designing by experiences of engineering project, this paper proposed a multi-objective fuzzy optimal strategy based on the research of Characteristic parameters of rectangular symmetrical double Ridge waveguide. It takes the cut-off wavelength (COW), single-mode bandwidth (SMB), attenuation factor (AF), power-handling capacity (PHC) and characteristic impedance (CI) as objectives to optimize the design of the waveguide by fuzzy optimization algorithm. As the experiments proved, the results have good integrated transmission characteristics. Numerical results provide design data for the application of rectangular symmetric double-ridge waveguide in microwave systems.

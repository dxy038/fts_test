The objective of this study was to examine the effects of hygrothermal aging on the durability of a graphite/epoxy woven composite material system. The study was part of a larger project in which the objective was to evaluate and model the effects of moisture, temperature, and combined hygrothermal conditions on the strength and life of a graphite/epoxy woven composite material system. The results presented here represent an extension of the work by Patel and Case (Int. J. Fatigue 22 (2000) 809).

The hygrothermal aging consisted of cyclical temperature and moisture variations which were meant to simulate mission conditions for an advanced subsonic aircraft. Durability studies were carried out on the aged material system in the form of fatigue and residual strength testing under humid and elevated temperature environments. Damage mechanisms and failure modes were determined through fatigue testing, residual strength testing, and nondestructive evaluation.

Changes in physical appearance, thermal analysis results, fracture surfaces, and moisture diffusion behavior all supported the idea that the material was affected by the aging process. However, experimental testing also showed that the initial and residual tensile properties of the aged material were virtually unaffected by the imposed environmental aging (as compared to unaged material testing results), except when tested at elevated temperature. At elevated temperature, both the dynamic stiffness and residual strength were noticeably reduced from that at room temperature.

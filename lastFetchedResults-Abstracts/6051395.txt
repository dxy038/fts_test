Flow line are one of the most commonly encountered layouts in manufacturing industries, where several product types (grades) are manufactured using a sequence of sub-systems or machinery with different tasks. With increasing prices of energy and specific customer demands employing effective product scheduling strategies has become essential for manufacturing industries to maintain their business viability. In this paper, a new product scheduling method is proposed for multi-machine, multi-product flow lines. The objective here is to control the production start time for each grade so that the product delivery time errors are minimised. It is also desired to minimise the overall makespan variability caused by non-Gaussian uncertainties formulated by the entropy of the delivery time errors. Therefore, the proposed product scheduling strategy is a nonlinear multi-objective optimisation problem with non-Gaussian uncertainties. To solve this problem, the nonlinear dynamic flow line model is converted to a linear dynamic equivalent using a (Max,+) algebraic approach. Then, a Proportional-Integral (PI) scheduling controller is used to control the production start time for each grade. The scheduling controller coefficients are tuned by a Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique and a comparison is made between MODE, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO).

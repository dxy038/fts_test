Conjugate addition of diamines to glycosyl olefinic esters 1a and 1b followed by reduction of resulting bis-glycosyl β-amino esters (2–7 and 14–19) with lithium aluminium hydride led to the respective glycosyl amino alcohols (8–13 and 20–25) in moderate to good yields. All the compounds were evaluated for antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv. Few of the compounds exhibited antitubercular activity with MIC as low as 6.25–3.12 μg/mL in virulent and avirulent strains. Compound 13 was found to be active against MDR strain and showed mild protection in mice.

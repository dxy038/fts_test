The convergence of the fuzzy ISODATA clustering algorithm was proved by Bezdek [3]. Two sets of conditions were derived and it was conjectured that they are necessary and sufficient for a local minimum point. In this paper, we address this conjecture and explore the properties of the underlying optimization problem. The notions of reduced objective function and improving and feasible directions are used to examine this conjecture. Finally, based on the derived properties of the problem, a new stopping criterion for the fuzzy ISODATA algorithm is proposed.

Analog circuits are regarded as grey system in this paper. The theory of grey system is used to diagnose the fault of analog circuits. Grey relational analysis is used to quantify the relevance between circuit and fault. Analog circuits can be diagnosed by grey relational degree. An example of fault diagnosis is provided in this paper. The result shows that fault diagnosis of analog circuits based on the theory of grey system has the advantages of simple algorithm, less consumption of samples, objective quantitative data. This method improves the accuracy and efficiency of fault diagnosis of analog circuits.

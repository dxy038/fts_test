This paper deals with the TV educational media production. The main objective is to simplify production process and increase productivity. A resource management methodology is proposed. The proposed system is mainly a database of scenes and scripts (procedures) that make the TV Educational Program Unit (TVEPU). The system needs two levels of preparation. The first, which is the primary effort, is done to initiate the scenes database. The second preparation is a continuous work, is done through the system operation, updating, and maintenance. The database initiation contains the analysis and breakdown of the available material to small ingredients that constitutes the starting molecule. This molecule will be used to prepare simple and short units (TV educational program units). By the time and use of the system, the database will enlarge. This will increase system productivity and modify production quality.

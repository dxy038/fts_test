We study reconfigurations of wavelength-routed Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM) networks in response to lightpath demand changes, with the
objective of servicing more lightpath demands without additional network resources
from a long-term network operation point of view. For the reconfiguration problem
under study, we assume WDM network operators are provided with lightpath
demands in batches. With limited network resources, our problem has two unique
challenges: balancing network resource allocations between current and future
lightpath demands, and modeling future lightpath demands. The first challenge
implies making tradeoffs between accepting as many current immediate lightpath
demands as possible and reserving a certain amount of network resources for near
future predicted lightpath demands. The second challenge implies modeling future
predicted lightpath demands, which are not exactly known or certain as the current
lightpath demands. Our proposed model allows a natural separation between the
operation of the optical layer and the user traffic layer (predominantly the IP-layer),
while supporting their interactions, for which we propose a new formulation for perlink
congestion control, associated with a mathematical solution procedure. Our
simulation results reveal that by properly controlling resource allocations in thecurrent session using our proposed mechanism, rejections in future sessions are
greatly reduced.

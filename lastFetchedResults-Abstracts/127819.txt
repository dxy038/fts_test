Introduction & Objective: Thalassemia major is the most sever identified hemolytic anemia and the most common single gene abnormality. This disease is very common in Iran and that is why there should be a careful investigation into it. Not treated properly, growth failure is one of the most important complications of this disease. This study was designed to evaluate the growth parameters in thalassemic children and to compare the obtained data with normal children.
Material & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study was carried out on 121 thalassemic patients who received blood transfusion therapy in Yasuj, with respect to the physical growth parameters such as height, weight, sitting height, and arm circumference. Collected data were compared with data from normal children (who were chosen from the same sex, age and socioeconomic groups).Result: According to statistical analysis, weight of 53.7% of thalassemics and 17.1% of non-thalassemics, for the same age group, was under 5 percentile (p<0.0001), These measurements for height and mid arm circumference were 66.9% v1s 17.1%, and 72.7% vls 32.5% under percentile respectively (p<0,0001). Conclusion: Considering the growth retardation of thalassemic patients, we recommend regular follow-up for confirming the blood transfusion and desferal injection with exact interval.

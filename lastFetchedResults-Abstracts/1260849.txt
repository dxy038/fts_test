 The objective of the study was to measure the subjective long-term effects of vocal therapy (more than 6 months) in 29 patients suffering from dysfunctional dysphonia. Four subjective measurements were used: one visual analog scale ranging from 0 (not efficient at all) to 100 (very efficient); one question â€œIs the speech therapy still efficient?,â€‌ answered by yes or no; the GRB parameters of the GRBAS scale (evaluated by the patient); and the VHI-10. The results show that 76% of the patients consider that the vocal therapy they received is still efficient. On the vocal quality (G), roughness (R), and breathiness (B) parameters, we observe a high degree of satisfaction on the G parameter (medianآ =آ 77). The scores on the R and B parameters are lower (median Rآ =آ 12, Sآ =آ 5). Roughness is significantly correlated to the Grade (Spearman coefficient rآ =آ 0.516, Pآ =آ 0.004), whereas breathiness is not (Pآ =آ 0.251, NS). The comparison of the results on the VHI-10 pre and post treatment shows a significant decrease in the grade of perceived handicap (medians 15 vs 11, Pآ =آ 0.017). The correlations between the judgment of the treatment's efficacy and the vocal quality is significant (rآ =آ 0.623, Pآ <آ 0.001) as well as the correlation between the VHI-10 and the length of the treatment (rآ =آ 0.416, Pآ =آ 0.035). The conclusion can be made that speech therapy plays an important role in long-term treatment of dysfunctional dysphonias.

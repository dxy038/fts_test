This paper develops a technique for separating the ground and vegetation components from polarimetric interferometric SAR measurements. The objective is to use this technique to remove the vegetation bias in interferometric measurements of elevation in forested terrain. Initial results indicate that the technique is able to compensate for the vegetation bias and provide improved estimates of the terrain elevation. However, further work is needed to estimate geophysical information about the vegetation canopy.

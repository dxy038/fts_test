Long-term urban water demand is uncertainty. The delivery capacity of urban water distribution system is required to be flexible to satisfy multiple possible water demand in the future. In each prediction phase, water demand can be regarded as a stochastic variable. Based on the uncertain demand prediction information, further consideration is how to effectively utilize the predicted demand conclusion to determine the delivery capability. A multi-objective optimization with multiple prediction phases is applied to minimize both the wasted investment due to overestimated delivery capacity, and supplementary investment due to underestimated delivery capacity. The flexible design can help decision maker to select a low cost long-term decision to deal with various water demands.

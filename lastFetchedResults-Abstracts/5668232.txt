The main reason of customer unavailability is the events occurring in distribution networks. Hence, one of the most important issues should be considered is improving reliability of distribution networks. Installation of switching devices like sectionalizers along the network, positively affects the system reliability, but, of course, it involves utility cost. The main aim of this paper is to determine optimal number and place of sectionalizers in distribution networks. By considering non-linear and non-differentiable nature of problem, using common methods to solve the problem is not possible. In this paper the optimization problem is solved by multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGAII to minimize installation cost of sectionalizers, simultaneously improving reliability indices, i.e. System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), Expected customer interruption cost (ECOST). Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a 50 feeder distribution network and simulation results are assessed.

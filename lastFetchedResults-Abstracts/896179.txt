Abstract
In this study, the effect of board characteristics as corporate governance
determinants on the firm debt maturity structure has been investigated. Therefore, the
main objective of this paper is to review the effect of board size, percentage of non
executive directors in the board and CEO/Chair duality as independent variables on debt
maturity structure as a dependent variable in Tehran Stock Exchange. To achieve the
objective, 8 year information (2002-2009) of 72 firms were analyzed. To hypotheses
testing, we have employed multivariate regression with panel data.
The research results imply that there is a positive significant relation between board
size and debt maturity structure. There is also a negative significant relation between
percentage of non executive directors and debt maturity structure. Additionally, it was
not found any relation between CEO/Chair duality and debt maturity structure. Research
findings represent the effect of strong board on financing decisions. Furthermore,
hypnoses testing among different industries indicate that about relation of the board size
and debt maturity structure in Drug and Automobile industries there are significant
positive relations and in Cement industry there exists a negative relation. In Cement
and Food Industries, percentage of non executive directors in the board has a significant
negative relation. The relation between CEO/Chair duality and debt maturity structure is
also negative in the level of Chemical, Drug and Food.

Directors CEO/Chair Duality.

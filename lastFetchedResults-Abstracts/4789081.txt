A multi-sensor, intelligent transportation system is presented as a reduced scale automated highway platform. The main objective of this development is to provide and expend advanced technological solutions in order to test, in real conditions, different embedded control strategies following an accurate and affordable multi-sensor instrumentation and a physical redundancy specification. This redundancy is introduced on purpose for safety reasons and to tackle the automatic reconfiguration in case of breakdowns. A four-vehicle platoon is designed then developed, and embedded fuzzy controllers introduced in order to deal with the grappling and/or the unhooking of the train of vehicles.

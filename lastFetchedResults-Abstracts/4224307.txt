A description is given of three integrated Fortran routines that calculate a comprehensive set of characterization parameters for any uniformly sampled discrete-time signal. The parameters and algorithms are based on IEEE Standard 194-1977, Pulse Terms and Definitions and IEEE Standard 181-1977, Pulse Measurement and Analysis by Objective Techniques. These subroutines are used extensively for trend analysis of the performance of digital data acquisition systems in the Nevada Test Site field instrumentation system. The algorithms are designed to be independent of pulse shape and polarity

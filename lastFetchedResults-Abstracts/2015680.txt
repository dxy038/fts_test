Objective: Diabetes Mellitus is one of the most common metabolic disorders which have several oral complications such as hypofunction of salivary glands. The aim of present study was to compare the unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) flow rate in diabetic type II patients and healthy peoples who admitted in Yazd Diabetic center.
Materials and Methods: In this analytic-observational study, 78 patients with diabetic type II and 74 healthy people were selected. At first the xerostomia was checked and then the UWS flow rate was measured by spitting method. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Chi-square and Multiple way variance tests using SPSS software version 11.
Results: the participants were between 30-69 years old including 103 female (diabetic (53), healthy (50)) and 49 male (diabetic (25), healthy (24)) were selected. The mean of UWS flow rate in diabetic patients was (0.07±0.03 ml/min) which was statistically less than healthy people (0.13±0.036 ml/min) (P <  0.002).The mean of UWS flow rate in relation to age was significantly different and adverse relationship between UWS flow rate and FBS was found in diabetic type 2 patients (P < 0.000, r=-0.389). Also diabetic patients complain about xerstomia more than healthy people significantly (83% versus 28.4%, P <  0.001).
Conclusion: The complaint of xerstomia and decrease of UWS flow rate was more common in diabetic patients than healthy people; also good FBS control can prevent xerostomia.

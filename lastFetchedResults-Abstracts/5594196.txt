This paper proposes a new environmental friendly evaluation criterion to assess the comprehensive performance of coal-fired power plant. The new evaluation criterion, which is called the comprehensive Index of Energy, Resources and Environment (I<sub>ERE</sub>), can synthetically evaluate the thermal, economical and environmental performance of power plants. Based on the new criterion, the paper analyzes the comprehensive performances of four typical 600MW coal fired power plants, discloses the relation regulation between power plant comprehensive performance criterion I<sub>ERE</sub> and key independent design variables, and analyzes the main factors influencing the comprehensive performance of power plant. These achievements will provide a new idea and criterion for multi-objective comprehensive evaluation and design parameters optimization of coal-fired power plants.

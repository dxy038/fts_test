The objective of this article is to bring the benefits of NEC´s experience to a number of telecom operators who are on the verge of either planning or implementing wireless local loop (WLL) based telephone access networks.

A number of challenges and issues have been encountered by the NEC and their partners during the initial phase of implementation of the WLL networks

Motor evoked potential (MEP) signals serve as an objective measure of the functional integrity of motor pathways in the spinal cord. Hence, they provide a reliable assessment of the extent of spinal cord injury (SCI). There are two methods currently being used for serial MEP recordings in rats: a low-frequency and a high-frequency method. In this paper, we compared the two methods and determined the better method for MEP recordings. We also compared the effect of two anesthetic agents- inhalational isoflurane and intraperitoneal ketamine - on the MEP signals. We found that under ketamine anesthesia, low-frequency stimulation led to more consistent results, while high-frequency stimulation required greater stimulation intensity and was prone to unwanted side-effects including excessive head twitches. We further found that isoflurane anesthesia severely depressed the MEP response for both low-frequency and high-frequency stimulation which rendered the resulting signal unusable.

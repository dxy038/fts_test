This paper propose a new motion control algorithms for an intelligent robotic walker that emulate ambulatory device function such as cane, wheeled walker, and standard walker. Usually, the objective in designing robotic walker is to replaced conventional wheeled walker and introduce new high level functions such as guidance, health monitoring, and others. We extend the objective of a robotic walker in different direction and propose a new motion control algorithms in replacing other ambulatory device such as cane and standard walker. In this study, we consider the motion control algorithm for wheeled walker, cane, and standard walker based on imposed apparent dynamics to the robotic walker. In cane function emulation, one hand control is considered. This method of controlling a robotic walker leads to some unintentional applied force/torque and makes the system uncontrollable. With that, we propose to change the kinematic structure of the robotic walker to make the system controllable. In standard walker function emulation, supported weight will be monitored and used to make the system in halt mode during weight transfer. The motion control algorithms were experimentally implemented and the results show its validity.


Introduction: The basic objective of this study is to investigate the effects of alpha and theta
brain waves amplitude increase in occipital area on reducing the severity of symptoms of
generalized anxiety disorder and to increase the global functioning level in patients with GAD. Methods: This study is a quasi-experimental study with pre-test and post-test with two groups.
For this purpose, 28 patients who had been referred to Sohrawardi psychiatric and clinical
psychology center in Zanjan were studied based on the interview with the psychiatrist, clinical
psychologist and using clinical diagnostic criteria for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders text revision - the DSM-IV-TR Fourth Edition diagnosis of GAD, 14 subjects
were studied in neurofeedback treatment group and 14 subjects in the waiting list group. Patients
in both groups were evaluated at pre-test and post-test with General Anxiety Disorder Scale
(GAD-7) and Global Assessment Functioning Scale (GAFs). The treatment group received
fifteen 30-minute alpha training sessions and fifteen 30-minute theta brain training sessions
in occipital area by neurofeedback training (treatment group). This evaluation was performed
according to the treatment protocol to increase the alpha and theta waves. And no intervention
was done in the waiting list group. But due to ethical issues after the completion of the study all
the subjects in the waiting list group were treated. Results: The results showed that increase of alpha and theta brain waves amplitude in occipital
area in people with GAD can increase the global functioning level and can reduce symptoms
of generalized anxiety disorder in a treatment group, but no such change was observed in the
waiting list group. Discussion: Increase of alpha and theta brain waves amplitude in occipital area can be useful in
the treatment of people with GAD.

In this work, N-methylene phosphonic chitosan (NMPC) based hydrogels and electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds are reported with objective to obtain osteoconductive and osteoinductive matrixes for bone grafting applications. NMPC, a phosphorylated derivative of chitosan, is known to mimic the function of non collagenous phosphoproteins in providing nucleation sites for biomineralization. NMPC hydrogels were prepared by crosslinking between NMPC and genipin. A detailed investigation of physicochemical properties of NMPC solutions is also carried out in order to obtain beads free nanofibers. Both NMPC gels and nanofibers were further evaluated for their biomineralization potential and biocompatibility with human osteoblast like cells. Results indicated that hydrogels and nanofibrous scaffolds NMPC are biocompatible and significantly osteoinductive compared to tissue culture plate controls. However, cells seeded on nanofibrous scaffolds exhibited greater proliferation measured by MTT assay, and higher expression of early markers for osteogenic differentiation proving the superior applicability of nanofibrous scaffolds for bone grafting applications.

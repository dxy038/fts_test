This paperÂ´s objective is to investigate and compare classification performances for different methods (Radial Basis Function networks, Support Vector Machines neural networks, Nai&#776;ve Bayes and Decision Trees). The purpose of this comparison is to choose the best solution in terms of performance/computation to be included in an integrated framework for semantic image analysis that is suitable for content-based image retrieval by combining classical descriptors with classification algorithms.

The quality analysis of pathological voice is not only a kind of objective evaluation for the human voice, but also an objective evidence for the application of voice disease diagnosis and the judgment of therapy. In this paper, the pathological voice quality analysis system is composed of five parts, which are voice recording, voice signal processing, and extraction of voice characteristic parameters, choice of these features and evaluation of voice quality. Firstly, this paper gives a brief introduction to the pathological voice quality analysisÂ´s background and purpose. Besides, it also details some methods of voice signal processing. For detection of voice period, vague fundamental frequency of voice is extracted firstly by using Fourier transform, and then the accurate detection of the voice period through EGG and wavelet transformation is performed. This method of period detection is highly accurate and practicable. Based on the period of voice, many features of voice such as the fundamental frequency, frequency perturbation, and amplitude perturbation can be extracted. This database is built by collecting healthy and pathological voice samples from Shengjing Hospital and related references. After analyzing the collected voice signals, the result shows that the pathological voice quality analysis system has the well evaluation performance in the practical application. These evaluation results reflect the quality of voice signal and can be used to assistant judge the treatment of voice disease and the recovery condition of treatment.

The objective of this prospective cohort study was to describe real-life use of lipid-lowering drugs and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target-attainment rates 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). LDL-C was recorded at hospital admission for AMI and at follow-up at 2 and 12 months after AMI in 17,236 patients in the Swedish heart registry, SWEDEHEART, from 2004 through 2009. Lipid-lowering treatments were identified using the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. More than 90% of patients received statins after AMI. Simvastatin ≤40 mg was used by 80% of patients at discharge and at 2 months and 68% at 1 year after AMI. Intensive statin therapy (LDL-C-lowering capacity &gt;40%) was prescribed for 8.4%, 11.9%, and 12.2% at these time points, and combinations of statin/ezetimibe for 1.1%, 2.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. The LDL-C target of &lt;2.5 mmol/L (97 mg/dl) was achieved in 74.5% of patients at 2 months and 72.3% at 12 months after AMI. Treatment was intensified for only 21.3% of patients with LDL-C above target at 2 months. In multivariate analysis, higher LDL-C levels at admission and at 2 months correlated to increased risk for under treatment at 12 months after AMI. In conclusion, statin treatment after AMI in Sweden has become standard, but titration to reach recommended LDL-C levels is still suboptimal. Strategies to further improve implementation of guidelines are needed.

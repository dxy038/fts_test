Dynamic thermal management (DTM) is commonly used to ensure reliable and safe operation in modern computing systems. DTM techniques are based on slowing down or shutting down parts of a system; hence, they effectively reduce system performance and thereby adversely impact applications. In this paper, we focus on real-time applications in which degradation in performance translates to a loss in application quality, and address the problem of quality-optimized DTM, wherein the objective of DTM is to satisfy specified temperature constraints while optimizing application quality metrics. We first introduce a new DTM method called dynamic work scaling (DWS), which is based on modulating an application´s computational requirements. Next, we observe that application quality and platform temperature are effectively determined by two key parameters, viz., the application´s computational requirement and the platform´s computing capacity, and formulate the relationship between them. Finally, we propose a quality-optimized DTM based on joint dynamic work and voltage/frequency scaling (DWVFS). We have implemented the proposed DTM technique and evaluated it for two applications: 1) H.264 video encoding and 2) turbo decoding. Our results demonstrate that DWVFS can provide superior results in terms of application quality compared with both DVFS and DWS-based DTM at identical temperature constraints.

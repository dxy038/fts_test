Study the electromagnetic behavior of the grounding system is still relevant. The main studies are devoted to transient variation of the impedance as well as its electromagnetic radiation. In modeling this problem, the main difficulty is posed by the non-homogeneous soil whose resistivity varies according to climatic conditions, in the time and with depth. The work we propose in this paper treats the case of grounding buried in soil at two horizontal layers. In this case we compare the different approaches (antenna theory, direct resolution of the Maxwell equations and line theory) used to model a ground excited by a lightning discharge. Our objective is to assist the electrical engineer in the appropriate choice of a model that allows a parametric study without loss of accuracy, simplified implementation and not heavy theoretical and especially realized with very low computation time.

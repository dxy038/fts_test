Heavy metals (HMs) such as lead (Pb) enter the soil through various pathways and affect soil quality. HMs decline population, activity, and efficiency of soil microorganisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil Pb contamination on population, activity and functionality of microbes in a sterilized soil inoculated with species of Glomus fungi including G. intraradices, G. mosseae and G. fasciculatum and species of Pseudomonads bacteria including P. putida, P. fluorescens, and P. aeruginosa. Various concentrations of Pb (0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg Pb kg-1 soil) were uniformly added to the sterilized soil and after soil inoculation with the microbes Centaurea (Centaurea cyanus) was grown. This study was carried out under greenhouse condition as a randomized complete block design and in three replications. Results showed that soil bacterial population, root colonization, root dry weight substrate induced respiration and microbial carbon biomass decreased significantly (P?0.05) as soil Pb concentration increased. Metabolic quotient (qCO2) increased by increasing the soil Pb concentration for both the microbial treatments. However, this increase was higher in the bacterial treatment compared to fungal treatment. Results indicated higher effect of Pb contamination on the bacteria and the fungi were more tolerant. Therefore, soil Pb contamination with decreasing the growth of plant and declining of population, activity and functionality of soil microbes results in degradation of soil biological quality.

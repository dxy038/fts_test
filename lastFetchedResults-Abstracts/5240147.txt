An investigation of a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) incorporating the high-order nonlinearity is presented. The improvement of the memory storage capacity and the error-correcting capability of the high-order bidirectional associative memory (HOBAM) is discussed. The application of a frequency classifier is presented, and the performance of HOBAM and BAM are compared. The HOBAM is superior to the BAM in classifying cluttered signals. The application of image classification is reported. The parallel processing of HOBAM on an Allian/FX80 for frequency classification and on a dynamically reconfigurable multiprocessor system for image recognition is discussed

With the rapid development of China railway informatization, information source, composition and volume get a explosive increase. Aiming at massive information integration and access of China railway information system, paper has proposed a smart information integration service mode to provide the objective correlative and effective multi-source information based on Autonomous Decentralized System(ADS) theory. Paper analyzed railway information properties, finished level design of information flexibility descending field based on information flexibility and hierarchy, defined service mapping and access mechanism, designed autonomous service algorithm to complete autonomous service implementation based on context code. the experiments demonstrates that the proposed integration model can get a better system properties.

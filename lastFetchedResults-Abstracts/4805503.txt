This paper proposes an analytical model useful in the design of conveyor-based automated material handling systems (AMHS) to support semiconductor manufacturing. The objective is to correctly estimate the work-in-process on the conveyor and assess the system stability. The analysis approach is based on a queuing model, but takes into account details of the operation of the AMHS including turntables. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate and validate the queuing model over a wide range of operating scenarios. The results indicated that the analytical model estimates the expected work-in-process on the conveyor with reasonable accuracy.

The distribution network fault recovery described, made light of the actual distribution network recovery objective function, the analysis of genetic algorithms and ant colony algorithm based on the combination of genetic algorithms and ant colony count of the respective merits of proposed A genetic algorithm into the new strategy of ant colony algorithm using the genetic algorithm has stronger global search ability, look for a group of large-scale solution, and then as a basis, using ant colony algorithm is fast to find the optimal solution is constructed based on genetic algorithm hybrid ant colony algorithm. Case analysis shows that the algorithm has fast convergence speed and a strong prime global search capabilities,to avoid premature convergence, effectively improving the power supply to restore the speed and accuracy.

A general approach to solving a wide class of optimization problems with fuzzy coefficients in objective functions and constraints is described. It is based on a modification of traditional mathematical programming methods and consists in formulating and solving one and the same problem within the framework of interrelated models with constructing equivalent analogs with fuzzy coefficients in objective function alone. This approach allows one to maximally cut off dominated alternatives from below as well as from above. The subsequent contraction of the decision uncertainty region is associated with reduction of the problem to multicriteria decision making in a fuzzy environment. The approach is applied within the context of fuzzy discrete optimization models, that is based on a modification of discrete optimization algorithms. The results of the paper are of a universal character and are already being used to solve problems of the design and control of power systems and subsystems.

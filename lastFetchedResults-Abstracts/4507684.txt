Most of current existing writing tools are developed by native speakers of English (L1). Some of these writing tools may not be suitable for non-native writers (L2) who used English as a second language (L2). The writing styles of L2 writers are different from the writing styles of L1 writers. One of the main problems faced by L2 writers were generating ideas while writing. They tended to generate ideas in L1 and later translated into English as L2. They also lack in vocabulary which make the problem further. People with limited vocabularies are often forced to use the relatively few words they know without knowing their precise meaning. The objective of this paper is to discuss an approach to develop a computer-assisted writing tool for L2 writers. The vocabulary used in business letters will be investigated based on the part of letter, genre analysis and effective sentences and words for business letters. The collection of sentences and words based on these three aspects will be used to develop an electronic dictionary and develop rules to check the sentences and provide suggestive example sentences. Some techniques will be used in order to automatically detect and correct sentences.

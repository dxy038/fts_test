Objective: To reexamine literature and data on the effects of gene mutation on central precocious puberty (CPP) via a meta-analysis. Methods: Consultation of search engines Chinese Bio-medicine Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Pubmed and Medline search resulted in a total of six studies containing more than 1600 individuals from various ethnic backgrounds. To evaluate the risk of CPP odds ratios (OR) for all case-control studies were calculated. Results: In this meta-analysis no significant association of the gene mutation with CPP in the combined case-control sample with mixed ethnic background (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 0.65-4.93, P = 0.26) was found. Conclusion: This study found no evidence of gene mutation being an independent risk factor of CPP. Further studies are needed further understand the effects of the interactions between this gene and other genetic and/or environment factors on CPP.

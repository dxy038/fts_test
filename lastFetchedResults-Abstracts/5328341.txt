The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the unique features of jitter-free response and bilateral conduction of photoconductive switches made from a polycrystalline thin layer of CdSSe material as a high-voltage device optically modulated by high-power illuminators to produce a high voltage very-low-frequency (VLF) sinusoidal waveform. The experimental results show that the sinusoidal waveform can be generated with peak-to-peak voltages up to 80 kV at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Theoretical simulation for the switch in the analogue application is also presented

In this paper, soft switching bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed. The proposed topology is consisted of two auxiliary switch, two resonant capacitors and one resonant inductor compared to conventional bidirectional DC-DC converter. Through employing ZVS(Zero Voltage Switching) and ZCS(Zero Current Switching) methods, switching loss occurs from each power switch is able to be reduced. We have performed mode analysis, simulation and experiment in order to analyze the proposed topology.

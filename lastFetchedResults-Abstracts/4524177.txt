As the engineering and technology management (ETM) field continues to grow, Portland State UniversityÂ´s Department of Engineering and Technology Management is conducting a world-wide research study on education and research in this field. It is a follow-up to previous studies in 1977, 1981, and 1984, 1990 and 1994. The objective is to develop a resource guide for ETM by analyzing growth patterns in ETM education, and determining the characteristics and strategic directions of the educational and research components of the field. Approximately 3500 individuals have been contacted in more than 1200 academic institutions, and responses have been received from 148 academic institutions up to now. An additional 121 ETM programs have also been identified, but their responses have not been received yet. This paper presents a summary of the findings of the study.

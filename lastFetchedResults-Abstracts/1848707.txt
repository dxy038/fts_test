Diffusion tensor imaging requires correction of eddy current distortion in diffusion-weighted images. An effective retrospective correction approach is to transform a diffusion-weighted image to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the transformed diffusion-weighted image and the corresponding T2-weighted image. In the literature, either linear interpolation or partial volume interpolation is applied to estimate the MI objective function. However, these interpolation methods induce artifacts to the MI objective function, thus compromising correction results. In this work, the MI objective function is estimated based on interpolation using Fourier shift theorem. This method eliminates the artifacts incurred with the aforementioned interpolation methods. The algorithm is further improved by approximating pixel values using their nearest neighbors in the up-sampled spatial domain, resulting in dramatically increased computational efficiency without compromising the correction results. The effects of varying the number of quantization levels and using Parzen window filtering to smooth the MI objective function are also investigated to obtain optimized algorithm parameters. The diffusion tensor image quality after applying the proposed distortion correction method is significantly improved visually.

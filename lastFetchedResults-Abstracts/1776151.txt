During recent decades, research on quality of life has gained increasing interest. In gerontology, the assessment of objective as well as subjective dimensions is recommendable, and the most innovative research will involve the study of the interrelationships of several components. In empirical research objective environmental factors have rarely been explored. The aim of this study was to explore the interrelationships among subjective well-being, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), and objective housing accessibility in the elderly population in ordinary housing. A random sample of 133 subjects aged 75â€“84 was multi-dimensionally assessed. The Gothenburg Quality of Life Instrument, a revised version of the ADL Staircase and the Enabler were administered at home-visits. Most of the subjects rated their general well-being as high. One-third were independent in ADL, and 1/5 did not have any objective housing accessibility problems. Different aspects of physical well-being covaried significantly with ADL dependence, but even more strongly with objective housing accessibility. Theoretically, the results relate to the Lawton model of `The Good Life'. In conclusion, inaccessible housing represents a potential health problem, since it threatens the independence and subjective well-being of elderly people. The results presented in this study provided increased knowledge of importance for geriatric rehabilitation and society planning to meet the needs of senior citizens.

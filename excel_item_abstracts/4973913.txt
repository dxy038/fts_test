Data compression techniques are used to optimize time and space while sending and retrieving data. In information retrieval, data compression techniques are used by Search engines to reduce the size of their indexes which will result in optimizing the speed and performance of retrieving relevant information. The goal of this research project is to propose some enhancements on search engines indexing using Bigram index term coding. Evaluation of the improvements on search-engine performance resulting from encoding the terms of its index is also conducted. Our experiments showed a good reduction in the size of index terms which contributes to the overall index size. It also showed a significant reduction of the number of comparisons made to process the user queries as a result of reducing the number of symbols representing each index term.

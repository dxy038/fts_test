Interfaces, as the reactive medium of integrate units, transfer information, exchange materials, conduct energy and shape order. Man, machine and organization, 3 factors of organizational systems integration, their composition varied with different systems. Thus, man-man, man-machine, man-organization, machine-organization, organization-organization, 5 interfaces appeared. Since differences between nature, characteristic and objective of integrated units and systems, the mechanism how interfaces come into being diversify. The paper, by analyzing those interfaces features and functions, discusses determinants that influenced the formation of interfaces.

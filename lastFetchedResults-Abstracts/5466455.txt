In order to remedy defects of the current network security evaluation systems, a novel evaluation algorithm, called quantitative network security situation evaluation based on the classification of attacks, is presented. Using this method, the traditional risk assessment is combined with network environment factors such as the network running status, asset security characteristic etc., and several quantitative indexes are extracted based on the analysis of factors which can affect the LAN´s security situation. Then, evaluations are done based on the classification of attacks. Experiment results show that the novel method can provide situation information which is more objective and detailed so the security administrator can understand the LAN´s security situation more clearly.

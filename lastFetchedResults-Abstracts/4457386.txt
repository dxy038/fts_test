The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of multiple UWB devices emission on the IEEE 802.11a WLAN receiver. The data rates and SINR of WLAN is evaluated with and without the UWB interference. Approximate path loss model is used to calculate the UWB signal power that interferes with the WLAN system. The three dimensional hemispherical distribution of UWB tramsmitters around the victim WLAN receiver is considered. Based on this model, the analytical analysis to assess the effect of the multiple UWB devices emission on the IEEE 802.11a system is presented.

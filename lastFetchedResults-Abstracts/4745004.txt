The objective of this paper is to propose a progressive smooth transition (PST) control strategy for the four-switch buck-boost converter (FSBBC) that is used for photovoltaic (PV) applications. The proposed PST control strategy can maintain the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) feature during the mode-change transition of the FSBBC and increase the output power of the PV system. Computer simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed PST strategy.

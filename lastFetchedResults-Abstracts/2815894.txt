Bidirectional Reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) archetype database[1] briefly summarize reflectance anisotropy into six BRDF archetypes. To evaluate the representation of BRDF archetypes from reflectance anisotropy, the shapes of BRDF archetypes are compared with according MODIS product; then the albedos and the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) retrieved from BRDF archetypes are compared with MODIS retrievals, Comparisons show that the shapes of BRDF archetypes agree well with the according MODIS BRDF, and the albedos and RMSEs of BRDF archetype retrieval are close to MODIS product. These archetypes can represent the characteristics of reflectance anisotropy in the retrieval of albedo.

Nowadays multi-terminal voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) system stands as an interesting solution to efficiently connect a number of offshore wind farms. But the VSC based HVDC system is more vulnerable to DC line faults due to the high discharge current from the DC link capacitance. In view of this, a superconducting fault current limiter (SCFCL) is a possible device which can mitigate the consequences of DC line faults effectively. The main objective of this paper is to improve the dynamic performance of an offshore wind farm connected multi-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system by incorporating SCFCL under various perturbations. Here, the MTDC system along with the SCFCL is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink and the results are presented for various AC/DC fault conditions.

A new design method for superconducting magnets with a strong, homogeneous magnetic field at their center and a small stray field area outside the magnets has been developed. The method can design magnets with noncircular racetrack coils and field correction iron pieces. The simulated annealing method is adopted to optimize the arrangement of the coils. The minimized objective function is a combination of penalty terms, which are thickness of field correction iron pieces and constraints. The design method was used to prepare some trial designs for wide bore magnets with noncircular shaped coils. It was found that even with such noncircular coils, a homogeneous magnetic field is possible.

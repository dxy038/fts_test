The traditional optimizing control method is mainly based on the single control objective optimization, which is not enough for the overall coordinated control system of power plant. So this paper proposes a multi-objective optimizing control method, including two optimization procedures. Firstly, to formulate the multiple control and optimization objective of the overall boiler-turbine system, then to obtain its optimal solution by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm, that is, the optimal trajectory reference values of power plant. Secondly, with these optimizing references, we set up the resulting constrained predictive control system based on fuzzy gain scheduling and the global fuzzy model of thermal processes. It can ensure the global optimization ability of close-loop control system. Finally, the multi-objective optimizing control strategy is applied in the MIMO boiler-turbine coordinated control system. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method even under wide load demand changes. More than with the satisfaction of multi-objective requirements, the resulting control system can also maintain satisfactory load-tracking performance and other control aim.

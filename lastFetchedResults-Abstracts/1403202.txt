Aims: For centuries, herbs have been used to avoid diseases. Peptic ulcer is a disease of any part of the stomach or intestines that exposed to acid and activated pepsin. The objective of the present research was to study the effect of Ziziphora clinopodioides aqueous extract  on peptic ulcer due to acetic acid in rats.
Methods: In this experimental study, 60 Wistar rats weighing approximately 200-250g were randomly divided into 4 groups; negative control, positive control, experiment 1 and experiment 2. Initially, rats were operated to give peptic ulcers by acetic acid. A day after stomach ulcer, the experimental groups received Ziziphora clinopodioides aqueous extract for 14 consecutive days and positive control received normal saline. Negative control animals received no substance. Wound healing and fibroblasts, neutrophils and macrophages per unit area were calculated after 14 days. Data was collected using the SPSS 17 software and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and LSD tests. 
Results: Wound healing in the experimental group compared to the negative control and positive control groups was significantly increased (p < 0.05). By passing time, the number of neutrophils and macrophages were increased in experimental groups and the number of fibroblasts was reduced. 
Conclusion: Ziziphora clinopodioides extract is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer induced by acetic acid.

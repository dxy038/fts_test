An unprecedented 42 dB loss budget is realised, for the first time, by using a hybrid DWDM-CDM (code division multiplexing)-PON without an optical amplifier. 16lambda-DWDM-CDM-PON bidirectional transmission over 100 km was experimentally demonstrated. Long-reach PON is expected to reduce capex and opex costs for service providers

A significant challenge in all-IP multi-service networks is to balance the goal of providing high-quality services to the end-users with the desire to maximize the number of end-users that can be simultaneously served. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by using the Quality-Oriented Adaptation Scheme (QOAS) for delivering multimedia streams. This adaptive mechanism uses feedback from clients regarding the quality of delivery to assist the server in making dynamic adjustments to the transmitted streams. Experimental objective and subjective test results illustrate the significant performance improvements achieved by QOAS, both in terms of number of simultaneous viewers served and of end-user perceived quality.

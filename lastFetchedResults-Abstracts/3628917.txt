The objective of this paper is to bring forth the benefits that can be realized by using LSI microprocessors in test equipment and instrument applications. We will attempt to do this by describing the Qualifier* 901, which is a low-cost bench top digital integrated circuit tester controlled by an LSI microprocessor. First, we identify the scope of low-cost testers and describe the general principles of operation of such testers using fixed logic control. Then we describe the Qualifier 901, and finally, we point out the advantages gained by the usage of the intelligence of the microprocessor in Qualifier 901 versus fixed logic controlled testers.

AbstractObjectives
ess the significance of circulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) as predictors of disease progression in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) receiving sunitinib.
als and methods
ating levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in sera from 52 patients with mRCC treated with sunitinib were measured at the baseline and on the first day of each treatment cycle until progression using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
s
seline level of MMP-9 in nonresponders to sunitinib was significantly higher than that in responders, whereas the baseline level of TIMP-2 in nonresponders was significantly lower than that in responders. However, there were no significant differences in the serum levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 between responders and nonresponders. The serum MMP-9/TIMP-2 ratio at the baseline in nonresponders was also significantly higher than that in responders. Univariate analysis showed that the MMP-9/TIMP-2 ratio, but not MMP-9 and TIMP-2 levels, was significantly correlated with progression-free survival, and the MMP-9/TIMP-2 ratio, in addition to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center classification and C-reactive protein level, appeared to be independently associated with progression-free survival on multivariate analysis. Furthermore, despite the lack of significant differences in the serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-2 between the baseline and the time of progression, the MMP-9/TIMP-2 ratio at the time of progression was significantly elevated compared with the baseline ratio.
sions
alance between the serum MMP-9 and TIMP-2 levels could be a novel biomarker to predict disease progression in patients with mRCC under treatment with sunitinib.

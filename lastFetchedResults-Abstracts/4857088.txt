In todayÂ´s semiconductor market, manufacturers continually seek ways to improve their performance and effectiveness. One area where they can remain competitive with the industry is with holiday production. During major holidays, many factors play a role in ensuring that the effect on revenue of a fabricator shutdown is kept to a minimum. To achieve this objective, a semiconductor manufacturer must effectively manage the facilities work which cannot be efficiently done at other times, equipment and tool work, the logistical positioning of product, as well as staffing and security. Total management of these activities is needed to ensure that the fabricator line returns to full operation after the holiday and can meet customer commitments. It is also the responsibility of the fabricator to improve on the procedures applied during holiday periods so that the time it takes to return to production can be minimized, thereby generating more revenue for the business unit. This paper discusses the business processes applied in the IBM Microelectronics Division 200 mm fabricator at Essex Junction, Vermont, during the 1995 Christmas and New Year holidays, as well as the planning that went into this activity and the improvements that resulted

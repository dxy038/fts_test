A rapid protocol for the multicomponent microwave-assisted organocatalytic domino Knoevenagel/hetero Dielsâ€“Alder reaction (DKHDA) has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3-dihydropyran[2,3-c]pyrazoles. The reported procedure could be used for the fast generation of novel substituted 2,3-dihydropyran[2,3-c]pyrazoles with potential anti-tuberculosis activity.

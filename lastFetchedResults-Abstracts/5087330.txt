In this paper, a novel Smart Energy Management System (SMES) architecture is proposed to solve the multi-objective dispatch of distributed generation problem in a Micro-Grid with different technologies and new concepts such as demand response action. The multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a constrained mixed integer nonlinear problem in which a set of Pareto optimal solutions will be obtained through the simultaneous optimization of operating cost and the net emission inside the Micro-Grid. The findings indicate that the optimal dispatch of units together with incorporating demand side bidding actions can reduce energy prices for the consumers or increased revenues for the aggregators.

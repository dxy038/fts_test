We explore a number of polymer architectures with the objective of fabricating intrinsically polar polymer films for applications such as electro-optic switches and signal modulators for high bandwidth data processing. The goal of this work is to offer an alternative to the poled polymer approach in order to avoid high temperature processing and high electric fields. This paper reports progress toward achieving this goal.

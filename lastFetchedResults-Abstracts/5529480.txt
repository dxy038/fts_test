This paper arose from a research project conducted to develop an interactive multimedia package for fostering the cultivation of moral sentiments using traditional Malay oral narratives called CITRA, which is presented and described herein. This project was carried out taking advantage of new and emerging information technologies. CITRA, which uses the CD-ROM and computer as the means of dissemination, is a didactic tool that comprises of four strictly interrelated learning modules: (i) storytelling world module, (ii) enjoyable reading world module, (iii) word enrichment corner, and (iv) mind test land module that consists of moral values appreciation test and application test, which focus on the presentation and evaluation of moral knowledge. The design and development of CITRA was made using the experience from other interactive multimedia applications, as well as referred to education and Malay literature specialists. The principle objective of this project is to create a didactic tool that uses different communications mediums within a single computer program, which allows the positive images of stories to be projected and can foster good moral sense in children. The paper also discusses the findings of the research, which indicates that the use of CITRA is significantly more effective as compared to the use of conventional instruction method in projecting positive values and images of narratives for assisting in moral education teaching learning.

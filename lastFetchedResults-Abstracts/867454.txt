Traditionally, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) is modeled as a static and deterministic problem and is solved with the objective of makespan minimization. However, many uncertainties, such as unpredictable increases in processing times caused by rework or supplier delays, random transportation and/or setup, may render the proposed solution obsolete. In this paper, we present a two-stage algorithm for robust resource-constrained project scheduling. The first stage of the algorithm solves the RCPSP for minimizing the makespan only using a priority-rule-based heuristic, namely an enhanced multi-pass random-biased serial schedule generation scheme. The problem is then similarly solved for maximizing the schedule robustness while considering the makespan obtained in the first stage as an acceptance threshold. Selection of the best schedule in this phase is based on one out of 12 alternative robustness predictive indicators formulated for the maximization purpose. Extensive simulation testing of the generated schedules provides strong evidence of the benefits of considering robustness of the schedules in addition to their makespans. For illustration purposes, for 10 problems from the well-known standard set J30, both robust and non-robust schedules are executed with a 10% duration increase that is applied to the same randomly picked 20% of the project activities. Over 1000 iterations per instance problem, the robust schedules display a shorter makespan in 55% of the times while the non-robust schedules are shown to be the best performing ones in only 6% of the times.

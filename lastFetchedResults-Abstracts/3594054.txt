We present a brief review of those aspects of seismic data gathering which have a bearing on seismic data processing and interpretation. A summary of sources, detectors, and other instruments is given. Noises that interfere with seismic reflection data are described. The most troublesome noises are source-generated coherent noises and much of the data gathering effort is directed towards attenuating them. The main methods of attenuating coherent noise involve the geometry of the source and receiver layout and the use of source and receiver arrays. Incoherent noise can be attenuated by increasing the multiplicity of the data. Proper choice of field parameters requires a knowledge of the exploration objective, noise characteristics, and data processing requirements. Field parameter design is discussed on that basis.

The objective of overlay routing is to minimize the latency of overlay users, while the objective of traffic engineering is to minimize the maximum link utilization of overall network. Thus, there exists the interaction between overlay routing and traffic engineering in the multi-layer network topology, which may lead to endless routing oscillations and performance degradation in the network. In order to solve the oscillation problem, we propose an alternative-offers bargaining model to investigate the interaction process. We view each route of two players as an offer. With the knowledge from the previous round, two strategies are introduced in each offer to weaken the inevitable conflict between two players. The simulation results show that our proposed strategies can improve the default interaction and achieve satisfactory results at the stable state.

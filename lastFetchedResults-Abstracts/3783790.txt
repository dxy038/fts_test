The author discusses the use of simulated annealing for optimizing signal distribution networks consisting of multiplexers, switches, buses and end-devices or users. A linear algebraic approach is developed for application of simulated annealing to problems of this kind. The author shows how such an approach allows for the optimization of general capacity-constrained signal distribution networks containing multiple levels of demultiplexers, switches, and buses, with linear and nonlinear objective functions. Examples include both linear and nonlinear objective functions

The scheduling of flow shops with multiple parallel machines per stage, usually referred to as the hybrid flow shop (HFS), is a complex combinatorial problem encountered in many real world applications. Given its importance and complexity, the HFS problem has been intensively studied. This paper presents a literature review on exact, heuristic and metaheuristic methods that have been proposed for its solution. The paper briefly discusses and reviews several variants of the HFS problem, each in turn considering different assumptions, constraints and objective functions. Research opportunities in HFS are also discussed.

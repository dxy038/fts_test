The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of shrimp cooperatives and non-cooperatives in Guatr district in Chabahar city of Sistan and Baluchistan province. To achieve the objective of study, profitability and efficiency indices were used.  Data were collected from 25 shrimp farms. Technical efficiency was estimated by BCC and super efficiency models. The results of study  revealed that all farms made profit. Moreover, the ranking of super efficiency models showed significant differences among efficiency levels of farms. Low level of efficiency was mainly related to poor management and rate of inputs utilization. Therefore, providing intensive extension services was recommended

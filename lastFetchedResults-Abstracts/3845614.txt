Mobile computing involves bulk data transmission over the transmission media. To achieve highly reliable data transmission, wireless mobile networks require efficient reliable link connectivity, regardless of terminal mobility and, thus, a reliable traffic performance. Mobile networks consist of mobile hosts, base stations, links, etc. that are often vulnerable to failure. It is desirable to design a reliable network, in terms of services of both the base stations and the communication channels of the network, for the reliable transmission of the data. An attempt is made to employ those channels that offer a reliable communication at any given time. The objective of this study is to design an appropriate reliability-based model for channel allocation that retains the overall system reliability with acceptable system performance. The system may achieve acceptable performance not only during normal operations but also under various component failures. A genetic algorithm, which is a search procedure based on evolutionary computation, is suited to solve a class of complex optimization problems. The potential of the genetic algorithm is used, in this paper, to improve the reliability of the mobile communication system. The proposed model designs a reliable mobile communication system, irrespective of the mobile hosts that change their position due to mobility. A simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm is conducted, and results reveal the effectiveness of this model.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the force behavior of living Drosophila embryos using an in situ PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) piezoelectric micro-force sensor with resolution in the range of sub-&#194;&#191;N. The Drosophila embryo is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, medical research, genetics and developmental biology, and has implications in the cure of human diseases. For a highly efficient and accurate microinjection of genetic material into a Drosophila embryo, it is absolutely necessary to allow close monitoring of the magnitude and direction of microinjection and other biomanipulation forces acting on the embryo during the injection process. In this paper, a networked microrobotic biomanipulation platform integrating a two-axis (2-D) PVDF micro-force sensing tool is used to implement force sensing and injection of living Drosophila embryos. Ultimately, the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated biomanipuation for batch injection of living embryos in genetics, which will facilitate the development of medicine for the cure of human diseases.

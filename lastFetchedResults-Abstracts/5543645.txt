Nowadays, the environment risk of mining area is a very serious problem. And mining area environmental impact of a variety of uncertainties, from the engineering point of view can be divided into land pollution, water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution and solid waste pollution. In the paper, an evaluation index system of mining area risk is established by using the triangular fuzzy number algorithm. Firstly, the risk factor set is established. Secondly, the value of risk factor set and weight set is scored by using experts. According to the scoring results, the evaluation matrix is got based on the triangular fuzzy number theory. Finally, the result of environment risk of mining area is worked out by using the triangular fuzzy number algorithm. This method can get an objective evidence to evaluate the environment risk on order to provide a basis for decision-making on sustainable development of the mining area.

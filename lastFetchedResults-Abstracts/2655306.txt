Introduction: Ciprofloxacin has adverse effects on spermatogenesis and male fertility.since L-carnitine has antioxidant effects potentially.
Objective:Ciprofloxacin has adverse effects on spermatogenesis and male fertility. since L-carnitine has antioxidant effects potentially, the purpose of this study is to investigate the gonad toxic of ciprofloxacin effects and L-carnitine protective effects on male mice.
Materials and Methods: Totally, 20 white mice of NMRI race were randomly selected and divided into four groups of 5. control group received normal saline, experimental group 1 received 12.5 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, experimental group 2 received 100 mg/kg  L- carnitine, experimental group 3 received 100 mg/kg L- carnitine and 12.5 mg/kg ciprofloxacin simultaneously. all animal were treated by peritoneal injection for 15 days. after treatment, the animals were weighed. the removed testis and the organ were weighed, too. the left testes were fixed in formalin 10% solution for histological examination. finally, the slices were painted with hematoxilin and eosin (H & E). then, results in the form of mean values were analyzed using SPSS, ANOVA test and T- test.
Results: Testis weight, spermatogeny cells count (spermatocytes, round spermatids, elongated spermatids) and diameter of seminiferous tubules in the ciprofloxacin group, compared to the control group, showed a significant decrease (p ?0 / 05). however, the simultaneous use of L-carnitine with ciprofloxacin, testis weight, spermatogeny cell count (round spermatid, long spermatid) and seminiferous tubule diameter, compared to the ciprofloxacin group, revealed a significant increase ( p ?0 / 05).
Conclusion: It can be concluded that L- carnitine administration can cause an improvement,gonadotoxic ciprofloxacin effects and spermatogenesis in adult mice.
Conflict of interest: none Declared
Key words:L-Carnitine improves gonad toxic damage caused by ciprofloxacin and spermatogenesis process in the adult mouse.

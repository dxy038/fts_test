Background and Objective: Sulfur mustard is a vesicant agent. Its long-term effects include respiratory, eye, and skin complications. The most important skin long-term complications include itching, eczema, scars, xerosis, hyper-pigmentation, and hypo-pigmentation. Serum IgE titers have a direct relationship with eczema and other skin problems such as itching and xerosis in allergic diseases and hypersensitivity. In this study, the relationship between serum levels of immunoglobulins and eczema in Sardasht chemical victims was investigated 27 years after exposure to sulfur mustard.

Materials and Methods: This study was part of a cohort study of Sardasht chemical victims. A total of 446 chemical victims exposed to sulfur mustard and 107 people as the control group in an age range of 27-67 years old were selected. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, smoking, and other geographic, national, and food tradition factors. The clinical evaluation of both groups was performed by a specialist physician. The measurement of serum immunoglobulin was carried out using sandwich ELISA. The results were reported using Mann-Whitney U test.

Results: Serum IgM and IgE levels in chemical victims with eczema were significantly higher than the control group with eczema. Also, serum IgM and IgE levels in chemical victims with eczema were significantly higher than chemical victims without eczema. In addition, serum IgE levels of chemical victims without eczema were significantly higher than the control group without eczema.

Conclusion: The results of this study showed that IgM and IgE have a significant relationship with eczema caused by sulfur mustard.

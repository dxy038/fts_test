This paper presents a source based power-aware reactive routing protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). It considers Quality of Service (QoS) parameters namely delay, throughput, bandwidth and cost of each link. Recent advances in MANETs have led to many new routing protocols specifically designed for mobile devices. Almost all of these routing protocols considered energy efficiency as the ultimate objective in order to maximize the whole network lifetime. The QoS routing in an ad hoc network is difficult because the network topology may change constantly and the available state information for routing is inherently imprecise. In this chapter, we propose a new Efficient Power-Aware QoS Routing (QEPAR) protocol is implemented on existing DSR protocol with residual battery power and bandwidth (data rate) as the QoS requirement metric for ad hoc networks to provide a solution for energy consumption. The designed protocol finds a packet delivery ratio, end to end delay, throughput and battery lifetime of mobile node. By simulation results we show that the proposed power-aware QoS routing protocol achieves better network life time with reduced energy consumption and end to end delay.

To realize maximization of the effective coverage area and lifetime for wireless sensor networks monitoring areas, the design of network routing protocol needs to take consideration of both the individual node and the whole network energy consumption. Aiming at the characteristics that node distribution is influenced by natural condition and data can fuse in real environment, as well as signaling overhead in unique uneven EEUC (Energy-Efficient Unequal Clustering protocol), an improved clustering routing algorithm has been presented, which priority to energy efficiency. First, generate cluster head by random competition in the nodes which have advantage in energy; next determine the internal structure of clusters by calculating dynamically tightness coefficient of each cluster, after that, optimize transmission path between cluster heads through improved multi-objective particle swarm algorithm. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that new proposed routing protocol can better balance energy consumption improve energy efficiency of the networks and prolong the network lifetime.

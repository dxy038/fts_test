It is the main objective for conventional variable-speed constant frequency wind energy conversion system (WECS) below the rated power to realize maximum power point tracking (MPPT). This paper presents a double objectives control scheme for WECS. Based on the frequency separation principle, the wind speed is divided into two components, a slowly varying component, named seasonal, and a rapidly varying component, named turbulence. Then the double-loop control structure is proposed, where the controller has two objectives to maximize the wind turbine energy efficiency and minimize the torque variations of turbine shaft, respectively. The simulation model is built in Matlab/Simulink surrounding and simulation results show that the proposed double objectives control scheme achieve not only high power capture efficiency but also low torque variations.

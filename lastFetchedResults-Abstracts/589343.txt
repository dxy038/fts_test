Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Fernald’s multisensory method on dyslexic children. 
Method: To this end, one male and one female student with dyslexia were selected by convenience sampling and were trained using Fernald’s multisensory approach. The present study is conducted within the framework of an empirical case study using the single-subject research design. For this purpose, 20 training sessions were held with two-month and three-month follow-ups. In order to evaluate children’s development, the test of reading and dyslexia (NAMA) was administered. 
Results: The results show improvement in the tested children, whose condition remained stable in the two-month and three-month follow-ups. It is suggested that other age and educational groups are used in future researches.

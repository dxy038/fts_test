Objective: The main purpose of this research was planning and fitting the structural model of the relationships between epistemological beliefs, academic self-efficacy, metacognitive self-regulation and deep-processing variables with high school students’ academic performance. Method:  For this purpose, a sample of 400 students was used to determine the validity and reliability of the instruments in the primary stage.  To test the hypothesis in the main stage of the research, the sample included 700 high school students, who were randomly selected using multiple-stage sampling. For assessing research variables, scales and questionnaires such as Bayless’s Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ), academic self- efficacy and self regulation subscales (derived from MSLQ) and deep-processing strategy subscale (derived from SPQ) were used.  Data were analyzed using Structural Equations Analysis. Results: Results provided robust support for the hypothesized structural relationships. In general, results indicated that epistemological beliefs could directly and indirectly affect students’ academic performance with the mediating effects of academic self-efficacy and metacognitive self-regulation strategy. Also, deep-processing variable was omitted in the final model because of its insignificant relevance to the academic performance.

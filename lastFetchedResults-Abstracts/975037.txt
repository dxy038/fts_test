Background and Objective: Striae Gravidarum found during pregnancy may be an indicative of poor skin elasticity and may prone to tearing perineal and vaginal tissues during vaginal delivery. The aim of this study was to determine relationship between striae gravidarum and perineal trauma and vaginal lacerations in women referred to Hajar Hospital Labor Ward in Shahr-e kord city. 
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 587 women who referred to Hajar Hospital Labor Ward for vaginal delivery in 2010-2011. The study was conducted within the first and second stages of labor. Data was collected by using interviews, hospital files and physical examinations. Descriptive statistics and chi square test, t- student test, one-way ANOVA and step-wise multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the collected data.
Results: 82.8 percent of the participants developed stretch marks.14.5 percent of the pregnant women in this study experienced vaginal and perineal tears. There was a significant association of vaginal and perineal tears with conduction anesthesia (P < 0.0001), vaginal dilation (P=0.023), duration of the first stage (p=0.044), and breast striae gravidarum score (P=0.005). No significant association was found between vaginal and perineal tears and neonatal birth weight, head circumference and maternal BMI (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: Patients with breast striae gravidarum are at a higher risk of vaginal and perineal lacerations at the time of vaginal delivery. This finding suggests that midwives and obstetricians consider beast striae gravidarum score as a simple and non- invasive tool for assessment of vaginal and perineal lacerations in management of women during vaginal delivery.

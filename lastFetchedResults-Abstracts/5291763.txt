The decision-making on capital structure is a core issue of modern corporate financing management, whether the decision result is correct or not directly affects the effect of capital operation and the economic benefit of the corporation. In view of the defects of traditional multi-objective methods in capital structure decision, a synthetic evaluation method based on triangular fuzzy number has been puts forward and an example of listed corporation has been used to prove the feasibility of this method in the paper. The method overcomes the quantification problem of qualitative indexes in the capital structure decision and can be easily extended to solve other synthetic evaluation problems affected by multiple factors.

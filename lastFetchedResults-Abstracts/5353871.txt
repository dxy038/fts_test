The research presented in this paper aims at improving the accuracy of land-use maps produced from classification of Landsat images of mega cities in developing countries. In other words, the main objective of this paper is to find a suitable post classification technique that gives optimum results for Landsat images of mega cities in developing countries. To reach our goal, the paper presents a classification of two TM-Landsat sub scenes using a traditional statistical classifier (Maximum Likelihood) into four land cover classes (vegetation-water-Desert-Urban); then the accuracy assessment for the produced land-cover map will be calculated. Following to this step, three post processing techniques- Majority Filter, Probability label Relaxation (PLR), and Cellular Automata (CA) - will be applied in order to improve the accuracy of the previously produced land cover map. Finally, the same accuracy assessment measurements will be calculated for the two land-cover maps produced by each of the above post classification techniques. Initial results will show that CA outperformed the other techniques. In this paper we propose a methodology to implement a satellite image post classification Algorithm with cellular Automata.

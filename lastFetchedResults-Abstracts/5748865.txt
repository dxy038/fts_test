This paper is a companion to D. Gupta et al. (2008). The primary objective is to motivate the need for interference rejection by analyzing the bit-error-rate performance of the frequency-shifted reference UWB system by D. Goeckel (2007) in the presence of a single sinusoidal interferer. Numerical simulations are then carried out to validate the interference rejection mechanism proposed by D. Gupta et al (2008).

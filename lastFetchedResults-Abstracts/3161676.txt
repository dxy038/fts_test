Natural language ontology is divided into meaning-ontology and semantic-ontology, meaning-ontology including the concepts of the subject, object and SPR (semanteme pointing to the relation) and the semantic relation of related, anti-related, share, and anti-sharing, and then generate 24 meaning meta-attributes, semantic-ontology including the concepts of species, hypo taxis, layer and SPS (semantic pointing subject-orriented), and semantic relations of related, non-related, anti-related, non anti-related, share, non-shared, anti-sharing and non anti-sharing, and then generate semantic 128 meta-attributes. And then the natural language semanteme could be formed by the semantic-dependency. It includes two phases of meaning phase and semantic phase. The meaning phase can be developed by four principles of meaning-beginning, meaning-compatibility, meaning-harmony and meaning-transformation. And the semantic phase can be generated by the five semantic principles of semantic-recycle, semantic-reverse, semantic-conflict, semantic-equilibrium and semantic-objective.

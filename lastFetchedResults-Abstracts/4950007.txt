This paper proposes an emotional harmony composition system using a series of predefined rules and interactive genetic algorithm. Two kinds of rules are defined: One is harmony composition rules used for composing harmony and the other is harmony emotion rules which may indicate the mapping between harmonic elements and a specific emotion of either happiness or sadness. Interactive genetic algorithm is applied to incorporate usersÂ´ subjective perception in the generated harmony. Both subjective and objective experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our approach.

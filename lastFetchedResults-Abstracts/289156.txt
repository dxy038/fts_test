Objective:
Epidermoid tumors have similar radiologic characteristics with arachnoid cysts on routine imaging techniques. Since they warrant different therapeutic interventions, it is essential to differentiate the two pathologies and to assess operative results.
Purpose:
The purpose of this study is to define the MR characteristics of epidermoid tumors in posterior fossa particularly on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
Patients and methods:
During a 10-year period, we operated 19 cases with epidermoid tumor of posterior fossa. The localization of the epidermoids was cerebellopontine angle in 16 patients, within the fourth ventricle in 2 patients and pineal region in 1 patient. Neuroimaging included CT in all patients, conventional MR in 14 patients and FLAIR and DWI in the last 6 patients.
Results:
In the first 13 cases, diagnosis of epidermoid tumor was difficult on CT and conventional MR. Epidermoids appeared as heterogeneous hyperintense lesions on FLAIR and homogenous hyperintense lesions on DWI in the last 6 patients. While total resection of the tumor was achieved in 17 patients, subtotal resection was performed in 2 patients. Histopathological examinations of the specimens revealed epidermoid tumor in all cases.
Conclusion:
Advances in neuroradiology provide us advantages for planning the treatment modalities in epidermoid tumors of the posterior fossa. The difficulties in preoperative differential diagnosis and judgment for reoperation in the postoperative course have been decreased particularly via FLAIR and DWI.

In the automotive industry, the Automotive Open System Architecture AUTOSAR is established as a de-facto standard and is applied in a steadily increasing number of development projects. In addition, AUTOSAR attracted the attention of other non-automotive industries, like railway, agriculture and construction machines, power generation and marine technology. The first versions of the standard successfully achieved the objective of integrating in a common framework various components from different suppliers and ensuring their interfaces interoperability. In actual and future versions of the standard, the objective becomes even more ambitious as it considers behavioral and timing characteristics of these components. Therefore, this paper presents the current status of AUTOSAR Release 4.0 concerning the behavioral modeling and timing characterization of components and opens several research and development directions for future extensions of the standard.

In the paper the fuzzy logic based multicriteria
protective relay for three-phase power transformer
is presented. Twelve criteria used to stabilize
the relay are introduced and integrated by means of
multi-objective decision-making methods, The introduced
protection scheme contains several internal
functions and coefficients which are subject to offline
pre-installation self-setting. Three unique procedures
are delivered for self-adljusting the relay,
and thus, making it self-organized. The included
results of testing show significantly gained both sensitivity
and selectivity of the self-organized relay
comparing with traditional approaches.

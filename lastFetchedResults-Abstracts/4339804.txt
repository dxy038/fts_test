Recently, in many countries the power systems are going to move toward creating a competition structure for selling and buying electrical energy. These changes and the numerous advantages of the Distributed Generations (DGs) in term of their technology enhancement and economical consideration, which are mostly connected to the distribution networks, have created more incentives to use these kinds of generators than before. Therefore, it is necessary to study the impact of DGs on the power systems, especially on the distribution networks. The distribution feeder reconfiguration is one of the most important control schemes in the distribution networks, which can be affected by DGs. This paper presents an approach for distribution reconfiguration considering Distributed Generators (DGs). The objective function is cost summation of electrical energy generated by DGs and substation buses (main buses). Genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimal operation problem. The approach is tested on a real distribution feeder.

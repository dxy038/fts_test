The objective of this study is the design of a photovoltaic pumping station for a remote site in the valley of LAGHOUT region located in the high plateaus of Algeria. First the site water needs and the availability of solar energy have been defined. Then the PV generator has been modeled and simulated. The water pump and the other system components have also been dimensioned. The system is operated to irrigate a determined 2500 m<sup>2</sup> surface of palm trees. In order to check the behavior of the solar panels used in our station under different illuminations and ensure of the right choice a simulation work has been performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK software.

For Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology, the accuracy of navigation signals (time reference signal) is very important. To improve the accuracy of the navigation signals, exact time control of the satellite and highly accurate clock synchronization between satellites and ground stations are required. JAXA plans to conduct a time synchronization experiment for future global navigation satellite technology. The objective of the experiment is to confirm whether a geostationary satellite is useful for the positioning accuracy improvement if it is used as a GNSS. This clock management technology will be utilized in the quasi-zenith satellite system, which has been studied in Japan. In this symposium, the results of a experiment and the experiment outline will be reported.

This work studies on the issue of energy efficient caching for Content-centric Networking (CCN) architecture. We first build the energy consumption model for content distribution in an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and find that the objective of energy optimization can translate into that of minimizing average response hops. We then develop an aging popularity-based in-network caching scheme (APC), where each router implements caching policy using its local information but relying little on coordination. Simulation results show that APC has significant advantage over the widely used Leaving Copies Everywhere (LCE) in terms of the saved energy consumption, cache hit rate and the average number of response hops, so it helps improve user access experience and reduce network traffic other than the energy optimization. Encouragingly, APC can save up to 70% energy.

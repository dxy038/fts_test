The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor σR is a global regulator of redox homeostasis in the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, with a similar role in other actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Normally maintained in an inactive state by its bound anti-sigma factor RsrA, σR dissociates in response to intracellular disulphide-stress to direct core RNA polymerase to transcribe genes, such as trxBA and trxC that encode the enzymes of the thioredoxin disulphide reductase pathway, that re-establish redox homeostasis. Little is known about where RsrA binds on σR or how it suppresses σR-dependent transcriptional activity. Using a combination of proteolysis, surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry and pull-down assays we identify an N-terminal, ∼10 kDa domain (σRN) that encompasses region 2 of σR that represents the major RsrA binding site. We show that σRN inhibits transcription by an unrelated sigma factor and that this inhibition is relieved by RsrA binding, reaffirming that region 2 is involved in binding to core RNA polymerase but also demonstrating that the likely mechanism by which RsrA inhibits σR activity is by blocking this association. We also report the 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure of σRN that reveals extensive structural conservation with the equivalent region of σ70 from Escherichia coli as well as with the cyclin-box, a domain-fold found in the eukaryotic proteins TFIIB and cyclin A. σRN has a propensity to aggregate, due to steric complementarity of oppositely charged surfaces on the domain, but this is inhibited by RsrA, an observation that suggests a possible mode of action for RsrA which we compare to other well-studied sigma factor-anti-sigma factor systems.

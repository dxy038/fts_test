In this paper, a new approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is proposed to tune the parameters of the thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) power oscillation damping controller. The design problem of the damping controller is converted to an optimization problem with the time-domain-based objective function which is solved by a PSO technique which has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results. To ensure the robustness of the proposed stabilizers, the design process takes a wide range of operating conditions into account. The performance of the newly designed controller is evaluated in a four-machine power system subjected to the different types of disturbances in comparison with the genetic algorithm based damping controller. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through the nonlinear time-domain simulation and some performance indices studies. The results analysis reveals that the tuned PSO based TCSC damping controller using the proposed fitness function has an excellent capability in damping power system inter-area oscillations and enhances greatly the dynamic stability of the power systems. Moreover, it is superior to the genetic algorithm based damping controller.

The discipline of software engineering encompasses knowledge, tools, and methods for defining software requirements, and performing software design, software construction, software testing, and software maintenance tasks. In software development practice, testing accounts for as much as 50% of total development efforts. Testing can be manual, automated, or a combination of both. Manual testing is the process of executing the application and manually interacting with the application, specifying inputs and observing outputs The objective of the project is to test the software application by suitable algorithm. The proposed system has to reduce the application testing moment, easily can find out bug and solve the bug by Regression Testing. Here by we are going to using a safe efficient regression bee colony optimization algorithm(BCO) for construct control flow graphs for a procedure or program and its modified version and use these graphs to select tests that execute changed code from the original test suite. Traceability relation of completeness checking for agent errors. In traceability relation to identifying missing elements in entire application and classifying defect in the testing moment.

With the membership degree linear weighted programming method, the solar investment fuzzy multi-objective decision-making is researched in the incomplete weight factors information case. First, the unknown weight factors multi-objective decision making problems are converted to equivalent non-linear programming problem, and the corresponding Lagrange function is constructed, and the optimal solution meeting the nonnegative constraint conditions is obtained, and then objective comparative membership degree linear weighted average of integrated values of all projects are obtained and they are sorted with the value. Three different solar investment projects are proposed according to monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon solar cells. Six factor indicators are selected, including investment costs, operating costs, economic benefits, state taxation, environmental benefits, system reliability, in which economic benefits is calculated on the basis of annual global solar radiation forecast value based on GM (1,1) gray prediction model. The two cases, completeness unknown of weight factors and smattering information of weight factors, are discussed separately. The final evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation and human judgment.

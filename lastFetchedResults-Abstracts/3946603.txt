An efficient bidirectional DC-DC convertor is necessary to couple the low DC-voltage sources (storage batteries, photo voltaic (PV) cells, etc.) to high-voltage DC-bus and vice versa. This study proposes a high-voltage diversity coupled inductor bidirectional DC (BDC) convertor which can eliminate the drawbacks of both the conventional buck/boost non-isolated and isolated BDC convertors in terms of high-voltage/current stress, high costs and less efficiency. Hence, the high-voltage DC-bus and low-voltage battery can be coupled easily and efficiently. The proposed CI-BDC topology is suitable for high-power applications. This study presents the design considerations, loss estimation and efficiency analysis of high-voltage diversity CI-BDC convertor in detail; vis-a-vis compares it with the performance of conventional BDC convertor. Matlab/Simulink-based simulation analysis has been carried out, and validated with the experimental results of 400-W prototype convertors.

A new zero-voltage-switched bidirectional dc-dc converter with coupled inductors is proposed in the paper. The proposed converter can operate with a steep conversion ratio, soft switching, a continuous inductor current, and fixed switching frequency. It can also operate with the switch stresses of a conventional pulsewidth-modulation-tapped/coupled-inductor converter regardless of the direction of power flow and without any voltage spikes across the switches during turn-OFF. These features are due to a very simple auxiliary circuit that is operational regardless of the direction of power flow and absorbs energy from the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors during switch turn-OFF. In the paper, the operation and design of the converter are discussed and its feasibility is confirmed with experimental results obtained from a prototype.

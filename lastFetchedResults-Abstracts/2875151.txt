Objective and subjective quality assessment of images and videos have been an active research topic in the recent years. Multimedia technologies require new quality metrics and methodologies taking into account the fundamental differences in the human visual perception and the typical distortions of both video and audio modalities. Because of the increase of multimedia content platforms (Streaming, IPTV, OTT, etc) to delivering video content over the open Internet to a variety of devices; from TVs, to tablets, and smart phones, the Quality of Experience (QoE) may change. In this work we propose to evaluate the mutual interaction between audio and video and their influence on the perceived quality in case of streaming video applications. From one side, we carried out subjective experiments for assessing audio-only, video-only and audiovisual quality to create an audiovisual database that contains a wide range of degradations. From another side, a statistical analysis has been performed to investigate the influence of video resolution, viewing device and audio quality on perceived audiovisual quality. The Results show that audio quality plays a crucial role in the judgment of perceived quality especially when its quality is poor.

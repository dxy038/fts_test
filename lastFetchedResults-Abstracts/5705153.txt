This paper aims to help farmers in selecting the right crop at the right time and the optimum allocation of land and water to each of these crops to maximize the profit by taking into consideration, the market prices, climate and irrigation facilities. It considers the case of optimization of agricultural resources in various districts of Kerala, India. The selection is based on a meta-heuristic method called Multi-objective Genetic algorithm (MOGA). To prevent premature convergence to local minima, Infeasible Solution Archiving and Replacement Mechanism (ISARM) and niche-based fitness sharing of Pareto dominant set is done. Besides, dynamic parameterization of cross-over and mutation operators are carried out to obtain the best proportion in which the operators are selected.

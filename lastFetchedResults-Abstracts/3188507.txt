This paper presents an adaptive semantic wiki dedicated to CoPs made up of actors from the higher education context (faculties, lecturers, teaching assistants, lab assistants). The wiki called ASWiki-CoPs (Adaptive Semantic Wiki for CoPs) is based on the semantic web technologies in order to enhance the knowledge sharing and reuse, offering the functionalities of a wiki together with some knowledge management features. ASWiki-CoP is based on an ontology used to describe the knowledge resources through the objective annotations and to express the member´s feedback through the subjective annotations. Furthermore, we describe the member´s profile in order to allow an adaptive access to the semantic wiki.

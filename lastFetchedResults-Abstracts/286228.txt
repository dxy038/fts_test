Background:  Health care workers are exposed to many agents that can cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. Recently, much attention has been focused on latex sensitivity, which commonly causes contact urticaria. Most studies have examined the conditions of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis and contact urticaria independently. Therefore, we have little information about the possible occurrence of these conditions in the context of combined assessment including both prick and patch testing. Objective: To determine the prevalence of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and contact urticaria in a group of health care workers presenting with skin problems. Methods: Retrospective review of health care workers assessed by both prick and patch testing in an occupational health clinic. Results:  The diagnoses included 61% with irritant contact dermatitis, 31% with allergic contact dermatitis, and 27% with contact urticaria to latex. Eleven percent had both allergic contact dermatitis related to thiuram and contact urticaria to latex. Ninety five percent were deemed to be work-related. Conclusion: Health care workers presenting with skin complaints should be assessed with both prick and patch testing.

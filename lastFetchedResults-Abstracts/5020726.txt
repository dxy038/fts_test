The paper reflects an analysis of thermal behaviour of a half-bridge IGBT power module. The main objective of this research is achieved by proposing analytical, numerical and experimental methods for boundary conditions determination and temperature calculation. The analytical approach is carried out from basic heat equation and corresponding boundary conditions. The modelling of boundary conditions offers an entirely new definition for temperature calculation for this particular case. The finite element method (FEM) investigates the influence of different boundary conditions on the transient thermal analysis. The experiment confirms the obtained results.

Our objective was to examine the physico-chemical and sensory attributes of low-sodium restructured caiman steaks containing microbial transglutaminase (MTG) and salt replacers (KCl and MgCl2). Trimmings from caiman carcasses were processed into restructured steaks with or without MTG and salt replacers; the five treatments were CON (1.5% NaCl), T-1 (1.5% NaCl + 1% MTG), T-2 (0.75% NaCl + 1% MTG + 0.75% KCl), T-3 (0.75% NaCl + 1% MTG + 0.75% MgCl2), and T-4 (0.75% NaCl + 1% MTG + 0.375% KCl + 0.375% MgCl2). T-4 demonstrated the greatest (P &lt; 0.05) succulence and the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) values for cooked hardness, springiness, and cohesiveness. The greatest (P &lt; 0.05) purchase intention was for T-3. Furthermore, T-3 and T-4 were similar (P &gt; 0.05) to controls in salty flavor. Our findings suggest that the combination of MTG, KCl, and MgCl2 can be employed as a suitable salt reduction strategy in restructured caiman steaks without compromising sensory attributes and consumer acceptance.

The paper presents a summary of related literatures and the findings from preliminary network behavior analyses of an IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks public access point. The objective of the study is to investigate and identify the wireless network´s characteristics. Received Signal Strength from a public access point was examined and the internet connection speed through the said access point, from end user´s perspective was scrutinized. Correlation of internet connection performance based on received signal strength from the access point was put under evaluation. Such notion has been evaluated and likely to be refuted based on the experimental findings. Having a high received signal strength alone does not warrant a good internet connection speed since there are likely to be other influencing factors and parameters involved. Since classifying the behavior of an access point is not always straightforward, this study confines the monitoring of IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network behaviors from the perspective of access point users.

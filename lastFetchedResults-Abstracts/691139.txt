This paper investigates the application of a multiobjective algorithm in the problem of multiobjective design of water distribution networks. The problem is formulated using two different objective functions: minimizing cost and maximizing reliability. To measure the reliability, a new definition based on the original concept of fuzzy logic, named “Fuzzy Reliability Index” is introduced. Then, developing the Multi Objective Honey-Bee Mating Optimization algorithm based on it’s single objective version, the multi criteria design of two benchmark networks is performed using predefined objective functions. The results obtained show that the proposed reliability index is able to provide desired reliability in the network. Furthermore, satisfactory results obtained by the algorithm in defining the pay off characteristic between total cost and reliability are shown. Finally, it is possible to use the developed model to introduce different and numerous non-dominant solutions to decision makers.

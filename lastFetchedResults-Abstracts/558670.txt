In this paper we consider a multi objective resource allocation problem (MORAP) that decision making units are controlled by a central unit. We choose to use a method based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to evaluate centralized-MORAP. A ranking model is proposed for all allowed allocations for the mentioned problem as well. Our method is illustrated by a numerical example

The objective of this paper is to answer to the following question: How the unified power flow controller (UPFC) parameters should be controlled in order to achieve the maximal desired effect in solving first swing stability problem. This problem appears for bulky power systems with long transmission lines. Various methods of reference identification of the series part, in order to improve the transient stability of the system based on: optimal parameters, state variables and also injection models were studied. Finally, a new identification method based on state variables and using the local measurement was proposed.

In this paper, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based controller is proposed for a class of Non-Linear Systems along with an additional proportional controller. The proportional controller forms an inner feedback loop which increases the stability of the non-linear system. The objective function of the system is used to optimize the Integral Squared Error (ISE) in addition to the peak overshoot of the respective system. To show effectiveness of the PSO-PID-P controller, different non-linear plants are analyzed through simulation. Furthermore simulation results of the non-linear system including the disturbances, show usefulness of the proposed method.

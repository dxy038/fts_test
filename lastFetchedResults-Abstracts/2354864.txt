The objective of the present work is to investigate the effect of the Earthâ€™s oblateness
parameters, particularly J2, on the formation flight of micro satellites in low circular
orbits. For this purpose, the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which have been accordingly
modified, will be reviewed to arrive at a convenient formulation as a set of linearized
differential equations of motion to include the J2 effects in the LVLH frame of
reference. Comparison will then be made between the orbit of twin-satellite formation
flying with respect to that predicted by the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equation. Results
obtained compare well with those in the literature and can be utilized for further
development, parametric studies and mission design.

This work proposes a new intelligent power module integrating the bidirectional switch function with fast switching times, optimized for matrix converter applications. It includes the power transistors gate drivers, galvanic isolation between control and power stages, over-voltage protection devices, floating voltage power supplies and a control circuitry providing smart switching sequences for the current commutation strategy. In addition, its modular design allows easy replacement of damaged BDSs in an entire matrix converter and makes the power and signals interconnections easier. The structure of the bidirectional switch consists of a power substrate containing the power circuit and components (diodes, IGBTs, etc.) and a PCB on top with the control circuits. From the userÂ´s point of view, the proposed module shows two power terminals (bidirectional switch function), two pins corresponding to the voltage power supply of the high-level control circuits, the bidirectional switch logic control signal pin (turn-on / turn-off) and other auxiliary control pins depending on the implemented commutation strategy (for example, the sign of the load current).

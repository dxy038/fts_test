The observer-based robust fault detection (RFD) design problems are studied for nonlinear
Markov jump systems (MJSs). Initially, multi-layer neural networks (MNN) are constructed
as an alternative to approximate the nonlinear terms. Subsequently, the linear difference
inclusion (LDI) representation is established for this class of approximating MNN. Then,
attention is focused on constructing the residual generator based on observer. What is
more, in order to take into account the robustness against disturbances and sensitivity
to faults simultaneously, the H1 filtering problem is formulated to minimize the influences
of the unknown input and another new performance index is introduced to enhance the
sensitivity to faults. Based on this, the RFD observer design problem is finally formulated
as a two-objective optimization and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed.
An illustrative example demonstrates that the proposed RFD observer can detect the
faults shortly after the occurrences without any false alarm.

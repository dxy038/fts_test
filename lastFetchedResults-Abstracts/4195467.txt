The paper proposes a protocol to adjust the vulnerable path by using mobile sensor networks. The objective of vulnerable adjustment is to protect some important areas, named TBP (to-be-protected) areas in the paper, from being attacked. In the paper, Voronoi diagram is utilized to And a vulnerable path, which is a path that an intruder may pass through. While the vulnerable path passes over a TBP area, a backward tracing and critical sets selection schemes are used to move the fewest number of sensors such that the vulnerable path can be changed and the new vulnerable path will not pass over the TBP area. Moreover, a moving schemes is proposed to decide where mobile sensors shall move. Since sensor movement is the major resource of energy consumption, thus, in order not to cause much movement, the proposed mechanism can move the fewest number of sensors with the shortest distance. Simulation results also verify the advantages of the proposed mechanism.

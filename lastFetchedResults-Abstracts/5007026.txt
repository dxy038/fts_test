This paper introduces the continuous double auction parameter selection algorithm (CDAPS) which manages multifunction radar resource by utilising an auction mechanism to select parameters for individual radar tasks. The mechanism enables numerous localised agents representing tasks to globally optimise the resource utilisation objective. The algorithm is demonstrated on a long range surveillance control problem and compared to a conventional rule based approach. CDAPS offers a significant improvement by providing an emergent global optimisation of task quality. The continuous nature of the algorithm enables adaptation to a potentially complex and dynamic scenario. Additionally, the algorithm balances the time budget to produce graceful degradation and is implemented in real time.

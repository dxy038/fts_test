At the present time, the country has carried out the measure of energy-saving power scheduling. The main object of this measure is to increase the efficiency and to reduce pollution which is important to the power stations. This paper calculated three kinds of equivalent price coefficient of energy and environment in the case of the lowest bidding price or the least energy or the most minimum pollution to the environment. In this way, the multi-objective optimal problem with different physical units was reformulated into a new single-objective optimal problem. The numerical result shows that only considering economic indicators is unable to meet the development of the market. More considering on saving energy, lower energy consumption and reducing pollutants discharge must be given to put the power suppliers in a favorable position in the future market.

A power-compensated, 3&#215;3 reconfigurable, multiwavelength and bidirectional optical cross-connect (RMB-OXC) for all-optical networks is proposed using strain-tunable fiber Bragg gratings (ST-FBG) and several optical circulators. The paper presents the experimental study for the induced crosstalk due to the OXC. The RBM-OXC operation and performance are experimentally demonstrated and crosstalk is determined to confirm the low penalty incurred. In overall the selective RBM-OXC offers high reconfigurable capability, flexibility and survivability in an optical network.

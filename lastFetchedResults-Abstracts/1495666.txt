Introduction: Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity- impulsivity behavior. ADHD is frequently accompanied by Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD).
Objective: To assess the Cardiovascular Fitness in children with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder with and without developmental coordination disorder and normal children.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive comparative study, a total of 45 male children aged 9-7 years in which 30 individuals non-randomly selected from child psychiatry outpatient squarely addressed both public and private centers. Fifteen normal children were selected from elementary schools students in Rasht. Diagnostic criteria by clinical interview based on DSM-IV criteria, were performed by child and adolescent psychiatrist. Cardiovascular Fitness was tested with 6-minute walk. Data were analyzed using SPSS-16.0 software. Variables to determine statistically significant differences in the three groups ANNOVA test were used. Levels lower than the rate of p= 0/05 were considered significant.
Results: Children with ADHD with and without DCD showed poor Cardiovascular Fitness, compared with normal children (P < 0.05). Cardiovascular Fitness in ADHD+ DCD group was lower than that in ADHD counterparts.
Conclusions: ADHD children with and without DCD have poor Cardiovascular Fitness than normal children. Cardiovascular Fitness deficit may differentiate motor problems in DCD and ADHD.

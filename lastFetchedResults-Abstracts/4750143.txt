The objective of automated highway systems (AHS) is to increase the safety and throughput of the existing highway infrastructure by introducing traffic automation. AHS is an example of a large scale, multiagent complex dynamical system and is ideally suited for a hierarchical hybrid controller. We discuss the design of efficient hybrid controllers for the platoon maneuvers on an AHS. For the modeling of a hybrid system including the merge and split operations, we introduce the safety distance policy for the merge and split operations. Then, the platoon system is modeled by a hybrid system. In addition, the hybrid controller for the proposed merge and split operation models is presented. Finally, we demonstrate our scenarios for platoon maneuvers using the hybrid control scheme

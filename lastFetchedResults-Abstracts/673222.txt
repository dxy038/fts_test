Recent urban policy in western cities is directed towards urban entrepreneurialism, private sector participation and making developers pay for planning gain. Land development control strategy is formulated accordingly to reflect these themes in rejuvenating inner city areas.

The conclusion is that it did not achieve the stated objective in increasing private sector site amalgamation for new urban housing redevelopment. Main reasons include plannersâ€™ neglect of market viability issues, geographical mobility of property development capital, and incompatibility of this incentive with other development control measures

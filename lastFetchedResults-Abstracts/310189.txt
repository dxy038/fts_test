Objectives
Hemodialysis (HD) population commonly show high plasma ferritin levels with a poor diagnostic value. The objective of this study is to elucidate the meaning of HD hyperferritinemia through the analysis of its ferritin iron content (FIC).
Design and methods
FIC (iron atoms/ferritin molecule) was measured by atomic emission spectrometry. Ferritin and FIC values were correlated with iron storage and inflammation markers and the results of HD patients compared to those of septic and hemochromatosis patients.
Results
1) In the whole HD population, high ferritin levels were associated to low FIC values; 2) the correlation of ferritin with iron indices and inflammation markers in HD patients was intermediate in between that of septic and hemochromatosis patients; 3) the FIC level of HD patients was lower than that of the other two groups.
Conclusions
The high ferritin levels of HD patients are not synonymous with either inflammation or of high levels of iron storage. Their high levels and the low FIC values might be due to the presence inside the ferritin core of oligoelements other than iron.

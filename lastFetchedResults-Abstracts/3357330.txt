This paper proposes the deployment of a metaheuristic algorithm known as the Firefly Algorithm (FA) to find the optimal variables like transformer taps, location of UPFC and its variables in a power system transmission network. All these multi-variables are simultaneously optimized for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem to optimize the real power loss (RPL) as a single objective function and then minimization of RPL and maximization of voltage stability limit (VSL) as multiobjective functions. The proposed algorithm is applied to New England 39 bus test system and the results are compared with Interior point successive linear programming (IPSLP) and Bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) methods. The results confirm the improvement of RPL and VSL which justifies the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

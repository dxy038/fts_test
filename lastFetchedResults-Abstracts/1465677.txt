Eighty-six male light lambs of Manchego breed were used in this study. Principal component (PC) analysis was performed to study the relationship between carcass quality variables (n=22) and between meat quality measures (n=21). The carcass quality was assessed using objective and subjective measurements of conformation and fatness besides the joints proportion and tissues proportion of the leg. The measurements used to evaluate meat quality were pH in longissimus dorsi and semitendinosus muscles, the colour, moisture, water holding capacity, cooking losses, texture and sensorial analysis on longissimus dorsi. The five first PCs explained about 77% of the total variability for carcass measures whereas for meat quality the 74% of the total variability was explained for the eight first PCs. All the carcass measurements showed similar weight to define the first PC, whereas the muscle and bone proportion as well as muscle:bone ratio of the leg were useful to define the second PC. The meat quality measures that were more effective to define the first PC were the meat colour measurements, whereas the sensorial variables defined the second PC. The projection of the carcass quality data in the first two PCs allowed to distinguish clearly between heavier carcasses (higher than 6.5 kg) and lighter carcasses (lower than 5.5 kg). The carcasses with a weight higher than 6.5 kg were on the left side of the figure, where the variables of conformation and fatness lie. The group of medium carcass weight were placed between the two previous groups. The projection of the meat quality data in the first two PCs did not differ between hot carcass weights, although there was a trend, the lighter carcasses lay on the left side of the graph, which implies small differences between meat quality in this range of carcass weight.

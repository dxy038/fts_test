In this paper, a modified artificial immune network algorithm (MAINetA) is used for placement of static VAr compensators (SVC) in a large-scale power system to improve voltage stability. To enhance voltage stability, the planning problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem for maximizing fuzzy performance indices for bus voltage deviation, system loss and the installation cost. The multi-objective placement problem is solved by the fuzzy MAINetA and the results are compared with those obtained by the real immune algorithm (RIA).

We investigate a blind method for cancelling the multipath effects, in order to improve the time-of-arrival estimate. Our approach uses early-late gate processing on an objective function derived from an adaptive FIR filter that attempts to match the crosscorrelation of the received signal with a multipath-free replica of the desired crosscorrelation. This method performs reasonably well, and decreases the bias by approximately a factor of 2, even in very stressing multipath environments.

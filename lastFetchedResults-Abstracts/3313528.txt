Tuberculosis is an infectious disease widely present in developing countries, which is largely motivated by the difficulty of a rapid and efficient diagnosis. In order to reduce the number of patients suspected of having TB unnecessarily isolated in hospitals, thus optimize the use of health resources, we propose a systematic procedure for developing a decision support system based on specialized MLP network committee. The system based on 3 MLP models, which response to input data clusters inferred by the k-means technique, exhibits a better classification performance than a single network in terms of the number of false positives, achieving a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 94.3%.

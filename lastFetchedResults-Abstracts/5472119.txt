In this paper, we highlight the use of synthetic data sets to analyze learners behavior under bounded complexity. We propose a method to generate synthetic data sets with a specific complexity, based on the length of the class boundary. We design a genetic algorithm as a search technique and find it useful to obtain class labels according to the desired complexity. The results show the suitability of the genetic algorithm as a framework to provide artificial benchmark problems that can be further enriched with the use of multi-objective and niching strategies.

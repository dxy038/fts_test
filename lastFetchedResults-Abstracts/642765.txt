Objective
The objective of the present study was to compare measured energy expenditure with predicted energy expenditure in patients with short bowel syndrome.
Methods

Thirteen patients with short bowel syndrome underwent anthropometric measurements and indirect calorimetry for the determination of resting energy expenditure. Energy expenditure was also estimated by use of the Harris-Benedict equation with current weight and ideal weights.
Results

The difference between measured energy expenditure and energy expenditure estimated by use of current weight was statistically significant, whereas the difference between measured energy expenditure and energy expenditure estimated by use of ideal weight was not significant.
Conclusion

The energy expenditure of patients with short bowel syndrome can be estimated by use of the Harris-Benedict equation and patientsâ€™ ideal weight.

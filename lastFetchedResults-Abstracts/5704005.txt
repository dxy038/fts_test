The prime focus of this work is in describing a symbiotic architecture for a Cognitive Radio network, called Cognitive Relaying with Frequency Incentive. The incumbent Primary User (PU) of the spectrum, with a weak transmission link, seeks cooperation from the cognitive Secondary User (SU) nodes in its vicinity, and in return rewards them with incentive frequency bands for their own communication. We propose two schemes (Band-Set Minimization and Edge-by-Band Minimization) to achieve this objective. Cross-layer optimization problems are formulated to create the frequency incentive while ensuring a guaranteed throughput for the PU, as well as for the SUÂ´s to efficiently access this incentive. The proposed schemes are extensively compared, and simulation results are furnished to demonstrate their differences and individual merits from the perspective of both the PU and SUs.

In unreliable communication environment, an efficient motion vector (MV) recovery method is proposed in this paper for video temporal error concealment (TEC) with H.264/AVC standard in order to provide better quality. To increase the accuracy, 4Â´4 block size is regarded as the basic operation unit in the proposal. Furthermore, the detailed processing procedures of the proposed algorithm for 3 packet loss cases which happen frequently are separately discussed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could achieve better subjective and objective qualities compared with the existing temporal EC algorithms. It is fast and pervasive to be used in multimedia communication systems with H.264/AVC coding standard.

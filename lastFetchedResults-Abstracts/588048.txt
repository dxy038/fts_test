Background: Access to prenatal care has an extremely important role in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in the world. 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of integrated maternal health care program on reducing pregnancy and delivery complications in Qazvin province.
Methods: This was a cohort study carried out on 450 pregnant women who were visited at maternal health centers in two cities of Qazvin and Alborz between 2009-2011. The sampling method used was based upon objective. A researcher-made questionnaire composed of three parts marked as pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum was used for collecting data. All information was obtained from clinical files, observations, interviews with relevant people in charge (general practitioners or midwives), and mothers who visited the health centers. Samples were followed up from the entry time to study until the time of postpartum visit. The two study groups (one provided with integrated health care and the other with routine health care) were examined for pregnancy complications. Data were analyzed by independent t-test, chi-square test, Fisherâ€™s exact test, and Mann-Whitney U-test.
Findings: The rate of gestational complications including hypertension (P=0.03), preterm delivery (P=0.03), and premature infants (P=0.02) were lower in mothers who received integrated maternal health care. Moreover, the referral rate for the group with integrated maternal health care was higher compared to the one with routine health care (P=0.001). 
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that, despite the implementation of almost 60% of the integrated maternal program in the city of Alborz, it seems that the program had a positive impact on reducing gestational complications and promoting maternal health.

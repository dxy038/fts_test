For the non-periodic failure rate reduction equipment preventive maintenance, this paper studies on the equipment maintenance time optimization problem for incomplete maintenance in a finite time interval. The research aims to optimize the objective function by minimizing total maintenance costs, establish the dynamic optimization model with consideration of equipment warranty period and resale value, design algorithms for model solutions, and conduct simulation studies. The paper also conducts model sensitivity analysis so as to provide decision makers with useful references for maintenance strategies.

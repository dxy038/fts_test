<p><strong>Background and objectives: </strong>Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease caused by <em>Leptospira interrogans</em>. Leptospirosis leads to economical losses in dairy farm industry. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pathogenic serovars of <em>Leptospira interrogans </em>in dairy cattle herds of Shahrekord by PCR.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>Two hundred samples (100 urine and 100 blood) were collected from 100 cows randomly and delivered to the laboratory. Samples were stored at −20 °C. DNA was extracted and purified from the plasma and urine samples and concentrated on diatoms in the presence of guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN). PCR products were detected and identified as <em>Leptospira </em>by ilumination of the expected size of DNA bands after staining of the agarose gel with ethidium bromide gels. PCR products were purified and sequenced.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The results showed that 28% of urine samples and 23% of plasma samples were contaminated. The major serotypes were <em>Icterohaemorrhagiae </em>(50%) and <em>Pomona </em>(37.5%). The urine samples of 17 cows were positive for <em>Leptospira </em>without positive plasma samples. This indicated that these cows are reservoirs in dairy herds of Shahrekord and dangerous for human health. The plasma samples of twelve cows were positive for <em>Leptospira </em>without positive urine samples.<br /><strong>Conclusions</strong>: <em>Leptospira </em>serotypes can be maintained in relatively dry regions and must be considered when dealing with leptospirosis in dairy farms of Shahrekord and human health.</p>

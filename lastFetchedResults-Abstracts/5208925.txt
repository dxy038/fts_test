The objective of this paper is to show how stretchable conductive composites can be utilized for the fabrication of ultra-low cost stretchable RF devices. We show a method to produce biocompatible highly conductive stretchable silicone composites via an in-situ nanoparticle formation and sintering process. Furthermore, we develop a simple, low cost, processing technique to fabricate stretchable RF transmission lines. These RF transmission lines are highly flexible, stretchable and robust. The S-parameter measurements show stable performance during mechanical deformation up to 6 GHz. Future development of this technology will enable ultra low cost consumer RF devices serving as a platform for future stretchable electronic devices.

The control of pH is widely recognized as a difficult problem. The Strong Acid Equivalent approach for control of pH processes consists of defining an alternate equivalent control objective, the Strong Acid Equivalent, and using a linear control law in terms of this new control objective. The Strong Acid Equivalent is calculated on line from pH measurements given a nominal titration curve of the inlet stream. Deadtime compensation is achieved in the complete control structure through use of a Deadtime Window. This approach has been implemented on an industrial pH process with unknown chemical composition.

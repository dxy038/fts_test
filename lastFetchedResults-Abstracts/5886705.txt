The emerging of the smart grid provides the residents with the opportunity to schedule the power usage in the home with the purpose of reducing the expense of the electricity. With this objective, we develop an optimal power scheduling method. In order to reduce the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the electricity consumersÂ´ power demand, a real time pricing (RTP) combined with inclining block rate (IBR) pricing model is also presented. The simulation results verifies that our proposed approach could reduce both the electricity cost and the PAR.

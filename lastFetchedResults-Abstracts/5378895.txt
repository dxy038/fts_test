Application actuality of evolutionary algorithms in product design is discussed, and characteristics and default of evolutionary design are summarized. An interactive evolutionary technology is proposed, which can integrate intelligence of human and computer for product design, the function model of interactive evolutionary design system is described. Finally, an interactive evolutionary design support system combining case based reasoning technology is developed, and it is used in the structure design of injecting mould successfully. Through dynamical modulating of constraints and objective for design in the design process, intelligence of human and computer are integrated to design product in the system. The proposed interactive evolutionary technology is effective for complex problem with large scale variables and constraints

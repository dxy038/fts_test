A reconstruction model of agile logistics was proposed in this paper, based on related agile and agile logistics research. At first, there was a short discussion about the agile logistics modular thinking and modular categories based on the operation of agile logistics processes, then the level of the customer service parameters and the functional modules of the logistics (transport, storage, distribution, package, etc) were analyzed by the antinomy relations between customer service and logistics cost, and then, the objective function of the reconstruction was identified. Secondly, the gray relational grade was used to acquire the result of decision-making result of the reconstruction model of agile logistics. At last, a real application was given for the model, calculated the gray relational grade and geted the best decision.

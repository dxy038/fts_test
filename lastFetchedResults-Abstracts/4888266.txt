The goal of this paper is to consider a co-design approach between the controller of a process control application and the frame scheduling of a Local Area Network (LAN). More precisely we present a bi-directional relation between the Quality of Control (QoC) provided by the controller and the Quality of Service (QoS) provided by the LAN (relation noted QoS&#8651;QoC). We present, first, the implementation of the relation QoS&#8594;QoC on the basis of a compensation method for time delays called dominant pole method, and second, the implementation of the relation QoC&#8594;QoS on the basis of the hybrid priorities for the frame scheduling. The final objective is the implementation of the bidirectional relation QoS&#8651;QoC which is the combination of the both relations QoS&#8594;QoC and QoC&#8594;QoS in order to have a more efficient NCSs design.

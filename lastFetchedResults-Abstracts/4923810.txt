A novel simulator has been developed to facilitate vertical circuit design integration. Written in Objective C, it allows the incorporation of new system/intermediate/device level models and modifications to the simulation algorithms. The analog simulation capability of the simulator is demonstrated. A simulator model is presented and the simulatorÂ´s implementation of that model is shown. The necessary steps to add a new simulation capability, Elogic, are outlined. Code size and execution speed gains are discussed. The current ROOMMS implements the iterated timing analysis algorithm and packages this proven analog algorithm with a proven relaxation-based logic algorithm

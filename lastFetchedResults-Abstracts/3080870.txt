This paper presents a new aperiodic request server in a hard real-time system handling periodic and aperiodic tasks, using EDF (earliest deadline first) in order to schedule periodic tasks. The objective of the server is to reduce response times for aperiodic tasks and guaranteeing the schedulability of all periodic tasks (considered as critical tasks). This server improves the response time offered by TBS (total bandwidth server), because idle times, aperiodic and periodic tasks are considered for deadline assignment. The optimality of the server is also proved. Finally a performance evaluation is made by comparing the server with TBS in different periodic and aperiodic load levels

Objective
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent
mental health disorders. In recent years, the impacts of various micronutrients
on ADHD have been studied. However, vitamin D has received much less
attention. This study was aimed at evaluating the association and level of
serum vitamin D in children with ADHD.
Materials & Methods
This case-control study was carried out, in 2012, on 6 to 12 yr-old children.
Thirty-seven were children with ADHD in the cases group and another 37
healthy children were in the control group. Venous blood sample was drawn
from each child to measure the serum level of vitamin D. Other variables were
compared as well.
Results
The mean serum vitamin D level of children with ADHD (19.11±10.10 ng/ml) was
significantly lower than that of the control group (28.67±13.76 ng/ml) (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Deficiency of vitamin D has been proved in various psychiatric diseases. This
study evidenced a significantly low level of serum vitamin D in children with
ADHD. This suggests the need for regularly monitoring of serum vitamin D
levels and treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiencies.

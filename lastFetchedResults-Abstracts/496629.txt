Restricted breeding seasons used in beef cattle produce censored data for reproduction traits measured in regard to these
seasons. To analyze these data, adequate methods must be used. The objective of this paper was to compare three approaches
aiming to evaluate sexual precocity in Nellore cattle. The final data set contained 6699 records of age at first conception (AFC14)
(in days) and of heifer pregnancy (HP14) (binary) obtained from females exposed to the bulls for the first time at about 14
months of age. Records of females that did not calve in the following year after being exposed to a sire were considered
censored (77.5% of total). The models used to obtain genetic parameters and expected progeny differences (EPDs) were a Weibull
mixed and a censored linear model for AFC14 and threshold model for HP14. The mean heritabilities obtained were 0.76 and
0.44, respectively, for survival and censored linear models (for AFC14), and 0.58 for HP14. Ranking and Pearson correlations
varied (in absolute values) from 0.54 to 0.99 (considering different percentages of sires selected), indicating moderate changes in
the classification. Considering survival analysis as the best selection criterion (that would result in the best response to selection),
it was observed that selection for HP14 would lead to a more significant decrease in selection response if compared with
selection for AFC14 analysed by censored linear model, from which results were very similar to the survival analysis

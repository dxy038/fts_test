OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe clinical characteristics in premenopausal women with uterine myomas and to identify factors associated with hysterectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected by chart abstraction in 421 premenopausal women with myomas and analyzed by univariate and multivariable regression.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 29 months, 86% of women had symptoms associated with myomas and 40% had an increase in uterine size of >2 gestational weeks. By multivariable regression, bleeding symptoms at presentation and previous surgical history of cholecystectomy and adhesiolysis were significantly associated with greater odds of hysterectomy. There was a significant interaction between age and uterine size, so that as age increased, uterine size had a greater impact on the likelihood of hysterectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of premenopausal women myomas were associated with symptoms in almost all women over the follow-up period. Hysterectomy was performed in 22% of women overall. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1213-9.)

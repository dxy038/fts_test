To reduce the complexity of classical direct radiating arrays, we propose an architecture of array based on parasitic element antennas with multiple excitations. The objective is to reduce the number of active ways of the antenna and to keep enough controls for beam shaping. In this contribution, we consider a 10 &#215; 10 lattice with only 15 % of the elements directly fed. The others are only fed by couplings and they are loaded on reactive values to obtain a desired radiation pattern. With a substantial reduction in the number of excited elements, we are able to obtain a low degradation of the directivity compared to an array with all elements excited. After describing the concept, some interesting results are given to illustrate the potentialities of this hybrid antenna.

Given ever-higher labor costs, organizations should periodically assess the match of personnel skills and
quantities with required duties. Consolidating similar functional specialties can improve efficiency by
increasing staffing for high-demand jobs, or by identifying areas where staff may be reduced. However,
such consolidation activities are often done anecdotally, and can potentially overlook successful skill
pairings. We propose a model that enables an objective, repeatable skills consolidation assessment process.
Our model—a cost/benefit ratio—identifies skill pairings which are likely to merge successfully, by
comparing the costs of training to the benefits of increased staffing level efficiencies for these jobs.

Rail yards dispatcher must determine (1) how cars are transferred from one inbound train to another outbound train and what is the makeup of each outbound train, (2) how to use yard engines, (3) how to arrange yard track occupation. The sum total of these decisions is the basis of other decisions in rail yards. This paper presents the formulation and solution of a joint computer-aided dispatching model for the coordination of the above decisions. The objective here is to capture the tradeoff between benefits of reducing the staying time of cars in yards and the delay penalty costs. This formulation results in a mixed 0â€“1 programming and an optimal decomposing heuristic solution method is proposed. The tests with the practical instances demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the algorithm.

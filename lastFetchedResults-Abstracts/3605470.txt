A 4 &#956;m period ion implanted bubble device has been developed employing 1 &#956;m bubble single layer film. The design and characterization of a transfer-in gate are described. The effect of the pulse shape on operating margins has been investigated, and an auxiliary pulse added to the transfer pulse to greatly improve gate performance. This newly designed transfer-in gate has also been successfully operated as a bidirectional transfer gate. In order to decrease the access time of large capacity chips, a highly efficient method of detection at high frequencies has been devised. Characterization of the device at 300 kHz is presented.

A power conversion module for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) should handle all power modes of HEV including high, medium, low and regenerative power modes. The possibility of using a bidirectional z-source nine-switch inverter (BZS-NSI) as power conversion module of HEV has been investigated by the authors in previous works. However in this paper, a series HEV based on BZS-NSI is modeled and performance of it is survived by simulation.

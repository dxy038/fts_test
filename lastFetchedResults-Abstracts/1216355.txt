A mathematical model of optimal energy medium distribution in steelmaking process is formulated. In this model, three kinds of important energy mediums including byproduct gases, steam and electricity are considered, and the objective function accounts for both the change of generation and consumption of the byproduct gases and the demand of low (or middle) pressure steam and electricity for each period to maximize the benefit of products cost and minimize the consumption of energy. The results indicate that the optimal distribution scheme of byproduct gases, middle pressure steam, low pressure steam and electricity is achieved and case study shows that 6% of operation cost is reduced by using the proposed model comparing with the previous model.

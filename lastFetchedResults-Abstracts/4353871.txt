The purpose of this project was to determine the current climate conditions of the Volvo plant located in Dublin, Virginia. Since no air conditioning was installed in the plant the employees become uncomfortable while they work. Fans were located sporadically around the plant to alleviate this problem. Critical areas within the plant needed to be identified to begin to address this problem. A critical area was defined as any area with temperatures between 68 and 77 degrees, 77 and 85 degrees, and above 85 degrees. These classifications were chosen based on established guidelines. To determine the critical areas, a subjective analysis, employee surveys, and objective analysis, temperature data and fan location, was conducted. The results showed that most plant was classified as a critical area. However, the limitations of this project did not allow for a full analysis of the plant, specifically the summer months, which were the most problematic.

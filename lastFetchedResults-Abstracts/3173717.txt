A multi-objective gait optimization method for a humanoid robotÂ´s walking on slopes is proposed in this paper. Firstly, based on SCUT-I humanoid robot and slopes model, the complicated process of walking on slopes is parameterized so that hip and ankle trajectories are planned based on IPM (inverted pendulum model). Secondly, a multi-object optimization method based on walking stability, velocity and energy is proposed to search for the optimal gait parameters that are step, walking cycle, the supporting time of double feet and the height of foot. Finally, SCUT-I robot model is built and simulated by Matlab6.5, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of this multi-objective gait optimization method that makes the robot walk on slopes more stably, quickly and lower energy consumption.

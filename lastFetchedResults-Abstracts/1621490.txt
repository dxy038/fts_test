The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which cyclic AMP increases arginase activity in cultured human Caco-2 tumor cells. Caco-2 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 8-bromo cyclic AMP or forskolin, and the cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for total arginase activity. Both test agents increased arginase activity by twofold, and this was attributed to the induction of the arginase II isoform. Both arginase II mRNA and protein showed increased expression in response to 8-bromo cyclic AMP and forskolin, and these effects were inhibited by H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), enhanced by okadaic acid (phosphatase inhibitor), and enhanced by 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor). Cyclic GMP did not appear to be involved in arginase II induction. These observations indicate that cyclic AMP stimulates arginase II gene expression by mechanisms involving activation of protein kinase A and consequent activation of appropriate transcription factors.

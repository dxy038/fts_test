In order to achieve the objective and exact classification of the traditional Chinese medicine pulse- conditions, a pulse-condition recognition method based on BP neural network has been successfully developed. The influence of concealed layer node number on convergent speed and recognition accuracy and the influence of learning rate on convergent speed are considered. The BP network-training algorithm is improved, which obtains satisfactory network convergent error and recognition effect. The recognition tests of many pulse-condition samples indicate that our method works well in classifying the traditional Chinese medicine pulse- conditions accurately and quickly.

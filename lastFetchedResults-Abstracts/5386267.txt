This paper addresses the problem of energy efficient transmission in an IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN based on UWB technology. We consider devices with heterogeneous energy attributes. That is, some of the devices are battery-powered and energy sensitive, while others may have more power, or even AC powered. Our objective is to design an energy efficient transmission protocol to optimize the energy efficiency of the energy sensitive devices. That is, to minimize the energy consumption per bit. To achieve this, we utilize the network topology and UWB physical layer information in an energy-aware system design framework. Specifically, we propose a novel scheme to exploit the following key ideas: (1) efficient TDMA MAC for sleep/wakeup switch and network information exchange, (2) dual communication mode considering different transmission paths, namely, peer to peer and relay, and (3) UWB PHY characteristics (multi-rate and precise location information). The simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in various scenarios.

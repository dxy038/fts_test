The following paper proposes the architecture for a consumer - end solution to smart grid implementation. The objective of the on-going research is to arrive at a system that can easily be integrated with the current electricity distribution infrastructure, with minimal modifications. The system consists of two entities present on the consumer premises - a central processing unit called Power Hub and an intelligent switch, called Slave, to which an appliance needs to be connected. The implementation can serve a wide range of applications such as restricting consumer electricity billing through inbuilt policies, implementing prepaid billing, energy market transactions, etc.

                                                                            Prazosin is significantly effective to reduce sleep disturbance and trauma nightmare in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, results of different studies were evaluated.
                                                                                                        Objectives
                                                                            The current randomized clinical trial aimed to assess the effects of prazosin on sleep parameters and nightmares among veterans with chronic PTSD.
                                                                                                        Materials and Methods
                                                                            Thirty-two veterans with chronic war-induced PTSD and distressing nightmares were randomized into prazosin and placebo groups for eight weeks. The main symptoms were qualified using the recurrent distressing dreams item of the clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) and the daytime symptom severity was measured by PTSD checklist (PCL) and the objective sleep quality assessment by actigraphy.
                                                                                                        Results
                                                                            Compared with placebo, prazosin had no significant effects on reduction of daytime symptoms (P = 0.69) and frequency and intensity of trauma-related nightmares. Also, there were no significant differences between pre- and post-treatment actigraphy measurements (P &gt; 0.05).
                                                                                                        Conclusions
                                                                            The study findings showed that prazosin had no significant effect on reduction of PTSD symptoms as well as nightmares among veterans with chronic PTSD. Further clinical trials are needed to define the effect of prazosin on sleep physiology and whether such effects regarding the therapeutic response.

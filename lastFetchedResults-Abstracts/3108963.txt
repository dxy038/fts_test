In this paper, first a simple frequency domain technique for the design of suboptimal controllers for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is presented. The technique is aimed at singular value shaping and combines the optimality of Wiener-Hopf solution and the computational simplicity of Diophantine formulation to minimize a quadratic norm of a weighted performance function. Second, the problem of choosing the performance function for norm minimization is considered, with an objective of ensuring robustness against both right and left multiplicative plant uncertainties. An application in the design of controllers for variable speed induction motor drives, as a part of which these techniques were developed, is presented.

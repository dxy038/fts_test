The paper presents an optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) accelerometer, using a modified cantilever beam design to get the highest possible strain in the FBG and a wide natural frequency. This accelerometer modeled a system composed by a mass mounted at the free end of a cantilever beam, which is also attached to an optic fiber whose length is varied by the movement of the mass. The objective is to compare the measured deflection, natural frequency and sensitivity with the predicted ones. The sensitivity and frequency response range has been enhanced compared to the conventional cantilever designs: surface mounted, patch mounted FBG and L-shape. Achieving a sensitivity of about 330 pm/g and a natural frequency of 227.3 Hz.

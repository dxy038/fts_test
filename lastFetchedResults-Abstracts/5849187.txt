The objective of this paper is to understand an aspect of human social interaction in public bulletin board systems (BBSs). We try to answer the question of why and how a long and hot chain of articles often emerges in BBSs. This paper presents the following three contributions. (1) empirical results: we measured and analyzed actual BBS logs, and found that the number of articles submitted by each individual in an article chain follows a lognormal distribution. (2) model: to investigate why the distribution emerges through individual activities, we developed a simple model of voluntary submission activity for each individual. With only this simple mechanism, the lognormal distribution shown in actual data is reproduced. (3) analytical solution: we showed that the model generates a lognormal distribution when the number of members in a BBS community is constant, and the individuals in a community are homogeneous

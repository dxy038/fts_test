Following surface mining of the Athabasca Oil Sands deposits in northeastern Alberta, Canada, land reclamation entails the reconstruction of soil-like profiles using salvaged soil materials such as peat and mining by-products. The overall objective of this research was to assess soil organic matter (SOM) quality in different reclamation practices as compared to undisturbed soils found in the region. Soil samples (0â€“10 cm) were taken from 45 plots selected to represent undisturbed reference ecosites and reclamation treatments. Soil OM pools were isolated using a combination of acid hydrolysis and physical separation techniques. Chemical composition of the low density fractions was characterized using ramped cross polarization (RAMP-CP) 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Differences between disturbed and undisturbed sites reflected the influence of different botanical inputs (peat vs. forest litter) to SOM composition. Reconstructed soils were characterized by significantly lower alkyl over O-alkyl carbon (ALK/O-ALK) ratios (0.3) than undisturbed sites (0.5). For these reconstructed soils, a significantly higher proportion of soil carbon was present in the sand associated (Heavy sand) pool (49.2 vs. 37.3) and in the acid-unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) fraction (61.3 vs. 54.7). These SOM parameters were significantly related to time since reconstruction, with the AUR (p value = 0.012) and Heavy sand (p value = 0.05) fractions decreasing with time since reconstruction, while the ALK/O-ALK ratio increased (p value = 0.006). These findings suggest that the ALK/O-ALK, AUR, and Heavy sand parameters are suitable indicators for monitoring SOM quality in these reconstructed soils following oil sands mining.

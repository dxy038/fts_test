In this paper, an image fusion approach based on grey polynomial interpolation (GPI) is presented to enhance the visual quality for a high contrast image. The objective of image fusion is to integrate different source images and to produce an image with higher visual quality than the source images. In this paper, two source images are obtained by a camera with different exposure parameters. One is of high exposure and the other low. With the GPI, two source images are fused. The results for the given examples indicate that the proposed approach has achieved the goal and is of better visual quality when compared with the scheme in [1].

In this paper, an improved nonlinear image enhancement (NIE) algorithm is proposed for the improvement of the quality of blurred images. Obviously, different parts of an image require different sharpening, different edges of an image require different scaling. The procedure of our method utilizes shape-invariant properties of edges across scale by the use of a nonlinear process with the consideration of local characteristics, which allows fine detail enhancement as well as processing of global contrast. Simulation results indicate that the proposed improved NIE algorithm improves the quality of blurred image and obtains a better subjective quality and objective PSNR performance than other NIE methods.

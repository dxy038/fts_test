Background: Aflatoxins are forms of mycotoxins that cause aflatoxicosis in both domestic animals and human population and are both teratogenic and carcinogenic. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a hyroxylated metabolite of aflatoxin B1 which is produced in the liver of animals and can be excreted in the milk.
Objective: The aim of this study was to review systematically previous studies of the aflatoxin contamination in the products of animal origin in Iran.
Methods: This systematic review was conducted on all published studies between 2003 and 2013 that examined and quantified aflatoxin contamination of products of animal origin using HPLC and ELISA methods in different institutes and research centers in Iran. Pubmed, Science Direct, SID and magiran databases were searched.
Finding: 100% of milk samples were contaminated by AFM1 in Iran. The level of AFM1 contamination in the pasteurized milk of Tehran was less than other cities. The level of AFB1contamination was low in meat and other products of animal origin.
Conclusion: High levels of aflatoxin in milk and dairy products indicate the necessity of revising national standards in products of animal origin. Using appropriate methods to neutralize this toxin in the dairy industry should be considered.

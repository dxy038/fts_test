In an effort to develop a simulation framework for evaluating the performance of wireless access technologies for vehicular networks, the authors have developed a simulation framework for the draft wireless technology IEEE 802.11p within the simulator NS-2[1]. Furthermore, handoff mechanisms for the draft technology have also been added to the framework. The latter aims at replicating, as far as possible, the access technology characteristics in the simulator and with the help of scenarios intends to give an objective view of the performance of applications destined for Intelligent Transport Systems. The framework is, in our knowledge, the first framework open to the research community designed to meet the requirements set for vehicle to infrastructure communications, with special attention being paid to the handover process in the infrastructure mode of operation of IEEE 802.11p.

Nowadays, the power transmission network is expanding and is getting more complicated day by day. The problems of uncontrolled loop flows, overloading, excess of short circuit current levels and system instabilities are causes of concern for a power engineer. These serious problems have necessitated new transmission technologies to be adopted such as FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices which make electrical energy transmission more efficient and reliable. Among the FACTS controllers the TCSC (Thyristor Controlled Series Compensators) plays a major role. TCSC is mainly used to enhance line loadability and damp inter-area oscillations for smooth synchronous operation of the interconnected regions. Thus TCSC is used to enhance the effective performance of the system. The main objective of this paper is to examine the improvement of power system stability by introducing TCSC in the power system model through the inspection of their waveforms, where the design and simulation is done by using PSCAD (Power System Computer Aided Design).

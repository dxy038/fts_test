Objective: To assess the efficacy of re-routing the testis in the inguinal canal, in high undescended testis. Material and Methods: Testicular re-routing was done in 19 patients with high undescended testis, where usual dissection of the testis brought it to the superficial inguinal pouch, upper part of scrotum or mid scrotum but with considerable tension. Result: In all nineteen cases in which the procedure was employed, satisfactory mid scrotal position was achieved without extra complication which was not possible with routine dissection. Conclusion: Testicular re-routing is a simple, and useful method in achieving, a mid scrotal position, not possible with ordinary dissection of the testis.

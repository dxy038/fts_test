The fuzzy weighted average (FWA), which is a function of fuzzy numbers and is useful as an aggregation method in management and engineering science based on fuzzy sets theory by Zadeh. It provides a discrete approximate solution by &#194;&#191;-cuts level representation of fuzzy sets and interval analysis. Since the FWA method has an exponential complexity, thus several researches have focused on reducing this complexity. This paper also presents an enhanced fuzzy weighted average approach to achieve the objective of reducing the complexity. This proposed approach is through an improved initial solution for original FWA algorithm, and a two-phase concept by extending and applying both the algorithms of Chang et al. (2006) and Guu (2002). Its complexity is O(n) the same as Guu (2002) which is the best level achieved to date. This paper a practical example for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) selected under military requirements, which have illustrated and demonstrated the usefulness of this study.

This correspondence presents and investigates a fast algorithm
for the tracking of nonstationary environments in power inversion
arrays. The algorithm is based on the use of iterative least squares techniques
and the introduction of an additional gradient vector in the objective
function so that both the optimal weight vector and its rate of change are estimated
recursively. Although the algorithm is computationally more complex
than conventional least squares methods, it has better performance in
tracking moving sources as the velocities of the latter are also being estimated.

The main objective of pavement management is to provide comfortable roads for the users. The present serviceability index (PSI) is established to determine the quality of the road. Present serviceability rating (PSR), rutting, roughness and pavement distress data, etc. for the provincial and county road in Taiwan were collected in this study. Considering the interaction among parameters which deteriorate pavement condition, the fuzzy integral method is used to establish the non-interactive integrated performance value. Because the conventional regression model cannot deal with the fuzzy characteristic existed in the PSR, fuzzy regression model is used to establish the PSI relationship between subjective rating (PSR) and objective survey (parameters).

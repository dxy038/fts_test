Choosing inappropriate monetary policies in the past decades and the appearance of new economic problems led to paying attention to the issue of optimization in choosing the desirable monetary policy and to such concepts as the cost of inflation reduction, time inconsistency, Nash equilibrium, and the credibility and reputation of the central bank. The optimization process results in policy rules and reaction functions, which the central banks are required officially to announce and follow in order to achieve their objective functions.
This study aims at answering the question whether, considering the interest constraint in the Iranian banking system, it is possible to identify an optimal policy rule as a guide for the long-term pathway of monetary policy. To this end, it addresses two well-known monetary policy rules, that is Taylor rule and McCallum rule, the former being based on the stock money rate and the latter on the rate of monetary base, and tries to investigate their compatibility with the interest free banking system. It also tries to examine the hypothesis that these two monetary-policy rules, in being concentrated on the money stock rate and the rate of monetary base, apply to the interest-free banking. The study shows that considering the efficiency of these two rules in empirical works in connection with some developing countries, with some flexibility they can also function as suitable rules for the long term monetary policies.

    The objective of this study was to examine composition of fatty acids in the muscle tissue of common carp (cyprinus carpio), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Arigtichthys nobilis) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), with the aim to find out to what extent the fatty acid compositions is capable to distinguish these freshwater fish. Among all the samples, palmitic and oleic acids were the principal saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The dominant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in bighead and grass carp were docosahexaenoic acid and in common and silver carps were linoleic and linolenic acids, respectively. The results of principle component analysis showed that among studied variables (fatty acids), C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, C20:5, C22:5, C22:6, MUFA, PUFA6, PUFA/SFA, EPA+DHA, n3/n6 and n6/n3 had the most influence on species differentiation. The composition of fatty acid in different carp species is likely to be determined by differences in the nutrition of food sources and the enzymatic activity of fatty acid biosynthesis.

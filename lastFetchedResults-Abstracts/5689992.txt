The authors discuss two optimization techniques for finding the minimum of an objective function while avoiding a saddle point solution. The first is a technique to handle the unconstrained objective function and the second is a technique to handle the constrained optimization problem. The winner-take-all neural network problem and the winner-take-all problem with constraints are considered

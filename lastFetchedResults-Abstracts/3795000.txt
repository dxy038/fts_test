This paper describes a decision support system that indicates to a power plant operator the effect of daily operation on plant lifetime consumption and recommends short-term operating strategies that optimize plant economic performance. The recommended operating strategy is based on the optimization of an objective function that includes terms for revenues from energy sales, production costs, and plant ageing. Plant ageing is based on models that are directly load dependent and incorporate a memory aspect-a feature that is missing from common lifetime modeling techniques. The optimization results in a trade-off between maximization of immediate profits (i.e., earnings achieved by selling heat and power) and minimization of lifetime consumption. Model predictive control and the mixed logical dynamic (MLD) approach are used to solve the posed optimization problem.

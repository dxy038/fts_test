This paper addresses the problem of video server selection in a distributed video-on-demand system. The objective of the problem is to balance the load among video servers and to minimize the delay for the video requests to be served. In order to achieve this objective, a near optimal assignment algorithm is proposed for video server selection. Empirical study shows that our proposed algorithm is able to achieve good load balancing performance as compared to some landmark algorithms

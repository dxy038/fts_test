Emergency voltage control problems in electric power networks, which typically feature relatively slow dynamics, have stimulated the interest for the implementation of online optimal control techniques. Nonetheless for realistically sized networks the complexity of the associated optimization problem may prove to be prohibitive; in this sense it is therefore necessary to provide an adequate modelling scheme that captures the interdependence between discrete and continuous dynamics and the behaviour of the inherent nonlinearities while yielding a system description that is not overly onerous and viable for online computation purposes. In view of this objective the present paper extends previous work done in terms of a model predictive voltage control approach in power systems based on a mixed-logical-dynamical model formulation while employing an alternative and simpler scheme to extend the applicability of the method to a 12-bus sample network model.

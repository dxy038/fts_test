Health monitoring is of critical importance for safe and reliable machine operations. This paper presents the design of a digital wireless data transmitter to extend the applicability of sensors to locations where wire based solutions are not feasible. The design was based on the code division multiple access (CDMA) technique, with the objective to provide a generic solution for embedded machine health monitoring systems

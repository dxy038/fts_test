The objective of this paper is to simulate and study the dynamics of a linear variable reluctance motor using coupled network models. The need for an explicit functional expression to describe flux linkage has been eliminated, since the magnetic subsystem is coupled to, and simultaneously solved with, the dynamics of the electrical and mechanical subsystems. This paper focuses on the development of a coupled network model that incorporates the effects of magnetic saturation and spatial harmonics, and also includes the application of position control software interacting with the physical system.

The objective of this paper is to investigate a modeling methodology called QTES (quantized transform-expand-sample) which can be used to model network traffic taking into consideration both the marginal and the autocorrelation function of the empirical data. An effort is made towards an algorithmic procedure rather than a heuristic search, thereby largely automating QTES modeling

Natural Resources develop and implement action plans designed for direct contact with the forest road network development and ease of access to the deep forests and mountain areas in particular Contract. Today, GIS can be used Azqablyt large volumes of data paths in the design and evaluation, be managed in a short time. The main objective of this study was prepared the map capabilities through appropriate road forest, mountain and forest stands in Series 8 Spiroud regard to technical road forest after harvesting, and also the maps needed to identify factors that influence the cross road in the study area. To prepare the base map in GIS for assessing DEM used to produce the 3D map. These factors includes dip in the Arc map maps, directions, soil, geology, type size, commercial volume and the altitude of the region were provided with a raster format. Then, the floor plans prepared by the relative importance of classes in the range of 1 to 9 were rated. Then according to hierarchical analysis (AHP) the weight value of maps was obtained. Map data combined with weight factors in environment, GIS, maps were capable for crossing the road. The results showed that using this method, which can be potential areas for the road through the forest road in the mountainous north and identify

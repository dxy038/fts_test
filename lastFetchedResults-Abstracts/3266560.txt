In cognitive radio networks, wideband spectrum sensing is a key requirement for cognitive radio access. Different node allocation schemes will lead to the different sensing performance between the sub-bands that compose the wideband. If the detection accuracy of some sub-band is much low, the primary user (PU) will be interfered severely. Thus, the system fairness which is measured by the minimum sensing performance between the sub-bands is proposed. In order to guarantee wideband spectrum sensing fairness, in this paper, we investigate node allocation schemes to maximize the minimum sensing performance between the sub-bands. we propose iterative hierarchical hungarian allocation(IHHA), bow-shaped allocation(BSA), class division allocation(CDA) to realize the Max-Min objective. Furthermore, on the basis of PU priority level and anti-interference capability, the frequency band property parameter (BPP) is defined. By improving the minimum sensing performance with BPP, modified fairness that suits for the actual scene is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes perform excellently in improving the overall sensing fairness of the whole system.

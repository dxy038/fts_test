To transmit the teaching of digital electronics today, considerations are outlined which must be kept in mind. Digital electronics is evolving quickly and its techniques and tools have revolutionized the manner of analyzing simulating, synthesizing and verifying digital systems. Microelectronic development is more and more dependant on the technology and on design methodology. Standard hardware description languages (Verilog and VHDL), together with simulation and synthesis tools are some of the drivers behind microelectronic development. The &#8220;constructivist&#8221; model in the teaching-learning process proposes: significant learning as opposed to memorizing; structuring and sequencing of content; learning through guided discovery and a spiral or recurring procedure. These circumstances, together with pedagogical concern and the knowledge and experience that the authors have acquired as digital electronics teaching Professors have resulted in the formulation of a curricular proposal to transmit this updated teaching method. Using this teaching model as a base, the aim of the proposal is to have the student studying digital electronics acquire the theory and practices (know-how) from the beginning by using current design methodologies and CAD and EDA tools that the students will use in their professional future. Another objective of this method is to provide students with multimedia applications as a learning resource

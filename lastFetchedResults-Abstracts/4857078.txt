This paper presents the studies of traffic management in the satellite ATM bridge based on a RACE II project-CATALYST R2074. The objective is to allocate adequate resources to the given traffic for specified quality of service. A traffic management mechanism has been developed in the light of CCITT recommendations on B-ISDN. The satellite ATM bridge will play a very important role in the initial interconnections of B-ISDN islands and in the further development of the B-ISDN for mobile communications and direct broadcast services

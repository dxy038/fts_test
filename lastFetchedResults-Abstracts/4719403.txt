The command and communications architecture implemented by the International Space Station (ISS) Program (ISSP) determines the amount of data that can be transmitted to (i.e., "uplinked") and received from (i.e., "downlinked") the ISS vehicle. The current system design reflects cost reductions imposed over the last 13 years, and constrains data flows to much lower rates than are technologically feasible. These constraints will result in loss of irreplaceable opportunities for exploiting the science that could be returned from experiments conducted in the microgravity environment of the ISS. NASA has embarked on a series of projects to upgrade the end-to-end ISS Program communications architecture. This work summarizes the content and schedule of projects currently underway and planned, as well as future potential efforts which still are in concept definition. The objective is to provide a high-level summary of prospective improvements in ISS science support as an aid to designing ISS experiment hardware, software and procedures to take maximum advantage of those improvements.

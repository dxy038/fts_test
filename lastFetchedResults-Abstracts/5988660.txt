This paper describes the development, through the analysis of figure-copying tasks, of a powerful, integrated set of image processing algorithms to monitor the neurological function of patients undergoing long term haemodialysis. The technique has been developed as part of a robust and non-invasive computer-based system to provide an objective assessment while still preserving the traditional test environment

The objective of ODP is according to ITU-T Recommendation X.901 stated as follows: &#8220;The objective of ODP standardization is the development of standards that allow the benefits of distributing information processing services to be realized in an environment of heterogeneous IT resources and multiple organizational domains. These standards address constraints on system specification and the provision of a system infrastructure that accommodate difficulties inherent in the design and programming of distributed systems.&#8221; This objective seems to cover cloud computing systems. Therefore, we in this paper discuss the concepts of cloud, and discuss the use of RM-ODP for specifying the solution. We indicate that the current RM-ODP may be too abstract for the purpose, and indicate how to adapt RM-ODP to fit the purpose.

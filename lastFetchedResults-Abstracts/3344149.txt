With the advent of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), carbon capture power plant (CCPP) has become a vital part of modern day power systems. However, introduction of CCPPs in power systems has a significant impact on dispatch strategies as CCS consumes energy for their operation though they reduce emission. In this work a Modified Imperialistic Competition Algorithm (MICA) based solution procedure is proposed for solving multi-objective Economic Emission Dispatch problem (EED) in a power system with CCPP. A fuzzy set theory based selection method is adopted for selecting the best compromise solution out of a set of non-dominated Pareto solutions of EED problem. Proposed approach is implemented on a 6-generator test system. Results demonstrate the effects of CCPP on economy and emission of the system and effectiveness of MICA in handling multi-objective non-linear optimization problems.

A circularly polarized slotted substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) array antenna is presented. The objective is to verify the capabilities of a new type of slot to maintain good circular polarization radiation performances for beams scanned over a large angle range. A Rotman lens has been designed to feed a 15 slotted waveguides array generating a set of independent beams covering the &#177;60&#176; angle range. Each slotted waveguide contains 16 annular slots.

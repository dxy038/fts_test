This paper presents the initial results of the development of an approach for the hybrid control of a class of switched hybrid dynamical systems. This approach involves partitioning the state space of each mode in to domains and designing controllers for each sub-domain. The proposed approach is applied to the control of a simplified model of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) drivetrain where the control objective is to achieve a seamless transition between electric launch and parallel hybrid operating modes of the vehicle. Performance of the proposed hybrid controller is demonstrated using a simulation model of the drivetrain.

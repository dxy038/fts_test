The study objective is to develop a visual simulation software that is user friendly to show pollutant diffusion laws in a kitchen, which is based on the programming technology of OpenGL on VC++6.0 platform; modify the measured data and find the best area and find the best location and method to control pollutants. We set up theoretically mathematic model of pollutant diffusion. The pollutants are from cooking and burning liquefied-gas in a closed kitchen. This paper only covers pollutant diffusion without mechanical ventilation. And we obtain 2-d and 3-d distribution figures of pollutants in a case study, and compare the results from the software to those from two other methods, Gaussian calculation model and the CFD simulation software. Their relative simulation figures conform well. Then we present that the visual simulation results are similar to the reality; the simulation of the pollutant distribution in a closed kitchen without ventilation with this software is correct and feasible; and the software can be used to simulate the pollutant distribution in a closed kitchen without ventilation. It also lays a foundation for the study on the complicated conditions, such as, dynamic simulation with ventilation.

Finite element (FE) analysis has been widely used to study the behaviour of bone or implants in many clinical applications. One of the main factors in analyses is the realistic behaviour of the bone model, because the behaviour of the bone is strongly dependent on a realistic bone material property assignment. The objective of this study was to compare isotropic and orthotropic inhomogeneous material models used for FE analyses of the “global” proximal femur and “small” specimens of the bone (cancellous and cortical). Our hypothesis was that realistic material property assignment (orthotropy) is very important for the FE analyses of small bone specimens, whereas in global FE analyses of the proximal femur, this assignment can be omitted, if the inhomogeneous material model was used. The three-dimensional geometry of the “global” proximal femur was reconstructed using CT scans of a cadaveric femur. This model was implemented into an FE simulation tool and various bone material properties, dependant on bone density, were assigned to each element in the models. The “small” specimens of cortical and cancellous bone were created in the same way as the model of the proximal femur. The results obtained from FE analyses support our above described hypothesis.

For a residential PV installed application complete utilization of battery banks is key to reduce grid dependency and improved reliability. To achieve this objective itÂ´s important to keep battery banks at nearly equal state of charges. This paper proposes a technique to keep battery banks within limit by switching isolated panels. Selection of isolated panels is done by considering irregularity of roof top. In addition, to decrease grid reliance and improve reliability a switching pattern is developed for a household installed PV system considering generation and load pattern. The proposed technique and switching pattern is verified in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.

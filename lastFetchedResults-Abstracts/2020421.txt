Evaluation of genotype × environment interaction with the objective of selection of the superior genotypes is the most important part of breeding programs. In this study, twelve promising winter rapeseed lines with one check cultivar (Okapi) was investigated for the stability and grouping using Lin and Butler cluster analysis methods. Experiments were performed in randomized complete block design with three replications at Karaj, Kermanshah, Bojnurd, Hamedan, Isfahan, and Arak research stations during two cropping seasons (2010-12). The data of Bojnurd and Arak were omitted because of the high error mean squres shown by Bartlet's statistic. Combined analysis of variance performed by assuming environments (years and locations) as random and genotypes as fixed factors. The results of combined analysis showed that the interaction effects of year×location and year × location × genotypes were significant at 1% and 5% level of probability, respectively. The results of clustering using the first model showed that promising lines No. L137, L201 and L119 were the most stable lines. The second model divided lines in to two groups. In the first group, the same lines with the maximum regression coefficients were recognized as stable genotypes for favorable environment. In the second group, line L63 with the minimum regression coefficient was suitable for unfavorable environments.

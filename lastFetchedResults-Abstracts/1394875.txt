The objective of this paper is to describe the modified Dahl and Masing models used for predicting hysteretic behavior, and tested on a belt tensioner for automotive engines. An experimental study with deflection imposed on the tensioner is first carried out to identify hysteresis loop parameters for the two models. The models are implemented in the general motion equations which govern the behavior of a belt–tensioner–mass system. Particular attention is paid to the use of numerical schemes. The numerical and experimental investigations show the reliability of the modified Dahl model.

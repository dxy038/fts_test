Existing operational rate-distortion shape coding aims at finding a polygon which can be encoded with the lowest bit rate under a given upper bound on the edge error. However, this upper bound may cause noticeable errors. Therefore, we add an &#8467;<sub>2</sub>-norm error regularization term to the objective function, and seek the globally optimal solution using a shortest path algorithm for a weighted directed acyclic graph. Experiments confirm the accuracy and robustness of our method.

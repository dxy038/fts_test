The objective of this research was to use non-linear models to describe the growth pattern
in Santa Inês sheep and to study the influence of environmental effects on curve parameters
with the best-fit model. The models included the Brody, Richards, Von Bertalanffy,
Gompertz, and Logistic models. We used 773 field reports on 162 animals ranging in age
from 120 to 774 days, including 46 males and 116 females. The statistics used to evaluate
the quality of fit included RMS (residual mean square), C% (percentage of convergence),
R2 (adjusted determination coefficient) and MAD (mean absolute deviation). Of the fixed
effects studied, the only significant relationship was the effect of sex on parameter A. The
Richards model was problematic during the process of convergence. Considering all studied
criteria, the Logistic model presented the best fit in describing the growth pattern in Santa
Inês sheep.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the correlations between the quantitative MRI parameter, T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time, and the viscoelastic storage modulus for low concentrations of agarose gel. T<sub>2</sub> values were determined from MR image maps generated by a 3T scanner. The storage modulus was measured by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). It was found that the T<sub>2</sub> values decreased, while the storage modulus increased, with higher agarose concentrations.

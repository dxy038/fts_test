Entropy weight is a kind of objective weight. It can be calculated in terms of information entropy which was put forward by Shannon. If entropy weight was applied in the model of fuzzy synthetic evaluation, the subjectivity can be avoided during ascertaining weights. The model of fuzzy synthetic evaluation based on entropy weight was applied in safety evaluation on fully mechanized mining faces in the 6th mine of PING Dingshan Coal Industry Group Co. Ltd. The evaluation result indicates that this method was more reasonable than generic fuzzy synthetic evaluation. At the same time, the problems existing in fully mechanized mining faces were pointed out and corresponding countermeasures were put forward.

Introduction&Objective: Formalin and copper sulfate  are compounds than those who are constantly in aquaculture to treat parasitic infections and bacterial infections are used. Fish gills are as organs that are constantly exposed to the external environment and because of its role in respiration and osmotic balance of these chemicals and heavy metal are the first target. The purpose of this study is of histopathological effects of copper sulfate and formaldehyde concentrations on gill tissue of white fish in the Caspian Sea
Materials & Methods: In this research, indication of probable was teforgill tissues of Caspian white fish with average weight of 428 mg and length weight of 3.5cm is addressed after exposing to different compactness of copper sulfate (in 20 minutes short time care and 24 hours long time care, 100ppm and 1ppm) and formalin (in short time care and long time care, 25ppm and 250ppm). After stabilizing tissues in 10 percent formalin and making 5 micrometer section, it is painted with hematoxylin method and is studied by optical microscope. 
Results: The results showed that lying gill in the proximity of 1ppm per copper sulfate litter can cause to start as lighthy per plagy at gill secondary blade. In compactness of 100ppm, these was tesare enhanced and brings about phenol mena such as hyperplagyin the gill primary and secondary lamell as and very much hyperemia was evident. 
Conclusion: The results of lyinggill in proximity of 25ppm formalin ,a little hyperemi a was evident and in long time cause the presence of red globule.

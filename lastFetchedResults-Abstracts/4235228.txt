In VLSI/ULSI ICs, high speed was and still is and will be a main concern. However, as the &#8220;on the move with anywhere, anytime and anyone&#8221; era comes in reality, portability becomes an essential feature of the electronic systems interfacing with non-electronic systems, emphasizing the efficient use of energy as a major design objective. This paper introduces a new optimization criteria in addition to performance and area. New results in energy consumption reduction by processing technology, device structures, circuit techniques, software and system architecture are reviewed. Considerable advances are possible, reducing the power by more than two orders of magnitude

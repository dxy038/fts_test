Introduction: The articles indexed in accredited citation databases essentially indicate how
scientists share knowledge and promote sustainable development in each country. Therefore, according
to citations to the papers of individuals, it could be possible to assess the rate of their acceptability
in the scientific community. The main objective of this study was to review Lotka's
law of scientific productivity and Bradford's law of scatter in scientific productions among researchers
at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) whose articles have been cited in
Web of Science (WOS) database during 1992-2008.
Methods: This was an applied study using scientometric indicators. Data was collected, sorted
and analyzed in two phases and with two tools. In the first stage, data was extracted from the
WOS in the form of plain text and stored on a personal computer. In the second stage, using
ISI.exe, data was identified, analyzed and entered into spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel. In this
research, Bradford's law of scatter, collaboration rates formula and Lotka's law of scientific production
were used.
Results: The results showed that the distribution of articles by authors at IUMS followed Lotka's
law, i.e., a few writers released a large portion of the scientific products. In addition, the distribution
frequency of journals published by IUMS followed Bradford's law, i.e., a small number of
journals published the highest number of scientific papers. Moreover, the researchers at IUMS
collaborated most with authors from the United States, Canada and England.
Conclusion: The results of the present study indicated that the researchers of IUMS highly collaborate
in writing their papers. Generally, collaboration rate in this university was equal to 0.967
which was relatively high.

This paper presents an investigation into the optimization of power system stabilizer (PSS) parameters using multi-power flow conditions. A simple objective function takes into account all the critical operating conditions. The steepest descent optimization method based on eigenvalue sensitivity is used for the minimization of the objective function. Two types of PSSs are evaluated, namely, the optimized PSS (OPSS) based on multi-power flow conditions and the conventional PSS (CPSS). It is shown that the OPSS performs better than the CPSS on a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system.

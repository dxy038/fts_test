Although biodata has been shown to be one of the best predictors of employee performance and turnover, a number of important issues remain unresolved (e.g., how broadly or narrowly should biodata be defined?). This paper has three main objectives. The first objective is to provide a selective but representative review of the research that has been conducted on the use of biodata for employee selection. The second objective is to constructively critique this research. This critique is intended to highlight deficiencies of this research that may limit the conclusions that should be drawn. The paper's third objective is to stimulate important future research on biodata that avoids the limitations of past research.

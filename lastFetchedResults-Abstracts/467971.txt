OBJECTIVE: This article reports our experience with minilaparotomy hysterectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Minilaparotomy was defined as a skin incision â‰¤6 cm in length. From January 1, 1996, to June 30, 1997, data were collected on all patients who underwent hysterectomy by means of a minilaparotomy.
RESULTS: During the study a total of 250 hysterectomies were performed. Twenty-six of those were performed by means of a minilaparotomy. The mean age of the patients was 54 years. Seven had endometrial cancer and 8 had an adnexal mass. In 1 patient the incision was extended for staging of an ovarian cancer. The only intraoperative complication was rupture of a 6-cm ovarian tumor. After operation, 2 patients had febrile morbidity, 1 had a prolonged ileus, and in 1 atrial fibrillation developed. The mean uterine weight was 123 g. Median day of Foley catheter removal and mean day of ambulation, regular diet, and discharge were 1 day, 1.2 days, 2.4 days, and 3.4 days, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Minilaparotomy is a safe and feasible route of hysterectomy for a selected group of patients. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:316-20.)

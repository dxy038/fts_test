In the last two decades the Internet technology has boosted and the connection speeds have been incrased from kilobits to hundred megabits scale. With the rising coverage of the Internet and the usage of mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones, the usage of social media and especially multimedia elements has been increased rapidly. This increment in streaming multimedia created a need for the assessment of the user experience on multimedia and especially video. Even though there are different Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods for that purpose, most of them are Full-Reference (FR) or Reduced-Reference (RR). In todayÂ´s world with many mobile devices, the application of these methods are not possible since they need the reference data. The No-Reference (NR) video metrics are much more suitable for the case. In this paper, the main objective is to evaluate a previously proposed NR VQA metric with a new dataset and to compare the results to other highperformance NR metrics such as G.1070 and G.1070E which do not utilize spatial and temporal characteristics of a given video sequence. Evaluation and comparison results show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed metric.

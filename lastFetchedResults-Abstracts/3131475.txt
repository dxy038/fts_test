The purpose of this paper is to promote the intensive land-use of districts and countries, and provide the theoretical basis for intensive land-use evaluation on other province of China. Method of AHP and entropy were employed. The result gives the intensive land-use evaluation system for districts and counties, and the AHP-entropy evaluation method is provided. In accordance with the location of districts and counties, the function of different area, the data of different years, this method can provides the domain-value of different evaluation level. This method can also calculate the variable weights by the combination of variable entropy objective weights and AHP subjective weights. It can make a more objective evaluation about the intensive land-use level on some districts in a particular year, and enhance the comparability between districts and counties which have the same or similar economic, function and environmental.

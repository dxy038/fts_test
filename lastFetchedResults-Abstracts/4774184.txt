The proportion of senile people tends to increase in the global population. The cognitive impairment in the three dimensional (3D) space is usually associated with senile dementia. This paper presents a computer-aid tool developed to evaluate and train the cognitive ability in the 3D space by using the virtual reality technique. Once the norm is developed, this tool can assist the physiotherapist to evaluate the patientsÂ´ 3D cognitive function in a more objective and efficient way. The viability of 3D cognitive training will be evaluated among the normal subjects prior to clinical trials

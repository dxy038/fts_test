The use of the dual voltage system 14 V/42 V in the electric systems of cars brings many advantages, but it also poses new challenges like a bigger short circuits (SC) casuistic. The fussing management system (FMS) is responsible for managing the 14 V-gnd, 42 V-gnd and 14 V-42 V short circuits, with the objective of eliminating them as soon as possible, reducing in this way the harmful effects for the wires, batteries and electrical loads. In this paper we show an implementation of the FMS with the communication protocol RDbus. We discuss the basic ideas used in the FMS, its main benefits and the experimental results obtained with 14 V-42 V short circuits.

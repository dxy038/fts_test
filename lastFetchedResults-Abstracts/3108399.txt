Grinding robots must hold and guide a grinding tool in the face of large vibratory loads. This paper presents an optimal compliance design for grinding tool suspension systems, with the objective of reducing vibrations and maximizing material removal rate. First, the endpoint compliance matrix of the main robot is utilized to determines the optimal workpiece position and orientation. Then a method for determining the optimal end-effector compliance matrix for a given workpiece position and orientation is presented.

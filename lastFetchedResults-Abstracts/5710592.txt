In this paper, we propose a guide system for daily life in semipublic spaces by adopting a gaze-communicative stuffed-toy robot and a gaze-interactive display board. The system provides naturally anthropomorphic guidance through a) gaze-communicative behaviors of the stuffed-toy robot (ldquojoint attentionrdquo and ldquoeye-contact reactionsrdquo) that virtually express its internal mind, b) voice guidance, and c) projection on the board corresponding to the userpsilas gaze orientation. The userpsilas gaze is estimated by our remote gaze-tracking method. The results from both subjective/objective evaluations and demonstration experiments in a semipublic space show i) the holistic operation of the system and ii) the inherent effectiveness of the gaze-communicative guide.

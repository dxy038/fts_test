As knowledge is usually heterogeneous, voluminous, poorly structured and steadily evolving, its automated use in practice is extremely difficult. These limitations remain the main blocking element for creating advanced, adaptive business processes providing intelligent assistance. In this paper we propose to extend the typical business process development view, mainly focusing on services composition, with a business intelligence view which aims to support the design of complex, automatically reconfigurable services. To fulfil this objective, we designed an approach that consists in setting up an intelligent environment based on a context-aware concepts ontology of business processes and on related context handling rules for services orchestration. ItÂ´s a generic method that enables to capture and to granulate the knowledge into a set of models that support dynamic business processes management. We demonstrate the relevance of this approach for the design of automatic and personalised decision support services orchestration based on a core ontology.

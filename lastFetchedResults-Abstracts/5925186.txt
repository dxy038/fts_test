The concept of next generation (xG) networks is a novel paradigm that attempts to mitigate spectrum overcrowding and inefficiencies. This objective is envisaged to be accomplished by allowing unlicensed users to utilize licensed parts of the spectrum opportunistically, without disrupting the quality of service (QoS) for licensed users. The cornerstone of xG networks lies in the ability of the device to sense the surrounding spectral environment and use this knowledge to alter its transceiver characteristics. This paper addresses the pertinent issue of determining whether the spectrum in a particular television band is occupied by a licensed national television standards committee (NTSC) signal or some other unlicensed signal. The differentiation between the two signals employs correlation detection based on a locally most powerful test.

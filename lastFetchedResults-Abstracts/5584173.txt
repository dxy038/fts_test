This paper aims to study the logistics scheduling with due date assignment and batch delivery. A set of orders needs to be processed by the manufacturer and delivered to the customers upon completion. Each customer has a specific acceptable lead time. The manufacturer assigns a due date for one order by negotiating with the customers. The problem is to assign appropriate due date for the orders, and find a joint schedule of order processing at the manufacturer and order delivery from the manufacturer to the customers that minimize the total cost. The objective is to minimize the total tardiness penalty, due date assignment and delivery costs. For this problem, we analyze the complexity of the general case and study the solvability of multiple case by providing efficient algorithms.

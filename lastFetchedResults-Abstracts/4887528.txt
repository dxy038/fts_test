This paper describes a trimming approach to compensate the frequency response errors which occur on the realized active RC filter circuit that operates in the relatively high frequency range. The objective elements of the compensation are limited to the resistors, and the compensation rates from the original resistors´ values are limited to be positive, because of the easy operation for the actual laser trimming. The compensated resistors´ values are calculated from the transfer function with the nominal value of the Op Amp´s GB product using the functional trimming technique

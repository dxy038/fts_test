Optical three dimensional scanning for weld distortion measurements have been performed for validation, inspection, general visualization and documentation of a robotized welding process. The planning, preparing and processing of the weld is done in a simulation-based concept where computer aided robotics software simulations are integrated with finite element analysis simulations with the objective to reduce global geometrical deformation during welding. The off-line programmed robot paths were used as an input for finite element calculations of temperature fields and distortion in the work piece. In order to validate the finite element model 3D-scannings have been performed before and after every single welding sequence. This paper describes a validation experiment with non-contact measurements of weld distortion and discusses limitations in optical 3D-scanning techniques used for this purpose

Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the definitions and beliefs regarding fetal station among pregnancy caregivers.
Study design
Residents, nurses, and faculty at 5 teaching centers in Denver, Colo, were given surveys to determine what definitions were being used for fetal station and the perceived importance of these definitions.
Results
There were 243 responses from the 453 surveys. We found 4 definitions were in use: level of the presenting part in relationship to ischial spines in (1) centimeters or (2) thirds, and level of the biparietal diameter in relationship to the ischial spines in (3) centimeters or (4) thirds. Few caregivers were aware that other caregivers were using different definitions of fetal station.
Conclusion
This lack of standardization may lead to errors in the care of laboring patients.

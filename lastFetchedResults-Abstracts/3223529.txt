In the optimization of distribution systems, decision makers have to face with conflicting objectives, so that a multi-objective formulation of the optimization problem is needed. The application of a specific solver allows to determine the non-dominated points representing the compromise solutions presented to the decision-makers. In order to rank the compromise solutions, this paper adopts a criterion based on Decision Theory concepts as the ranking tool. Results of a case study carried out on a test network are presented.

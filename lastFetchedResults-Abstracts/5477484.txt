The objective is to study the feasibility of remotely monitoring people with diabetes using low-cost technology. Using a personal computer, randomly chosen people with type I diabetes transmit their diabetes related data to their physician at Georgetown University Medical Center on a weekly basis where he analyzes it and contacts the patient every week to make safe adjustments to diet, exercise plan and insulin dose to prevent different kinds of diseases. Based on the data received the physician at the Endocrinology Department was able to early correct blood glucose levels for many patients enrolled in the program and prevent many possible clinical complications. This preliminary study indicates that tight monitoring people with diabetes and frequent patient physician communication and feedback utilizing a low-cost technology can significantly lower the risk of getting diseases and avoid costly short and long term hospitalizations and ER visits thus increase the quality of life and life expectancy

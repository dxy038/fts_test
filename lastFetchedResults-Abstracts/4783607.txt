The main problem of higher educational institutions is to increase the performance of their students. For this purpose, they always scan studentsÂ´ performance in the class test and quiz of different subjects and take appropriate decision like arrangement of extra lectures on conceptual topics so that they can improve student performance in the examination. They also face the problem to predict the student performance in the examination. If the number of students is less, say 20 to 30 then these analysis can be done manually because teachers can give attention to an individual, but if the student strength is large then it will become a tough task. Our objective is to prepare a Multi-Tenant database for University and propose a result prediction system that can be used to predict the result of any student in coming examinations.

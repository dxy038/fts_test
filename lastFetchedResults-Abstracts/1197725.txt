The objective of the present study was to investigate the benefit of filtration in the physical water treatment used to mitigate mineral scale build-up in heat exchangers. Two types of filters were used: a 5-μm cartridge fabric filter and a sand filter with 20-μm pores, both of which were used at a side-stream loop in a laboratory cooling tower. Heat transfer fouling experiments were conducted using a double-pipe heat exchanger with cooling water at 5 and 8 cycles of concentration with a make-up water hardness of 200–240 ppm. The test results demonstrated that the filtration enhanced the performance of the PWT synergistically, resulting in a near initial peak heat transfer performance in the double-pipe heat exchanger.

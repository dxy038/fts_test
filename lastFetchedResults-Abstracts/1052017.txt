Given the importance of assessment for sound judgment, this study was done to compare the students' and professors' views about the priority of clinical assessment tools.
Materials and Methods: The present study is a descriptive-analytical study with 30 nursing students (the target group) and 10 faculty members (panel of experts) from the dialysis unit. At the beginning, priotity items were used to assess the importance of students' views  and to prevent possible failure of students to respond to open questions of the questionnaire.Then, Tthey were analyzed using nominal group technique. Later, content validity index was calculated using the opinions of the teachers. Tools for prioritizing was developed and were given to the students and teachers. Data were collected and analyzed with SPSS software using descriptive and analytical statistical tests.
Results: Findings showed that there was no significant difference (p >  0.05) between the teachers' and students' options regarding item prioritization. However, after collecting opinions of the students and the teachers about the items, we found that both teachers and students had chosen high-prioritized items.

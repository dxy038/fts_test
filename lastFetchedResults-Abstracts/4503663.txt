Coastal marine and inland landforms are dynamic systems undergoing adjustments in form at different time and space scales in response to varying conditions external to the system. Coastal emerged and nearshore areas, affected by short-term perturbations, return to their pre-disturbance morphology and generally reach a dynamic equilibrium. The objective of this research is to propose innovative remote sensing applications for monitoring and/or combination of existing ones to monitor specific coastal processes in order to quantify and model their time evolution. In particular, it shows which properties are the best proxy for remote sensing characterisation of nearshore coastal areas both emerged and submerged environments by combining multi-sensor spaceborne remote sensing (SAR and OPTICAL) to (a) produce deformation and spatiotemporal variations maps in coastal morphology with a special focus to point out the temporal subsidence evolution, (b) integrate inter and intra-annual change detection maps of vegetation into coastal morphology.

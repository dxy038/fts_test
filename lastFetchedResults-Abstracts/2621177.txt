Introduction: Body type and its relation with spine curve is one of outdated place of interest for engineers and student in field of corrective motions and pathology while scientific and research resources in this regard are rare.
Objective: main objective of this research is to study the relation between body type with lordosis
spine in girls between 15-17 years in public high schools of Tehran-dist 2.
Methodology: study group consisted of 240 girls (15-17) from high-schools in Tehran –dist 2, subjects randomly selected using bunch method among 5 high schools. Thoracis kyphosis and lumber lordosis were measured using flexible ruler, followed by measuring body type (ectomorphy, mesomorphy, endomorphy) using Heath and Carter’s method, in addition 10 variable were measured including height, weight, four skin fold, two bone breadth two limbs’ girth using the same method. Relation between spinal curve and body type analyzed using descriptive statistics methods and Pierson’s correlation.
Results: There is no significant relationship between body types and lumber lordosis (lordosis and endomophy, lordosis and meomorphy, lordosis and ectomorphy).
Discussion: Results show that lordosis have no relation to body type and intensity of such curves are subject to other factors other than body type. Probably among the reasons are muscular weakness, social characteristics, and improper habits (sleeping, standing, seating, and walking) and motor languor.

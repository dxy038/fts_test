Fish sperm motility as a fertilization potential index depends on Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. Because start of sperm motility in fresh water fishes needs both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of water hardness and Ionic factor on the fertilization percent of Acipenser persicus spawns in various water hardness. Therefore,the exploited gametes have been fertilized from a producer in four treatment batches (20, 150, 300 (control group) and 360 mg/l) with three replicates by semi-dry method. The eggs were transferred to glass potted (vase) incubators for incubation. The percent of fertilization on each of the four batches was measured. Water analyses have been performed to determine the amount of Calcium and Magnesium ions. The results show that the appropriate rate of hardness can be 20 to 360 mg/l, provided that there should be ionic balance in the water. However, same results show that the concentration of the required Calcium at the time of Acipenser persicus fertilization is about 5 to 70 mg/l and the required Magnasium this time is about 1 to 48 mg/l.

Forthcoming wideband wireless systems are supposed to support services with loose delay requirements, which allows for scheduling of data. In this work we investigate fast transmission scheduling for downlink CDMA over a Rayleigh fading channel. For a logarithmic relation between the channel quality and the effective transmission rate, merely scheduling one user at a time may not result in maximum channel utilization. Therefore, we analyze the benefits of scheduling several users at a time with a suggested scheduler, containing regular CDMA as a special case. We consider a resource fair scheduler with the objective to asymptotically allocate the same amount of energy to all users. We derive the scheduling gain on closed-form and determine its limit values for both high and low average channel quality. The results show that the better the average channel quality becomes, the more users should be allowed to transmit simultaneously.

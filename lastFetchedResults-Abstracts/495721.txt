The existence of various objectives in agricultural activities makes optimal inputs allocation more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to apply approaches to approximate the objectives to desirable points, simultaneously. In this paper, it was explicated the way of applying multi objective programming (MOP) and compromise programming (CP) in order to make a farm planning in Mashhad plain. It was considered two objectives: maximizing gross margin (GM) and minimizing irrigation water. Efficient sets and the best compromise solutions were obtained by MOP and CP respectively. Results showed that, in compromise solutions GM of small (less than 3 hectare) and medium (between 3 and 8 hectare) farms are increased and irrigation water decreased. Cropping pattern was the same in the model and representative of large farms (more than 8 hectare). According to finds, there is a scope for more efficient use of inputs by increasing size of farms through decreasing the number of farm lands.

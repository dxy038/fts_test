Spiritual leadership is a causal model for organizational change which has been designed to increase the intrinsic motivation of employees and reduce their resistance to organizational changes. This research, by presenting a model based on game theory, seeks to investigate the role of spiritual leadership of employees who tend to resist against organizational change for various reasons. In this model, spiritual leadership can diminish the employees' resistance against change by inspiring faith, hope, altruism, meaningfulness and membership, which obviously incur some costs for the leader and the organization. In contrast, a spiritual leader can act without any regard for the resistance of employees which again incur some costs for organization. Here, the players are the resistant leader and employees who interact with each other. The leader looks for a strategy that can minimize the resistance of employees against change and maximize their productivity with producing minimum cost. In this model, the components of spiritual leadership and employee resistance, the objective function of each player and finally the optimal strategy of the leader relative to the strategies of both sides of the game and the model parameters are examined.

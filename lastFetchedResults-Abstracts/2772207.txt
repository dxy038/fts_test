High-frequency-link (HFL) power conversion systems (PCSs) are attracting more and more attentions in academia and industry for high power density, reduced weight, and low noise without compromising efficiency, cost, and reliability. In HFL PCSs, dual-active-bridge (DAB) isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter (IBDC) serves as the core circuit. This paper gives an overview of DAB-IBDC for HFL PCSs. First, the research necessity and development history are introduced. Second, the research subjects about basic characterization, control strategy, soft-switching solution and variant, as well as hardware design and optimization are reviewed and analyzed. On this basis, several typical application schemes of DAB-IBDC for HPL PCSs are presented in a worldwide scope. Finally, design recommendations and future trends are presented. As the core circuit of HFL PCSs, DAB-IBDC has wide prospects. The large-scale practical application of DAB-IBDC for HFL PCSs is expected with the recent advances in solid-state semiconductors, magnetic and capacitive materials, and microelectronic technologies.

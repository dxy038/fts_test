Modeling, analysis, and design problems and methodologies for centralized and distributed computer-communication networks are discussed. The basic problem is to specify the location and capacity of each communication link within the network. The design objective is to provide a low-cost network which satisfies constraints on response time, throughput, reliability, and other parameters. Fundamental network models for queuing and reliability analysis are described, as are basic properties of various network structures. A number of approaches to the topological design problem are presented; areas where further research is needed are indicated; possible approaches to several unsolved problems are suggested.

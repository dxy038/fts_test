The effect of on the extraction of polysaccharides in leaves of Dendrocalamus Latiflorus was investigated. Based on the yield of polysaccharides that is regarded as the objective, the influences of the several factors such as the contentration of Cellulose enzyme, enzymolysis time, temperature and pH of solution on the extraction efficiency were studied. The optimal conditions for enzymatic cellulose were also determined as follows: the temperature was 50&#176;C, the enzyme dosage was 4<sup>0</sup>/<sub>00</sub>, the volume of water was 20mL, the pH of buffer solution was 4.0, reflux time was 90min, and extraction times was twice, and the yield of polysaccharide was 9.2%. The experiment result indicates that the yield of cellulose enzyme extraction was 12% higher than the yield of hot water that used as solvent.

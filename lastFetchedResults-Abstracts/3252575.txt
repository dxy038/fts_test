The paper describes a novel method for the reduction of unwanted features present in the images obtained using ground penetrating radar (GPR). To achieve this objective a recently developed downsample-upsample filtering technique has been applied to measured GPR images. Results obtained by processing raw GPR images containing high level of unwanted signals and clutter indicate promising performance of the proposed technique. As there is usually no &#8220;ideal&#8221; or clean image available in most of GPR situations and measurements, classical image quality metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and similar are not best suited to evaluate results of this, or indeed any other GPR image enhancement algorithm. This problem is discussed and illustrated in the conclusion of the paper.

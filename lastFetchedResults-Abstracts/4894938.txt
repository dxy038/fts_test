A microgrid consists of various types of smart distributed generators, renewable generators, storage devices and controllable load, which not only must meet their local needs but also are under the hierarchical control of management system. Due to this combination of conventional and renewable sources, the unit commitment becomes more crucial and more complicated in the management of a microgrid. In this paper, an improved genetic algorithm based method is proposed for unit commitment in a microgrid. The genetic algorithm is improved by adopting the simulated annealing technique to accelerate the convergence. The objective is to minimize microgridÂ´s operational cost when it is isolated and maximize its revenue when it is connected to upstream networks.

In this paper, a planar compact bidirectional antenna configuration is proposed for dual wide band operation with wide lower band and ultra wide higher band. This configuration has been analyzed using finite integration technique based commercial software CST studio. An antenna is optimized for 865 MHz to 1.42 GHz lower operating band and 2.5 GHz to 20 GHz higher operating band. The measured return loss agrees with the simulated result.

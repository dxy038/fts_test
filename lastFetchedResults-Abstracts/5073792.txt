In this paper, a novel method for designing a structure that integrates PV modules into a roof environment is developed. The objective of the method is to optimise the thermal behaviour of the PV power system in order to minimise the electrical losses due to the high module operating temperatures. While component dissipation patterns and system operating modes vary widely, a PV roof integrated system was modelled and an analytical solution for maximising the heat transfer per unit of volume or unit of area was found. The mathematical model was verified with computer simulations and with measurements taken in the Oxford Solar House, UK

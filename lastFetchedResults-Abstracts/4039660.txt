Short-term flicker severity (P<sub>st</sub>) is an important electric power quality index defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). P<sub>st</sub> results from the statistical evaluation of flicker over short periods of time producing an objective measure for flicker originating from various types of sources. This paper reviews previous methods for computing P<sub>st</sub> and proposes a new iterative algorithm. The algorithm is computationally efficient and shown to comply with the IEC standard

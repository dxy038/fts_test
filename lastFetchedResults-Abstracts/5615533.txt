A technique of adaptive control, called an accelerated gradient method, is presented which is capable of adapting rapidly to plant parameter variations. It is based upon the objective of improving the stability characteristics of a gradient-type model reference adaptive control system. A design procedure is developed for an nth order linear plant. It is applied to the control of pitch motion for an airframe; simulation results comparing the technique with conventional gradient methods are presented.

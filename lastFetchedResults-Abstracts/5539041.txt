This paper deals with the problem of minimizing the losses of electrical distribution systems, in the presence of power generator nodes in a smart-grid paradigm and by considering service quality requirements. The distribution network is modeled as a graph where nodes are the distribution network nodes and branches represent feeder sections. Moreover, the distribution network reconfiguration problem is solved by a mixed-integer quadratic programming and a multi-objective Pareto approach in two stages. First, a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem is defined in order to find a radial operating structure that minimizes the system power losses while satisfying structural and operating constraints. Second, a service quality index is assigned to each solution obtained at the first stage and a Pareto frontier is determined. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a benchmark distribution network is tested.

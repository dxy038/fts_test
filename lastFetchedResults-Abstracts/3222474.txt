Development of an underwater acoustic communication system is a necessity for the majority of the nation as a sea area of Indonesia. Most area s of the ocean in Indonesia is shallow, the environment has unique characteristics compared to other countries. It is a challenge in the research underwater acoustic communication system. This paper presented a preliminary study of the developing of soft acoustic modem testbed for underwater acoustic communication system with OFDM technique. Modem has been implemented on a PC with Matlab, with the objective to evaluate the algorithm development. Image file in JPEG format is encoded with a discrete cosine transform (DCT). To improve performance, information is encoded with a forward error correction, FEC-Hamming. The system uses BPSK modulation, OFDM transmission techniques, and using acoustic signal as carrier wave. In this system, the occupation bandwidth is 5.3 kHz, transmission rate of 3.7 k sps, and center frequency at 13.3 kHz. As an initial stage, the model presented in the form of simulator tesbed passband, and is treated with the propagation parameters that was obtained from measurements in a Towing Tank in previous experiment. The next stage is tesbed evaluation through experimental in a laboratory, such the effect of conversion process from electrical to audio signal at PC sound card and the capability of the receiver to recover the information.

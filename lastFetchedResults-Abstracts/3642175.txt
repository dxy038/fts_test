System and component design for the ultrahigh velocity, guided electromagnetic defensive interceptor (GEDI) experiment is underway and initial fabrication has begun. Figure 1 is an artistÂ´s sketch of the experimental facility. The objective of the GEDI experiment is to accelerate a 1-g mass to 50 km/s. Prime power for the experiment will be supplied by the 60 MJ, 9-HA Balcones homopolar generator (BHPG) power supply located at the Center for Electromechanics at The University of Texas at Austin (CEM-UT). This power supply consists of six 10-MJ HPGs which can be connected in various series/parallel configurations or sequentially discharged for pulse shaping. Power conditioning consists of six room-temperature copper coaxial inductors, six two-stage opening switches, and six crowbar switches with a 1 m diameter &#215; 40 m long vacuum chamber, and high speed diagnostics completing the system. The system which will be used to develop and test ultrahigh velocity electromagnetic accelerators (EMAs) was designed to be a versatile, easily maintained laboratory system. This power supply represents a substantial capability and can be used to drive a variety of experiments such as a large bore tactical-type railgun which is being designed to launch a 2-kg projectile at 3 km/s. Design parameters, component specifications, and program status are presented.

Gripping is a very important function in daily life and there will be a best form for gripping for each person. If the form is best, then it will contain some information about the physical and mental condition of the person, and there might be some common mathematical formulas by which we can describe the best form to each person. Such concept as to best fit everybody may be the concept of universal design, but no theoretical research has yet done. Takahashi has developed a cup called &#8220;Waga-Hai&#8221; for people who cannot use a standard one easily. We believe that the key information for deriving a formula for universal design will be concealed in this 3D polygon data. As this is the first challenge to derive a universal design, this paper is devoted to extracting features. The objective of this paper is to determine the features reflecting the distribution of grip force of each figure and the location of the fingers.

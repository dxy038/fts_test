A optimization method of self-tuning fuzzy PID controller for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is presented in this paper. The proposed controller is developed for speed control of the PMSM for vehicle. Self-tuning fuzzy PID controller optimization is a complex task due to a large number of parameters and rule bases. In this paper, the parameters of membership functions and rule bases of fuzzy logic controller are optimized by adaptive weighted particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is an efficient and simple tool for multi-objective and multi-dimensional problem. The proposed controller is verified by simulation, the result showing robust and good dynamic response.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allows detection of the intercellular heterogeneity of C-ERB-B2 gene amplification in uncultured breast cancer cells. Nevertheless, because high levels of amplification result in coalescence of signals, direct microscopy quantification is restricted to cells with low levels of amplification or with dispersed signals. A methodology of digital image analysis, using surface and grey-level FISH signals as parameters that permit a rapid, objective, and accurate estimation of gene copy number, is presented. This procedure is independent of the signal overlapping and results in a more accurate quantification and characterization of tumor cell heterogeneity.

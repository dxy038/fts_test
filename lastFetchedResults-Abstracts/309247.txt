This article illustrates how one academic health science center in a large metropolitan area sought to improve the quality of patient care by soliciting the input of their nursing staff in devising an action plan for change.

The goal was to establish consensus among clinicians and researchers about significant issues in the institution requiring in-depth attention. A second objective was to design a survey instrument that is easy to complete and could be distributed, collected, and analyzed easily, thereby providing empirical data to the clinicians in a timely manner and in a simple format. This expedited process enabled specific action plans to be developed around the identified problems. Moreover, the process promoted interest in advancing nursing research and evidence-based practice among the clinicians and administrators

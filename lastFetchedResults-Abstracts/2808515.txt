Swapping mode of electric vehicle battery become an important way to supplement electric vehiclesÂ´ energy, owing to the advantage of quicker swapping and simpler management. This paper researched the optimal capacity configuration of battery switch stations (BSS) for buses. Firstly the evaluation index of service availability is proposed. Then the timing simulation model of BSS operating state is analyzed. A mathematical model is built considering equipment annual cost as objective function and service availability as constraint. DE algorithm is used to solve the mathematical model. The operating data of a Beijing BSS are selected to verify the model.

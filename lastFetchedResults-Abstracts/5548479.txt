With the advances in mobile technologies, smart mobile computing devices have become increasingly affordable and powerful, leading to a significant growth in both the number of advanced mobile users and their bandwidth demands. Moreover multimedia streaming to these high-end mobile devices has become widespread. However, multimedia applications are known to be resource-hungry and in order to cope with this explosion of data traffic, operators have started deploying different, overlapping radio access network technologies. One important challenge in such a heterogeneous wireless environment is to ensure an Always Best Experience to the mobile user, anywhere and anytime. This paper proposes the Quality Utility, a realistic mapping function of the received bandwidth to user satisfaction for multimedia streaming applications. The Quality Utility is mapped to a Google Nexus One Android Mobile device and validated through objective and subjective tests.

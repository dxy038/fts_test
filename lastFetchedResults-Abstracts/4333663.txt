Different multiple input - multiple output (MIMO) channel models are analyzed with regard to the indoor line-of-sight (LOS) MIMO channel. In the literature this channel is proven to achieve high capacities while being highly correlated. The modeling results from physical as well as analytical models are compared with measured channels, showing that none of the established models is exactly suitable for the considered indoor LOS MIMO channel. However, there is a promising approach that applies an extended Saleh model in conjunction with the physically correct spherical wave propagation. Although in its current state this basic approach cannot be regarded as a complete MIMO channel model, at least it provides an adequate origin for the correct prediction of MIMO capacities in different types of LOS channels. This is due to the fact, that the crucial prerequisites for an appropriate LOS MIMO channel model, which are by name the application of the physically correct spherical wave propagation, the correct modeling of the high correlation in LOS channels and the inclusion of the geometrical antenna setup, are regarded correctly. Contrarily, these prerequisites are included in none of the current models that are widely accepted in MIMO radio communications nowadays. The proof of this statement using measured data is a major objective of this paper.

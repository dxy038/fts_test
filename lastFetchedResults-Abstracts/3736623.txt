This paper reports on experimental investigations in the use of available long-wavelength ( <img src="/images/tex/9900.gif" alt="1.3-1.55-\\mu"/> m) devices in wide-band analog optical-fiber loops assumed functioning in a conventional star-configured switched network. Since for economic reasons analog TV transmission will remain attractive for the foreseeable future, the objective of this work is to extend loop length from 2 km (now feasible) to about 10 km. Distances of up to 10 km are needed to accommodate three or four television channels (each switchable) and narrow-band (NB) services. It is shown that with available "experimental" long-wavelength LED\Â´s and p-i-n photodiodes distances up to about 10 km are feasible.

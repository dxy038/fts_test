Pneumonectomy for chronic lung infections has been avoided because of potential intraoperative and postoperative complications. A retrospective review of 13 cases requiring pneumonectomy for aspergillus (8), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2), actinomycosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bronchiectasis revealed increased operating time, blood loss, and transfusion requirements. Operative records documented problems with dense adhesions, lack of an extrapleural plane, and distortion of hilar structures. Although mortality was acceptable (8%), early and late morbidity (total, 38%), especially bronchopleural fistula (23%), was significant. It is concluded that when justified, pneumonectomy for complete resection of chronic infection can be performed with acceptable risk. However, specific problems should be anticipated. This review has led to modifications in operative technique.

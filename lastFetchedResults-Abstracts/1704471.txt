In this paper, we present a real time system for detecting repeated video clips from a live video source such as news broadcasts. Our system utilizes customized temporal video segmentation techniques to automatically partition the digital video signal into semantically sensible shots and scenes. As each frame of the video source is processed, we extract auxiliary information to facilitate repeated sequence detection. When the video transition marking the end of the shot/scene is detected, we are able to rapidly locate all previous occurrences of the video clip. Our objective is to use repeated sequence information in our multimedia content analysis application to deduce semantic relationships among shots/scenes in the input video. Our real time video processing techniques are independent of source and domain and can be applied to other applications such as commercial detection and improved video compression.

Purpose: The objective of this study was to formulate and optimize an orodispersible
formulation of meloxicam using a 22 factorial design for enhanced bioavailability.
Methods: The tablets were made by non-aqueous wet granulation using crospovidone and
mannitol. A 22 factorial design was used to investigate the amount of crospovidone and taste
masking, soothening hydrophilic agent (mannitol), as independent variables, and
disintegration time as dependent response. Formulated orodispersible tablets were evaluated
for weight variation, friability, disintegration time, drug content, wetting time, water absorption
ratio and in vitro drug release.
Results: The results show that the presence of a superdisintegrant and mannitol is desirable
for orodispersion. All the formulations satisfied the limits of orodispersion with a dispersion
time of less than 60 sec. For example, formulation F4 showed a disintegration time of 32.1
sec, crushing strength of 4.93 kg/cm2, drug content of 98.5% and fast drug release rate of
99.5% within 30 min, as compared with the conventional tablet (49.5%) .
Conclusion: It is feasible to formulate orodispersible tablets of meloxican with acceptable
disintegration time, rapid drug release and good hardness, which could be amenable to
replication on an industrial scale.

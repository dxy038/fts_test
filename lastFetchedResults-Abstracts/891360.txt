The objective of this study was to determine the effect of body conformation on meat performance in young bulls. The experimental materials comprised a total of 156 Holsteinâ€“Friesian and crossbred beef bulls, aged 21-22 months. Body measurements were performed and muscle scores were recorded before slaughter. After slaughter, carcasses were graded for conformation and fatness according to the EUROP system, and half-carcasses were weighed and cut up. Based on their height at sacrum, the bulls were divided into three groups: tall ( > 140 cm), average (135-140 cm) and short ( < 135 cm). Width at hips was determined within the groups, and the animals were further subdivided into those with narrow and wide hips. Tall bulls with wide hips were characterized by the highest live body weight at slaughter (664. 3 kg) and the highest carcass dressing percentage (56.89%). Bulls of average height with wide hips received the best muscle score (7.1 points). Short bulls with narrow hips had the lowest live body weight (487.8 kg), while tall bulls with narrow hips were characterized by the lowest muscle score (5.0 points), the lowest carcass dressing percentage (54.58%) and a low content of valuable cuts in the carcass. Regardless of their height at sacrum, bulls with wide hips had higher live body weight and better carcass quality parameters, compared to bulls with narrow hips. The results of the study show that width at hips is a more reliable indicator of slaughter quality in beef cattle than height, and selection based on body conformation may contribute to improving beef production efficiency.

The main objective of this paper is to develop an improved model of the analysis of urban disaster prevention engineering investment by cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. This improved model isolates the economic benefits, but also the social and environmental benefits. This paper distresses the question how to measure the indirect effects of the urban disaster and the how to analysis the efficiency of the investment for the prevention engineering from the social and environmental aspects based on CBA and CEA approaches.

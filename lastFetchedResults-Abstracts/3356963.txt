Training power system operators for situations with a high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) is a prospective task of most system operator entities. The objective of this paper is to develop simplified but accurate models of variable speed wind turbine generation (WTG) which are implementable into a real-time training simulator (RTS) environment for a realistic operational training. The behaviour of the generation unit model to grid side voltage incidents depends on the voltage control strategy (VCS) and priority conditions which are selected by the power plant operator. The unit capability diagram is considered as a feature on how much reactive power could be supplied by the unit. The models are suitable for root-mean square (RMS) and balanced simulations and can be adjusted to resemble any vendor products.

This article presents the Robo&#769;tica-Autismo research project which started in 2009 from a partnership with APPACDM (Portuguese Association of Parents and Friends of Mentally Retarded Citizens). The main objective of the study is to promote the interaction and communication with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by using robots. Different approaches have been followed by the researchers enrolled in this project. Some studies are focused on using Lego robots to teach social and academic skills to children with ASD; other studies are dedicated to the detection of stereotyped movements in children with ASD using two different methods: the Kinect sensor and accelerometers. Recent work is related to the use of a humanoid robot that allows facial expressions to facilitate the emotion recognition and teaching facial expressions.

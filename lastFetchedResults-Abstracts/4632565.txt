The primary focus of current research is upon three different parallelization implementation methods of a widely-used semi-implicit chemically non-equilibrium reactive Euler equations solver on the Vector Parallel Processor (VPP) parallel computer. The main objective is to reduce the relative cost of the convection term calculation and chemical term computation and also to optimize the global cost of the numerical simulation by parallel implementation. Three different data parallel methods Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) and Multiblock Structured Algorithm (MSA) were outlined. The characteristics of the three methods are commented, such as parallel performance and data communication process. Finally, a summary of the parallelization strategy is presented and conclusions are drawn.

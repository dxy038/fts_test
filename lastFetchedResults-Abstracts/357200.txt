Background Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including that caused by associated coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Previous studies have shown that coagulation parameters are altered in PAD and that altered coagulation may play a critical role in the susceptibility to cardiovascular complications in PAD. It is therefore important to assess the effect of secondary prevention measures on coagulation in patients with PAD. The Arterial Disease Multiple Intervention Trial (ADMIT), a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, was conducted to determine the feasibility of a combined lipid-modifying, antioxidant, and antithrombotic treatment regimen in patients with PAD. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the ADMIT interventions on coagulation. Methods ADMIT participants were randomly assigned to low-dose warfarin, niacin, and antioxidant vitamin cocktail or corresponding placebos in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design. Specialized coagulation studies were performed in a subset of 80 ADMIT participants at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Results Low-dose warfarin (1 to 4 mg/d) resulted in a significant decrease in factor VIIc (P < .001) and in plasma F1.2 (P = .001). Unexpectedly, niacin treatment also resulted in significant decrease in both fibrinogen (48 mg/dL; P < .001) and F1.2 (P = .04). von Willebrand factor increased after antioxidant vitamin treatment (P = .04). Conclusions  A regimen of low-dose warfarin effectively modifies coagulation in patients with PAD. Niacin also favorably modifies fibrinogen and plasma F1.2. Niacin, in addition to its lipid effects, modifies abnormal coagulation factors that accompany PAD. (Am Heart J 2000;140:631-6.)

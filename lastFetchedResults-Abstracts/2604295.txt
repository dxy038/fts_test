The objective of this paper is to design a finite-time controller for Lorenz system in discrete-time. First, a discrete model is derived through the Taylor series expansion. In thenext step, a discrete-time terminal sliding mode controller (DTSMC) is developed to reach a finite-time and high precisioncontrol. The stability analysis of DTSMC is presented in the presence of external disturbance and model uncertainties. Numerical simulations of Lorenz system are shown andcompared with a discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC) to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme

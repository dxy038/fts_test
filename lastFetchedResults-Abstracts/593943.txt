Success in rehabilitation activities using particular species in desert areas rely on knowing the relationships between soil and vegetation.  The study area is located in eastern part of Sarbisheh, Southern Khorasan Province. The main objective of this research was to find out the relationships between soil physical and chemical properties and succulence of natural and planted Saxaul (Haloxylon spp). After field inspection, two sites including natural and planted Saxaual (Haloxylon spp) close together were selected in which the area of each site was about 200 ha. Soil and vegetation were sampled as randomized circular sample plot or transect. In each above mentioned site, five 60 m transects were established. On the longitudinal direction of each transect six soil profiles were dug and soil samples from two different depths (0-10 cm and 10-50 cm) were taken. Also, succulence degree for the nearest Saxual shrub to transect was determined. Soil samples were physically and chemically analyzed in the laboratory for texture, bulk density, humidity, organic matter, C, N, K, Caco3, Na, EC, and pH. Results of the principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that there is a significant difference between succulence of Saxual shrubs and some of soil properties. For example, increasing organic matters and Carbon content improved the succulence and this reality is more sensible in soil surface horizons. On the other hand, increasing the content of Na, K and salinity in the soil, decreased the succulence of Saxual shrubs. Also, there was not any correlation between Caco3, pH and bulk density and succulence of Saxual shrubs. Thus, soil physical and chemical characteristics were the most important factors affecting on the succulence of Saxual shrubs.

In this letter, our main objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of independent component analysis (ICA) for very high resolution satellite image characterization, particularly for geometrical structures contained in images from urban areas in comparison with natural landscapes. We propose a model based on ICA sources to index satellite images with a resolution of 0.6 m. An important part of this work is to study the effects of multiscaling and dimensionality behavior of ICA components. For evaluating the capabilities of our model, we design a classification method to distinguish images from a variety of natural and man-made scenes.

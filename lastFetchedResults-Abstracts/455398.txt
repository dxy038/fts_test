Objective: to characterize the potential of an endothelin derivative labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) for the imaging of experimentally induced atherosclerosis. Methods: neointima of different cellularity and severity of stenosis was induced in 32 rabbits by balloon denudation followed by distinct dietary regimens and drug application. Angiograms and scintigrams after injection of the Tc-99m-labeled endothelin derivative were obtained. The aorta was dissected for autoradiography, sudan-III-staining, morphometry, and immunohistology. Results: the lesions induced could be detected in vivo (whole body scintigram) in all the animals 15 min after the injection of the Tc-99m endothelin derivative. Autoradiography revealed a strong relationship between tracer accumulation and sudan-III-staining of lesions. Accumulation of the endothelin derivative correlated with the number of neointimal smooth muscle cells (SMC), but not with the number of medial SMC, neointimal macrophages, and neointimal area. Conclusions: the results indicate that in vivo imaging of atherosclerosis with an endothelin derivative is a feasible method of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic arterial wall lesions at early stages.

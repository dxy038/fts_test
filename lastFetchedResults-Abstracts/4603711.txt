The proposed system enables the control of sound sources in a large auditorium both in direction and distance. Reproduction of 3D sound fields over loudspeakers where distance coding is taken into account is a rather difficult goal, because different simple and complex properties of a sound event contribute to the perception of distance. Similar to the perception of pitch, the perception of distance is bounded in both directions. Small deviations concerning far and very short distances can hardly be distinguished. Furthermore, caused to be the associated memory, the impression of distance is always biased and relative. Therefore, similar to the visual sense, the auditory sense can be easily confused. To overcome these problems the reproduces sound field should be identical to the natural one as much as possible. As will be shown below, the presented approach is based on the construction of the wavefront curvature in a defined listening area in order to perceive the desired distance. The subject of this paper is to find out and validate objective description, which correlates with subjective perception. Based on this correlation, optimization criteria can be evaluated to maximize the reconstruction performance in order to control the desired spatial auditory stimuli of perception.

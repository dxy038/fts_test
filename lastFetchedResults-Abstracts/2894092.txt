This paper deals with the real time control of an electromagnetic ball suspension system using multiple model based predictive control (MMPC). The objective is to control the position of a metal ball in air space. The multiple model predictive control is designed based on the linearized models of the system about multiple operating conditions. For real time control a laboratory version of magnetic levitation device (33-210) by Feedback instruments is used. The performance of MMPC is compared with normal model predictive control (MPC) and found that MMPC is better than MPC.

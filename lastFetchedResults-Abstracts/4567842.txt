A compact test range (CTR) facility shall extend the measurement capabilities at the microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen. TodayÂ´s accuracy requirements in the RF-component characterization are decisive factors for the specification of a new measurement facility. Parts of a compact antenna test range (CATR) model 8074B, manufactured by March Microwave Systems B.V., have been purchased by the Institute in 2006. On the basis of these components, a compact test range in a new building named dasiaHF-TechLabpsila is currently under construction. It is planned to be operational at the end of 2009. An overview of the entire CTR facility is the objective of this paper.

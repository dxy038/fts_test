A model is developed to study the energetic particle populations in Ganymede’s magnetosphere. The main objective is to estimate to what extent the moon could protect an orbiter from radiations. Using Liouville’s theorem, the phase space density of particles coming from Jupiter’s magnetosphere is calculated at any point of Ganymede’s environment. Up to energies of ∼50–100 keV for ions and ∼10–20 MeV for electrons, Ganymede’s magnetic field appears to be able to form distinctive populations as loss-cones over the polar caps and radiation belts. At larger energies, these features are blurred by Larmor radius effects; the moon absorption simply creates a quasi-isotropic layer of ∼500 km thickness where the flux is reduced by ∼40–50%. The predictions are compared to Galileo measurements. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of the moon sweeping in reducing the flux over the polar caps. Interestingly, this can be accounted for by assuming that the particles bouncing between Jupiter and Ganymede are ideally scattered in pitch angle and permanently re-fill the loss-cone, which increases the precipitation on Ganymede’s polar cap. In overall, it is estimated that the radiation dose received by an orbiter of Ganymede will be reduced by more than 50–60% compared to the expected dose at Jupiter/Ganymede distance. This should have a positive impact on the design of a future orbiter of Ganymede.

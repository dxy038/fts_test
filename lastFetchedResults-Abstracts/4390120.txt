This research presents a gene ontology (GO)-based microarray gene expression data analysis method for diagnosing pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). The proposed method extracts a set of probes that are good candidates for tumor markers of PMP. It is shown that bidirectional hierarchical cluster analysis using the extracted probes is helpful for identifying the primary site of PMP. Some tumor markers for PMP are found through the proposed method.

Routing in a low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite system involves the choice of inter-satellite links (ISLs) that connects two home satellites of the mobile terminals. We use a mesh model to formulate the LEO system and proposed 4 mesh-based algorithms. The objective is to minimize the new call blocking probability and the forced termination probability. Also, due to the dynamic topology of the LEO system, the route is subject to disconnection because of a route breaking event, such as a connection handover event or a link handover event. We propose a channel reservation strategy in order to safeguard the continuity of a route. Experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the routing algorithms and the reservation strategy

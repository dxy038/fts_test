The Hungarian algorithm can provide the maximum weighted bipartite matching for assignment problems. However it can only solve the single objective weight optimization problem. In this paper, a modified bipartite matching (MBM) algorithm is proposed to solve the weighted bipartite matching problem with multiobjective optimization. In addition, our MBM algorithm is applicable to asymmetric bipartite graph, which is common in resource allocation problems. We illustrate the application of MBM to antenna assignments in wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. The simulation results show that MBM enjoys low computational complexity and maximizes the system capacity, while keeping the fairness among mobile users.

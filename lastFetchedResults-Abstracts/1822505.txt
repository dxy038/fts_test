Objective
m of the study was to evaluate the effect of topical fluoride gel NaF 2% application on antioxidant parameters of whole saliva from children.

liva mechanically stimulated with parafilm was collected from 25 children (6–12 years) attending the Clinic of Paediatric Dentistry of Universidade Cruzeiro do Sul, São Paulo, Brazil, before (control group) and immediately after application of neutral fluoride gel NaF 2% (fluoride-gel group), according to the Standards for Research Using Human Subjects, Resolution 196/96 of the USA National Health Council of 10/10/1996. Afterwards, pre-post ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), uric acid, reduced/oxidised glutathione content (GSH/GSSG) and total peroxidase activity (TPO) were evaluated in whole saliva of both groups.
s
n-enzymatic antioxidant parameters were augmented by fluoride-gel NaF 2% application, whereas a notable reduction (31%) of peroxidase activity was concomitantly observed in the children's saliva (p ≤ 0.05). Nevertheless, the reducing power of saliva was kept unaltered under these circumstances (p ≤ 0.05).
sions
e the reduced activity of peroxidase (an important antimicrobial and antioxidant enzyme), the topical fluoride gel NaF 2% favourably stimulated the release of non-enzymatic antioxidant components of saliva, sustaining the reducing power of saliva and the natural defences of the oral cavity.

The main objective of the INSYDE project is to define, implement, and demonstrate a comprehensive methodology for the design of hybrid hardware/software systems. Stages in the INSYDE Methodology are analysis, system design, detailed design, and validation, each with its own milestone. The INSYDE Methodology is not devoted to one particular development strategy, such as the waterfall model, prototyping, e.g. the stages can possibly overlap and iterations between them can occur

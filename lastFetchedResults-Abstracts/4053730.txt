A novel type of two-phase synchronous reluctance motor drive is introduced and analyzed. Since the currents in the phases are unidirectional rather than bidirectional, the associated power converter requires only two transistors and two feedback diodes. It is demonstrated by the finite-element method of analysis that with the same amount of active copper and under the same rated power output, the copper losses of this machine can be reduced to 75% of that of the equivalent switched reluctance motor

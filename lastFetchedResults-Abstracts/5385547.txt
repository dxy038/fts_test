This paper proposes a fast and accurate load shedding scheme design. The algorithm uses the synchronized real time power flow information. It selects the suitable load shedding for generator tripping contingencies. Genetic algorithms are used to solve the steady state load shedding optimization problem. The constraints associated with the problem of load shedding are calculated from power flow study. A multidimensional objective is used to restore power system to normal condition after generator tripping. This method has been tested on the IEEE 30-bus system. Results have been illustrated with simulation by NEPLAN software

A variety of Bayesian methods have recently been introduced for finding sparse representations from overcomplete dictionaries of candidate features. These methods often capitalize on latent structure inherent in sparse distributions to perform standard MAP estimation, variational Bayes, approximation using convex duality, or evidence maximization. Despite their reliance on sparsity-inducing priors however, these approaches may or may not actually lead to sparse representations in practice, and so it is a challenging task to determine which algorithm and sparse prior is appropriate. Rather than justifying prior selections and modelling assumptions based on the credibility of the full Bayesian model as is commonly done, this paper bases evaluations on the actual cost functions that emerge from each method. Two minimal conditions are postulated that ideally any sparse learning objective should satisfy. Out of all possible cost functions that can be obtained from the methods described above using (virtually) any sparse prior, a unique function is derived that satisfies these conditions. Both sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and basis pursuit (BP) are special cases. Later, all methods are shown to be performing MAP estimation using potentially non-factorable implicit priors, which suggests new sparse learning cost functions.

Suit-dress dealing via network is soaring in recent years and its commercial potential is enormous. Based on the analysis of the limitation of existing shopping guide Web sites, this paper proposes a customer-oriented shopping assistant system of suit-dress with intelligent characteristics. In this article, the shopping assistant system is composed of three functional modules: quantified and classified suit-dress database module, consumer individual database module and the dress recommendation module. A few of objective attributes, such as fabric, price and brand, are used to classify the dresses and some adjective gradable antonym pairs are chosen to quantify the style of clothing. These information about dresses are stored in the quantified and classified suit-dress database. Compared with the customer´s requirement put in her individual database, the third module decides the sequence of recommendations. In addition, we illustrate the customer´s purchasing process while using the system and discuss the possibility and the crucial issues to realize it.

The design and optimization of low-thrust transfers to synchronous orbit control scheme are solved, using the Multi-Neighborhood Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MNI-PSO). Based on the analysis of the low-thrust transfers to synchronous orbit control problems, the control model and multi-objective optimization model are proposed. And then, the concrete optimization scheme using MNI-PSO is specified. At the end, a simulation scenario is optimized. The results show that the optimized control scheme is fitting to the accuracy requirements. The design and optimization methods in the paper can be good materials for solving both low-thrust transfers to synchronous orbit control problems and other multi-objective optimization problems.

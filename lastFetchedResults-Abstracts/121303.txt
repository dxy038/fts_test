Introduction & Objective: Population based data concerning the prevalence of visual impairment in children are not readily available in Iran. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of common visual disorders (amblyopia, strabismus and refractive errors) in a group of primary school children and to compare the findings with similar studies.
Materials & Methods: Ten percent of the primary school children in Fasa were selected by systematic random method. They enrolled into prospective vision screening program combining the identification arm (screening) and diagnostic/treatment arm (ophthalmic examination).The screening consisted of Snellen chart presented at 6 meters test distance. An ophthalmologist in ophthalmology clinic examined each child failing the vision screening.
Results: 1224 children were screened during the 1999-2000 academic year.196 (16%) failed the vision screening (VA50.8) and 131(10.7%) failed the ophthalmic examination (VA50.7). The estimate prevalence of visual morbidity was as follows: amblyopia, 2.28%; strabismus, 0.4%, and refractive error, 10.04%. The most common cause of amblyopia was refractory error.
Conclusion: Refractive error and amblyopia were found in relatively high frequency for this population group. Refractive error was the most common cause of amblyopia. These findings underscore the necessity of comprehensive vision-screening programs that integrate follow up care.

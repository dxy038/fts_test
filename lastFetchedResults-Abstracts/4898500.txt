The six-phase induction machine (SPIM) has two sets of three-phase stator windings spatially shifted by 30 electrical degrees. It has many advantages, such as reducing the torque pulsations, enhancing the power handling capability. The matrix converter (MC) is a very promising converter, which has the following characteristics: operation with unity power factor, bidirectional power flow. In this paper, six-phase induction motor driven by the six-phase matrix converter has been proposed. It can combine the advantage of the SPIM and the MC. A direct modulation algorithm is presented. The control system can realize bidirectional power flow and the unity power factor. Simulation results have tested the performances of the proposed method.

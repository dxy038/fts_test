Background: HOXA11 and HOXA10 are expressed in endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle and show a dramatic increase during the mid-luteal phase at the time of implantation. The expression of these genes is decreased in women with myomas.
Objective: To determine whether myomectomy would reverse HOXA11 and HOXA10 expression, we evaluated the transcript levels of these genes in the endometria of patients before and after myomectomy.
Materials and Methods: Expression of HOXA11 and HOXA10 were examined prospectively during the midluteal phase in endometrium obtained from infertile women (n=12) with myoma before and three months after myomectomy. Endometrial HOXA11 and HOXA10 expression were evaluated using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results: Endometrial HOXA11 and HOXA10 mRNAs expression levels (normalized to 18SrRNA) were increased insignificantly in endometrium of patients after myomectomy (p=0.7 and p=0.15 respectively).
Conclusion: The results suggest that the alteration in expression pattern of these genes could not account for some aspects of fertility after myomectomy

This paper proposes a single-phase bidirectional ac-dc converter feasible to dc distributed power systems. The topology provides galvanic isolation and is able to protect the system during short-circuits occurrence in the load side. The power factor control in the ac side is performed by the duty cycle variation in the primary bridge. It is supposed to regulate the dc bus voltage even during voltage dips and short-circuits. The secondary side bridge is driven with constant duty cycle and the power flow is controlled by the variation of the phase shift angle between the two bridges. The basic equations are shown and the simulation results are presented and discussed.

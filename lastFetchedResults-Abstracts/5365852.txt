This paper is aiming at researching new methods for evaluation and characterization of human tissue behavior when it undergoes hyperthermia treatment. A tissue mimicking material (phantom) is modeled as a gel with ultrasound scatterings (glass bead). We have used a modified broadband pulse-echo technique proposed by Ping He for measuring acoustic dispersion since this technique requires only a minimum number of variables to be measured and eliminates the necessity of measuring the speed of sound in water and trigger delays in data sampling. In addition, it minimizes the uncertainty in determining the phase spectra. The objective of this paper is to detect testing beads or other targets from the background material

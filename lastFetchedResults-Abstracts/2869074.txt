This paper presents a novel dual active bridge (DAB) converter suitable for high power bidirectional power transfer. The converter topology comprises full bridge converters on each side linked by a tuned LCL network and a high frequency transformer, which provides galvanic isolation. According to theoretical analysis and simulations the addition of this resonant network significantly improves efficiency as a result of the smaller currents in the bridge semiconductor switches and in the transformer.

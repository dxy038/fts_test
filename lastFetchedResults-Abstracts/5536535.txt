For a long time, how to put optimal allocation of counterpart fund into new technology import according to its regional external effects, has received great attention from the manager and the experts on government management. On the base of Endogenous Growth Theory, a production function model of endogenous counterpart fund for technology import is built on this paper. Moreover, taking maximum production function as objective function, constraint conditions of resources, funds, capability of infrastructure and institution are discussed. And finally an example of project of optimal counterpart fund from local government of some region is given and it proves the effect of the model.

A harmonic radar system is described for use in tracking the movement of flying insects in entomological studies. The objective is to predict the range performance of the system given realistic antenna dimensions, transmit power and receiver performance. A description of the receiver is presented including the noise and signal level calculations. A maximum range of 251 m is shown to be realizable under realistic assumptions

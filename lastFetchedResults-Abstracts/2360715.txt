The advent of the fundamental constants RK (the von Klitzing constant) and KJ (the Josephson constant) in electrical metrology and the growing development of nanotechnologies have totally changed the vision and the practice of the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), opening a modern era of metrology and arousing a growing interest in a possible re-definition of the international system of units (SI). The Josephson effect (JE) and the Quantum Hall effect (QHE), at the origin of these fundamental constants, constitute the keystone of a new approach to electrical units, when one considers the very high level of reproducibility of these units, never seen before. On the other hand, the Watt balance experiment in which these constants play a part could be the origin of a new SI definition, replacing the mass unit ‘the kilogram’ as a fundamental unit by the Planck constant h. It thus seems that the implementation of experiments aimed at demonstrating the coherency between the theoretical and phenomenological values of these constants is a major objective. In this framework the metrological triangle experiment associating QHE, JE and single electron tunnelling effect would play a major role in checking the consistency of these fundamental constants in terms of the Planck and electron charge constants. This article gives briefly an outline of these quantum phenomena and their metrological applications in NMIs for the realisation of electrical units and the determination of the fundamental constants.

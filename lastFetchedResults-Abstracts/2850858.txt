We propose a maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning framework to directly maximize mean average precision (MAP) which is a key performance metric in many multi-class classification tasks. Conventional classifiers based on support vector machines cannot be easily adopted to optimize the MAP metric. On the other hand, classifiers based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been shown to deliver a great discrimination capability in automatic speech recognition and image classification as well. However, DNNs are usually optimized with the minimum cross entropy criterion. In contrast to most conventional classification methods, our proposed approach can be formulated to embed DNNs and MAP into the objective function to be optimized during training. The combination of the proposed maximum MAP (MMAP) technique and DNNs introduces nonlinearity to the linear discriminant function (LDF) in order to increase the flexibility and discriminant power of the original MFoM-trained LDF based classifiers. Tested on both automatic image annotation and audio event classification, the experimental results show consistent improvements of MAP on both datasets when compared with other state-of-the-art classifiers without using MMAP.

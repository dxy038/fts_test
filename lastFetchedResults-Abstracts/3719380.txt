An optimization method is proposed for electromagnetic design of actively shielded MRI superconducting magnets. Central field strength, uniformity over FOV, stray field regulation, and uniformity robustness against manufacturing errors are combined as an optimization objective. A cost-effective solution is guaranteed by constraining the magnet dimensions and pre-estimating the operating current upper limit. Design of a 7 T animal MRI superconducting magnet is provided as an example of the proposed method.

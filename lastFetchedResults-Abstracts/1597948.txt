This paper presents a new approach to analyze or to select the most influential inputs for locating the reason for poor education among rural people, with the use of bidirectional associative memories (BAM). Quantifying the reason for poor education in rural areas can improve the education of rural people. This paper develops a extended BAM (EBAM) [1], using BAM and it tries to test this method for analyzing the reason for poor eduction in the rural areas. This analysis can be used to determine the method of education for rural people, and it can help to improve the quality or level of education of rural people. So, this paper uses the EBAM with different neurons for the problem of poor education in rural area.

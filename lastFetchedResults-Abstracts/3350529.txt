The paper proposes a global optimization approach to the network resource allocation problem, where the objective is to maximize the overall data flow through a shared network. In the proposed approach, the utility functions of agents may have different forms, which allows a more realistic modeling of phenomena occurring in computer networks. To solve the optimization problem, a modified gradient projection method has been applied.

 The objective of the study was to demonstrate the utility of botulinum toxin (BTX; Botox: Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) type A injections for symptom reduction in laryngeal tics. The study consisted of case studies and literature review. Case histories of two patients with laryngeal tics are presented. Treatment was administered using BTX type A injected into the thyroarytenoid muscles using electromyographic guidance or via direct laryngoscopy. Treatment outcomes were measured using clinical rating scales with a range from 0 (no response) to 4 (maximal response). A subjective assessment of reduction in premonitory sensations was recorded. Subject 1 was a 49-year-old female with onset of laryngeal tic (throat clearing) at 46 years. She received six injections over 24 months. The lowest effective dose was 1.25 units bilaterally, producing complete resolution of the tic behavior (peak effect of 4/4) and reduction of the premonitory sensations. The median duration of benefit was 13 weeks. Subject 2 was a 14-year-old male with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome with laryngeal symptoms including throat clearing, barking, and crowing. He received three injections, with the lowest effective dose of 0.625 units bilaterally. He achieved marked reduction (peak effect of 3/4) of the throat clearing, barking, and crowing behaviors. There was also substantial reduction of the premonitory sensations. The median duration of benefit was 10 weeks. The cases presented herein are examples of successful treatment with low-dose BTX type A to reduce the symptoms of laryngeal tics, leading to improved quality of life. These cases add to the relatively small number of similar patients reported in the literature, and support the use of chemical neuromuscular blockade for treatment of laryngeal tic symptoms.

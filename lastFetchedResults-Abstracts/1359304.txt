Background and Objective: Staying away from the familiar surroundings and family supports, along with weaknesses in capabilities, skills and aging- related failures can lead to mental problems in the elderly residing in nursing homes. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and strengthen the factors that reduce the old people’s vulnerability to these problems. One of the factors neglected in this area is hope. Hence, the aim of the present study was to examine the role of hope in mental problems of the elderly residing in nursing homes.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive- correlational study, 60 elderly (28 females and 32 males) with normal IQ, without severe physical and cognitive problems from the nursing homes of Zanjan city were selected by using full census method. The data was collected using demographic researcher-made questionnaire, Snyder hopefulness and SCL-90-R measures.
Results: Data analysis using Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariate linear regression indicated significant relationship in general, operative and strategic hope  and  GSI and some of its dimensions. Operative, strategic and general hope exhibited significant and relatively high variance in GSI and dimensions of depression, somatization, anxiety, hostility and paranoid (7, 7, 14, 9, 21 and 17.5%, respectively). Beta coefficients showed that higher scores in predictive variables led to lower mental problems and better mental health in the elderly.
Conclusion: Hopefulness toward the future through strengthening forbearance of  the existing circumstances, is regarded as  a key element in facing stressful situations  and reduces the  elderlys’ vulnerability to mental disorders.

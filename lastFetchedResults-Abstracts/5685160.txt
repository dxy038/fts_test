According to the principle of establishing index system, we construct an evaluation index system with coordinated port logistics and regional economy. Principal Component Analysis is used to build coordinated development model of port logistics and regional economy. Based on the data of J combinatorial ports from 2002 to 2009, we evaluate the coordinated development between two systems, and come to the coordinated development degree of port logistics system and regional economic system. Our results provide relative scientific and objective basis for decision-makers.

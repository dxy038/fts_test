The increased penetration of renewable energy sources and the concept of a dynamic and highly distributed Smart Grid which can intelligently integrate production units, storage systems and connected users opened new challenges in the application of optimization techniques. In this work, a dynamic optimization problem is formulated on a power grid characterized by wind and photovoltaic production units, conventional power plants, biomass co-generation and storage systems. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is adopted in the dynamic decision model for real time purposes. The decision problem takes into account the network load flows constraints and a state equation related to the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries. Different issues (economic, technical, environmental, security) have been taken into account for the formalization of the objective function. Numerical results are finally reported and discussed.

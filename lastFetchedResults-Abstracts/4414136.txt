The increase in the production cost of electricity from conventional energy sources, led systems to look for cheaper and cleaner energy sources like wind and solar. Over past few years wind energy integration drew more attention in the electricity markets. But, due to uncertainties in wind energy forecasts and to maintain system under balance condition, additional services are required. Such additional services are named as Ancillary Services. This paper presents a scheduling methodology for thermal generators, under wind integration uncertainties to serve the demand, while providing a schedule for operating reserve (Ancillary Services). In this paper minimization of Operating cost objective is considered which includes thermal units fuel cost and cost paid to reserve, required due to intermittency in wind energy forecast. The uncertainties in wind are also considered, wind output is modelled using Weibull probability density function (PDF). Dynamic Programming method with Priority-list is used to schedule thermal units. The performance and feasibility of the projected method is illustrated with case studies on 6 and 10 thermal generators test systems, along with one wind generator is considered and results are found encouraging.

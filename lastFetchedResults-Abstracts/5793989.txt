Scientific and effective emergency evacuation traffic management plays an important part in improving event reaction ability of urban traffic system, saving rescue time and reducing property losses. A new approach for real-time traffic management under emergency evacuation is proposed in this paper. Distinct from the well-studied evacuation planning, real-time traffic management for evacuation aims at dynamically controlling traffic flow under evacuation in such a way that certain system objective like minimization of evacuation time could be achieved. We take into account the idea of feedback in the executing process based on the real-time information obtained from sensors and other surveillance technologies. Updating the evacuation plans is essential and brings the following two advantages: firstly, it prevents congestion, by creating new evacuation routes and thus avoiding the already crowded areas; and secondly, it decreases congestion by directing traffic on currently congested routes to disperse on alternative routes. A numerical example is given to illustrate that the proposed approach can be effectively carried out in emergency evacuation.

We present a new 3D reconstruction pipeline for digital preservation of natural and cultural assets. This application requires high quality results, making time and space constraints less important than the achievable precision. Besides the high quality models generated, our work allows an overview of the entire reconstruction process, from range image acquisition to texture generation. Several contributions are shown, which improve the overall quality of the obtained 3D models. We also identify and discuss many practical problems found during the pipeline implementation. Our objective is to help future works of other researchers facing the challenge of creating accurate 3D models of real objects.

In this paper we investigate the electrical properties of hydrophobic silicon wafer bonded interface. Platinum diffusion, commonly used to enhance fast bipolar P-i-N diodes, is performed to control its electrical properties. The control of the bonded interface properties is a necessary condition to integrate the wafer bonding technique as a new manufacturing process for structures such as bidirectional switch devices. This work is based on spreading Resistance (SR), Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Micro-PhotoConductivity Decay (&#956;-PCD) characterizations of as-bonded and platinum decorated silicon direct wafer bonded interfaces.

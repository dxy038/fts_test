In traditional acupuncture, reinforcement and reduction are conducted to stimulate the channel Qi by puncturing or heating the points with specific manners so as to regulate the functional activities of the internal organs. Reinforcement and reduction manners played an important role in clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine, especially in disease curing. And the non-invasive nature of laser acupuncture has made lasers an attractive alternative in Medical Acupuncture at the last 25 years. The objective of this paper was to introduce the methods to implement reinforcement and reduction in laser acupuncture. According to reinforcement and reduction of traditional acupuncture and the theory of laser optics, lifting and thrusting of acupuncture, twisting and twirling of acupuncture and sparrow-pecking moxibustion are implemented.

Objective: To identify low and high-frequency median nerve (MN) somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) generators by means of chronically implanted electrodes in the parietal lobe (SI and neighbouring areas) of two epileptic patients.
Methods: Wide-pass short-latency and long-latency SEPs to electrical MN stimulation were recorded in two epileptic patients by stereotactically chronically implanted electrodes in the parietal lobe (SI and neighbouring areas). To study high-frequency responses (HFOs) an off-line digital filtering of depth short-latency SEPs was performed (500â€“800 Hz, 24 dB roll-off). Spectral analysis was performed by fast Fourier transform.
Results: In both patients we recorded a N20/P30 potential followed by a biphasic N50/P70 response. A little negative response in the 100 ms latency range was the last detectable wide-pass SEP in both patients. Two HFOs components (called iP1 and iP2) were detected by mere visual analysis and spectral analysis, and were supposed to be originated within the parietal cortex.
Conclusions: This was the very first study that recorded wide bandpass and high frequency SEPs by electrodes, exploring both the lateral and the mesial part of the parietal lobe and particularly that of the post-central gyrus.

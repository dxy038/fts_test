In this paper, a HadoopMapReduce framework is presented in order to perform parallel processing used for an online CBIR application. HadoopMapReduce framework is used with the intention of integrating an image analysis algorithm into the text-based image search engines without degrading their response time. Therefore, the main objective of the study is a distribution of the image data over a large number of nodes. Some of the techniques used in the paper includes: image indexing and retrieval, parallel processing of downloading images, indexing, and comparing the similarity of retrieved images from various sources.

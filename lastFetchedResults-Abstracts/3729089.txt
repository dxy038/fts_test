A special aspect of sequential machine identification is treated in this paper. Given an input signal sequence to an unknown sequential machine and the resulting output signal sequence of the machine, it is necessary to find a state table or any other description of the machine and all other machines which response to the given input sequence with the given output sequence. The main objective of the research was to develop a fast and efficient state merging method which profits from the special characteristics of the problem at hand.

Background: Scropholaria striata Boiss. From Scropholariaceae (Teshnehdari in folklore of Ilam Province, Iran) is used for treatment of infectious disease of urinary tract especially in females.
Objective: In this research for finding of the most effective part of the plant, crude extract of the aerial parts of S. striata and its different fractions was investigated on the 50 resistant strains of Psudomonas aeroginosa.
Methods: Crude extract of the plant and its various fractions (chloroform, methanol and water) were prepared. Bacterial strains were collected from 3 hospitals and 50 resistant strains were isolated from the culture medium containing various antibiotics. Efficacy of the all fractions was investigated on these resistant bacterial strains.
Result: Water and methanol fractions of the plant were showed more antibacterial activity on 50 resistant strains of P. aeroginosa than crude extract (p=0.0001 and p=0.001 respectively) and water fraction was showed stronger effect than methanol fraction (p=0.001). Chloroform fraction of the plant had no antibacterial activity on this resistant strain.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the water extract of Scropholaria striata can be used as a remedy for the treatment of the infections caused by Psudomonas aeroginosa.

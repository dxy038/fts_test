OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the effects of intrauterine release of a daily dose of 20 μg levonorgestrel by an intrauterine device on climacteric symptoma, bleeding pattern, and endometrial histologic features in postmenopausal women receiving transdermal estrogen replacement therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Forty parous postmenopausal women were randomly allocated into two groups for 1 year: 20 women receiving a continuous transdermal daily dose of 50 μg of estradiol had a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device inserted, and the control group of 20 women received a continuous oral dose of 2 mg of estradiol valerate and 1 mg of norethisterone acetate daily. The climacteric symptoms, bleeding patterns, endometrial thickness, and endometrial changes in biopsy samples were analyzed. Serum levels of estradiol in both groups and levonorgestrel levels in the intrauterine device group were also determined.
RESULTS: Both treatment regimens effectively relieved climacteric symptoms. Spotting was more common in the intrauterine contraceptive device group than in the oral therapy group for the first 3 months. After that, the proportion of women without any bleeding was similar in both groups. Two patients in each group dropped out because of bleeding.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device is a useful alternative mode of progestin administration for certain selected women receiving estrogen replacement therapy.

A control scheme based on fuzzy logic is proposed. The objective is to design a fuzzy controller for the pitch axis of an unmanned research vehicle. The inputs to the controller are the error and the change in error. A set of fuzzy rules that makes the controller look like a proportional-plus-derivative controller is obtained and simulated on Matrix<sub>s</sub>, a software package for the analysis and design of control systems. The fuzzy controller was found to give better results than those obtained from the existing analog controller

This study presents the finite element based fatigue life prediction of a new free piston linear generator engine mounting. The objective of this research is to assess the critical fatigue locations on the component due to loading conditions. The effects of mean stress and probabilistic nature on the fatigue life are also investigated. Materials SAE 1045-450-QT and SAE 1045-595-QT are considered in this study. The finite
element modeling and analysis was performed using computer-aided design and finite element analysis codes.
In addition, the fatigue life prediction was carried out utilizing the finite element based fatigue code. Total-life approach and crack initiation approach were applied to predict the fatigue life of the free piston linear engine mounting. The results show the contour plots of fatigue life and damage histogram at the most damaging case.
The comparison between the total-life approach and crack initiation approach were investigated. From the results, it can be concluded that Morrow mean stress correction method gives the most conservative (less life) results for crack initiation method. It can be seen that SAE 1045-595-QT material gives consistently higher life than SAE 1045-450-QT material for all loading conditions for both methods.

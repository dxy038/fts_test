Objective The aim of the study was to determine the effect of strength and endurance training on the pelvic floor muscles in women suffering from stress urinary incontinence using electromyography (EMG) biofeedback.
Materials & Methods Forty women volunteers suffering from stress urinary incontinence participated in this quasi-experimental clinical trial (before and after). The strength and endurance of pelvic floor muscles were evaluated before and after the intervention using EMG biofeedback (MyoTrac Infiniti). The patients performed pelvic floor exercises twice a week for a ten-week program under the supervision of a physical therapist. All data were analyzed using paired t-test, regression analysis, and Pearson correlation coefficient using SPSS (version 11).
Results It was found that the maximum strength and endurance levels in each patients&rsquo; pelvic floor muscles before and after the intervention were statistically significant (P<0.001).
Conclusion The strength and endurance training of pelvic floor muscles using EMG biofeedback increased the pelvic floor muscle strength and endurance in women with stress urinary incontinence.

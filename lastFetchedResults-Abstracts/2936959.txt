The objective of this study is to find areas where landslides may occur in the near future by using satellite remote sensing and thematic-map data, also using GIS (Geographic Information System) techniques. The authors considered how the combination of GIS with remote sensing data and thematic map data may facilitate greatly the assessment and estimation of regional landslide hazards. They extracted inclination angles, inclination aspects, and ridge and valley lines from DTM data originally made for landslide areas. The watersheds in the study areas were extracted by GIS techniques. Criteria to predict landslide areas are proposed

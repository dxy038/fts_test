This paper discusses a predictive scheduling for permutation flow shop problem subject to new arrival job. We developed a predictive schedule method to absorb the effect caused by the new arrival job by inserting moderate slack times into the initial schedule. Considering the idle time existed in the initial schedule, we introduced how to insert slack times according to the occurrence probability of new job to optimize the objective combining efficiency and stability. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the computational results demonstrate that the proposed predictive scheduling method can improve the schedule stability significantly with little sacrifice of efficiency.

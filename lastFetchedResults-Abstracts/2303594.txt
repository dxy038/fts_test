Abstract
Introduction: Accumulation of secretions in airways is a serious complication in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Tracheal suctioning which is done with the aim of secretion removal can be used in conjunction with physiotherapy for effective airway clearance and improving gas exchange.
Objective: The aim of study was to determine the effects of rib cage compression before suctioning on respiratory parameters in mechanically ventilated patients.
Methods: In this crossover clinical trial study fifty mechanically ventilated patients were randomly divided to two groups. Each patient received two interventions of endotracheal suctioning with and without rib-cage compression in expiration time with a minimum of 3-hour interval between the two interventions and ten times with three respiratory cycle intervals. Oxygen saturation and dynamic compliance were measured before, 5 and 25 minutes after and data were analyzed using paired t-tests and Greenhouse Geisser and Sphericity.  
Results:  Average cumulative dynamic compliance a minute before, 5 and 25 minutes after intervention with compression was 30.06, 32.14 and 30.93 and 30.42, respectively and without compression, 32.26 and 32.81. Arterial oxygen saturation a minute before, 5 and 25 minutes after the intervention was 97.67, 98.09 and 97.94 respectively in suction with compression and 98.12, 98.27 and 98.17 without compression which were almost similar in the 3 step evaluation and there was no statistically significant difference.
Conclusion: In attention to lack of significant differences in oxygen saturation and dynamic compliance in two methods of suction with and without chest compressions, further research is needed in this area.

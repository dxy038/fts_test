The objective of this study was to evaluate an automated blood culture system for the isolation of microorganisms from infected equine synovial fluid (SF). Samples were collected from 220 severely inflamed synovial joints and classified as either presumably infected (group A: n = 149) or not infected (group B: n = 71), based on a combination of clinical history, clinical signs and cytological analysis of the SF. Samples were inoculated into blood culture bottles and after incubation were subcultured onto agar media to confirm the results and to facilitate full bacterial identification. Microorganisms were isolated from 107 group A samples (71.8%) and from three group B samples (4.2%). Overall, the detection system identified 117 bottles as positive and 103 as negative, including nine instrument-false-positives and two instrument-false-negatives. The median time-to-detection for Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and for fungi was 14.3 (interquartile range [I.R.] 10.0) h, 8.8 (I.R. 12.8) h, and 72.0 (range 60.8â€“74.8) h, respectively. It was concluded that culture of infected SF using the automated system combines the advantages of enrichment in specialised medium with the rapid detection of bacterial growth.

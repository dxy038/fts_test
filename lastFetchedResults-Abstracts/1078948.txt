Two different procedures, respectively aiming at the best allocation and managing of disinfection stations along water distribution systems, are presented, with the main objective of proposing a criterion to limit chlorine and disinfection by-product concentrations in the drinking water supplied to users without compromising its agreeableness and safety characteristics. The procedures are based on the evaluation of two different indexes obtained through the analysis of several operating conditions related to changes of water demands in both space and time and to the random behaviour of users: the Presence Index and the Efficiency of Allocation Index. The proposed procedures have been applied to a case study in order to determine, respectively, (1) the number and the allocation of chlorine booster stations according to minimum and maximum values of chlorine concentration indicated in drinking water standards and to minimum chlorine dosage allowed for each station; and (2) the optimal dosage of chlorine according to the number and allocation of chlorine disinfection stations and to the changes of water demand from users.

Optimization of molding compound properties is the general objective of post-mold thermal processing. The use of such thermal processing has led to property changes that are commonly ascribed to residual curing. In this paper we report on an examination of microstructural changes effected during post-mold thermal aging at temperatures slightly lower than the molding temperature. The results of this characterization demonstrate that both chemical and physical aging phenomena are jointly operative in determining the overall properties. These results will be elaborated upon in this paper.

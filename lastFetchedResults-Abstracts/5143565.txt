The content of the paper is about the IP/MPLS traffic engineering objectives and methods, multilayering and SRLG optimization. It gives emphasis on its benefits such as smoothing of the SRLG size, lessening SRLG which has a very large bandwidth, having successful traffic engineering approach for the lower/WDM layer, reducing maximum link utilization in IP layer, and improving the original objective thru the chosen optimisation.

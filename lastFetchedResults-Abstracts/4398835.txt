This paper proposes a real-time evaluation method for power supply capacity of distribution network with distributed generation (DG) based on the uncertainty of DG output and the cyclical change characteristics of power grid load. The method considers the situation that various types of DG in distribution network generate electricity complementally and obtains the future load and DG output through prediction technology. The optimization model is established using the maximum load that can be supplied by distribution network as objective function and the safe operation requirements of the system as constraint conditions. The model can give change curves of power supply capacity and power supply margin of distribution network for a period of time in the future, which allows dispatchers to take corresponding measures in advance according to the evaluation results to ensure the safety and reliability of power grid operation. Considering the situation that load growth in the same proportion may result in large errors, the relative growth rate is used here to construct load growth mode. Finally, a practical example is employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and model.

A new method for the continuous regulation of series reactive power compensation is presented. The two control circuits proposed consist of capacitor banks inserted in a transmission line and are controlled by bidirectional gate turn-off switches. The level of compensation is controlled by varying the on and off time of the GTO switch. To avoid current surges the switch is turned on before the capacitor voltage is zero. The feasibility of this method is verified by transient analysis and by measurements on a small-scale model. The advantage of the proposed method is the fast and continuous regulation of series compensation. A circuit can be built with available components and can be used for impedance control and oscillation reduction.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

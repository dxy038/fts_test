This paper presents an instance of priority encoding transmission system based on an exact and discrete Radon transform called the Mojette transform. The system includes an optimization process constrained jointly by the hierarchy of the source and by the channel property. In the framework of JPEG2000 image wireless transmission, the hierarchy is characterized by a perceptual objective quality assessment which is well correlated with the human judgement and the channel estimation is performed by an exponential loss profile. The solution is compared with the JPEG2000 Wireless (JPWL) system based on the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) criterion and the Reed- Solomon codes. We also propose an extension of this work to H.264/AVC videos.

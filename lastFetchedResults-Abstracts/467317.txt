Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of subcutaneous drainage in patients who are affected by benign gynecologic diseases that are treated by a Kustner's minilaparotomy incision. Study Design: We performed a randomized controlled study with 72 patients who underwent operation for benign gynecologic disease. Patients were assigned intraoperatively to two groups: group A (36 patients) had a closed drainage system and group B (36 patients) had no drainage. Historic data, clinical and surgical characteristics, and perioperative complications were recorded prospectively. Postoperative care data, surgical incision complications, and hospital stay were analyzed. Patients were to be seen 4 weeks after the operation to assess wound healing. Results: No patients had intraoperative complications or blood transfusions. A significant difference was observed between the drainage versus no-drainage groups regarding postoperative complications and hospital stay (P = .001, both groups). No patients had surgical complications at 4 weeks after the last operation. Conclusion: Our data suggest that routine prophylactic subcutaneous drainage is indicated in patients who undergo Kustner's minilaparotomy incision for benign gynecologic operation. Drains significantly prevent wound complications and reduce hospital stay. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:71-5.)

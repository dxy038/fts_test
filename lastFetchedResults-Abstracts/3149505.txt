There are many researches about the mobility on improving performance in ail hoc networks. Their objective all try to provide intermittent connectivity in a disconnected ad hoc network. However, the mobility application is still new in the WSN domain. In this paper, we consider the tradeoffs between the delay performance and the energy efficiency offered by the fuzzy analysis model. Our contribution is two-fold. First, the authors propose a role-based mobility-aware sampling mechanism via the status classification. Secondly, the fuzzy logic system is applied to the decision making, and the simulation results show the scheme can extend the network life time.

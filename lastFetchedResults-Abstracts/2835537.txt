A bearing is a machine element used to constrain relative motion and reduces friction between moving parts with necessary lubrication provided. Bi-metal aluminium bearing manufacturers say their products offer long-term durability, dry-start protection, resistance to debris, corrosion resistance and dimensional accuracy for stock and light duty, as well as performance and racing, applications. The main objective of the work is to determine the safe load and seizure load of the Aluminium alloy Bearing material using Thrust type seizure testing machine and to determine the stress for the safe load of the same material using ANSYS, under same operating condition and then, finally to compare the experimental result with ANSYS result.

Wireless heterogeneous networks have emerged as a new paradigm to meet the fast increasing wireless capacity and coverage demands. Coordinated Multipoint Processing (CoMP) and Precoding are two promising techniques to further improve the network capacity and spectral efficiency. This paper presents an optimal intra-cell CoMP resource allocation scheme in a wireless heterogeneous network and explores the Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) in the physical layer to reduce the inter-user interference. The objective is to maximize the aggregate proportional rates in the system. We derive an asymptotically optimal solution for resource allocation by using a gradient descent based scheduling and KKT conditions for optimality. Simulation results demonstrate the system proportional fairness capacity gain of proposed resource allocation scheme and this resource management framework provides a guideline for future radio resource management in wireless heterogeneous networks.

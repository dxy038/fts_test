We investigate an optimal resource allocation problem in modular software systems during testing phase. The main purpose is to minimize the cost of software development when the number of remaining faults and a desired reliability objective are given. An elaborated optimization algorithm based on the Lagrange multiplier method is proposed and numerical examples are illustrated. Besides, sensitivity analysis is also conducted. We analyze the sensitivity of parameters of proposed software reliability growth models and show the results in detail. In addition, we present the impact on the resource allocation problem if some parameters are either overestimated or underestimated. We can evaluate the optimal resource allocation problems for various conditions by examining the behavior of the parameters with the most significant influence. The experimental results greatly help us to identify the contributions of each selected parameter and its weight. The proposed algorithm and method can facilitate the allocation of limited testing-resource efficiently and thus the desired reliability objective during software module testing can be better achieved.

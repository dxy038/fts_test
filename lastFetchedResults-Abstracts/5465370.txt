In order to accelerate the learning speed of the conventional CMAC, an Improved Credit Assigned CMAC (ICA-CMAC) is presented in this paper. And then the proposed ICA-CMAC is applied to approaching two objective functions. Simulation results show that the ICA-CMAC has faster learning speed. In addition, the paper discussed different performances of ICA-CMAC influenced by different learning rates. It was found that the ICA-CMAC with a learning rate less than 1 has a better learning performance, which might be useful in selecting an appropriate learning rate.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of primary and conversion percutaneous radiologic gastrojejunostomy (PRGJ) under fluoroscopic guidance. Between January 1998 and July 2007, 29 patients (M/F=26:3) were enrolled. Indications for primary PRGJ (n=16) included recurrent aspiration pneumonia (n=8), prevention of gastroesophageal reflux in cases of disrupted gastrointestinal tract (n=6), or bypass of surgical anastomosis (n=1) or duodenal obstruction (n=1). Indications for conversion PRGJ (n=13) included recurrent aspiration pneumonia (n=11), malignant duodenal obstruction (n=1), or previous gastrostomy-related complication (n=1). All 29 procedures were successfully completed with 10.2â€“16.5-Fr feeding gastrojejunostomy tube tip located in the proximal jejunum. A single anchor was used in all patients with primary PRGJ. Clinical success was achieved in all study patients. There were no major complications. There was no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux or aspiration aggravation in any patient during the follow-up period. Four tubes were electively removed after healing of the esophageal rupture. The indwelling period was 10 to 429 days (mean, 110 days) after tube placement in the remaining 25 patients. Primary and conversion PRGJ under fluoroscopic guidance was a safe and effective procedure for enteral feeding as well as for preventing gastroesophageal reflux or aspiration pneumonia. In cases of primary gastrojejunostomy, use of single gastropexy was feasible and sufficient.

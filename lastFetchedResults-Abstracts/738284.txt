Objective
We previously reported a decrease in regular mammogram use from 2000 through 2005. To determine whether a downward trend continued in 2006 we re-examined mammography utilization reported in Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 2000 through 2006.
Methods

Age-adjusted percentages of women who reported having had a mammogram in the past 2 years were estimated by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Logistic regression was used to assess the linear time trends.
Results

The total age-adjusted proportion of all women aged ≥ 40 years who reported having had a mammogram within the 2 preceding years did not change when comparing data from 2000 (76.5% [95% CI: 75.9–77.0]) to 2006 (76.1% [75.7–76.6]). However, among those with health care coverage, a statistically significant decline in utilization occurred among women age 40 through 59 years, and non-Hispanic white women.
Conclusions

A substantial proportion of women are not being screened by mammography as recommended. Recent data suggest that patterns of utilization have leveled off or declined among certain subgroups of women. These data underscore the need to more effectively address current barriers to the utilization of mammography.

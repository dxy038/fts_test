This paper presents a new method for determining a set of candidate buses which should be considered for passive filter installation in large industrial distribution systems. Linear programming (LP) was used to evaluate the marginal costs of buses. The objective function for the linear programming is the linearized harmonic voltages and the cost of the slackness for the harmonic standard. The equality constraints consist of the linearized harmonic power flow equations. The linearized harmonic standard is formulated as inequality constraints. A large marginal cost obtained from LP flags a requirement for installing filters and its corresponding bus is considered as a candidate bus. A 6-bus power station system and an 18-bus industrial power system were used as examples for showing the applicability of the proposed method

Sport coaches are critical human resources in sport organizations and are influenced by various factors. The objective of the present study was to determine the relation between emotional intelligence and leadership style with mediating role of efficacy among female coaches participating in female college 12th Olympiad. The required data were collected by questionnaires of emotional intelligence (Shout, 1998), coaching efficacy (Myers et al, 2011) and leadership style (Chelladurai and Saleh, 1980). The population of 183 coaches who participated in the Olympiad by Tabachnik and Fidel (2007), 90 samples were selected. Although reliability and validity of these questionnaires had been already confirmed in many studies; their facial and content validity was approved by many university professors and their reliability was calculated by Cronbach’s alpha as 0.84, 0.77 and 0.91. Data were analyzed using multiple and double regression methods based on four-step model proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986). Results indicated that perceived ability of coaches regarding emotional intelligence including evaluation and exact monitoring of excitement changes during training and match time and the ability for optimal control and regulation of these excitements have positive influence on coaching confidence and their efficacy beliefs; and this relation results in taking a leadership style and behavior proportional to match and athlete’s condition and hence, enhances effectiveness of total coaching process. Moreover, this interaction can also promote athlete’s attitude and relation with his/her coach and thus their learning and performance.

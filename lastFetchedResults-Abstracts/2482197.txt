Objective: There is some evidence that chronic skin diseases like dermatitis could affect the quality of life of
sufferers. In addition, patients with dermatological disorders are at greater risk to develop psychiatric morbidity.
The aim of this study was to explore the quality of life in patients with chronic eczematous dermatitis. We also
examined the effect of a convenient dermatologic intervention on quality of life of the participants.
Methods: Fifty patients with chronic dermatitis (29 females and 21 males with mean age of 29.3 years) were
recruited. Data were collected before and after six weeks of dermatological treatment using Dermatology Life
Quality Index (DLQI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire. The relevant data were analyzed using paired t
test.
Results: Mean base score for dermatology life quality index in our sample was 10.94, which was within low
limits of averaged for their norm. Moreover, after 6 weeks of treatment, quality of life significantly improved
particularly in domains of symptoms and feeling.
Conclusion: Dermatologic diseases like chronic dermatitis influence quality of life of patients. Even a
feasible dermatologic intervention could significantly improve the quality of life in people who are suffering
from such disabling illnesses.

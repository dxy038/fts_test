The objective of this work is to study the influence of the manufacturing technology on the varistor characteristics and its equivalent circuit. For this aim, a comparative study between two types of ZnO varistors, prepared by conventional and chemical methods respectively, was accomplished. The specimens of the two types of varistors were characterized by their I(V) characteristics, before and after the application of electrical impulses. It was shown that the preparation method can have a great influence on its characteristics and equivalent circuit.

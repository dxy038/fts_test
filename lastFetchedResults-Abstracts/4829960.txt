Recommender Systems are information systems that attempt to recommend items of interest to particular users based on their explicit and implicit preferences. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims at assisting the decision maker in the decision making process, or giving the decision maker a recommendation, concerning a set of actions, alternatives, items etc. Thus, despite their differences, Recommender Systems and Multi-Criteria Decision Making share the same objective which is supporting the decision making process and reducing information overload. In this paper we propose a novel hybrid Multi-Criteria Trust-enhanced CF (MC-TeCF) approach. The proposed MC-TeCF approach combines the MC user-based CF and the MC user-based Trust filtering approaches to alleviate the standard Single-Criteria user-based CF limitations. Empirical results demonstrate the significance and effectiveness of the proposed MC-TeCF approach in terms of improving accuracy, as well as in dealing with very sparse data sets or cold start users compared with the standard Single-Criteria user-based CF approach.

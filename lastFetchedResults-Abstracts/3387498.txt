An amplitude-only measurement setup can measure the axial ratio and tilt angle of an elliptically polarized wave. During design, both the amplitude and phase of the linear components are needed. The equipment measures the amplitudes directly. A nomograph, using the well-known relationships between polarization components determines the phase of the vertical component relative to the horizontal. The value of the nomograph goes beyond the stated objective, because it shows the relationships between the variables. The nomograph gives both the requirements for good circularity, and the sensitivity of the various parameters

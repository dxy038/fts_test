As most of you might know, the Vice-President (VP) of Member Services and the Chapter Coordinator organize a chapter chair meeting and training in conjunction with the annual IEEE International Symposium on EMC. The objective of this meeting is networking and exchange of experience. A fixed part of this meeting is the presentation of chapter activities by the chapter chair. During the chapter chair meeting in Raleigh (North Carolina) it occurred that a presentation given by one of our Distinguished Lecturers (DL) was mentioned by more than half of the chapters present. The person that delivered numerous DL presentations world-wide was Vignesh Rajamani. I think this notable achievement is worthwhile and thereby take the opportunity with this Personality Profile to introduce you to Vignesh.

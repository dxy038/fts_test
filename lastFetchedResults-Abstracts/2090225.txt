In this paper, we propose a solution to the Multi-Robot Dynamic Task Allocation problem. We use Multi-Objective optimization in order to estimate, and subsequently, make an offer for its assignment. The motivation is to provide a generic solution, independent of the domain, with an aim to better utilize resources such as time or energy. The algorithm provides a significant degree of flexibility, and can be implemented in a number of diverse domains, provided the modeling of the parameters follows the convention presented. For this, we take into account – besides the distance traveled – the efficiency of a robot in a specific task type. The system has been shown to demonstrate scalability, as the experimental results indicate. It is also capable of responding to changes in the environment.

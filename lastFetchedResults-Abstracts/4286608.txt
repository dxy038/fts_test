Two power bipolar transistors structures called the trench base-shielded bipolar transistor (TBSBT) and Gate Associated Transistor (GAT) were proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Those structures incorporate deep P+ area in the purpose to achieve high current gain without compromising on the breakdown voltage. In this paper, we suggest a new behaviour for a bipolar bidirectional switch with very low on-state voltage drop, and having a fully turn-on/turn-off control for main application. We propose to use two high current gain bipolar power transistors, one to control the forward current, and the second one to short-circuit the complementary diode, thus, for the first time, significantly decrease its power dissipation.

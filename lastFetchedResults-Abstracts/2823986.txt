In this paper, we developed an interactive global illumination application for mobile devices and we show that interactive filtered importance sampling is possible even with a low-power mobile graphics processing unit (GPU). Taking the limited power and the screen size of mobile devices into account, we designed a user interface that allows selecting different predefined objects, environments and textures. With our implementation, desired materials can be visualized interactively by changing the parameters of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF).

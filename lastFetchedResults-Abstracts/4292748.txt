Summary from only given, as follows. This paper describes the optimization of design variables of SLIM using finite element method and SUMT sequential unconstrained minimization technique). Thrust is taken as objective function in order to maximize thrust under constant current drive, and seven independent design variables and nine constraints are chosen. As the result, g/r and dal/T of good criteria in SLIM design are determined.

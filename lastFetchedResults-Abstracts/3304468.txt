As photovoltaic (PV) energy continues to gain market penetration due to the lower cost of photovoltaic (PV) modules, attention is shifting to the balance-of-system. In this paper, a new efficiency evaluation technique based on a usage model synthesized from high temporal operational data of a PV module is investigated along with a multi-objective design optimization of the DC-DC stage of a Module-Integrated Inverter. The analysis shows that the technique provides more accurate results then the California Energy Commission weighted efficiency method particularly when other geographic regions of the world are considered.

Outliers are considered as a set of data that distinctly stands out from the rest of that
data. Accepting or rejecting the outliers depends on various factors. The objective of this
paper is to explain the accepting or rejecting conditions of outliers. Studying the congestion
of the outlier units is one of the which through which the acceptance or rejection
conditions can be figure out. In this method, it is first needed to identify the outliers that
have congestion and then decide about the accepting or rejecting them. Discussions are
presented following some examples to obtain higher level of underestimating of the proposed
method. In addition, the return to scale of outliers are determined and discussed
by using some examples.

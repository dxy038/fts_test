This paper presents the methodology from evolving a climbing Six Articulated-Wheeled Robot (SAWR) to realizing the simulation result for physical-testing with 3D printing fabrication. The design of the SAWR is obtained from a single-objective evolution process where the morphology of a climbing SAWR is optimized (minimized). The fittest SAWR obtained from the simulation is then fabricated with 3D printing technology and assembled with sensors and motors for real-world testing. Results show that the fabricated SAWR is able to achieve 80% of the performance of the fittest SAWR in the simulation.

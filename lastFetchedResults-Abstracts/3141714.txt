In this artical, four evolutionary programming algorithms (Standard EP, Meta-EP, Continuous Standard EP and Continuous Meta-EP algorithms) are applied to test to maximizing a solution against a highly multimodal test objective function. We will use the same population size to compare the effectiveness of these four algorithms according to their success rate, average number of function evaluation and average best fitness. We experiments with different population size.

Some measurements are described that pertain to the high frequency behaviour of the vibrations of the string and soundboard of the guitar.Three isolated soundboards of different woods were compared with respect to their early decay times (by means of measurements of their vibrational impulse responses), in order to assess its possible use as an objective measure of the reverberation time of the plates. The results of all these measurements show that high frequency vibrations and radiation occurs significantly from 1 to 14 kHz, but that the sound radiation has harmonics at frequencies up to 20 kHz. This report does not produce any experimental evidence as to the importance of the high frequency region from the subjective point of view, or to the correlation of the subjective impression of reverberation of the plates with measured data of early decay times, as these aspects were not addressed at this point.

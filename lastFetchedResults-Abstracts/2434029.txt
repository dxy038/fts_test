In this paper, we consider the flow shop scheduling problem with respect to the both objectives of makespan and total flowtime. This problem is known to be NP-hard type in literature. Several algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. We present a multi-objective ant colony system algorithm (MOACSA), which combines ant colony optimization approach and a local search strategy in order to solve this scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm is tested with well-known problems in literature. Its solution performance was compared with the existing multi-objective heuristics. The computational results show that proposed algorithm is more efficient and better than other methods compared.

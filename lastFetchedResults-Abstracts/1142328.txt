The objective of this work was to study the rheological and thermal properties of film forming solutions (FFS) based on blends of gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The effect of the PVA concentration and plasticizer presence on the flow behavior, and viscoelastic and thermal properties of FFS was studied by steady-shear flow and oscillatory experiments, and also, by microcalorimetry. The FFS presented Newtonian behavior at 30 °C, and the viscosity was not affected neither by the PVA concentration nor by the plasticizer. All FFS presented a phase transition during tests applying temperature scanning. It was verified that the PVA affected the viscoelastic properties of FFS by dilution of gelatin. This behavior was confirmed by microcalorimetric analysis. The behaviors of the storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli as a function of frequency of FFS obtained at 5 °C were typical of physical gels; with the G′ higher than the G″. The strength of the gels was affected by the PVA concentration.

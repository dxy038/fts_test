Growth in the outside plant equipment has prompted a demand for longer battery backup which is met by an outdoor battery enclosure (OBE). Maximizing battery life with minimum maintenance is the objective for every provider. This work presents factors affecting the design and specific requirements for a high reliability and low cost battery enclosure. The design process to develop such an OBE is described in detail. Requirements for compliance to safety and regulatory standards are also explained.

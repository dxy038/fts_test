This study developed a shunt-based, semi-active power factor correction (PFC) circuit for a sensor-less speed controller applicable in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). The objective of this novel approach is to increase the PF of the control circuit in order to improve the effectiveness of controlling the speed of the motor. The proposed circuit includes two parallel rectifiers capable of providing good PFC while maintaining simplicity. This study discusses the relevant theories, introduces the components and provides a simulation of the system. Experimental results, involving a sensor-less PMSM rotary compressor for an air conditioning unit, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed device over a wide range of speeds and duty times. The performance was further compared with two other circuits, the results of which prove that this system accomplished the objectives of the study.

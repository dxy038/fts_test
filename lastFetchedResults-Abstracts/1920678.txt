The objective of this study was to determine cardiovascular event rates in diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects from the REACH Registry with established coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or multiple risk factors for atherothrombosis. REACH is an international, prospective, and contemporaneous cohort of patients with â‰¥3 atherothrombotic risk factors only or established atherothrombotic disease, of which 30,043 have diabetes. The main outcomes after 1-year follow-up were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke), and MACEs/hospitalization. The MACE rate at 1 year was positively related to the number of atherothrombotic anatomic sites in diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects, and the rate was higher in those with (3.8%) than without (3.0%, p &lt;0.001) diabetes. Diabetic patients with risk factors only had a lower MACE rate than nondiabetic subjects or diabetic patients with established atherothrombotic disease (2.2% vs 4.0% or 6.0%, respectively, p &lt;0.001 for the 2 comparisons). These differences persisted after adjusting for gender and age. In conclusion, diabetic patients in the REACH Registry have an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared to nondiabetic subjects related to the number of atherothrombotic sites. Although increasing risk, diabetes may not be truly equivalent to previous atherothrombotic events on new cardiovascular event rates.

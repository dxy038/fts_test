In order to eliminate the static error, PI compensator was introduced to the classic two-loop autopilot and the contribution of PI was analyzed while the equivalent time constant estimates of two-loop autopilot with PI was discussed. Four different objective functions were introduced to the design procedures. It is concluded that it is the large gain at low frequency of PI solved the problem of static error.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are an emerging technology that draws a significant amount of research attention. Localization of the nodes in these networks plays a key enabling role in WSN applications. In this paper, the use of Bees Optimization Algorithm (BOA) for localizing the nodes of the wireless sensor networks is investigated. BOA is population-based search algorithm that performs a neighborhood search combined with random search. It is inspired by the natural foraging behavior of honey bees. The summation of the squared range error between the node and the anchors is used as the objective function to be minimized in this work. Different simulation tests with different topologies are conducted based on normal random distribution for time of arrival (TOA) measurements and log-normal distribution for received signal strength (RSS) measurements. The simulation test results showed effectiveness of the proposed approach in case of TOA measurements when compared with the lower variance achievable by any unbiased location estimator.

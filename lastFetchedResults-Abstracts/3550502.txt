This paper describes the concept of a voltage/VAR controller based on an interaction of fuzzy Mamdani controllers, with the main objective of keeping voltages at all busbars inside an admissible band while avoiding line flows to exceed admissible limits. Estimation of sensitivities via fuzzy clustering of load profiles is proposed. A complex rule base interacts with a Newton-Raphson power flow routine in iterative steps until a terminating criterion is met, following a basic min-max approach. Tests to the method reveal it as one order of magnitude faster than a competing simulated annealing routine.

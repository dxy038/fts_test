Objective: Our purpose was to characterize historic and clinical parameters in incontinent women to determine the predictive value for urodynamic diagnoses. Study design: The analysis includes 535 consecutive women with final diagnoses of genuine stress incontinence, detrusor instability, or both. Evaluations included a standardized history, examination, urinary diary, quantitation test, and urodynamics. The analysis used one-way analysis of variance, Ï‡2 analysis with Yates' correction, and Fisher's exact test. Results: A total of 351 (66%) women were diagnosed with genuine stress incontinence, 102 (19%) with detrusor instability, and 82 (15%) with both. Half had symptoms of both stress incontinence and urge incontinence, of whom only 21% had both genuine stress incontinence and detrusor instability. Fewer than half of women diagnosed with genuine stress incontinence or detrusor instability had just symptoms of stress incontinence or urge incontinence, respectively. Evaluation of historic, examination, and urinary diary data for their influences on the predictive value of pure stress incontinence or urge incontinence revealed statistical differences for urethral hypermobility, estrogen deficiency, and incontinent episodes, yet they were not clinically practical predictors. Conclusions: Pure symptoms identify fewer than half of patients with pure genuine stress incontinence or detrusor instability; historic and clinical parameters do not improve the sensitivity of these symptoms.

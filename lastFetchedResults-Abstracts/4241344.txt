Economic considerations make the conventional chest radiograph (X-ray) film an important ingredient in the diagnostic process. An initial clinical investigation for patients with suspected lung ailments is the study of the chest X-rays. The problem of detection for diseases in their early stages are well known using X-ray. A technique involving wavelets coefficient as the feature vector and AndrewÂ´s curve has been proposed for detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). This paper presents new and important results whereby lung cancer (LC) may be detected and differentiated from MTB. A method to calculate misclassification probabilities is given

Background
The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of underestimation and overestimation of postoperative maximum oxygen consumption (vo2  max).
Methods
A prospective analysis was performed on 229 patients who had 38 pneumonectomies, 171 lobectomies, and 20 segmentectomies. All patients performed a preoperative and postoperative (on average 9.2 days after surgery) maximal stair-climbing test. Predicted postoperative vo  2max (ppo  vo2max) was calculated on the basis of the number of functioning segments removed during operation. The patients were divided into three groups: group A (158 cases), patients with a ppo vo  2max within 1 standard deviation of the observed postoperative  vo 2max; group B (56 cases), patients with a difference between the observed postoperative  vo 2max and ppo vo  2max greater than 1 standard deviation (underestimation); and group C (15 cases), patients with a difference between ppo vo 2max and the observed postoperative vo  2max greater than 1 standard deviation (overestimation). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
Results
The only significant predictor of underestimation was a high percentage of functional parenchyma removed during operation (p< 0.0001). The significant predictors of overestimation were a low percentage of functional parenchyma removed during operation (p = 0.01) and a high preoperative   vo2max (p = 0.002).
Conclusions
The prediction of postoperative vo  2max was not accurate in all patients. Those with a large amount of functional lung tissue removed during operation tended to have a postoperative vo   2max greater than expected. Conversely, those patients with a small amount of functional lung tissue resected tended to have a postoperative   vo2max lower than predicted.

As the ultimate objective of maritime transportation - logistics is only achieved by completing safe and sound voyages, it has stimulated the study of the interaction between human and ship borne complex. Using a ship bridge simulator with a movable platform to study various crucial factors may have considerate affects on the performance of operator on board. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - one of the most credible and objective indices in the study on human behavior - performance is utilized as the main parameter. The interaction between human and machine system in such a unique environment with nonstop motion-induced element can be evaluated satisfactory.

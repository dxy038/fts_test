In Islamic Philosophy, two approaches are of significance in clarifying the existential quality of the three modalities. According to the first approach, advocated by Illuminationist philosophers, the triple modalities are subjective and mentally-posited attributes. The second approach is advocated by the Peripatetic philosophers and indicates that the triple modalities are among the objective attributes. The second approach has been attributed to Ibn Sina in current philosophical books.
In this article, the author has refered to Ibn Rushd as a rigourous advocate of this idea and proves that, Mulla Sadra, although taking the middle course in this regard and referring to it as "incidental compromise", agrees with the Peripatetics' approach. His arguements in this respect are in agreement with those of Ibn Rushd in his book
"Tahafat al-tahafut".
In the end, he writes that Mulla Sadra, for justifying his ultimate view concerning the issue of "the concomitant of the claim of the truth of statement and the claim of knowledge", separates his way from Khwajah Nasir al-Din Tusi, who followed the Illuminationists on this issue, and also Imam Fakhr, who believed in the mentally- posited quality of modalities.

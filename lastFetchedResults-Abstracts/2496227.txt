Objective
Few studies exist on the demographics and trends of pediatric central nervous
system (CNS) tumors in Iran. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed all cases
with confirmed CNS tumors admitted to Mofid Pediatric Hospital, Tehran, Iran
during the last 18 years.
Materials & Methods
Data on gender, age of diagnosis, pathologic classification and tumor location
were extracted from the available medical records. We used the last version of
International Classification of Childhood Cancer.
Result
Overall, 258 (81.9%) brain tumors and 57 (18.1%) spinal tumors were identified.
Our subjects comprised of 147 (46.7%) female and 168 (53.3%) male children.
More male dominancy was observed in brain tumors with a male to female ratio
of 1.2 compared with 1.03 of spinal tumors. Malignant CNS tumors were most
common in 1-4 yr age group. The four most common brain tumors in our subjects
were astrocytomas, medulloblastoma, ependymoma and craniopharyngioma.
Overall, 53.1% of the brain tumors were supratentorial. Gliomas, PNET and
neuroblastma were the most frequent primary spinal tumors in our study. We
observed an increasing trend for both brain and spinal tumors that was more
remarkable in the last 5 years.
Conclusion
Our results are comparable with similar single center studies on CNS tumors
during childhood. The observed disparities could be attributed to the single
center nature of our study and geographical, environmental and racial variations
in pediatric CNS tumors. The increasing trend of both brain and spinal tumors
could warrant further investigations at provincial and national levels to
investigate probable contributing environmental risk factors.

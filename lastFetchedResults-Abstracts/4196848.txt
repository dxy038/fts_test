In this work the multiarea optimal power flow (OPF) problem is decoupled into areas creating a set of regional OPF subproblems. The objective is to solve the optimal dispatch of active and reactive power for a determined area, without interfering in the neighboring areas. The regional OPF subproblems are modeled as a large-scale nonlinear constrained optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete variables. Constraints violated are handled as objective functions of the problem. In this way the original problem is converted to a multiobjective optimization problem, and a specifically-designed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed for solving the regional OPF subproblems. The proposed approach has been examined and tested on the RTS-96 and IEEE 354-bus test systems. Good quality suboptimal solutions were obtained, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

This paper focuses on the transceiver design for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximum per-stream mean square error (MSE) which greatly influences the bit error rate (BER) performance. Considering the imperfect channel state information (CSI) in reality, we propose two robust algorithms based on statistical and bounded CSI error models, respectively. For statistical CSI error model, the maximum average per-stream MSE is minimized while the worst-case per-stream MSE is optimized for bounded CSI error model. We utilize an alternate optimization approach to iteratively update the precoding and receiving matrices since the robust min-max per-stream MSE problems are not jointly convex. The objective is monotonically decreased and lower bounded, so the convergence of the algorithms is guaranteed. The improved performance and robustness of the proposed algorithms are verified by simulations.

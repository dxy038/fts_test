A software tool for evaluations of progressive image transmission (PIT) schemes is presented. This tool offers a simple, convenient, and flexible platform for performing these evaluations in a user-friendly manner. Under one platform, the tool permits simultaneous evaluation of two or more PIT schemes using both objective and subjective quality measures. It is an open architecture that makes it easy to add new modules. The authors present illustrative examples of some of the subjective evaluation features of the tool, namely, the difference image and the interactive zoom utility

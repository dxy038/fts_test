This paper proposes a novel Z-source dc-dc converter topology suitable for electric vehicle application. Compared to the existing dc-dc converter circuits, they can reduce in-rush and harmonic current, provide larger range of output dc voltage and improve reliability. It can operate in voltage-fed and current-fed when the place of the source and load is exchanged each other, and it can be perform buck-boost function in these two conditions. Its power flow can be bidirectional. The operating principle and control method of the proposed topology are presented. Analysis and simulation results are given.

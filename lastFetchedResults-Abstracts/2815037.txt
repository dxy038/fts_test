The objective of the NASA Soil Moisture Active &amp; Passive (SMAP) mission is to provide global measurements of soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state. The SMAP measurement approach is to integrate L-band radar and radiometer as a single observation system combining the respective strengths of active and passive remote sensing for enhanced soil moisture mapping. Airborne instruments will be a key part of the SMAP validation program. Here, we present an airborne campaign in the Rur catchment, Germany, in which the passive L-band system Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR2) and the active L-band system DLR F-SAR were flown on six dates in 2013. The flights covered the full heterogeneity of the area under investigation, i.e. all types of land cover and experimental monitoring sites. The obtained data sets are used as a test-bed for the analysis of existing and development of new active-passive fusion techniques.

Objective(s): To develop a nationwide medical classification system in Iran.
Methods: This comparative cross-sectional study was done in 2003-2004. It attempted to evaluate and modify the English classification system and produce a suitable model for Iran in the year 2003-4. We used library resources, websites and E-mail communication with domestic and overseas specialists. The model takes into account the economic, cultural and geographical peculiarities. This model used Delphi techniques and questionnaires properly evaluated in terms of their validity and reliability. The final model was set up after statistical analysis.
Results: In this research, we actually evaluated the international English classification system. We also created a model for Iran, based on five major axes. It seems that to optimize the infrastructure in all these axes, the current national classification system should undergo extensive revision.
Loncluslon: Multi-axis Format, expandability, broader scope, local coding guidelines, necessary modifiers, standardized terminology and chapter organization based on the types of procedures or interventions, could be considered as advantages of our model compared to the current classification system.

The objective of this project is to analyze the feasibility of designing a nonlinear controller for a load-sensing hydraulic servo system. The nonlinear controller is obtained using input-output feedback linearization. By using this technique, the system is not restricted to operate locally about a certain set of operating points. Hence, it shows improved performance over the system described by Kim et al. (1987), which uses a Taylor expansion linearization technique and, thus, is limited to operate about a chosen set of operating points

Introduction: Helicobacter Pylori infection is one of the most common infectious diseases.It can result in chronic gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcers, MALT lymphoma and gastric cancer. The H-pylori infection can lead to a wide range of diseases and the cost spent on the eradication is much less than the cost spent on the treatment of complications of the infection
Objective: Study the efficacy of quadruple therapy (Amoxicillin, Bismuth, Omeprazole and Clarithromycin) on the eradication of Helicobacter Pylori infection.
Materials and Methods: Between March 2011 and December 2011, we conducted a Quazi- experimental study on Helicobacter pylori infectious patients in Anzali. They were included after doing an endoscopy. Eight weeks after taking four-drugs regimen, Urea Breath Test was done to check the rate of eradication.
Result: The majority of the patients were females (58.7 %). The most common symptoms before the treatment were flatulence (76 %) and epigastric pain (74.9 %). The eradication rate was 89.9 %. There were significant differences in all of the symptoms while the difference between gender and eradication rate was non-significant.
Conclusion: Regardless of few side effects, all symptoms of the patients were treated significantly. As the eradication rate was 89.9 %, this quadruple drug regimen was effective on the eradication of the H-pylori.

The objective of this work is the development and optimization of a method for tartaric acid analysis in wines that does not require any sample pre-treatment and with adequate accuracy. A flow injection analysis manifold with three channels, using a dialysis unit to eliminate sample matrix interferences and to accomplish on-line dilution, is proposed for the spectrophotometrical determination of tartaric acid in wines making use of its reaction with vanadate. The proposed method is fast, accurate, simple, economic and does not require any sample pre-treatment. Preliminary studies using factorial designs were performed to determine which operational parameters should be included in the optimization stage. The optimization was performed using a modified simplex algorithm with a response function that included sensitivity, deviation from linearity at low concentrations and residence time, used as an inverse measure of sampling rate. The most relevant analytical parameters of the method are presented, including a comparison between the results provided by the proposed method and by an alternative procedure in the analysis of a set of wine samples from Portugal, with tartaric acid values in the range 0.5–4 g l−1.

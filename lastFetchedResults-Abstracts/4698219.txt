Traditional approaches to apply tabu search method typically require formulating an algorithmic structure for each individual problem. Based on algebraic specifications, the paper presents a unified and mechanical framework for implementing tabu search algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. We define a generalized specification using high-order functions to describe search strategies, from which efficient algorithms can be generated for concrete problems by data type refinement and functional refinement. We also extend the framework for multi-objective problems by enriching specification behaviors. Our approach achieves a high level of abstraction and mechanization without losing performance.

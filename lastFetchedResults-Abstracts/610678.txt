Introduction & Objective: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy disorder that is associated with increased maternal and perinatal mortality. Imbalance between lipid radicals and antioxidant system is discussed as one of the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum ceruloplasmin level and to examine its relationship with severity and complications of preeclampsia.
Materials & Methods: This case - control study was performed on 30 pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia in Hamedan Fatemiyeh Hospital as the case group. 30 women with normal pregnancy, after matching, as controls entered into the study. After measuring serum ceruloplasmin level, complications such as headache, visual disturbances, intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, weight loss and placenta decolmant were recorded in the check lists designed for each patient. Data was analyzed through SPSS software version 16, chi-square and t tests.
Results: Mean serum ceruloplasmin level in the case group was 317.01 mg/dl and in the control group was 197.94 mg/dl. The difference between them was statistically significant. Also headache and visual disturbances in the case group were significantly higher than the control group.
Conclusion: The results showed that serum ceruloplasmin level in the patients with preeclampsia is higher than those with normal pregnancy.

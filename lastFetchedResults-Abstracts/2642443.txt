Objective:
Although  smoking  increase  the  risk  of  cardiovascula
r 
diseases,  its quitting leads to  weight  gain due  to 
increased appetite. 
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  effect  o
f  face  to  face 
dietary   counseling   on   metabolic   syndrome   (MetS)   ind
ices   in 
cigarette quitter. 
Materials   and  Methods:
  This  9-week  parallel  randomized 
clinical  trial  was  conducted  by  participation  of  50
  patients  with 
metabolic  syndrome  who  have  recently  quit  smoking. 
Participants 
were  assigned  randomly  into  two  groups.  Interventio
n  group  (IG) 
received   weekly   nutritional   education   and   consultat
ion,   while 
control  group  (CG)  did  not  receive  any  intervention
.  Before  and 
after  the  trial,  both  groups  were  evaluated  nutriti
onally  using  24-
hour    dietary    recall    questionnaire,    and    metabolic    sy
ndrome 
parameters  were  measured
.
  Paired  T-test  and  ANCOVA  were  used 
for statistical analysis. 
Results
:
After   intervention,   weight,   body   mass   index   (BMI), 
triglycerides  and  systolic  blood  pressure  were  sign
ificantly  different 
between CG and IG, while indices of low-density lip
oprotein (LDL-C), 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and diastolic bloo
d pressure were not 
significantly  different  between  two  groups.  Amount 
of  energy,  lipid, 
protein,   and   carbohydrate   intake   were   significantly
   lower   in   IG 
compare  to  CG.  After  adjustment  of  age,  duration  of
  smoking  and  the 
initial   concentration   of   biochemical   and   anthropome
tric   factors, 
significant  differences  were  found  between  IG  and  C
G  in  the  changes 
of  LDL-C  (
P
-value  0.001),  BMI  (
P
-value  0.001),  weight  (
P
-value 
0.001),  waist  circumference  (
P
-value  0.002),  and  triglyceride  (
P
-value 
0.001).While  the  difference  in  changes  of  HDL-C,  FB
S,  systolic  and 
diastolic blood pressure, were not significant betw
een two groups. 
Conclusion: 
Given   the   findings   of   this   study,   nutritional 
counseling   could   improve   some   indices   of   MetS   in   ci
garette 
quitters.

In order to solve the design problem of coupled inductor in multiphase interleaving bidirectional DC/DC convertor, the universal design criterion of coupled inductor with general applicability was proposed. The Buck+Boost interleaving and magnetically integrated bidirectional DC/DC converter was studied under Buck mode with all inductors coupled symmetrically. The universal design criterion of coupled inductor in multiphase interleaving and magnetically integrated bidirectional DC/DC converter was summarized. When coupling coefficient and number of phases was chosen under the design criterion with constant duty circle, the steady state phase current ripple could be reduced and the transient total output current response speed could be improved at the same time. At last, the design criterion was verified by experimental results.

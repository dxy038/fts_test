Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate serum leptin concentrations in women with endometriosis during treatment with danazol and with leuprolide depot. Study Design: Twenty patients aged 18 to 42 years with regular menses and documented pelvic endometriosis were recruited from a university hospital setting. Treatment was 200 mg danazol 3 times daily for 6 months or 3.75 mg leuprolide depot every 28 days for 6 months. Serum leptin concentrations were measured before, during, and after treatment. A single blood sample was taken from each of 10 control women without endometriosis for comparison. Serum leptin level was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit with human leptin, and analysis of variance and paired t tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Serum leptin levels were almost the same among women with endometriosis as in the control group. Leptin levels were higher among women with endometriosis during treatment with danazol and leuprolide(P< .001). Three months after treatment, leptin values remained moderately higher than before treatment. Conclusion: Danazol and leuprolide increased serum leptin levels. The mechanism of leptin increase is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine whether an adipogonadal axis exists. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:58-62.)

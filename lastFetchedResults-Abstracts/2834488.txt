This paper presents an algorithm to estimate lost bus voltage measurements in balanced distribution networks regulated by centralized control schemes. The objective is to feed controllers with reliable estimations of lost measurements, using the information of similar bus voltage evolutions captured by the remaining measurements. The algorithm was tested in a 32-bus distribution network under different operating conditions.

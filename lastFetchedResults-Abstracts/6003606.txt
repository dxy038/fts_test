The objective of this paper is to make a review of the current status of the project entitled Evaluation of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol data for functional assessment of wetlands (Id6842), developed in the frame of the CSA-ESA SOAR-EU (Science and operational applications research for Europe) program by a consortium comprising I.E.T.R at the University of Rennes 1 and COSTEL-LETG at the University of Haute-Bretagne. The main objective of this project concerns in evaluating fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 time-series datasets to delineate precisely effective and potential wetlands, map detailed vegetation distribution, identify agricultural practices and determine water cycle and waterlevels.

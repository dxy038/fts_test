The main objective of this research was the study of the relation between organizational atmosphere in physical education colleges and the boys' students' entrepreneurship morale throughout the Iranian universities. The research method, considering the nature of the study, is correlative descriptive method. The statistical universe of the study is the directors and professors of the physical education faculties and departments affiliated to ministiy of science, research, and technology in the academic year 2006-2007. From the above mentioned groups 47 professors engaged in the physical education faculties and 150 boy college students were chosen through stratified random sampling.
For data collections two questionnaires "Halpin and Croft' organizational atmosphere" and "entrepreneurship morale" were used. The final coefficient of the questionnaires was estimated as 0.84 and 0.87 respectively. It was used one sample t-test and multivariate regression for data analysis. Data analysis revealed that the organizational atmosphere of the physical education colleges tended toward "being open" in the academic year 2006-2007. The indexes of entrepreneurship morale (creativity, self esteem, improvement motivation, intrinsic control source, futurism, and venture) among the students was higher than average (p<0.05).Also there was a positive meaningful relation between organizational atmosphere and students' entrepreneurship morale (p<0.05, r= 0.533). Regarding organizational atmosphere indexes, three factors i.e. intimacy, disengagement, and hindrances were meaningful anticipators of entrepreneurship morale (F= 30.07, p<0.05). However, there was not any meaningful relation observed between indexes of isolationism (t=-1.274, p=0.215), influence (t=-1.989, p=0.058), emphasis on production (t=-1.299, p=0.206), consideration (t=-0.519, p=0.609) and entrepreneurship morale. As a whole the output of the present research shows that the physical education colleges and departments tend to an open organizational atmosphere and it seems that such an atmosphere has a positive impact on the development and promotion of student's entrepreneurship morale.

Background: For dental treatment of the children who do not cooperate with the dentist, the use of behavior management techniques is inevitable. Behavior management techniques are the means by which the dental health team effectively performs treatment for the child and at the same time, instills a positive dental attitude.
Objective: Determining the behavior management technique's acceptance of mothers referred to the department of pediatric dentistry in Qazvin (2007).
Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study in which a film including 4 different behavior management techniques marked as: general anesthesia (GA), parents' separation (PS), hand-over- mouth (HOM), and voice control (VC) was produced. Before showing each technique, a brief explanation over the technique's characteristics, method, and the objective was given by a pedodontist in the film. A total of 50 mothers who were referred to the pediatric dentistry department of Qazvin University watched the film and later filled out a questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS.
Findings: Mothers' acceptance of P.S was 100%, V.C 92%, HOM 50%, and G.A 30%. There was a statistically significant relationship between the acceptance of voice control and child's order, child's age, and the number of children. Also, a significant relationship between the acceptance of general anesthesia and the child's order and mother's education was found.
Conclusion: According to our data, the parents' separation and general anesthesia are the most and the least accepted technique, respectively.

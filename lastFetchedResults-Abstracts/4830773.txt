Rejecting interferences, whether intentional or otherwise, enhances the quality of the signal-of-interest at the receiver, and hence is important in several applications. In this paper, we assume that the direction of all signals, useful or otherwise, are possibly time-varying, and we are concerned with interference cancellation in this scenario. A novel two-level adaptation strategy, which uses an adaptive version of the MVDR beamformer and switching is used to achieve the required objective. The algorithm also takes into consideration possible spatial coherence between the interference and the signal-of-interest. The directions-of-arrival of the signals are determined at every instant using ESPRIT algorithm.

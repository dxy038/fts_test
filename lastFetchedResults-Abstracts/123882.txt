Hearing disability in children should be detected early, in order to avoid developmental disorders in language, speech, psychological and social behavior.
Objective: To determine Risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss in children.
Material&methods: The association of selected risk factors with sensorineural hearing loss was assessed in a case- control study of 396 children aged under 6 years from 1374 to 1376 in Tehran. 200 cases with diagnosed sensorineural hearing loss who were attending to deaf educational centers were compared with 195 controls who were chosen among the nurseries. The questionnaire was used to obtain informations about maternal and child risk factors.
Results: Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis showed the following factors to be independently associated with increased risk of sensorineural hearing loss in children: positive family history of hearing loss (Odds ratio=1 I.9 , 95%C 1=5.3 - 27.2), parental consanguinity ( Odds ratio=4.l , 95% CI=2.2 - 7.4), seizure (Odds ratio-6.8 , 95% CI=2.2	20.8), hyperbilirubinemia needing exchange transfusion ( Odds ratio=3.3 , 95% C1=1.05 - 10.7), head trauma (Odds ratio=3 , 95% CI=1.001- 9.1), ototoxic drugs(Odds ratio=3.1, 95% CI=1.4 - 6.8), maternal (prenatal) trauma( Odds ratio=15.9 , 95% CI=1.5 - 164.4), maternal (prenatal) rash ( Odds ratio= 13.8 , 95% CI=1.4 - 136.3) and delivery complication (Odds ratio=l.9 , 95% CI=1.003 - 4).
Conclusion: We believe that a dramatic increase in the early detection of hearing impairement in early infancy is achievable. Initially, this would best be accomplished by adopting a policy of screening high risk infants. Pediatricians, in particular, must consider earlier refferal of high-risk patients.

Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have led to many new routing protocols specifically designed for sensor networks. Almost, all these routing protocols considered energy efficiency as the objective in order to maximize the whole network lifetime. However, the introduction of video and imaging sensors has introduced additional challenges. Transmission of these flows requires both energy and QoS aware routing in order to ensure efficient usage of sensors and effective access to gathered measurements. In this paper, we propose a new approach called "energy and delay efficient routing protocol for sensor networks (EDEAR)" based on inductive state-dependent swarm agent. This latter is responsible for collecting information of the state of the network in terms of energy and delay by using continuous learning parameters of the network. The discovery of network has been optimized by proposing a new algorithm based on multipoint relay for energy consumption, thus reducing the overhead generated by the packets exploration. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for different metrics compared to traditional approaches.

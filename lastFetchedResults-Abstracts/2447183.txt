<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To compare side effects between users of two kinds of injectable contraceptives (Depo-medroxy progesterone acetate and Cyclofem).<br /><strong>Materials and methods: </strong>This cross-sectional descriptive study included 250 women, aged 18-40 years, using Depo-medroxy progesterone acetate (DMPA) or Cyclofem. The volunteers were examined six months after using contraceptive, and they were asked about following symptoms: weight changes, irregular bleeding, dysparounia, vaginal dryness, headache, breast pain, bone pain, and discontinuation reason. The data were analyzed by statistical methods.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The important side effects of DMPA were: irregular bleeding (93.60%), weight gain (48%), bone pain (24%) and vaginal dryness (10.40%), while the side effects in the Cyclofem group were: irregular bleeding (65.60%), headache (14.4%) and breast sensitivity (20%). Bleeding pattern changes were the most important problem leading to discontinuation of both contraceptive methods in our participants.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The results of the study showed that the most important problem in both groups was change in bleeding pattern. Proper consulting by a trained expert reduces the high amount of discontinuation and their failure rates.</p>

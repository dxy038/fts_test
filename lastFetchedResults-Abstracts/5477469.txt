In order to facilitate optimal operation of process plants in the presence of disturbances, optimal control structure selection is important. In this paper we review the controlled variable selection, c = Hy, where y includes all the measurements. The objective is to find the matrix H such that steady-state operation is optimized when there are disturbances and inputs are adjusted to keep c constant. Several cases are studied such as optimal individual measurements, optimal combinations of fewer/all measurements and combinations of disjoint measurement subsets of fewer/all measurements. The proposed methods are evaluated on a distillation column case study with 41 trays.

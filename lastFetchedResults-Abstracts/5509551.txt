The time delay of Lurie nonlinear systems, in which the origin of the nonlinear systems is the absolute stability, is estimated by using a Liapunov-Razumikhn function. Two sufficient conditions are obtained about absolutely stable criteria of nonlinear systems. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the presented algorithm. We find that the key problem is how to choose tau. The value of tau depends on the set D that relates to Liapunov matrix Q. So the optimization (Q<sub>best</sub>,tau<sub>max</sub>) is our objective. By using computer aided tools and Liapunov matrix equations, we can obtain the optimization tau

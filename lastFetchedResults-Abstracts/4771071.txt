It is essential for the sustainable development of a city to establish a set of index system for the synthetic evaluation of ecological park city which is objective, appropriate and practical. This thesis attempts to construct a set of index system for the synthetic evaluation of ecological park city, in terms of the economic environment, ecological environment, environment protection and infrastructure. The weights of the various indices are calculated by the means of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The synthetic evaluation of ecological park city is evaluated by means of grey clustering. The paper concludes that the model is both scientific and practical.

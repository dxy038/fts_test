Path optimization problem is an important component of Emergency Logistics. According to the emergency incidents occurring in Emergency Logistics, We build an uncertain programming model, which is based on the shortest travel time as the objective function, and make the model closer to reality. The model use the traffic time as fuzzy variable, the demand quantity of disaster location as random variable, and in consideration of vehicles required to service within a specified time window, otherwise it will cause more losses. A hybrid algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the model and algorithm.

Pulse compression technique avoids the transmission of a signal having small pulse width and high peak power for better range resolution by transmitting phase or frequency modulated large pulse width signal having comparatively low peak power signal. This paper demonstrates an application of non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), a multiobjective algorithm, to generate biphase pulse compression codes from length 49 to 59. But the aperiodic autocorrelation function(ACF) of the phase coded signals contains range sidelobes which act as self clutter in radar target detection. The efficiency of these codes depends upon the energy content in the range sidelobes of their autocorrelation functions. Peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated side lobe level (ISL) are the two performance measures for pulse compression codes. A code is chosen for an application if the ISL and PSL value is within tolerable limits. In this work PSL and ISL are chosen as the objective functions for generating biphase code.

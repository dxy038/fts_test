Introduction: The embryo transfer to uterus is the most important process with can limit the success rate in IVF. The existence of pathogenic microorganisms in cervix may lead to infection of embryo at the time of transfer. Objective: In order to determine the relationship between microbial flora of cervix at time of embryo transfer and IVF outcome a longitudinal study was conducted on infertile women in IVF center of Mirza Koochak-Khan hospital in the years of 1379-80.
Materials and Methods: Thereby 100 eligible women were entered study consecutively. They underwent IVF treatment. After transferring the embryo, 2 cm of the end of using catheters were cut and put in the tubes of physiology solution, then either cultured in chocolate agar or blood agar 5% containers. And were incubated for 48-72 hours in aerobic-anaerobic conditions.
Results: The culture results were positive in 53 patients. The most frequent pathogen was E.Coli.
The overall clinical pregnancy rate was I0% (10 cases). This rate was significantly more in patients with negative culture than positive cultures (14.9% versus 5.7% P=0.03) and the ongoing pregnancy rate was 10.6% and 3.8% respectively (p=0.015).
The patients with positive and, negative culture were not significantly different about the mean of: age, HMG consumption, serum estradiol, FSH measures and the number of embryo transferred. The mean of infertility period was different significantly, 8.9+3.8 in negative and 7.1+4.4 year in positive culture patients (p=0.03). Conclusion: The contamination of cervix with pathogenic microorganisms at time of embryo transfer is associated with decrease success rate of IVF treatment.

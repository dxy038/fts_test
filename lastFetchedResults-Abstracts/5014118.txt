The QoS based route optimization is a key issue of the wireless network, which is a NPC-hard multi-objective discrete optimization problem. In this paper, an efficient multi-objective artificial bee colony optimization algorithm based on Pareto dominance called MOABC is proposed to tackle this problem. The algorithm was evaluated on a set of different scale test problems and compared with GA based multi-objective optimization algorithm for this problem. The experimental results reveal very encouraging results in terms of the quality of solution and the processing time required.

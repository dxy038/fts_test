Purpoe
To report the reult of a propective clinical erie to evaluate the management of both torion and diplopia in a large group of patient after full macular tranlocation (FMT) and extraocular mucle urgery.
Deign
Propective interventional cae erie.
Method
Information gathered included demographic, viual acuity, ocular motility, torion by Maddox rod, ocular hitory, and ymptom of viual diturbance. urgery on two, three, or four extraocular mucle wa performed baed on the magnitude of torion meaured after FMT urgery.
Reult
Fifty-three patient were included for both objective and ubjective outcome and were evaluated after FMT, both before (preoperative) and after (potoperative) extraocular mucle urgery. Preoperative torion for two- (n = 6), three- (n = 8), and four-mucle (n = 39) urgery group wa 21.2 ± 4.6, 30.0 ± 6.3, and 40.5 ± 8.7 degree, repectively. At 6 month, potoperative reidual torion wa ignificantly reduced in each group (to 3.4 ± 3.2, 5.6 ± 5.5, and 4.5 ± 6.8 degree, repectively, for two-, three-, and four-mucle group). Mucle urgery reduced mean hypertropia from 17 ± 6 prim diopter preoperative to 4 ± 10 prim diopter potoperative (P < .0001); mean exotropia wa mildly reduced from 20 ± 9 prim diopter preoperative to 13 ± 11 prim diopter potoperative (P < .01). ubjective data regarding diplopia and tilted viion after FMT and mucle urgery were available on an additional 10 patient (n = 53 + 10 = 63). Overall, 41% (26/63) of thee were free of both diplopia and tilt, wherea only 5% (3/63) had both ymptom contantly.
Concluion
Extraocular mucle urgery i effective at relieving the variable amount of torion produced by FMT when graded to match preoperative torion. The majority of patient were free of diabling tilt and diplopia after extraocular mucle urgery

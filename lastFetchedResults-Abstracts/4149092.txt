Novel bidirectional optical cross-connect structures using a single arrayed waveguide grating router and tunable fibre Bragg gratings have been proposed for interleaved multiwavelength ring networks. In the proposed structures, each wavelength channel is independently switched by tuning the centre wavelength of the gratings. The feasibility of the cross-connectors has been experimentally demonstrated. A homodyne crosstalk less than -26 dB and a backscattering suppression ratio of -35 dB have been obtained

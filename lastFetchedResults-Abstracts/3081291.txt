The purpose of HYPOS-DILETR project (funded by the Leonardo da Vinci Programme - DG Education &amp; Training) was to develop a tool for organizing attractive European distance learning in designing, operation and monitoring of the hybrid power systems (HPS). Energy planners, decision makers, engineers in energy generation and transportation, as well as technical personnel of regional environment/energy agencies, from different European countries, could evaluate in this way the qualitative and functional role of using HPS, containing one or more renewable energy technologies (RETs). The following guidance and training opportunities appeared: related to the electrification of isolated areas, one can prepare competent specialised teams, who would implement and exploit HPS on large-scale (short-term objective); stimulating the HPS market through raising awareness of electricity distribution networks and of the large public, signalling the importance of developing the hybrid systems market, as well as through transferring the activities related to HPS from the specialized industry, to the public services (long-term objective); promoting large-scale implementation of the HPS technology through elimination of installation, operation and maintenance deficiencies

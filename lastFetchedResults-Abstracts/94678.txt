A (mu) synthesis power system stabilizer (MPSS) design is presented for a two-area system in this paper. The uncertainty is modeled based on structural information of the system and the bifurcation parameter induced nonlinear change in the bifurcation subsystem that experiences, produces, and causes the full system bifurcation. The control objective is to damp out the interarea oscillation as well as maintaining the bus voltages for the variation of the uncertainty parameter. The determination of the robust control device location that is expected to give better control performance is discussed. The performance index definition reflects the desired control purpose. A very flexible robust control configuration that can be easily applied for different control designs is shown. The RGA matrix is studied to evaluate the robust power system stabilizer design. RGA matrix information suggests that the control structure and capability of disturbance rejection have been drastically improved by MPSS design. The time simulation verifies the improvement of control performance and robustness.

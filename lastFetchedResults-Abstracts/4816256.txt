In the Present approach, the optimum process parameter is found out by using Fuzzy logic technique in Electric discharge machining (EDM) of Al-18% weight SiC metal matrix composite (MMC).The experiment is followed by Box-Behnken central composite design method under different combination of process parameters such as peak current (I<inf>p</inf>), pulse on time (T<inf>on</inf>), flushing pressure (F<inf>p</inf>).Three responses like Material removal rate (MRR), Tool wear rate (TWR) and Surface roughness (R<inf>a</inf>) are considered for economic improvement in production and job quality of the product. A fuzzy model is developed to establish the relation between the process parameters and the responses by using the Membership function (MF). The objective of this fuzzy model is to find the predicted results over a wide range of machining conditions to verify the experimental results. Finally the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique is carried out to check the significance of the models and study the effect of process parameters.

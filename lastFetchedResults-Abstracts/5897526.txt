In this paper, multi-objective genetic algorithm applied to the regional water resources optimal allocation, through definition of economy, population, water resources and environment three objective function and the constraints, the regional water resources optimal allocation model has been established, and then multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to solve the model. The model gets different results for 50% and 75% of optimal allocation of water resources of Ningxia in 2030. The result of example proves that the method is reasonable and feasible in the application of region water resources optimal allocation.

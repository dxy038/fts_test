Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies are beginning to play a significant role in power systems research. A combination of ANN/AI methodologies can be forged into a formidable technique using the symbolic strengths of AI to aid the massively parallel and distributed processing models utilized by ANNs. The authors attempt to bring a philosophical perspective to this hybrid approach and examine it from different angles. Voltage stability enhancement is used as an example area and the ideas are being tested on it. The main objective is to promote discussion amongst the researchers and to investigate how this method can be used effectively

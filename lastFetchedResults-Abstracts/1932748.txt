Despite the wide geographical distribution of coati (Nasua nasua) from the south of Canada to the north of Argentina, studies regarding the reproductive characteristics of this species are extremely limited. The objective of this study was to describe the various characteristics of coati semen by morphometric and ultrastructural analysis. Five mature males were anesthetized and electroejaculated for the collection of semen. Semen was immediately evaluated for color, volume, pH, sperm motility, vigor, morphology, acrosomal integrity, percentage of live cells and hypo-osmotic response by light microscopy. Sperm cell morphometry and ultrastructural analyses were also performed. Observations of seminal characteristics determined by electroejaculation in captive coatis represent a valuable baseline dataset for establishing fertility standards and provide background information that may be useful for assisted breeding programmes in members of the Procyonidae family.

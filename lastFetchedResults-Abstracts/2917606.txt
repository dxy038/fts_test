The work reported represents an initial attempt to account for radar propagation effects on land clutter and shadowing near coastal regions. The authors demonstrate an optical ray-trace method in which the index of refraction is modified by topographical features in accordance with some relatively simple meteorological assumptions. Their objective is to develop a methodology for combining propagation and terrain effects, rather than to accurately model the coastal meteorology itself. They have been studying terrain effects on clutter and target shielding using a terrain data base known as DTED (Digital Terrain Elevation Data) published by the Defense Mapping Agency. The data base provides terrain elevations on a 100 m grid for much of the EarthÂ´s land mass

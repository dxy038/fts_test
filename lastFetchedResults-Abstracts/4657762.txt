This paper presents an overview of the Multiwavelength Optical NETworking program (MONET) including networking demonstrations and major research thrusts. The objective is to integrate research on network architectures, advanced technology, and network management with business drivers to demonstrate the viability of high capacity, cost effective, reliable, transparent multiwavelength networks that can be commercially viable in the context of both commercial and DoD applications

OBJECTIVE: To document frequency of Hepatitis B and C in patients undergoing elective surgery.
DESIGN: Descriptive case series

Anti-HCV was reported positive in 60 (12.0%) patients in which 38 (63.3%) were females and 22 (36.6%) were males. Overall 19.7% subjects had been vaccinated against HBV.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the high prevalence of hepatitis B and C in pre-operative patients is present in our population.

This paper presents an optimized controller based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) for a longitudinal axes of multivariable system in one of the aircraft flight conditions. This controller has been developed to control the attack angle and pitch attitude angle independently. These angles are required for designing a set of direct force modes for longitudinal axes. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find the global optimal solution for this problem. The autopilot system in military or civil aircrafts is an essential component and in this paper, the autopilot system via 3 degree of freedom model for the control and guidance of aircraft is considered. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated by considering the HIMAT military aircraft. The simulation results verify the merits of the proposed controller.

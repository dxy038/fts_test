Objective
The present study was performed to examine the prevalence of and associations between calcification in the coronary arteries, aortic arch and carotid arteries, assessed by multislice computed tomography (MSCT), in an elderly population.
Methods and results
This study was part of the population-based Rotterdam study. From October 2003 until July 2004, subjects underwent a 16-slice MSCT scan. Calcification was quantified by calculating the Agatston, volume and mass score. Current analyses were performed in 600 subjects (mean age 74 years). The prevalences of calcification in the coronary and carotid arteries were higher in men compared to women. However, aortic arch calcification was more prevalent among women. In men, correlation coefficients based on the Agatston score ranged from 0.40 (between coronary and aortic arch calcification) to 0.54 (between aortic arch and carotid calcification) (p < 0.001). Correlation coefficients for women ranged from 0.30 (between coronary and aortic arch calcification) to 0.40 (between coronary and carotid calcification) (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
While the prevalences of calcification in the coronary and the carotid arteries were higher in men compared to women, aortic arch calcification was more prevalent among women. Moderate to strong correlations between calcification in different vessel beds were found.

In preparation for the forthcoming EC legislation, UK electronics and electrical industries and industries whose products incorporate electrical or electronic elements will need a much higher level of expertise in electromagnetic compatibility than is currently available. The main objective of the MSc course described is to produce engineers whose knowledge of EMC will enable them to make important contributions to their companies up to and beyond 1992.

The course makes use of the existing screened room and the open-site facilities at the Universities of Hull and York

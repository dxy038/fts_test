Reuse and agility are all basic requirements in a rapid development environment. Among all disciplines, componentization is crucial and also the foundation to maintain a consistent responsiveness between business and IT. Based on this objective, this paper proposes that first the terminology of semantic mediation needs to be clarified. This should not be initiated from the macro architecture layer; instead we propose that both mediation and interoperability should impact components first and push semantics strategy directly into the micro process to be synthesized into the service layer. To achieve this goal, a precise framework for its life cycle includes, decision, analysis and design are key steps in building the skeleton of enterprise integration. In this research paper we deal with the component identification, we further explore the brief of micro mechanism of component interference and service provisioning in achieving service virtualization.

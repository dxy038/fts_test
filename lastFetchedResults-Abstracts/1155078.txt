Ductile regime grinding of silicon wafer has advantages such as smooth surface roughness (Ra < 10 nm) and minimum subsurface damage layer (<10 Î¼m). With ductile regime grinding, the subsequent processes such as etching and rough polishing processes can be minimized in the production of silicon wafer. To achieve ductile regime grinding, a fundamental concept is the application of grain depth of cut being less than the critical cut depth, dc, of the silicon wafer. The objective of this paper is to derive, and to investigate by experiment, the dc value for silicon wafer grinding. Following these key steps, the effects of dc on various major grinding parameters are studied.

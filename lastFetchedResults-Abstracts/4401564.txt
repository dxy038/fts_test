The current works on the data centers have revealed that most of the network resources are underutilized when adding the resources to the data centers. This under utilization results in congestion while routing the data across the data centers. This can be improved by the load balancing over the bottlenecked links. The traditional method handles the load balancing by implementing the protocols at the hardware level. This makes hard for the network management and trouble shooting. This can be improved using the Software Defined Networking (SDN) approach of load balancing. Software Defined Networking is a new emerging technology which helps in fast way of introducing the services to the market without depending on the vendor based configuration of the devices. The SDN helps in making the control decisions that are no longer limited to algorithms offered by network equipment provider and hence we have control over the entire network which helps in saving the running time. The proposed work implements the heuristic method of load balancing by defining our own objective function that classifies the best path and best server and makes it available for fast discovery to future requests. Thus proposed method makes the load balancing at the switch and router to be fast, making switches dump and cheap to do which achieves the simplicity of load balancing instead of complex network management of legacy systems.

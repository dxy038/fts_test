The objective of this paper is to summarize the recent literature and application examples of the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in the industry. Main focus in this paper is primarily on the use of collaborative wireless sensor networks for condition and performance monitoring of the industrial machines and plants. Current challenges and potential future research issues are outlined for design of WSN-based industrial monitoring systems in order to provide guidelines to researchers and application developers.

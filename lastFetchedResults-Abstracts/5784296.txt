In mobile Ad-hoc networks forwarding data through intermediate relays extends the coverage area and enhances the network throughput. Dynamic assignment of routes for data transmission from sources to destinations that is optimized based on channel conditions in a cross-layer manner could provide improved performance. We consider a general multiuser two-hop transmission, where each flow is subject to a constraint on the end-to-end buffering delay and its associated packet loss rate as a quality of service requirement. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate between source destination pairs, while the QoS requirement is satisfied. We introduce two new cross-layer dynamic route selection schemes in this setting that are designed involving physical, MAC, and network layers. In cross-layer opportunistic dynamic route selection, the routes are assigned dynamically based on the instantaneous state of fading channels. In time division cross-layer dynamic route selection, the route for data transmission is scheduled based on the average quality of links. Simulation results show that our proposed cross-layer dynamic route selection schemes provide superior performance in comparison to prior art.

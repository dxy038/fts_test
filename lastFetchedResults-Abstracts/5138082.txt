The matrix converter (MC) has been subject of investigation since 1980 and with the constant improvement of power electronics semiconductors along with the microelectronics it is now possible to efficiently and reliably implement such a topology. The MC finds its application wherever bidirectional power flow and controlled voltage and current in AC systems is needed and proves to be superior to its competitors when applied in certain specific environments and circumstances. Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) are a recent growing research topic where MC is found to be promisingly more efficient as power electronic controller. This paper discusses what a MC is, what are the different WECS configurations and the latest published advances and trends in this area of knowledge.

This paper made a multiple objective programming model, taking into account priority of the waiting time for being arranged in hospital for each kind of patients in a cycle, using Lingo software we made a solution, and we compared the model results with that of the model of First Come First Served (FCFS). The results showed that from three evaluation index, that is, comparison coefficients, total deviation for all the patients´ waiting time for surgery and the disposition of doctors, the efficiency of hospital beds is more reasonable. Total deviation for all the patients´ waiting time for surgery is 0, it is much better than the FCFS Model.

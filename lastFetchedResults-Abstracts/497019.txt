In this work, a packed bed reactor of methyl acetate hydrolysis process has been studied.
First, mass transfer limitations from bulk fluid to catalyst surface and then from surface into catalyst body
were investigated quantitatively. Whereas diffusion had no any limitation on the overall rate of reaction, a
pseudo homogeneous one dimensional model considering axial dispersion coefficients was developed. A
LHHW kinetic model for rate of reaction and a Longmuir model for equilibrium adsorption of species on the
catalyst, developed experimentally, were used in the mathematical model. An experiment of pulse-input
feed to reactor was performed and concentration of reactor product versus time was determined. The model
were solved by the numerical method of lines and the absolute difference between calculated concentration
profile and those measured experimentally was defined as the objective function which was optimized by
Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. A comparison of our model with ideal Plug Flow model and
also with previous model in literature shows that this model is more accurate and more comprehensive than
the others and can be used in many comparable industrial cases.

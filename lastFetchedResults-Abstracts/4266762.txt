In this paper we present a novel method for video cameras positioning and reconfiguration, to maximize visual coverage in complex indoor environments. Based on a suitable modeling of the camera field-of-view and of the environmental setup, the optimization procedure determines the most appropriate configuration of cameras to satisfy a coverage objective, taking into account a number of parameters on the quality of view at the camera position. This includes the global ground area coverage, the expected geometric distortion, and the entropy of the image. The proposed solution has been validated in different environmental setups, including synthetic settings, taking into account the presence of obstacles and constraints.

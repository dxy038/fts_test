The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) operational requirements document (ORD) emphasizes interoperability as one of the DoD\Â´s most crucial goals. Interoperability can be achieved by seamlessly integrating the MUOS satellite communications system into the ubiquitous DoD network of networks, the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN). The DISN has six components, the Unclassified but Sensitive IP Router Network (NIPRNET), the Secret IP Router Network (SIPRNET), the Defense Switched Network (DSN), the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) and the video teleconferencing centers (VTC). Each of these services contains a unified group of standard interfaces and applications with which MUOS user communications must be compatible. This paper addresses these interfaces and applications. Further, it proposes quality of service (QoS) mechanisms and standards to ensure the Global Information Grid (GIG) supports the ORD goal of providing the "timely transport of information to users throughout the world".

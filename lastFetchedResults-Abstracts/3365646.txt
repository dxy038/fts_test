The objective of this study was to estimate rice crop damage over the entire Cambodia during a large flood event from July to November 2011. An integrated approach was applied to detect and monitor flood areas with flood depth and duration for near real-time rice crop damage estimation in 2011 by using MODIS time-series imagery. The combined data consists of developed MLSWI, EVI from MODIS, new FID from DEM, land use, and simplified empirical damage curves. These data are expected to play an important role in emergency response efforts and rapid risk assessment for high-risk flood areas in the Cambodian floodplain. A rice crop damage map will be generated, showing areas with different damage levels based on flood duration and floodwater depth, including 25% (8 days, below 1.5 m), 50% (8 days, over 1.5 m; 16 days, below 1.5 m), and 100% (16 days, over 1.5 m). The resulting map was validated and shows about 80% consistency with the government census based on field-scale investigation and survey.

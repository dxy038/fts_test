This paper proposes advanced single-phase AC-DC converter using single-phase matrix converter (SPMC) topology incorporating with active power filter function. The topology is also capable of incorporating many other features for controlled rectifier operation that includes; bidirectional, regenerative and dual converter capabilities. The PWM technique was used to calculate the switch duty ratio to synthesize the output. Switch commutation arrangements were developed that allows dead time to avoid current spikes of non-ideal switches whilst providing a current path for the inductive load to avoid voltage spikes. Selected simulation and experimental results are presented to verify proposed operation.

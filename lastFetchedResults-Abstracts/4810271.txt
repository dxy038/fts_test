A transition from Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) via capacitive coupling in order to provide feeding to the so-called Ridge Gap Waveguide (RGW) has been investigated. The main objective of this work is to find a way to facilitate integration of active electronics with the gap waveguide structure and also to do measurements of the components made in gap waveguide technology working around 100 GHz. The transition design and simulation of S parameters for the designed topology is presented.

In this paper, we propose a new method able to correct errors the dematerialization the documents, especially the invoice document. We use on Electronic document readers able to read and recognize the relevant information. The process consists on: digitizing an important quantity of documents and passing them through an electronic documents reader. Then treating (correcting) the error recognition. The final objective is to find an electronic document reflecting all information included in the original document (physical document). To achieve this issue we develop a new parser which is applicable to a large kind of documents, especially correcting the detected errors. This parser is based on the formal concept analysis.

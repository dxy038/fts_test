International outsourcing and intermediate goods trade as a signal of economic globalization have been in progress. One of the benefits of technology transfer is acquiring foreign technology with higher efficiency, as technology spillovers lead to increased productivity of local firms. In this study, objective is to investigate the effects of international outsourcing, hightechcapital, foreign direct investment spillovers and capital stock of R&amp;D on total factor productivity in selected hightech industries in Iran. we have specified a theoretical framework, and then estimated its empirical version by the panel data econometric method for the selected hightech industries in Iran during the period (20002012). The results show that the estimated coefficient of international outsourcing (OS) is statistically significantat the 5% of significance level.The results also indicate a significant positive effect of hightech capital and FDI spillovers on total factor productivity in the selected Iranâ€™s hightech industries. However, the results show that the R&amp;D capital stock has not been statistically significant in the estimated total factor productivity equation for such industries.

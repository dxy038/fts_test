The objective of this paper is to control a single phase power rectifier using FPGA based PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controller to get a required output. Nowadays PWM control technique has become an integral part of the most power electronics system. This technique is the most suitable one for controlling the output voltage of a power rectifier. In this design the PWM control technique is incorporated in an FPGA which is dynamically reconfigurable. The experiment was conducted using Atlys Spartan-6 FPGA Development Kit which is used for control purpose. The VHDL code for different PWM pulse generation topologies was written and behavioral simulation of the architecture was done using ModelSim 6.2c .The synthesis was done in Xilinx 13.2 software. The bit file generated after the synthesis was downloaded to Atlys Spartan&#174;-6 FPGA for output verification using Digilent Adept software. Now this FPGA based PWM control architecture is used to control Gate signal of power switches of single phase power rectifier. By this way ON and OFF time of circuit MOSFETs can be controlled to obtain the desired D.C output voltage. To verify the proposed control strategy and FPGA controller, a prototype has been build and studied. The performance of the power rectifier with the FPGA controller is promising and attractive for harmonics free power supply applications.

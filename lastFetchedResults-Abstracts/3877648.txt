In this paper, a three-phase current-fed dual-active-bridge (DAB) bidirectional DC-DC converter is presented. Compared to the voltage source DAB converter, the proposed converter allows low RMS current and maintains zero voltage switching (ZVS) in the whole operating range by keeping the ratio between primary side and secondary side DC-link voltage constant, leading to high efficient energy conversion over a wide input voltage range. In addition, the ZVS conditions can be maintained using small DC inductors and the input current ripple still remains small because of high DC inductor current ripples being alleviated by three-phase interleaving structure. Furthermore, the proposed topology with Y-Y connected transformers is proven to have better current sharing capability compared with other three-phase topologies with different transformer connections. The operation mode analysis, soft switching conditions, and hardware design guidelines are derived in this paper. A 6-kW hardware prototype with input voltage range of 24~48 V and rated 288 V output voltage is developed and tested in the laboratory. The experimental results verified that the proposed converter could maintain high efficiency over a wide input voltage and power range.

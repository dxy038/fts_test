Serially received multiplexed pixels of an image are decoded and scanned on the probes array to stimulate the retina to reproduce the image. This paper presents a retinal stimulator (RS), which needs only six interface wires irrespective of array size. RS decodes the time-multiplexed pixels of the image and scans them on the probes array. RS doesnÂ´t need address to route the pixels. It is a bidirectional device that can also retrieve responses from retina as a reader and sends out multiplexed readings through reverse telemetry

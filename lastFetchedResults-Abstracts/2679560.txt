The classical economic production quantity (EPQ) model is a well-known and commonly used 
inventory control technique. Common assumptions in this model are that all units produced are 
of perfect quality and shortage is not allowed, since in practice shortage, non-conforming 
product or scrap items are possible, these assumptions will underestimate the actual required 
quantity. The objective of this paper is to provide a framework to integrate production of 
imperfect quality items, inspection errors, rework, scrap items and backlogging into a single 
EPQ model. To achieve this objective a suitable mathematical model is developed and the 
optimal production lot size which minimizes the total cost is derived. The sensitivity analysis 
results indicate the model is very sensitive to shortage cost per unit shortage and type-I error of 
inspection. While findings of this study show that the model is very sensitive to parameters 
type-I error of inspection, proportion of defectives in production process and shortage cost per 
unit short, it is much less sensitive to parameters like proportion of scraps in rework process and 
Type-II error of inspection. If the existence of such error and shortages are ignored, then the 
obtained results may differ considerably from the optimal outcome. This will impose additional 
costs to the system.

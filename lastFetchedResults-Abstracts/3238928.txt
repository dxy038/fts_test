Scale-of electric vehicle (EV) charging will bring great impacts to the operation of the power grid. Coordinated charging can guide these effects to the beneficial aspects. This paper firstly derived a steady mathematical model of single charge load as the basis of coordinated charging scheduling. Secondly, based on the schedulability of the EV charging load in time domain, a new kind of coordinated charging control method is put forward. An optimal model is proposed with the objective of minimum total load energy, concerning capacity of transformer and distributing lines and demands of charging time. By changing the charging time of each EV, minimum fluctuation of the total load curve be achieved. This method is verified the effectiveness by the simulation results. At last, the application design scheme in actual EV charging station is introduced for engineering application.

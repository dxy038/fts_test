Fuzzy set theory is a powerful and robust mathematical frame work to handle many optimization problems. Floor planning is an important step in the physical design of VLSI circuits, whose goal is to optimize the layout of the chip. With the development of IC designs, more and more issues need to be considered. As a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), it is very difficult for floor planning to balance various objectives simultaneously using traditional linear weighted penalty function. To overcome this problem, fuzzy rules and membership function are employed to combine various objectives in this paper. It is a convenient method of combining conflicting objectives and expert human knowledge. Experimental results show that this approach is stable and efficient which can obtain encouraging results in shorter time. Through the experimental results, we can have an intuitive understanding of objectives with various changes in parameter settings. This method can also be extended to handle other large scale MOP problems.

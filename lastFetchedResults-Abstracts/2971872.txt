The objective of this paper is to combine spatially enhanced event-related desynchronization (ERD) data recorded during motor imagery experiments to the anatomy of the brain. Four methods available, the local average reference method (LAR), the surface Laplacian method (LP), the linear estimation method (LE) and the analytical de-blurring method (AD) are applied to the event-related data. All methods yield similar and stable ERD patterns with respect to the location of the maximal desynchronization. The maximal ERD percentage values were found over the contralateral sensorimotor areas of the brain around 625 ms after the presentation of the cue stimulus

Objective: The success of sacral neuromodulation in the treatment of urge incontinence has been reported in young populations. Herein we report the success in an older, urge-incontinent population. Study Design: A cohort of 25 patients older than 55 years who had failed conventional therapy for the treatment of urge incontinence underwent percutaneous S3 sacral nerve test stimulation. Patients were considered candidates for permanent implantation if they were cured or had a greater than 50% improvement in incontinent episodes. Responders were implanted and completed a questionnaire, bladder diary, and disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Results: Twelve of the 25 patients (48%) responded to the test stimulation. The average follow-up after permanent implantation was 7.8 months. All patients obtained a >50% reduction in their incontinent episodes; 2 patients achieved total dryness. Conclusion: Our small cohort suggests that older urge-incontinent patients have improvement with sacral neuromodulation but cure rates may be lower than with a younger population.

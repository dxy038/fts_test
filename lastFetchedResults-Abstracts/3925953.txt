A nadir objective vector is constructed from the worst Pareto-optimal objective values in a multiobjective optimization problem and is an important entity to compute because of its significance in estimating the range of objective values in the Pareto-optimal front and also in executing a number of interactive multiobjective optimization techniques. Along with the ideal objective vector, it is also needed for the purpose of normalizing different objectives, so as to facilitate a comparison and agglomeration of the objectives. However, the task of estimating the nadir objective vector necessitates information about the complete Pareto-optimal front and has been reported to be a difficult task, and importantly an unsolved and open research issue. In this paper, we propose certain modifications to an existing evolutionary multiobjective optimization procedure to focus its search toward the extreme objective values and combine it with a reference-point based local search approach to constitute a couple of hybrid procedures for a reliable estimation of the nadir objective vector. With up to 20-objective optimization test problems and on a three-objective engineering design optimization problem, one of the proposed procedures is found to be capable of finding the nadir objective vector reliably. The study clearly shows the significance of an evolutionary computing based search procedure in assisting to solve an age-old important task in the field of multiobjective optimization.

Objective. The value of rest technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi scintigraphy under oral nitrate medication to predict myocardial viability was examined in patients with chronic infarcts.

Background. The value of rest Tc-99m sestamibi to predict viability in infarct regions has not been fully established because significant underestimation of viability, especially in the inferior myocardial wall, has been reported.

Methods. Forty patients with Q wave myocardial infarction underwent Tc-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography under nitrate medication before revascularization of the infarct-related artery. Wall motion was quantified from paired angiograms before and 4 months after revascularization. Tracer uptake was quantified in the central infarct region identified on the angiogram.

Results. The average Tc-99m sestamibi uptake in the central infarct region of patients with anterior infarcts and improvement of left ventricular function was significantly higher (68 ± 12%, mean ± SD) than in patients without improvement of function (40 ± 14%, p < 0.02). The average Tc-99m sestamibi uptake in the central infarct region of patients with improvement of function and inferior infarcts was significantly lower (43 ± 7%) than in patients with anterior infarcts (68 ± 12%, p < 0.003), but was significantly higher than in patients with inferior infarction and no improvement of function (31 ± 7%, p < 0.02). Using an infarct location adjusted optimal threshold (50% for anterior infarcts, 35% for inferior infarcts), Tc-99m sestamibi had  positive predictive value of 90% and  negative predictive value of 91% for improvement of left ventricular function.

Conclusion. Quantitative rest Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy after oral nitrates reliably predicts improvement of left ventricular function after revascularization if infarct location adjusted thresholds are used.

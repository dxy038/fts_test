Cleanliness of body surface is very important to the performance and precision of an instrument. Surface of industrial production touch switching is silver plated copper and there are still some contaminations on it after cleaning processes. They will affect the quality of the product in a certain extent. So the effect of cleaning processes is very important. This paper describes the use of image processing and image recognition technology to detect the surface cleanliness of industrial production touch switching. This method can remove human interference. The theory analyses and experiments prove that this method can improve the accuracy of the detection and decrease issues of product quality. And the results of image processing and image recognition can give an objective evaluation of the surface cleanliness.

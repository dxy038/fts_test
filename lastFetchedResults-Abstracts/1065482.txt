Background and Objective: Objective evaluation of clinical and professional competency is one of the most important aspects in medical students' clinical education. Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) evaluates a large spectrum of technical and basic skills in an experimental setting. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two methods of evaluation Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) and Traditional Practical Examination (TPE) on students' satisfaction in Gonabad Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery.
Materials and Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental research. The samples consisted of 45 nursing and medical emergency students who selected Practical Principles and Techniques. They were collected by the census methods and were evaluated by both Objective Structural Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), and traditional methods. For data gathering, a researcher- made questioner was used to poll about methods and check lists of skills assessment that were prepared by considering the standards of nursing skills. Moreover, its validity and reliability had been confirmed. The data was analyzed with a paired t- test and independent t-test using of Spss/20 software.
Results: The mean score of OSATS was higher than that of TPE and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.00). Also level of OSATS was higher than that of TPE (P = 0.00).
93.3% of students agreed with the evaluation by OSATS in future.
Conclusion: It is concluded that Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) can evaluate more practical skills and gain more studentsâ€™ satisfaction. Teachers also have a positive attitude towards this type of evaluation.

Many existing large ground reflector antennas have been designed as Cassegrain systems-i.e., paraboloid/hyperboloid combinations. Other large ground antennas are simply paraboloid designs. Upgrading the gain of these systems to a gain comparable to that obtainable with a dual shaped reflector antenna system has been an important and costly objective of many such ground stations. A potentially economic method for such an antenna upgrade is presented herein. It involves a redesign of only the subreflector portion of a Cassegrain antenna or the introduction of a subreflector feed system for a parabaloid. A pair of offset subreflectors are synthesized which will give a controllable high gain amplitude distribution in the aperture of the large paraboloid. The synthesis method that is used is based on an approximate formulation for an offset dual shaped high gain antenna that was first presented by Galindo-Israel and Mittra in 1977. In that approximate formulation, the geometrical optics (GO) energy was scattered from a subreflector and then from a second large reflector which reflected a uniform phase distribution. In the present offset dual shaped subreflector (DSS) antenna, the second reflection is from a smaller (sub) reflector and it scatters a spherical wave that feeds a hyperboloid or feeds a large paraboloid directly. Excellent results are shown for the approximate synthesis of the DSS.

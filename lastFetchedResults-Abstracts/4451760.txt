The objective this research is to effectively integrate a cane into at-home rehabilitation that can be used with many existing 3D games. Current 3D interfaces for games are not usable for many populations with physical impairments and are often not adaptable to rehabilitation exercises (e.g., balance exercise, assistive device training). To address this, we present the iterative design of a novel cane-based 3D interface for at-home rehabilitation games. We report preliminary results from an initial pilot study, which offers insight into the future design and potential effectiveness of canes as at-home rehabilitation game interfaces.

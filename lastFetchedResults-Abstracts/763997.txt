This study offers empirical measures for the concepts of cultural
capital and social identity, analyzes the relationship between
various dimensions of cultural capital and how one defines himself
and examines the correlation between cultural capital and salience
of various social Identities. The study consists of a survey
research conducted among 250 preuniversity students of Bookan
city. Based on the theory offered by Pierre Bourdieu cultural capital
has three dimensions: subjective, objective and institutional.
Social Identity includes ethnical identity, national identity, religious
identit y and universal identit y. There isnâ€™t a positive correlation
between cultural capital and the salience of the identities. Yet, the
highest degrees of correlation are with ethnic and individual and
national and religious identities, while the lowest is with global
Identity. Also, the correlation between the various types of social
identity and institutional and subjective dimensions of cultural
capital is to some extent different from that with the objective
dimension. Also, There is a meaningful relationship between the
subjective dimension of cultural capital and tribal and national
identities; while there is no meaningful relationship between the
subjective dimension of cultural capital and the international and
religions identities. And there is no meaningful relationship
between the international dimension of cultural capital and the
international, religions, national and tribal identities.

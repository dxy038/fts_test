Objective
This study was planned to compare the effects of neurodevelopmental treatment
and sensory integration therapy on gross motor function in children with
cerebral palsy
Materials & Methods
Twenty two children with spastic CP were randomly divided into two
groups. Sensory integrative therapy was given to the first group (n=11), and
neurodevelopmental treatment was given to the second group (n=11). All
children were evaluated with GMFM-88. Treatment was scheduled for three -
one hour sessions per week for 3 months.
Results
Twenty two children with spastic CP (11 diplegia and 11 quadriplegia)
participated in this study. When two groups were compared, a significant
difference was found in lying and rolling (P=0.003), sitting (0.009), crawling
and kneeling (0.02) and standing ability (P=0.04). But there was no significant
difference in walking, running, and jumping abilities between the two groups
(0.417). Paired t-tests revealed a significant difference between pre and post
test results, with increases in scores of lying and rolling, sitting, crawling and
kneeling, standing in sensory integration therapy (SIT) and neurodevelopmental
treatment (NDT) approaches.
Conclusion
Neurodevelopmental treatment and sensory integration therapy improved gross
motor function in children with cerebral palsy in four dimensions (lying and
rolling, sitting, crawling and kneeling, standing). However, walking, running
and jumping did not significantly improve.

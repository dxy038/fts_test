Given that improvement in efficiency is a major resource to economic development, this can be applied to each domestic sector of an economy.  The objective of this paper is to measure technical efficiency of the Iranian Post Company across the countryâ€™s provinces using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The ranking of technical efficiency has been calculated by using collected data on post offices across 32 Iranian provinces in 2011 based on assumption of constant return to scale imposed. 
The study has specified two models of DEA to explore efficiency of post offices for all Iranian provinces. The first model has shown that provinces of Alborz, Semnan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Tehran and Bushehr are technically efficient, while the second model has clarified the efficient units, which have been located in the 13th, 14th and 19th zones of Tehran province and the 16th zone of Bushehr province.

Background and Objective: In inlay restorations, most of the polymerization occurs out of the mouth. The aim of this study is to compare two types of restoration for micro leakage amount. Subjects and Methods: Thirty four premolars were randomly divided in two groups. In the direct composite restorations, mesio-occlusal cavities were prepared. After etching and bondig the cavity, 1 mm of the floor of the box was filled with F2 composite and the rest of it was restored with Nulite F. In the direct inlay composite group, cavities with same dimensions but with divergent walls (5-6 degrees) were prepared. Then Tetric Ceram composite was directly formed and cured in the cavity. Inlays were taken out and heated in boiling water for seven minutes. Then sandblasting by aluminum oxide was performed and inlays were cemented in the cavities with Rely X cement. Then the specimens were thermo cycled and immersed in 2% fushin for 24 hours. Samples were investigated with stereomicroscope with magnification ratio of 40 and analysis was done with Mann-Whitney test.

Results: All the samples in to the two groups are in score 0 and score 1 division based on their microleakage (without microleakage: score 0, microleakage to enamel: score 1). The data analysis showed that the two groups had not significant statistical difference.

Discussion: Although in direct inlay restorations most of polymerization shrinkage occurs extra oral, but it is not sufficient for complete reduction in micro leakage amount but this restoration is clinically suitable as direct composite restoration. Sci Med J 2011; 10(1): 107-113

This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm based approach for arriving at optimum load allocations for boilers and generators together with optimum values of import power from the grid and export of power if any under time of use rates satisfying all operating constraints. The objective function is nonlinear owing to the thermal and electrical systems involved which increases the complexity of the nature of the constraints also. The problem can be simulated using matlab in GAOT toolbox and the proposed scheme can render at least 4% in the average demand. The TOU tariff plays an important role in the development of the operation strategy.

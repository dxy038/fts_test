Large volume of data generated by manufacturing plants requires suitable techniques for extraction of useful information of the operational status of the process. By distributing the capabilities of data processing close to sensor level, the response time will be reduced and the accuracy of analysis will be improved. A new conceptual sensor node developed for distributed data rectification is presented. The node realizes data collection and nonlinear search within resource-limited systems using the reconfiguration capabilities of an SRAM-based field-programmable gate array. The node can effectively analyze data through online dynamic programming-like algorithms and be applied into a class of problems where the objective is to capture characteristics of sensors data while optimizing performance objective functions.

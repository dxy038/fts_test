Incomplete information intelligent processing extensible algorithm, is a new algorithm that can simulate the thinking process of the human brain. Through the analysis of the characteristics and objective object, puts forward the information full degree, Related domain, the common features of object, the individual features of object, characteristic vector concepts etc., and discussed the sufficient condition to distinct objects in the data class under the incomplete condition, and puts forward the method of constructing diagnosis experience database which could simplify condition. The sufficient conditions of Extensible intelligent reasoning could make it possible that intelligent reasoning is in progress successfully under the condition of incomplete data and the reasoning results are correct. This research is verified by intelligent diagnostic tests of TCM.

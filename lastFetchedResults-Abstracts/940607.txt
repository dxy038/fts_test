Numerical modelling of subsurface flow constructed wetlands (CWs) gained increasing interest during the last years. The main objective of the modelling work is, on the one hand, to increase the insight in dynamics and functioning of the complex CW system by using mechanistic or process based models that describe transformation and degradation processes in detail. As these mechanistic models are complex and therefore rather difficult to use there is, on the other hand, a need for simplified models for CW design. The design models should be premium to the currently used design guidelines that are mainly based on rules of thumb or simple first-order decay models. This paper presents an overview of the current developments on modelling of subsurface flow CWs based on the modelling work and model developments presented at the WETPOL 2007 symposium. Three kinds of models have been presented: simple transport and first-order decay models, complex mechanistic models, and a simplified model that has been developed for design of CWs. The models are presented and selected results are shown and discussed in relation to the available literature.

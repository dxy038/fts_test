The objective of this work is to investigate potential accuracy improvements in the fingerprint-based indoor positioning processes, by imposing map-constraints into the positioning algorithms in the form of a-priori knowledge. In our approach, we propose the introduction of a Route Probability Factor (RPF), which reflects the possibility of a user, to be located on one position instead of all others. The RPF does not only affect the probabilities of the points along the pre-defined frequent routes, but also influences all the neighbouring points that lie at the proximity of each frequent route. The outcome of the evaluation process, indicates the validity of the RPF approach, demonstrated by the significant reduction of the positioning error.

An efficient immune response against the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis  is critically dependent on rapid detection of the invader by the innate immune response and the activation of the adaptive immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) contribute to innate immunity by the detection of Mycobacteria-associated molecular patterns and mediating the secretion of antibacterial effector molecules. TLRs influence the adaptive immune response by upregulation of immunomodulatory molecules supporting the development of a Th1-biased T cell response. In this manner, activation of TLRs contributes to defense against microbial infection.

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) can be considered as the right tool to reduce the complexity of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) development through its principles of abstraction, separation of concerns, reuse and automation. In this paper we present the results of a systematic mapping study we performed for providing an organized view of existing MDE approaches for designing WSNs. A total number of 780 studies were analysed, among them, we selected 16 papers as primary studies relevant for review. We setup a comparison framework for these studies, and classified them based on a set of common parameters. The main objective of our research is to give an overview about the state-of-the-art of MDE approaches dedicated to WSN design, and finally, discuss emerging challenges that have to be considered in future MDE approaches for engineering WSNs.

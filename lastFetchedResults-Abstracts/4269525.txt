A full procedure to generate models for magnetic components is presented in this paper. The final objective of this work is to obtain a model of a magnetic component that takes into account frequency effects (capacitive effects as well as short circuit impedance calculation) integrated in a CAD environment, i.e. to automate the generation of models for magnetic components. A set of tools has been developed to help in the generation of the model. The model is generated with the help of a finite element analysis (FEA) tool. The user interface with the FEA tool is very easy, so it is not necessary to know in depth how to work with the FEA tool. Experimental results are included in this work. Simulations are compared with experimental results

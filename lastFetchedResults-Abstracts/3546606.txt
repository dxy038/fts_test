The basic concept of `design&#194;&#191; may be defined as a translation of an idea into a physical reality, or, in equivelent terms, the translation of a `need&#194;&#191; to a `solution&#194;&#191;. Thus, the activities of engineers and designer become almost synonymous. While it is convenient, and to an extent necessary, to separate different steps of design, it is vital to pay proper attention always to the correct balance and overall concept. The objective of the paper is to sketch out the `System approach&#194;&#191;, entailing the combination of the many different disciplines involved in producing engineering goods, illustrated by the authorÂ´s experience in `heavy electrical engineering&#194;&#191; and acknowledging the Corfield Report. Stress is placed on the overriding need to consider the economic requirements, with special reference to a total-energy concept, and the implication of computer-aided manufacture leading to computer-integrated manufacture.

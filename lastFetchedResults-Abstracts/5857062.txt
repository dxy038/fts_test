To improve the real-time and robustness of the dynamic visual recognition, this paper proposed a new mechanism and implementation techniques for evolutionary recognition, which is a perceptive--expressive interaction imitating the oil painting process. This mechanism can transform the oil painting process of continual observation, multi-level description, and repeated confirmation into the gradual maturity process of evolutionary objects driven by the force of evolution, as well as analyze the evolution process of evolutionary objects. Also, this paper put forward an evolution model of the evolutionary object as well as three kinds of evolution driving force, discussed the key technologies of evolutionary recognition, verified the feasibility, as well as raised questions that need to be resolved through the experiment of road environmental objective recognition.

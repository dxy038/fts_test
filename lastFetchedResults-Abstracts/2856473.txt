The Earth mover´s distance (EMD) is a measure of distance between probability distributions which is at the heart of mass transportation theory. Recent research has shown that the EMD plays a crucial role in studying the potential impact of one-way vehicle sharing paradigms like Mobility-on-Demand (MoD). While the ubiquitous physical transportation setting is the &#8220;road network&#8221;, characterized by systems of roads connected together by interchanges, most analytical works about vehicle sharing represent distances between points in a plane using the simple Euclidean metric. Instead, we consider the EMD when the ground metric is taken from a class of one-dimensional, continuous metric spaces, reminiscent of road networks. We produce an explicit formulation of the Earth mover´s distance given any finite road network R. The result generalizes the EMD with a Euclidean &#8477;<sup>1</sup> ground metric, which has remained one of the only known non-discrete cases with an explicit formula. Our formulation casts the EMD as the optimal value of a finite-dimensional, real-valued optimization problem, with a convex objective function and linear constraints. In the special case that the input distributions have piece-wise uniform (constant) density, the problem reduces to one whose objective function is convex quadratic. Both forms are amenable to modern mathematical programming techniques.

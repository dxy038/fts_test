Collaboration is one of the ways of improving the competitive edge of individual firms and/or groups of companies. However, it is reported in the literature that 70% of collaborations fail. One of the main reasons of failure is lack of shared benefits. The main objective of this paper is to explore and develop a model for sharing benefits based on the participantÂ´s contribution. This is achieved by: understanding the factors contributed by the participants, through the study of literature and through pilot case studies. Developing a conceptual model to measure contributions. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a model for assessing the nature of collaboration between enterprises and for distributing the resulting benefits.

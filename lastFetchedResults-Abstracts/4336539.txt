A hyper-complex wavelet phase coherent method is presented in this paper to detect image micro motion. The horizontal and vertical shift of image can be described by phase of hyper-complex wavelet, then, based on the theory of phase coherent, the local phase difference objective functions of every scale are constructed, and the local image shift is constrained by minimum of the objective function, then image motion is estimated by the multiscale strategy to fuse the shift parameters. Experiments have indicated that multiscale hyper-complex wavelet phase coherent method overcomes the difficulties of lacking regular texture, few feature points and cluttered backgrounds of the country scenarios images, and estimates the image micro motion effectively.

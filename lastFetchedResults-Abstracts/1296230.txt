The main objective of the present study is to investigate the relationship
between the managers’ entrepreneurship and the quality of the staff’s
working life and determining math pattern for the employee's quality of
work life based on the managers' entrepreneurship. The research population
includes all managers of Islamic Azad University employed in different
branches of the university. Using the stratified and cluster random sampling,
456 mangers, along with three employees under the supervision of each
manager (total 1368 staffs) were chosen from different branches of Islamic
Azad University. The assessment tools were the researcher-made
questionnaires of entrepreneurship and the quality of work life. The
questionnaire of entrepreneurship was administered to the managers, and the
questionnaire of the quality of work life was administered to three staffs
under the supervision of each manager. The results of the analysis of the
multi-variation regression showed that there is a relationship between the
managers’ entrepreneurship and the quality of the staff’s working life (p £
0.05 & = 0.10), and the math pattern for the quality of the staff’s working
life based on the managers’ entrepreneurship in the branches of Islamic
Azad University is as follows: The quality of the staff’s working life = 0.10
× the managers’ entrepreneurship + 135.621.

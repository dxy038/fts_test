There is presented control system design with autonomous control elements focused on field of automotive industry in this paper. The main objective of this document is description of the control and monitoring system with integrated image processing from the camera. The images obtained from the camera are used for recognizing routing and traffic situation. During system proposal we focused our attention on integration of components for the car localization using GPS and navigation system as well. The implemented embedded system communicates with other car control units using CAN bus and industrial Ethernet. The communication interface between driver and car integrated system is carried out by process visualization on the LCD touch panel.

Historic cities in Iran are the most valuable cultural heritage that expresses the dynamism, vitality and symbol of urban life. 
Architectural and urbanity of ancient Iran includes principles that have been manifested in the heart of the tradition. In recent decades, due to unbalanced expansion of cities and discontinuity of spatial organization, and arrival of new technologies, globalization and the space density, traditional city is far from its truth and it has created challenges for traditional urbanism and modern urbanism. Therefore, the main content of this paper includes spatial structure approach, respecting the history and concepts of Iranian traditional city. Certainly, utilizing traditional patterns and benefiting from past experiences could be a good and useful foundation for urban development patterns in the future. Searching climatic patterns and patterns of access based on traditional experiences can lead us to achieve harmony with the environment. The necessity of understanding the concepts of traditional city, cultural features, indigenous and historical context and criteria for recognition for structure can result into creation of objective models. This research tries to achieve the traditional Iranian pattern for design of historical context in Miyaneh city. The hypothesis of this study is to improve the environmental quality of traditional urban patterns through studying traditional patterns. The study method is, descriptive-analytic with use of practical subject and data. The initial recognition of structure was reviewed though library documentations, travelogues, maps and the data were completed by the direct information obtained by the author. Finally, two sets of questionnaires were prepared for Yazd and Semnan in order to evaluate the hypothesis. Other questions were designed to assess the influence of the old context in the neighborhood shrine in Miyaneh.  
The guideline of the historic axis for middle cities was presented by analysis of the old structure and identification of key areas of context, as the result of the identification of key areas of context, as the result of the study.
Important points of the guideline are as follows:
- Organic Maintenance 
- Strengthen the relationship between the forecourt and bazaar
- Unaffected new spaces of physical and semantic features of the old spaces
- Using an existing model and concepts of architecture modeling based on context as the Chahar Bagh principle of traditional cities

Tourism supply chain management (TSCM) has emerged as an important area in tourism research, and is attracting increasing attention from both the academic and practitioner communities. In TSCM, supplier selection and evaluation is a key phase. Based on the review of relevant literatures, a supplier evaluation index system was constructed in accordance with the features of tourism supply chain (TSC), and an entropy-weighted extension matter-element model for the comprehensive evaluation of supplier was also built according to matter-element model, extension method and theory of correlation function in this paper. By calculating entropy weight and comprehensive correlative degree, multi-index evaluation is boiled down to single-objective decision, and precise numerical rating result is given. This model is applied to the supplier selection process of a certain tour operator company, and the alternative suppliers are sequenced, so as to choose the optimal and suboptimal suppliers. The research shows that entropy-weighted extension matter-element model is characterize by easy operation, clear practical significance and precise evaluation results, which can be well applied to supplier selection of TSC.

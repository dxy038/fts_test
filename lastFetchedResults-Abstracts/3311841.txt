Although the problem of reactive power planning has been extensively studied, uncertain factors are rarely taken into account in traditional reactive power compensation models. For the wind farm output randomness, the paper applies chance constrained programming theories to establish the model of multi-objective wind farm reactive power compensation, which makes voltage level and power loss as the objective functions. The method of wind farm approached to the modeling and power flow calculation is discussed, and an improved differential evolution algorithm combined with Monte Carlo stochastic simulation technology is proposed to solve the model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and method is validated by IEEE 24-bus system with wind farms.

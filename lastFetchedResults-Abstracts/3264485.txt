Micro-grid system is an integrated energy system asit consists of distributed energy resources (DERs) and multipleelectrical loads operating in parallel or islanded grid. Theprimary objective of this project is to examine whether Microgridimplementation can reduce the cost of energy. It can bedetermined through the modelling bus bar system; 5-Bus TestSystem and 26-Bus Test System. This application can bedivided into three aspects which are modelling, simulation andanalysis. The power system analysis was conducted under twoconditions, steady state condition and contingencies conditionusing two different methods which are optimal power flow andeconomic dispatch. Newton-Raphson algorithm wasintroduced during the power flow analysis. The optimal powerflow and economic dispatch for total generation cost wasobtained through PowerWorld software simulation.

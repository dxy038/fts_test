Our objective was to design fission chambers capable of operating at high temperatures in reactor control, and consequently possessing the essential characteristics of extreme ruggedness for relativity high neutron sensitivity. In the following paper two types of chamber: one designed to operate at 400&#194;&#176;C, and the other at 600&#194;&#176;C, are described.

Spread spectrum techniques are widely used for a multiple access scheme, but another main advantage of this technique is its robustness against important fading. If it is well known that to spread the signal improves the quality of the link, quantitative results relating the BER, the coherence bandwidth and the spread bandwidth of the channel are still missing and it is thus the objective of this contribution to give insights on this point

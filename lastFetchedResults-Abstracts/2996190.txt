A fast and efficient distributed sub-optimal routing algorithm using hierarchical aggregation/disaggregation (HAD) scheme is proposed for high speed Internet based on IPv6. The hierarchical structure eliminates the dominant scaling limit of the routing algorithm. It allows the number of subnetworks that must be known to any single router to be bounded. Our algorithm is different from existing HAD algorithms in high level network routing algorithm and composition algorithm. Unlike the previous algorithms, the origin and destination can be any node in the flat network. We compared our algorithm with traditional optimal routing algorithm by gradient projection (TOR-GP) method using the system delay as an objective function. The results show that our algorithm converges much faster than traditional algorithm, and provides a very good approximation to the traditional algorithm. It is safe to say that the solution should have positive effects to the rapid development of the information super-highway

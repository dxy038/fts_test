In the last few years, extensive research has been performed to extend Internet connectivity to VANETS. Indeed, several routing protocols have been proposed to determine routes between vehicles and gateways (e.g., Road Side Units: RSUs). However, most of these protocols do not use efficiently the bandwidth which is a scarce resource in VANETS. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol to connect vehicles to Internet through mobile gateways with the objective to make efficient use of the network bandwidth. Indeed, the protocol significantly reduces the communication overhead required to establish and maintain the routes relying on the mobility of the gateways. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols in terms of normalized routing load, packet delivery ratio, and end-to-end delay.

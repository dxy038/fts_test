In order to deal with main targets of design methodologies subject to uncertainties in design variables: reliability and robustness, the reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) is developed by integrating the performance robustness and constraint feasibility into a single optimization model. A new RBRDO algorithm is proposed based on the worst case scenario approximation for robustness assessment and the sensitivity-assisted Monte Carlo simulation method for effective reliability calculation. Furthermore, one multi-objective RBRDO formulation is suggested. Overall, an electromagnetic application-superconducting magnetic energy storage device (TEAM Problem 22) is used to investigate performances of the proposed RBRDO methods.

Objective: The purpose of this research is to study the relationship between
mothers’ reminiscing style and children’s narrative coherence. Method: The
samples were 31 children aged 6 (16 boys and 15 girls) from various kindergartens
and their mothers. After showing an animation, a conversation between mother
and her child and also a semi- structured interview between the trainer and the
child was held. Qualitative data collected were analyzed using content analysis
and other statistical methods. Results: show that narrative coherence of children
is augmented by elaborative styles of mothers, whereas this elaboration is similar
between girls and boys. On orienting component, boys have greater coherence
while on emotion and explanation components both boys and girls are the same.
The other finding is that mothers’ close-ended questions are greatly correlated
with children’s narrative coherence. Conclusion: Mothers focused more on
orienting aspects of the event, while paid less attention to evaluating ones, like
emotions and make meanings. The other finding is that mothers’ close-ended
questions are greatly correlated with child narrative coherence. Results could be
applicable in the areas of parenting, communication styles of parents and their
children, and preventive interventions

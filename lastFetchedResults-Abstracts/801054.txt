Objective: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of Project RESPECT in reducing sexual risk behaviors of male to female transgender patients.
Method: In an interventional, quasi-experimental and case-control study, 30 transgender patients (male to female) with high-risk sexual behaviors were selected and divided into two experimental and control groups. Transgender patients in experimental group received a fourâ€“session intervention conducted one session per week individually, but control group received no intervention. The instruments include demographic and Sexual Risk Behavior questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent t-test, chi square and percent differences.
Results: Although frequency of sexual risk behaviors did not change significantly in experimental group, higher sexual risk behaviors were reduced significantly (p?0.01).
Conclusions: Project RESPECT is more effective in reducing higher sexual risk behaviors than frequency of sexual risk behaviors among male to female transgender patients.

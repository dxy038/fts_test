In human emission tomography, an additional transmission scan (x-ray CT or external gamma-source) is often required to obtain accurate attenuation maps for attenuation correction (AC) and scatter correction (SC). These transmission-based correction methods have been translated to small animal imaging although the impact of photon interactions on the mouse/rat-reconstructed images is substantially less than that in human imaging. Considering the additional complexity in design and cost of these systems, the necessity of these correction methods is questionable for small animal emission tomography. In this study, we evaluate the requirement of these corrections for small animal positron emission tomography (PET) through Monte Carlo simulations of the Inveon PET scanner using various sizes of MOBY voxelized phantoms. The 3D sinogram data obtained from simulations were reconstructed in 6 different conditions: Accurate AC+SC, simple (water) AC+SC, accurate AC only, simple AC only, SC only and no correction (NC). Mean error% for 8 different ROIs and 6 different MOBY sizes were obtained against the accurate scatter and attenuation corrections (first on the list). In addition to simulations, real mouse data obtained from an Inveon PET scanner were analyzed using similar methods. Results from both simulation and real mouse data showed that attenuation correction based on solely emission data should be sufficient for imaging animals smaller than 4 cm diameter. For larger sizes, a scatter correction employing an additional transmission scan can also be included depending on the objective of the study.

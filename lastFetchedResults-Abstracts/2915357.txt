A need for advanced simulators for use in training pilots to handle emergencies on or near the ground is noted. There is a lack of mathematical models for the situations involved, so approximations must be used. The article concerns the development of a comprehensive nonreal-time ground handling model. The model simulates the response of the aircraft to steering, control surface deflections, braking and gust inputs. Tyre deformities, shock strut nonlinearities, and the axis transformation between the ground and aircraft axis sets are also included. The objective of the work is to determine the level of complexity required to provide a high fidelity simulation of ground handling characteristics

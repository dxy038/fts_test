We develop an algorithm for the solution of multiobjective linear plus fractional
programming problem (MOL+FPP) when some of the constraints are homogeneous in
nature. Using homogeneous constraints, first we construct a transformation matrix T
which transforms the given problem into another MOL+FPP with fewer constraints. Then,
a relationship between these two problems, ensuring that the solution of the original
problem can be recovered from the solution of the transformed problem, is established.
We repeat this process of transformation until all the homogeneous constraints are
removed. Then, we discuss the multi objective programming part, for which fuzzy
programming methodology is proposed which works for the minimization of perpendicular
distances between two hyper planes (curves) at the optimal points of the objective
functions. A suitable membership function is defined with the help of the supremum
perpendicular distance. A compromised optimal solution is obtained as a result of the
minimization of the The supremum perpendicular distance. The corresponding optimal
solution to the original problem is obtained using the transformation matrix. Finally, an
example is given to illustrate the proposed model.

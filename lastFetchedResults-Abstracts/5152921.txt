This paper describes a methodology tried in field studies at three nuclear sites in a proactive step by the regulator to encourage the interest of safety culture within the industry. One objective of this project was to stimulate action by senior managers of nuclear facilities to review and enhance their safety practices and culture. The second objective was to prepare an industry safety culture report for SKI, describing the current status of the industry safety culture, its strengths and opportunities for improvement. These objectives were achieved by drawing together observations and findings in Management Workshops at the participating sites and by using the data across the three participating nuclear sites to form an overview of the industry in the report delivered to the regulator.

We propose an original approach of a miniature scanning confocal microscope that uses two electrostatic scanners with microoptical lenses. For this chip-scale microscope, we demonstrated the use of optical feedback of VCSELÂ´s laser as an active detection. The z-axis scanner will provide a vertical motion of the first microlens in the range of 100 mum, controlling the focal length of the objective. Raster scanning (30 mum in both directions) of a specimen by the focused illumination spot will be implemented by actuating of second microlens by x-y-axis scanner.

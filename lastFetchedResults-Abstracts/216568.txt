Background: The etiology of infertility has direct influence on the plan and outcome of its management. In this paper we showed the effect of history of tuberculosis (TB) on female infertility among infertile couples admitted to Royan infertility management center. Material and Methods: This case control study was performed on cases that were diagnosed with female infertility (308 women). Controls were women whose husbands were infertile due to some male factor (314 women). Those who had both female and male infertility were excluded from the study. The observed variables were BMI>25 kg/m^2, positive history of smoking, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted disease and pelvic inflammatory diseases. Results: The age adjusted odds ratio of history of tuberculosis for female infertility was 6.21(95 CI: 1.31-29.56).The attributable risk in exposed group was about 1%. Conclusion: According to our study, positive history of tuberculosis may be responsible for female infertility.

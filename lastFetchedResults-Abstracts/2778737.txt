This paper presents control algorithms and sizing strategies for using energy storage to manage energy imbalance for variable generation resources. The control objective is to minimize the hourly generation imbalance between the actual and the scheduled generation of wind farms. Three control algorithms are compared: 1)tracking minute-by-minute power imbalance; 2)postcompensation; and 3)precompensation. Measured data from a wind farm are used in the study. The results show that tracking minute-by-minute power imbalance achieves the best performance by keeping hourly energy imbalance zero. However, the energy storage system (ESS) will be significantly oversized. Postcompensation reduces the power rating of the ESS but the hourly energy imbalance may not be reduced to zero when a large and long-lasting power imbalance occurs. A linear regression forecasting algorithm is developed for a two-stage precompensation algorithm to precharge or predischarge the ESS based on the predicted energy imbalance. An equivalent charge cycle estimation method is proposed to evaluate the effect of providing the energy balancing service on battery life. The performance comparison shows that the precompensation method reduces the size of the ESS by 30% with satisfactory performance.

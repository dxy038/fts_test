The detection of covert channel is of increasing interest in light of the recent study of network behaviorism. However, due to the high variation in legitimate network traffic, detecting covert channel is a challenging task. In this paper, we study and analyze a new covert channel detection methodology, based on the property of scale-free networks, with the objective of enhancing the covert channel detection capabilities.

Background : Vomiting after strabismus surgery is a common incidence and may induce many complications. Different drugs may be used as preventive steps.
Objective : To compare the effectiveness of droperidol and promethazine in prevention of vomiting following strabismus surgery.
Methods : Through an experimental research , 100 patients who were in the age range of 2 to 17 (ASA : 1) and candidated for strabismus surgery were randomly divided into two equal groups (50 cases). As anti-emetic drug , promethazine was infused (0.5 mg/kg/1m) to group A and droperidol (75 Âµglkg/ly) to group B , prior to the surgery. Both groups were followed up for 24 hours after surgery. X2 test was used for statistical comparison of two groups.
Findings : 7 patients (14%) in group A and 11 (22%) in group B had vomiting. No significant statistical difference was observed between two groups.
Conclusion : Promethazine is a good replacement for droperidol in prevention of vomiting, since deoperidol is a foreign product , expensive , may not always be available to anesthesiologists and can cause respiratory depression.

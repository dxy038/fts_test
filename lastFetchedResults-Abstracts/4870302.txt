Based on Kirchhoff Law about arbitrary sinusoidal steady-state circuit network, optimization principle of dynamic design variables is adopted. Making real parts and imaginary parts of sub-circuit current and node potential as design variables, and equilibrium relation between node potential and sub-circuit current as frame-objective function, dynamic design variables optimization algorithm analysis of arbitrary complicated sinusoidal steady-state circuit network is proposed. Universal program computing sub-circuit current and node potential is completed. Practical examples are computed. Effectiveness and feasibility is verified. A new clue is set up for computing complicated alternating-current circuit network rapidly and precisely.

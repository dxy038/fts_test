In view of the actual situations of power grids operating mode, load level, operation and maintenance resource configuration, a multi-constraint &amp; multi-objective integrated outage optimization model of power grids is proposed in this paper. It takes the economy, reliability and workload balance of power grids as the optimizing objectives and adopts the differential evolution algorithm based on the elitist archive strategy to calculate efficiently its Pareto optimum solutions. According to the insufficiency and business demand existing in the outage management of power enterprises, the design ideas for the physical framework, logic framework and functional module of the integrated outage management and analysis decision-making system of power grids are proposed and the Java Platform Enterprise Edition is adopted to develop such system. Upon the quantitative analysis, assessment and comparison on the outage schedules, the system generates automatically the optimal decision scheme and has the functions of automated association and reminder for outage schedules, equilibrium analysis for workload, assistant update of outage schedules and analysis and assessment for outage equipments.

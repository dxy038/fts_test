Whilst there is a common agreement on the need to design e-learning systems able to take into account more explicitly the ´context´ in which learners operate within organizations in order to achieve higher levels of customization (personalized interaction) and impact, many different perspectives exist related to the characterization of which ´context´ has to be integrated in the design process, and how to accomplish it. The objective of this paper is to report on insights generated within an EU-funded research project - LIP (Learning In Process) - aimed at providing highly contextualized e-learning systems addressing the needs of knowledge intensive organizations.

This paper presents the human exposure assessment to high-voltage extremely-low-frequency (ELF) fields by the three-dimensional (3-D) boundary element method (BEM). The formulation is based on a realistic, anatomically based representation of the human body. The main objective is to analyze the influence of the relative position of the arms with respect to the body on the axial distribution of current density along the body and to determine the most vulnerable regions. Numerical results along head, neck, torso, abdomen, arms, legs, and ankles are presented and discussed in the case of grounded subject standing under power-distribution lines and in the vicinity of power transformer substations

Many previous works on the stereoscopic image retargeting are proposed. In this paper, we present the first study on objective assessment for stereoscopic image retargeting quality (SIRQ). Firstly, we build a dataset using four kinds of stereoscopic image retargeting methods and conduct a subjective experiment to evaluate the retargeted images according to ITU´s recommendations. Then we introduce a novel measurement for SIRQ by fusing picture quality and stereo perception quality. We derive an objective metric and validate it by a user study. Finally, we analyse the metric´s performance and discuss the influence factors. It shows that many works are needed to be researched further in the future.

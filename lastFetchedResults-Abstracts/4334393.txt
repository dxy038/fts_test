A vision system architecture called PIRS (Perception Interpretation Robotic System) is described which analyzes scenes for robotic tasks, for purposes of identifying partially occluded and overlapped 3D objects, verifying modifications in a scene for task execution, and looking for an object in processes of task recovery. The objective of this system is to integrate different techniques for a research environment and connect them to diverse sensors and equipment. The system is based on a hybrid architecture which uses logic-based and structural techniques as well as several types of knowledge-base structures. The system consists of a supervisor which controls four main modules: classifier, verifier, predictor and vision processor

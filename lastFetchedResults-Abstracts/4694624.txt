The interdependent global market has created certain opportunities that can best be promoted via universal use of information technologies (IT) and related services, especially electronic data interchange (EDI). The deployment of EDI as a means to facilitate international trade, however, has been hampered by many environmental, cultural, economic, and technical issues in the adopting countries. The objective of the article is to develop a strategic planning model for the adoption, implementation and diffusion of EDI in countries that have not yet developed an EDI program or are in the early stages of adoption. The model identifies generic, as well as country-specific factors that lead to successful implementation of EDI in a national setting. Similarly, general as well as country-specific factors that inhibit smooth adoption of EDI are identified.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

In security defense tasks, multiple robots need work cooperatively to detect offensive intrusion to protect some sensitive areas. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for a multi-robot system with some static sensors. The system concept is that static sensors sense intrusions and act as a cueing sensor to an ensemble of robots. These robots in turn engage the potential intruder, performing surveillance and/or neutralization of the intrusion. To minimize the intruder missing rate and average response time, a STAGS (Shame-level Task Allocation and Gap-based Self-deployment) method is proposed, which is a decentralized method without a central control unit. To further improve the system adaptability under dynamic environments, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) method is proposed to adjust the system parameters of STAGS. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in a dynamic intruder detection task.

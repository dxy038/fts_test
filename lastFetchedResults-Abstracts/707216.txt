The objective of this study was to compare the number of emergency medicine (EM) graduates unable to find a job in the city/area of their first choice in 1995 and 1997. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to EM residents who graduated in both 1995 and 1997. The survey ascertained resident's practice city and state, whether their job was in the city/area of first choice and how satisfied they were with their practice selection. Eighty (83%) programs and 507 (70%) of eligible residents participated. Thirty-eight percent of graduates chose to practice in the city or metropolitan area where they trained and 75% of respondents were very satisfied with their practice selection. Nineteen percent stated they would not be practicing in the city/area of their first choice; one-third indicated there were no jobs available and two-thirds stated that jobs were available but not desirable. These numbers were similar to the 1995 data (P = .79). Job selection was more important than liking (P< .001) or having lived in (P< .001) a desired city/area of practice location. In conclusion, 1997 EM residency graduates were as successful as 1995 graduates in obtaining their first choice of jobs.

This work is about a developed and implemented power quality digital meter to comply with the new Brazilian standard to regulate the Power Quality in Brazil. The objective of this work has been to develop a low cost device able to monitor the main indices of standard such as the steady state rms voltage, harmonic distortion, fluctuation voltage, unbalance voltage, voltage sags and swells and power supply interruptions in real-time. Through a cellular module the device meter is remotely controlled and configured. This way, it can send periodically measurements and information data to a remote server. Other discussed point has been the power quality indices of the standard.

This paper describes a photovoltaic (PV) power system with integrated bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) DC charger. The system enables fast and efficient EV battery charging while providing enhanced grid support by limiting the ramp rate of the PV inverter output power. Charger operation is described in three distinct modes: charging only, charging with grid support, and grid support only. A prototype system consists of a 15 kW grid-tied PV system, a 10 kW, 98% efficient bidirectional DC charger, and a 10 kWh EV battery. Experimental results demonstrate the operating modes, start-up routine, battery state-of-charge (SOC) estimation, and system operation. Simulation results are presented for a worst-case scenario of highly fluctuating PV power output; the vehicle battery is charged in less than 90 minutes while simultaneously reducing the maximum ramp rate of the inverter output power by 30% and the average ramp rate by 93%.

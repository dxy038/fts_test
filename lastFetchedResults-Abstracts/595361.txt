Objective: To assess the early out come of Transhiatal oesophagectomy for carcinoma of the middle and lower third oesophagus. Material and Methods: This observational study was carried out in Cardiothoracic surgery unit, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, from January 2006 to December 2007.50 patients of either gender and any age with a diagnosis of oesophageal carcinoma, willing to participate, were included in the study.

Mean operative time was 125 minutes with mean blood loss of 600 ml. Uncontrollable per-operative hemorrhage necessitating thoracotomy occurred in 2% (n = 1). Anastomotic leak occurred in 8% cases, aspiration pneumonia in 4% and transient hoarseness in 4% patients. One patient (2%) died postoperatively from aspiration pneumonia. Mean ICU stay was 2 days; mean postoperative hospital stay was 9 days. Conclusion: Transhiatal oesophagectomy is a safe approach for carcinoma of the middle and lower third oesophagus.

A groundwater management model has been developed that predicts human health risks and uses a noisy genetic algorithm to identify promising risk-based corrective action (RBCA) designs. Noisy genetic algorithms are simple genetic algorithms that operate in noisy environments. The noisy genetic algorithm uses a type of noisy fitness function (objective function) called the sampling fitness function, which utilises Monte-Carlo-type sampling to find robust designs. Unlike Monte Carlo simulation modelling, however, the noisy genetic algorithm is highly efficient and can identify robust designs with only a few samples per design. For hydroinformatic problems with complex fitness functions, however, it is important that the sampling be as efficient as possible. In this paper, methods for identifying efficient sampling strategies are investigated and their performance evaluated using a case study of a RBCA design problem. Guidelines for setting the parameter values used in these methods are also developed. Applying these guidelines to the case study resulted in highly efficient sampling strategies that found RBCA designs with 98% reliability using as few as 4 samples per design. Moreover, these designs were identified with fewer simulation runs than would likely be required to identify designs using trial-and-error Monte Carlo simulation. These findings show considerable promise for applying these methods to complex hydroinformatic problems where substantial uncertainty exists but extensive sampling cannot feasibly be done

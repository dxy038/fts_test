A vertebrate motoneuron receives an enormous amount of synaptic activity from descending pathways, from spinal cord interneurons and directly from mechanoreceptor afferents. The intrinsic characteristics of the motoneuron will determine how its output spike train will encode the activities of all its inputs. Therefore, the essence of the intrinsic motoneuron characteristics should be well studied and modelled if the roles of the motoneuron as a processing or encoding element are to be well understood. Mathematical models of motoneurons have been described in the literature and tested mostly under static conditions. To increase the reality of the validation of such models, the objective of the present work is to test a few selected models described in the literature using sinusoidal injected current of different frequencies. The resulting frequency responses are compared with data available in the literature from cat type F motoneurons. Discrepancies between some of the models' responses and real motoneuron data suggest that improvements are needed in the modelling of the afterhyperpolarization mechanism.

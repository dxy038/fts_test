The IMOCIM project which received funding support from the Department of Trade and IndustryÂ´s MOPS initiative began on the 1st of May 1992 and completed on the 31st of October 1993. The objective of this research and development project was to develop a methodology for management of change in manufacturing along with a computer based tool to support the methodology. A basic aim of the methodology to be developed was that a holistic approach to change should be adopted, which embraced people, organisation, systems and technology. This paper describes how the above aims and objectives were achieved together with the results and deliverables available from the project.

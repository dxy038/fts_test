We consider the reconfiguration problem in multi- fiber WDM optical networks. In a network with evolving traffic, the virtual topology may not remain optimal, leading to degradation of network performance. However, adapting the virtual topology to the changing traffic may lead to service disruption. This optimization problem hence captures the trade-off between network performance and number of reconfigurations applied to the virtual topology. This trade-off is considered via a multi- metrics approach. The above problem is solved through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation with a multivariate objective function. However the problem is NP-hard and such an approach is unable to solve large problem instances in a reasonable time. Therefore we propose a simulated annealing (SA) based heuristic approach for solving problems of higher complexity. We compare the performance and the computation time of solving the MILP model and the heuristic approach considering different test instances. We can find near optimal solutions for instances of medium complexity using the MILP model. The SA scheme can be used as a heuristic to arrive at near optimal solutions when the run-time of the MILP becomes practically infeasible. It also appears that the trade-offÂ´s involved in the reconfiguration problem cannot be left aside, as a little flexibility with respect to one metric allows to drastically improve the quality of the solution with respect to other metrics.

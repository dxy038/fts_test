This paper adopt fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the mining methods for complex difficult steep coal seam. Using FAHP to calculate weight vectors of each assessment factors, in order to get more real reaction of sorting relationship between various factors. Then calculate evaluation scores for various mining methods by establishing the mining methods fuzzy comprehensive appraisal model. Finally, set up the mining methods appraisal model based on the conditions of Carboniferous coal seam on +570 level in Qian juntai mine of Mu Chengjian coal mine. The result shows that flexible shield mining method and bow pseudo-inclined cantilever support mining method apply to the two conditions of steep and inclined of the inverted "S" type seam. In engineering practice, the two mining method achieved the desired objective and get good economic benefits. This research will provides a reference for similar coal seam mining in the future.

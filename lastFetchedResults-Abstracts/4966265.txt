This paper presents a multi-objective programming model for the asset portfolio selection problem. Use the idea of fuzzy sets to set up the membership function of the objective function for providing the satisfaction degree to the return and risk of the portfolio. Then the approach is used to achieve the high test degree of each of the membership functions and obtain the satisfactory solution for the decision maker. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the proposed approach.

The increasing demand for seamless wireless access has led to a growing interest in low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. An average end-to-end packet delay analysis for LEO satellite systems is put forward. An approach to the analysis is the consideration of an effective routing strategy based on an extended capacity and flow assignment (CFA) formulation. The importance of queuing analysis and the use of link state routing strategy to LEO satellite networks are also highlighted. A link state routing strategy that is based on a second-order Newton method is used for the optimization of the proposed CFA objective function with respect to the average end-to-end packet delay.

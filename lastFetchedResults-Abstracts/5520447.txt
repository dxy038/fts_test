It has been shown that channel state information (CSI) at transmitter can significantly increase the performance of a relay system. However, most of the existing designs assume perfect CSI at the transmitters. Since most practical systems can only obtain partial CSI at the transmitters, it is necessary to analyze the relay channels with limited CSI feedback. Our objective in this paper is to find the optimal power allocation strategy for relay channel under different levels of transmitter CSI, with the system outage probability constraint. We consider a Decode-and-Forward (DF) cooperative diversity model where one source node communicates with one destination node assisted by one half duplex relay. The Lloyd Algorithm is employed to quantize the CSI at receiver and construct the codebook, whose copies are also equipped on the source and the relay nodes. Each code in the codebook is a power allocation vector. Simulation results show that a few feedback bits can significantly improve the system performance.

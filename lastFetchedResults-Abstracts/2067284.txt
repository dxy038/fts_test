Duo-lateral position-sensitive detectors (PSD) are used for their low intrinsic distortion. This PSD was used for the gamma camera Per Operative Compact Imager (POCI) dedicated to the detection of body tumours. Besides, we developed a simulation model of this PSD. Our objective is to study the influence of the PSD and readout electronics parameters in order to improve residual spatial non-linearity, especially in detector edges. Various simulation runs based on our model were performed. The corresponding results are very close to experimental observation. Finally, this simulation is a powerfull tool for analysing PSD behaviour, in particular, cushion distortions.

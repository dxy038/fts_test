Surgery is performed on the glenoid for a variety of pathologic conditions, and an adequate blood supply is required to achieve good healing of soft tissue and bone. The objective of this investigation was to study the arterial supply of the glenoid in 24 fresh human cadaveric specimens. The vascular supply originates from branches of the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries and the suprascapular artery and branches directly from the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. The antero-superior portion of the glenoid is poorly vascularized, with a specific area that is completely devoid of blood supply. In addition, circumferentially around the glenoid rim, there is an area of approximately 5 mm from the edge that is completely devoid of vascularity. Adequate bone and soft-tissue healing in the glenoid, particularly in its anterosuperior portion, after fracture repair, osteotomy, total shoulder arthroplasty, and capsular procedures may be compromised by the demonstrated hypovascularity.

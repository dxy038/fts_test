In this paper, a robust second-order parametric approach to track following control is proposed for the free-flying space manipulator (FFSM) system. The dynamic equation of the system is derived via momentum conservation law and Lagrangian equation. It is a second-order matrix nonlinear formulation in nature. A feedback stabilizing controller and a feedforward compensation controller are built based on the parametric approach. The free parameters are optimized to obtain desired requirement and characteristics. The scheme can be applied to multi-objective optimization problem too. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

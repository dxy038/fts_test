Eye illusion is one of the most interesting topics which attracts majority of the people. In this paper, an interactive evolutionary technique has been proposed to improve the illusion factor in eye illusion images. Eye illusion or vision illusion is subjective and can differ from person to person. This technique utilizes an evolutionary algorithm, namely Differential Evolution (DE), to improve the vision deceiving factor for an Eye Illusion image. Modeling of human vision perception is impossible or at least very complicated even for a specific person. So, proposing a general fitness function as an optimization objective would not be an easy task. That is why an interactive optimization approach seems a reasonable approach in this regard. To the best of our knowledge, the current work is the first attempt which utilizes an interactive optimization technique to enhance vision illusion images. Performance of the proposed approach is verified on two eye illusion test cases, but that is applicable to other eye illusion image enhancements and also image processing tasks, such as image filtering.

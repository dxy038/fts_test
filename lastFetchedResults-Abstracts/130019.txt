After trimming forest trees,the amount of woods remaining are about 7x1 05m3 in average. By adding the remains of trimmed woods of garden and green spaces of cities, it would amount to a considerable volume. If these remarkable volumes of wood are reused correctly in the wood processing factories, it could provide raw material for 70 wood factories with the capacity of 104m3in a year. For the best utilization of these wood remains, a wood chipper machine could be used for this purpose. The main objective of this study was to design and fabricate a wood chipper machine that can be used for Iranian forests, green spaces and garden conditions. The specification of constructed machine consisted of disk cutting unit, automatic feeding unit, by shooting discharge system.this machine is mounted on tractor and P.T.O power reguirement (30 hp). The operational testing of the machine showed that all the parts worked properly. After chopping the Populus alba Land pine tree branch samples, it was found that by increasing the diameter of the branches, the wood chips were smaller. Also size, shape and thickness of the chopped woods were more uniform by increasing the branches' diameter. By comparing the wet and dry branch samples, it was observed that the chopped wood size and dimensions of dry samples were larger and nonuniformed. In general, the moisture, diameter of the branches and tree species directly will affect the size, dimensions, shape and uniformity of chopped woods.

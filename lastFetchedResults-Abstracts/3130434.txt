Several image quality evaluation methods is analyzed, such as the conventional mathematical statistics methods, mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), as well as methods based on the HVS, structural similarity (SSIM), objective picture quality scale (PQS), wavelet and weighted mean square error (WWMSE), wavelet and energy -weighted mean square error (WEWMSE). The above objective evaluations of image quality are compared with an image library labeled. Simulation results are presented. It is useful for selection of image quality methods in the practical application, design of more rational methods in the theory research.

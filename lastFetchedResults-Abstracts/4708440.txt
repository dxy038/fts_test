Based on the analysis of the e-waste (electronic waste) reverse logistics network and the characteristics of its planning, this paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which has cost minimization as its objective from the overall perspective of reverse logistics. The factors considered in the model include the cost of collection, disassembly and treatment, processing capacity, sales income from material fractions after disassembly or bulk recycling, and material flows between different specialized facilities, as well as the effect of governmental policy, such as recycling subsidy. The model is not limited to the multi-tiered structure of reverse logistics network, but considers bulk recycling facilities as a sub-network, which can flexibly support logistics activity among the facilities within the sub-network, which reflects the actual operations. Input of the network can be multiple types of e-wastes and the output could be different material fractions including valuable and hazardous substances. The proposed optimization model can help determine the optimal facility location and the material flows in the network.

In order to reduce energy consumption, we first show ideal energy mathematical model of PEGASIS topology, since the distance between nodes is the same, this energy mathematical model is the longest network lifetime of WSNs. To achieve this objective, we have proposed IntraGrid PEGASIS topology architecture, which is an architecture based on PEGASIS topology; in this architecture, the sensor area is divided into several network grids, meanwhile, the nodes of each network grid is deployed in random, then the nodes within the network grid are connected, finally, all the network grids are connected. From the simulation result, it can be seen that the energy consumption in each round is almost the same in ideal PEGASIS and Intra-Grid PEGASIS topology, but PEGASIS topology has largest energy consumption in each round.

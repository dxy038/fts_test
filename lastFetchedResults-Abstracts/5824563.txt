In this paper we discuss our ongoing work towards developing a hands-on course on network science. Unlike most of the existing courses on this emerging topic, our focus is on data analysis and modeling, with strong emphasis on model validation. Our objective is to develop a course that will not only give students a broad outlook on this emerging new field, but also equips them with practical skills useful in later professional and research careers. We discuss the planned structure for the course, especially focusing on the topics and methodologies covered. We also outline the structure of the proposed hands-on components, including tools used as foundation for these sessions.

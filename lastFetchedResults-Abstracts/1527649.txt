The main objective of this letter is to further investigate the global exponential stability of a class of general impulsive retarded functional differential equations. Several new criteria on global exponential stability are analytically established based on Lyapunov function methods combined with Razumikhin techniques. The obtained results extend and generalize some results existing in the literature. An example, along with computer simulations, is included to illustrate the results.

Urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence are common urogenital problems affecting 7 - 10% of menopausal women. The primary objective of this study was to quantify effective factors on urinary incontinence in a cohort of menopausal women. A sample of 150 menopausal women (natural menopause for at least 12 months) were recruited from 13 healthcare centers in Ilam, Iran. Data regarding diagnosis, medical history and clinical symptoms were collected using a structured questionnaire and screening patient medical records. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between urinary incontinence and other variables. Multiple atrophic urogenital changes were identified including vaginal dryness (42%), decreased libido (41.3%), dyspareunia (16%), vaginal itching (11.3%) and vaginal discharge and burning (10.7%). The prevalence of urinary frequency, stress urinary incontinence, nocturia and urge urinary incontinence were 33.3%, 28.7%, 22.7% and 17.3%, respectively. A multivariate logistic model found that urinary infection (OR 5.6; 95% CI: 2.6 - 11.58), cystocele (OR 1.73; 95% CI: 1.29 - 2.33) and rectocele (OR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.80) were potential risk factors for incontinence. A significant association was observed between marital status and vaginal atrophy, body mass index and urinary incontinence and parity type and urinary incontinence (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Multiple associations existed between atrophic urogenital changes and urinary incontinence. The most significant interaction was between urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence in menopausal women, with urinary tract infections increasing the risk of incontinence by 5.6 fold. We recommend health professionals to focus on early screening of these issues and implement educational programs for women as part of standard practice

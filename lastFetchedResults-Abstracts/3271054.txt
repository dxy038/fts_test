The objective of this thesis is to investigate and evaluate the use of the finite element method for the analysis of castellated beams. The analysis is to be carried on the castellated beams and calculated the stresses values. By knowing stresses values we can calculate the deflection, load carrying capacity of the beam. The following procedure is used to meet this goal 1. A literature review is conducted to evaluate previous analytical procedures related to castellated beams. 2. A calibration model using a commercial finite element analysis package (ANSYS) is set up and analysis is done.

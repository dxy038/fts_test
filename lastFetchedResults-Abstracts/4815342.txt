The observation automation of cloud, energy, and sky is a principal issue to solve in the modern meteorological observation field. The results of most of the research yet done show that: it is possible to achieve the observation automation of cloud, energy, and sky, since the theory and technology is basically prepared, and some of the technology is actually very mature. In the late 20th century, scientists have started to develop a kind of digital visibility automatic monitor, which has adopted advanced digital photographic technology and image recognition technology, based on the definition of visibility and fully imitating the human eye observing visibility principle. Undoubtedly, the digital visibility automatic monitor is the best instrument to replace the manual observation of visibility. Digital photography visibility automation observation instrument is made according to manual visual observation visibilityÂ´s theory, more objective than traditional transmission, dispersion visibility instrument. This thesis introduced the work theory of digital photographic visibility system (for short is DPVS), compose of system, structure of hardware and software flow, in the end communication between host and outdoor cell was given.

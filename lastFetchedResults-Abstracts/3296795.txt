Sustainability has increasingly become important for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). A number of researches have acknowledged the HEIs transformation towards sustainable campus. However, there is a lack of research contribution focused on alignment process between sustainability and information system (IS) strategies. This research issue inhibits achievement of sustainability objectives and values. In this study, therefore, the authors propose a sustainability transformation framework, which involves alignment process between sustainability and IS strategies, for sustainability transformation. The authors engage three phases to gain the objective of this study. These phases include problem definition, define objectives of a solution, and framework development. The proposed framework provides a sequential and rigorous approach to effectively transforming HEIs towards sustainable campus. However, there is a need of future works to validate and assess the applicability of the framework in HEIs.

There is strong evidence to suggest that anxiety is a common problem for many chronic pain patients and can exacerbate a patient's pain condition. Notwithstanding, there is little information about the extent and nature of anxiety experienced during physical examination of pain, or the primary factors associated with anxiety in this context. In the present study, 45 chronic low back pain patients completed a questionnaire battery at the time of intake to an interdisciplinary treatment program. After approximately four weeks on program, patients underwent a routine standardized physiotherapy review of their condition following which they completed a second questionnaire battery. The examination was videotaped and coded for pain behavior. Physiotherapists provided objective scoring of non-organic signs and physical impairment. Results suggested that participants experienced substantial anxiety at the point of examination with scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (M=30.47, S.D.=6.96) comparable to scores that have been found with DSM-IV panic disorder patients. Regression analyses revealed that catastrophic cognitions, behavioral displays of pain and somatic sensations measured during examination uniquely predicted anxiety experienced during examination. Demographic, injury-related, personality, and patientâ€“practitioner variables did not significantly contribute to explaining examination anxiety. Findings support cognitive-behavioral formulations of anxiety and strongly suggest that anxiety may complicate the assessment process. Implications for the assessment and treatment of pain are presented along with future research directions.

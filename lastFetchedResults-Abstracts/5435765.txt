Using different elasticity coefficients, comfort of bed was studied through experiments of the body pressure distribution and the subjective evaluation based on Ergonomics. It was concluded that different elasticity coefficients bed are different on human comfort, of which medium elasticity coefficients bed is the best; subjective evaluation and objective experimental results prove complementary.

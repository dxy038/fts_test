A new magnetic core circuit that is used to supply power in the proper phase and time sequence to a bidirectional stepping motor is described. This circuit will power a standard voltage stepping motor from a nonstandard voltage power supply and includes a means for maintaining a constant energy pulse excitation over a wide range of dc power supply input voltage, a means for supplying power to the winding of the motor on pairs of isolated conductors, and a means for conductively isolating the low-level logic circuits from the high-level power circuits.

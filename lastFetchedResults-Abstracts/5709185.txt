The author presents an improved method for estimating the parameters in the Weibull distribution with three parameters which is widely used in connection with high-reliability applications. Parameter estimation based on the optimum method of penalty function and direct searching is introduced, and a linear correlation coefficient of coordinate variables on modified probability paper is proposed as an objective function. The Monte Carlo test is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this method. A general computer program is designed for this application

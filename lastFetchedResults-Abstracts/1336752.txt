Prepurchase examinations are commonly used in the evaluation of sport horses. No data have been published concerning the use of traditional Chinese veterinary medical (TCVM) channel palpation with respect to the musculoskeletal status of sport horses for sale. The objective of the study is to summarize the results of channel evaluation when integrated with a Western examination in a series of prepurchase examinations. The prepurchase examination records of 235 sport horses were reviewed. The examined horses were presented as serviceable for the intended use. The examinations were performed by a single observer. The TCVM palpation examination and Western examinations, which often included radiography, infrared thermometry, diagnostic ultrasound, fiberoptic endoscopy, and diagnostic blood screens, were used to further evaluate the musculoskeletal system. The data were used to define the relationship between soundness, lameness, channel imbalance, and sale outcome. Over 6 years, 235 horses were examined. One hundred fifty-six (66%) were sound at their working gaits, and 79 (34%) had observable lameness. Two thirds of lame horses had palpable channel imbalance. Only a quarter of sound horses presented with palpable channel imbalance. Sound horses with no channel imbalance, that is, level channels, were most frequently sold, and lame horses with channel imbalance most frequently were not sold. Significantly more sound horses with level channels were sold as compared with sale outcome of sound horses with unbalanced channels. In conclusion, the TCVM channel examination is a useful component in the integrated prepurchase examination of sport horses.

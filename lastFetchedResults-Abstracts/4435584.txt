The principle objective of this paper is to develop a cloud based model, which is highly distributed with the inherent features like ease of use, reliability, dynamic scalability and low cost. Since adoption of various IT technologies are their implementation for various sectors is exponentially growing, an attempt has been made to address power system problems in cloud environment. To validate, one of the power system problem namely contingency analysis has been considered and tested in two different environments like windows azure and Google app engine.

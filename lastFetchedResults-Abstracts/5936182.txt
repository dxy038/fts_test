A novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary programming (MOEP) for thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) and static var compensators (SVC) tuning has been investigated in this paper. The coordinate design problem of TCSC and SVC is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the system transient stability is effectively improved by minimizing several system behavior measure criteria. Furthermore, MOEP is employed to design two FACTS controller parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme has been demonstrated with a two-area and four-machine power system. In comparison with the separate design of two controllers, the significant improvement in dynamic performance of the system is achieved

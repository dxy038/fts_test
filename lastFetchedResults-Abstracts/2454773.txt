<p><strong>Objective:</strong> In this study efficacy of sub lingual Misoprostol was examined in comparison to Oxytocin (I.V.) for inducing of labor in term pregnancy.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Seventy patients were allocated by blocked randomization to Groups A (n=35, sub lingual Misoprostol 25 Î¼g four hourly to maximum of 5 doses) and B (n=35, continuous Oxytocin infusion).<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Delivery active phase and total labor phase were shorter with sublingual Misoprostol in comparison to intravenous Oxytocin (p&lt; 0.001) and the rate of cesarean section was lower in Misoprostol group (p&lt;0.04) but delivery latent phase, meconium staining, uterine hypertonisity and apgar score (1&amp;5 minute) were similar in two groups.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> sublingual Misoprostol is better than intravenous Oxytocin for induction of labor at term.</p>

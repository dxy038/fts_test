A wide-area robust control method for damping inter-area oscillations of power system is suggested in this paper. Both local and PMU-provided remote signals are utilized as feedback inputs to the controller. Participation vector is used to select remote signal and position controller. The damping controller design is formulated as an output disturbance rejection problem based on the mixed-sensitivity formulation and with pole placement constraints. This multi-objective synthesis can be transformed into a standard linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem which can be tractable numerically. A 4-generator power system is used to illustrate the whole design procedure and demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller and robustness with respect to variations of the system operating conditions. The results are also compared with the conventional PSS damping control

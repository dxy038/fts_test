Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology is an effective and efficient alternative for conventional vehicles. It provides fuel efficiency, reduces harmful emission and enhances performance. The technology has gain enormous attention because of depleting conventional resources and measured carbon emission. This paper proposes a bidirectional buck boost converter with interleaved control, which minimizes input current and output voltage ripples. This leads to reduce size of passive components with higher efficiency and make whole system more reliable.

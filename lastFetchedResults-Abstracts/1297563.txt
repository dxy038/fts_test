We consider an n-job, m-machine lot-streaming problem in a flowshop with equal-size sublots where the objective is to minimize the total weighted earliness and tardiness. To solve this problem, we first propose a so-called net benefit of movement (NBM) algorithm, which is much more efficient than the existing linear programming model for obtaining the optimal starting and completion times of sublots for a given job sequence. A new discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm incorporating the NBM algorithm is then developed to search for the best sequence. The new DPSO improves the existing DPSO by introducing an inheritance scheme, inspired by a genetic algorithm, into particles construction. To verify the proposed DPSO algorithm, comparisons with the existing DPSO algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) are made. Computational results show that the proposed DPSO algorithm with a two-point inheritance scheme is very competitive for the lot-streaming flowshop scheduling problem.

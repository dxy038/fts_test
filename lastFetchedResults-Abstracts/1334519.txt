The objective of this study is to investigate the control methods of the gas-cooler pressure in a CO2 heat pump. The cooling performance of the CO2 heat pump was measured by varying the refrigerant charge amount, EEV opening, compressor frequency, and outdoor fan speed at various outdoor temperatures. The effects of the EEV opening and the outdoor fan speed on the gas-cooler pressure and the COP were analyzed by using the experimental data. In the standard cooling condition at the compressor frequency of 45 Hz, the optimum gas-cooler pressure and the maximum COP were 9200 kPa and 3.04, respectively, at the optimum EEV opening of 41% and outdoor fan speed of 500 rpm. As the compressor frequency increased from 45 Hz to 55 Hz at the standard cooling condition, the optimum outdoor fan speed increased from 500 rpm to 700 rpm.

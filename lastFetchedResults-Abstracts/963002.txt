
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Retained gauze after a surgery is an uncommon complication and may be associated with many complications. We report our case as attention may be paid to the fact that the retained gauze may get symptomatic even after a very long interval. 
CASE: The patient was a 60 year old man in whom infection and fistula developed 35 years after a surgery for femur fracture. The diagnosis was easily made because of a marker in the gauze by radiography. Removal of the gauze was associated with complete recovery of the patient in 1 year follow up. 
CONCLUSION: Retained gauze after surgery is a preventable complication and may be asymptomatic for a very long period. If it diagnosed immediately after the surgery, the gauze should be removed.

KEY WORDS: Surgical sponges, Fracture, Femur, Infection.

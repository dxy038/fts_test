A novel topology of isolated three-level half-bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter is proposed. the proposed novel isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter has not only the advantages, such as enabling bidirectional power flow, ease of realizing soft-switching control, galvanic isolation, high reliability and having complete symmetry of configuration and so on, but also can be used in high voltage application and apparently decreased the stress of the switches. In this paper, working principle of the Proposed DC/DC converter is discussed in detail. Equivalent circuit analysis is also used to obtain the criterion of soft switching conduction. In the end, simulation is done to certify to feasibility of the proposed DC/DC converter and accuracy of the criterion. Simulation results go hand in hand with our conclusion which indicates the correctness of our analysis.

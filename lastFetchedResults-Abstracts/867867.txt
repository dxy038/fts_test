This paper presents a study of the problem of online deadline scheduling under the preemption penalty
model of Zheng, Xu, and Zhang (2007). In that model, each preemption incurs a penalty of q times the
weight of the preempted job, where qP0 is the preemption penalty parameter. The objective is to maximise
the total weight of jobs completed on time minus the total penalty.
When the scheduler knows the ratio of longest to shortest job length, D, we show that the WAL algorithm
of Zheng et al. (2007) is ((1 + q)D + o(D))-competitive for sufficiently large D. This improves the
bound shown in Zheng et al. (2007). When the scheduler only knows that DP(k(1 + q))3 for some
k > 1, we propose a ((k(1 + q)D/(k   1)) + o(D))-competitive algorithm.
When q = 0, we give an optimal, O(D/log D)-competitive algorithm that, unlike previous algorithms,
does not require knowledge of D. This settles an open problem mentioned in Ting (2008).

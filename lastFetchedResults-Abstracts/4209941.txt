We solve the frequency assignment problem (FAP) in satellite communications with transiently chaotic neural networks (TCNN). The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize cochannel interference between two satellite systems by rearranging the frequency assignments. For an N-carrier-M-segment FAP problem, the TCNN consists of N x M neurons. The performance of the TCNN is demonstrated through solving a set of benchmark problems, where the TCNN finds comparative if not better solutions compared to the existing algorithms.

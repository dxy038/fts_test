As an effective method of saving energy and avoiding market risks, generation rights trade has been carried out in some provinces and regional power companies. This paper analyzes the existing generation rights trade models and their algorithms, points that the results calculated by high-low match mode are not the optimal, because the trade order is inherent characteristic owned by this mode, which is not suitable for coupled and non-linear power system; the trade costs as a correct factors canÂ´t be ignored because they are important to the justice of trades. In order to solve above two problems, this paper designs a new trade mode that taking the whole system into account, which is different from the high-low match mode and founds a congestion dispatching model considering trade costs. For cooperating with the new trade mode, genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize trade model. The method proposed in this paper not only solves the problems caused by trade order, but also improves the justice of trades. It is also applicable to the multi-objective models. Finally, the correctness of this method is tested by IEEE39-Bus system.

In this paper a method which applies Six Sigma and goal driven to the fuzzy multi-objective optimization of the sliding rack is presented. This method applies Six Sigma analysis to construct the fuzzy set of sensitivity to determine the optimal group of fuzzy design variables. Then make use of the method of goal driven to realize the fuzzy multi-objective optimization. The results show that fuzzy finite element method can obtain a more reasonable solution than that by the conventional optimum method, which can reflect the fuzziness of engineering problem, and it also processes positive research for optimization design of complexly large-sized structure.

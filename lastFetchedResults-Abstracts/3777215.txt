A framework that integrates past research in the area of software reliability measurement and analysis for application in the C2 / C3 I arena is presented. The framework centers upon a matrix for classifying software systems according to their size, technology life cycle, and objective requirements based in their operational context. Once categorized in the schema, a system can be compared with others and particular reliability problems, alternate measurement and analysis strategies, and possible trade-offs can be more easily identified. The matrix simplifies past checklist approaches to reliability measurement and analysis, honing in on key factors for the effective choice of reliability methods and procedures. The presentation of the matrix is followed by its application to the SDI battle management system. The SDI software needs are described for each of the dimensions of the matrix. Other c2 systems are compared briefly with the SDI findings, providing an initial baseline for further analyses using the framework.

The paper presented the design objective of three-phase 6/4 structure long-mover bilateral Switched Reluctance linear generator. The structure, the main design parameters include air gap length, unit stator poles numbers, mover poles numbers, mover tooth width, stator tooth width, mover polar distance, stator polar distance, mover width, stator width, mover slot depth, stator slot depth, mover yoke height, stator yoke height and stator unit length are described. The calculation method of electric load and magnetic load are also given. The selection methods and the calculation methods of the main design parameters are also presented. The design procedure and example of a developed prototype with rated output power 200 W, rated velocity 2 m/s, and output voltage for windings 24V are given. The design of Switched Reluctance linear generator is accomplished by analogy analysis between Switched Reluctance rotary generator. The length of air gap of the Switched Reluctance linear generator is bigger than that of Switched Reluctance rotary generator. The mover yoke height in bilateral Switched Reluctance linear generator is twice as same as that in unilateral Switched Reluctance linear generator.

A new, second-order accurate, volume conservative, material-order-independent interface reconstruction method for multi-material flow simulations is presented. First, materials are located in multi-material computational cells using a piecewise linear reconstruction of the volume fraction function. These material locator points are then used as generators to reconstruct the interface with a weighted Voronoi diagram that matches the volume fractions. The interfaces are then improved by minimizing an objective function that smoothes interface normals while enforcing convexity and volume constraints for the pure material subcells. Convergence tests are shown demonstrating second-order accuracy. Static and dynamic examples are shown illustrating the superior performance of the method over existing material-order-dependent methods.

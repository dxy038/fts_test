OBJECTIVE: To observe the change of Astrocyte (Ast) and cytokines, during vascular dementia (VD) formation to explore the prevention and treatment VD mechanisms of Xiongma dropping pill (XMDP). METHODS: To permanent bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery (2-VO) to establish a VD model. The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) on the rats brain, and IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; were observed by immunohistochemical staining and radioimmunoassay after administration 30 and 60 days. RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operation group, the number of GFAP positive cells and the contents of IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; were increased in the model rats (P &lt;; 0.05 or P &lt;; 0.01). Compared with the model group, XMDP and Ginkgo leaf tablets group could active or proliferative hippocampus and frontal cortex Asts, decrease the number of GFAP positive cells(P &lt;; 0.05), and decrease the contents of IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and TNF-&#945;(P &lt;; 0.05 or P &lt;; 0.01). In addition, the contents of IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; in all XMDP groups, after 60 days of administration, were remarkably greater than corresponding concentrations at 30 days(P &lt;; 0.05 or P &lt;; 0.01). CONCLUSION: XMDP could prevent and treatment VD may be associated with inhibiting the excessive activation or proliferation of Ast and to reduce the generation of the cytokines.

In order to implement real-time adaptive augmented cognition, one of the focal points of our present research involves understanding the dimensions of task complexity. Task complexity is a construct that has been used in many fields such as biology, computer science, and psychology. An objective of our current research effort is to be able to instantaneously assess change in the cognitive capabilities of people as they perform increasingly complex tasks. In order to address these broader goals, a better understanding of task complexity is needed. Specific questions we ask include: (1) What are the factors that contribute to task complexity? (2) What are effective ways to assess task complexity? and (3) How can task complexity be reduced in real-time tasks? In order to address these questions, we review literature related to task complexity across several domains such as user models, human computer interaction, human factors and instructional design.

One of the most common symptoms in cancer patients is fatigue that is often associated with appetite loss and sleep disruption. Quality of life indices and objective measures of these symptoms are now possible and continue to improve our understanding of how these symptoms are caused. Disruption of 24 hour rest/activity patterns measured by actigraphy is one example where there is overlap of the objective measurement of symptoms and the circadian axis. This paper reviews new data relevant to understanding mechanisms involving inhibition of the circadian system and the production of symptom complexes in cancer patients through hypothalamic signaling by tumor produced members of the epidermal growth factor receptor

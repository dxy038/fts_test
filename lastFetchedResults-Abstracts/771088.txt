Setting conservation priorities in taxonomically complex groups such as the orchid genus Dactylorhiza is a difficult task. As an alternative to taxonomic diversity, we used here a molecular phylogenetic analysis and the results of a genetic investigation using plastid microsatellites with an extensive geographic sampling to assess in a more objective way the patterns of diversity within this genus. Although western Europe is thought to be the main diversity centre for the genus due to the large number of species found there, we found higher phylogenetic and genetic diversity as well as higher endemicity in the Caucasus and the Mediterranean Basin, two biodiversity hotspots. Species number seems to be correlated with taxonomic effort, tentatively estimated here by the number of herbaria, and is thus biased and not an appropriate measure of diversity. Our results show that phylogenetic analyses and genetic data obtained with molecular tools can offer an alternative measure of biodiversity that is not sensitive to taxonomic inflation. Conservation of allotetraploid taxa is also discussed, and it is recommended that sites in which polyploids are formed should be conserved rather than any specific allotetraploid taxon.

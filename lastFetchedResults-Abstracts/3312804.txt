The main objective of the proposed system is to increase the resource utilization and the provider´s profit in a cloud environment. While reserving the resources, the users´ requests are posted onto the Virtual Machines (VMs), and then these VMs are deployed onto the Physical Machines (PMs). The proposed system uses a Bin-Packing procedure for VM Placement which is used to reduce the number of physical machines required by the cloud providers. The proposed work has two parts, Job placement and VM placement. Job placement is done by the cloud broker which uses the best fit heuristic approach and then, the VM placement is done by the cloud broker that follows the worst fit heuristic approach. This work has been executed and the performance results are analysed with CloudSim tool, which showcased the good power conservation compared to other strategies.

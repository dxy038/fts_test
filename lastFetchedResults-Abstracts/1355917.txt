Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare chronic pulmonary infection caused by actinomyces, a Gram–positive, microaerophilic bacterium. Pulmonary involvement other than cervicofacial or abdominopelvic actinomycosis is uncommon and often leads to a misdiagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis or lung cancer.  Endobronchial involvement is very rare in pulmonary actinomycosis. Here in, we describe the case of a 66–year–old male patient, referred with a history of massive hemoptysis since a few weeks ago. Plain chest radiograph and computerized tomographic scan revealed a dens consolidation in the right upper lobe; which was confirmed to be pulmonary actinomycosis with endobronchial involvement by transbronchial biopsy.

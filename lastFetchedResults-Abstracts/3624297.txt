The practical objective of program behavior studies is to enhance program and system performance. On the one hand, the knowledge resulting from these studies may be useful in designing new programs and new virtual memory systems that are capable of levels of performance higher than those currently achievable. On the other hand, such knowledge may often be employed to increase the performance of existing programs and systems.

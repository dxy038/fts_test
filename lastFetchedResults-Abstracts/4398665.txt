Voltage sag problem is getting extensive attention with the extensive application of sensitive equipments in power grid. How to use the limited monitors achieving optimal distribution of monitoring points becomes an important issue. This paper presents a method for voltage sag monitoring optimal allocation based on fuzzy system and particle swarm algorithm. Aiming at the problems of traditional MRA (Monitor Reach Area, voltage sag observation domain), the concept of fuzzy threshold and observation index are put forward, the bus observation ability is also considered, and then the fuzzy control model is established to get the optimal objective function. The allocation is optimized by binary particle swarm algorithm(BPSO). At last, the method is tested on IEEE 30 bus system and the results are compared with traditional methods, showing that the completely observability of voltage sag in the network can be realized, meanwhile the purpose of configuration scheme of monitoring devices can be also obtained.

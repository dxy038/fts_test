In this paper, a battery swapping station (BSS) model is proposed as an economic and convenient way to provide energy for the batteries of the electric vehicles (EVs). This method would overcome some drawbacks to the use of electric vehicles like long charging time and insufficient running distance. On the economic concern of a battery swapping station, the station would optimize the availability of the batteries in stock, and at the same time determine the best strategy for recharging the batteries on hand. By optimizing the charging method of the batteries, an optimization model of BSS with the maximum number of batteries in stock has been developed for the bus terminal at the Hong Kong International Airport. The secondary objective would be to minimize a cost on the batteries due to the use of different charging schemes. The genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to implement the optimization model, and simulation results are shown.

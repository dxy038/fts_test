The basic concept and mathematical model of thyristor controlled series compensation (TCSC) in a power system are described. The static and dynamic performance of TCSC is investigated using EMTP digital simulation. A whole model system for TCSC dynamic simulated testing, including the actual microprocessor-based control hardware, was constructed to compare with EMTP simulation. The test results agree well with the analytical and simulation results. As an example of prospective application in the power systems of China, digital simulations of ChinaÂ´s Yimin-Fengtun 590 kV transmission lines with a TCSC scheme are carried out. The main objective of this example is to demonstrate the effectiveness of TCSC in power swing damping

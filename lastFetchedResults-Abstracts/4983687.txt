We propose a novel slot-array antenna fed by a new guiding structure which forces a quasi-TEM mode within an oversized rectangular waveguide using a hard surface on the bottom face of the waveguide. In this paper, our objective is the evaluation of the order of magnitude of slot internal mutual coupling, as well as its interaction with the propagating quasi-TEM mode. This study can allow us to use a simplified model to analyse the whole slot array. Simulation results are shown.

Competition is a dynamic process. It involves the emergence of new firms, their growth, their eventual decay and ultimately the death of those who do not innovate and reinvent themselves. Plant deaths arise from failure when firms exit an industry. The pervasiveness of this phenomenon has caught the attention of economists to study the causes of the death of industrial units.

The objective of this paper is first to identify theoretically the determinants of firm's closure. Based on a review of the literature, the major factors affecting the firm's closure comprise location, size, and industrial group and then this paper examine empirically the specified model using the data of Yazd province over the third five-year development plan. The data used in this study is collected from the Yazd Mining and Industry Department database. These include 1539 manufacturing firms while 175 plants died during the period of the third five-year development plan.

The multivariate probit regression analysis is used to estimate the model. The results show that firm location and firm size doesn't have significant effects on firm's closure probability. Moreover, the findings confirm that the closure probability of older firms is less than the younger counterparts.

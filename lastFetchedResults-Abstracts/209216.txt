Introduction & Objective: Preoperative fasting for performing
elective operations can lead to a metabolic state which is
unfavorable for patients. The aim of this study was to determine
the outcome of preoperative fasting on hemodynamic status of
patients with elective operations by general anesthesia.
Materials & Methods: This is a descriptive study performed in
Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, in Alzahra educational and
therapeutic center on 60 ASA class I, and II patients candidate for
elective hysterectomy in 1385. Simple sampling method was used
for recruitment of patients and a questionnaire was used for data
collection. Collected data were analyzed by student t-test, using
SPSS software.
Results: The average age of the patients was 47±5.69 years and
their body weight was 56±7.56 kg. The average of fasting time (in
hours) was 12.66 for operations performed in the morning and 16
for evening surgeries. Changes of hemodynamic parameters
(including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate)
during 5 to 10 minutes of induction were significant during
induction of anesthesia in comparison to baseline levels (p<0.05).
For signs of dehydration, 25 (41.66%) of patients had dry mucosa
and 14 (23.33%) cases complained of being thirsty. Urinary output
during the first 30 minutes of surgery reported to be less than 15
rnl/hr in all cases. No significant changes in body temperature
were observed in studied patients.
Conclusion: Results of this study revealed that preoperative
fasting before elective operations for prevention of aspiration must
be considered in order to decrease its effect on hemodynamic

Based on the concept of the theory of constraints, this paper discusses a decision-making model of recycling reverse logistics. Taking the measure of throughput as its decision objective, we formulate the recycling reverse logistics problem into a linear programming. Meanwhile, we apply the TOC-based model to a rubber manufacturing enterprise which proves that it is more effective than the traditional approach in minimizing the total cost.

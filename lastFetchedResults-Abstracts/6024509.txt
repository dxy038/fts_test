Free-space optical interconnection (FSOI) of integrated circuits (ICs) shows great potential for the efficient implementation of high-performance parallel computing and signal processing systems. The design study of a high-speed FSOI FFT processor system is the objective of this paper. The FFT is an important mathematical operation in many applications such as signal processing, telecommunications, and instrumentation which makes it an excellent choice to incorporate in a high-speed system. The result of this work is the design of a photonic FFT system that includes the Photonic FFT (PFFT) chip and the Photonic RAM (PRAM) chip.

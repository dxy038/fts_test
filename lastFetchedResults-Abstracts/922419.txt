In this paper, Minimum Energy Dynamic Source Routing (MEDSR) and Hierarchical Minimum Energy Dynamic Source Routing (HMEDSR) protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) are proposed. The objective of MEDSR protocol is to reduce energy consumption in MANET while maintaining connectivity in the network. The objective of HMEDSR is to reduce the overhead of MEDSR. The overall result is that energy spent in transmitting overhead packets is reduced. This reduction allows more energy in transmitting data packets. The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is modified to implement both MEDSR and HMEDSR protocols, and these implementations are tested with a network simulator (Network Simulator (NS-2)). The simulation results show that both MEDSR and HMEDSR protocols reduce energy consumption per data packet by 25% compared to DSR, but HMESDR further reduces energy consumption by 12% compared to MEDSR by controlling overhead packets.

Introduction & Objective: Among all of the neurologic diseases in adult life, the cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the most common and important ones. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in basal ganglia (BG) is one of the common and major types of CVD. The relations between clot size and mortality rate, in different parts of the brain, has been addressed by several researchers. It is unclear whether such a relationship is in BG. Therefore this study was designed to find a formula that predicts outcome of hemorrhage based on clot size in BG.
Materials & Methods: This descriptive-comparative study that was carried out prospectively, conducted on all 63 patients who admitted to the hospital during one year, with definite diagnosis of ICH in BG. After urgent CT scanning, the size of hematoma was determined by scan images. Routine treatment was uniform for all patients. Focal signs and consciousness state were assessed in the first and last days of admission. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency tables and chi-square and T- test.  
Results: 33% of patients died. Hematoma size in 70% of them was larger than 5cm and in other 30% smaller. None of the hematoma with less than 4cm size was fatal. In patients with clots of 5cm or larger, the mortality was 100%.  
Conclusion: The results indicated that, there was meaningful relationship between hematoma size and mortality, in BG hemorrhages. So the clot size can be used as a factor in predicting hemorrhage outcome in BG.

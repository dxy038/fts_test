Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is intuitive method for decomposition of nolinear and nostacionary signals into their Intristic Mode Functions (IMF). Recently, multifocus image fusion method based on first level of EMD has been proposed and it´s applicability for fusion of low contrast images and color images is tested. However, this method was created for fusion of just two multifocus images of one scene. In this paper, recent proposed multifocus images fusion using just first levels of Empirical Mode Decomposition is analyzed and it´s modification for fusion of more than two multifocus images is proposed. Objective analysis using well known focus measures show main advantages of the proposed method, such as absence of artifacts, contrast control and straightforward applicability to color multifocus images.

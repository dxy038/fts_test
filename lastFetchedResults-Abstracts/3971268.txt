This paper presents the design and test results of a fourth-order and sixth-order 14-bit 2.2-MS/s sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The analog modulator and digital decimator sections were implemented in a 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS double-poly triple-level metal 3.3-V process. The design objective for these ADCÂ´s was to achieve 85 dB signal-to-noise distortion ratio (SNDR) with less than 200 mW power dissipation. Both modulators employ a cascade sigma-delta topology. The fourth-order modulator consists of two cascaded second-order stages which include 1-bit and 5-bit quantizers, respectively. The sixth-order modulator has a 2-2-2 cascade structure and 1-bit quantizer at the end of each stage. An oversampling ratio of 24 was selected to give the best SNDR and power consumption with realizable gain-matching requirements between the analog and digital sections.

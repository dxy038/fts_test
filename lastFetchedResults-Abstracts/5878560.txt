Power system structure is undergoing through restructuring process since a decade. Everyday a bulk amount of power is generated, transmitted and distributed via transmission network. The active power or the real power generated from the generator needs the reactive power for supporting its own transmission. This reactive power generation has some minimum limit which if generator fails to produce it has to take support from system operator for smooth real power flow in worth of paying money. While the generator produces excess reactive power it can expect remuneration from the system operator. In deregulated power system minimal reactive power generation is considered as an important issue as cost is related to it. In this paper IEEE 14-bus test system is considered for solving the problem. As a solving tool a well known population based metaheuristics technique: particle swarm optimisation is chosen which tries to optimize the problem by controlling the generator bus voltage. The choice of the objective function and the mentioned optimisation technique is considered by through literature survey.

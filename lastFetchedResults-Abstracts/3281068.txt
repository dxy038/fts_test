In this paper, a power allocation algorithm is proposed for multiuser MIMO-OFDM femtocell networks on downlink, where an objective considers the maximization of the SINR of a macro user that is near the femto base station. Since the macro and the femto base stations share the same spectrum, there is a co-channel interference problem. We propose a power allocation method based on genetic algorithms to enhance the SINR of the macro user. In addition, we also utilize the zero-forcing beamforming design to alleviate the co-channel interference. The simulation results show that the proposed genetic algorithm-based power allocation method with zero-forcing beamforming reveals the best performance, and outperforms the method with equal power allocation.

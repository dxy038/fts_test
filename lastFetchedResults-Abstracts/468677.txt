OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess endothelial dysfunction in women with preeclampsia by measuring endothelial microparticles.
STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted on 20 women with preeclampsia and 20 healthy pregnant women as control subjects. Endothelial microparticles were measured by flow cytometry with anti-CD31 and anti-CD42. CD31+/CD42+ platelet microparticles were also quantified.
RESULTS: Plasma endothelial microparticles levels were elevated significantly in women with preeclampsia as compared with control subjects (mean±SD and median [range]: 14,723±7,724 counts/μL and 12,378 counts/μL [1,442-33,772 counts/μL] vs 8406±2832 counts/μL and 9016 counts/μL [3,381-12,806 counts/μL]; P<.001). Plasma platelet microparticles levels were not different among cases compared to control subjects (10,751±6,114 counts/μL and 9463 counts/μL [3,000-23,895 counts/μL] vs 7871±4344 counts/μL and 6462 counts/μL [444-18,947 counts/μL]; P = .208). No significant correlation was found between plasma endothelial microparticles and mean arterial pressure in cases or control subjects.
CONCLUSION: The elevation of endothelial microparticles in women with preeclampsia supports the endothelial injury theory in preeclampsia.

In this paper, resource allocation for energy-efficient communication in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) downlink network with a large number of transmit antennas is studied. The considered problem is modeled as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and different quality of service (QoS) requirements including a minimum required data rate and a maximum tolerable channel outage probability. The power allocation, data rate adaptation, antenna allocation, and subcarrier allocation policies are optimized for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bit/Joule delivered to the users). By exploiting the properties of fractional programming, the resulting non-convex optimization problem in fractional form is transformed into an equivalent optimization problem in subtractive form, which leads to an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the objective function is lower bounded by a concave function which can be maximized by using dual decomposition. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithm converges in a small number of iterations and demonstrate the trade-off between energy efficiency and the number of transmit antennas.

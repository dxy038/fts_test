For the objective of the synthesis and the development of structural composite materials, direct metal oxidation, DIMOX introduced for hybrid composite processing. However, oxidation temperatures around 1100&#176;C lead to the formation of porous ceramic materials. To utilize this porosity intentionally for foam production, a new approach based on synergetic effect of alloying elements, DIMOX and semisolid (rheocsting) processing is developed. A semisolid reaction, rheocasting is introduced to control porosity shape and size. Aluminum alloy 6xxx (automobile scrap pistons) is recycled for this objective and DIMOX at 1100&#176;C for 20 min, then rheocasting, at 750&#176;C for 20 minutes. The effect of addition (2%) of each a-Fe powder, Mg powder, Boric acid powder, and Si powder established for the objective of a hybrid structural metal matrix composite in bulk foam matrix. The kinetic of formation of hybrid metal matrix foam composite is introduced. Microstructural and mechanical characterization established for high performance Aluminum foam hybrid composite materials.

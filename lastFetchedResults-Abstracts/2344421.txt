Objective(s):Anodized treated titanium surfaces, have been proposed as potential surfaces with better cell attachment capacities. We have investigated the adhesion and proliferation properties of H9C2 cardiac myoblasts on anodized treated titanium surface. 
Materials and Methods: Surface topography and anodized tubules were examined by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Control and test substrates were inserted to the bottom of 24-well tissue culture plates. Culture media including H9C2 cells were loaded on the surface of substrate and control wells at the second passage. Evaluation of cell growth, proliferation, viability and surface cytotoxicity was performed using MTT test. After 48 hr, some samples were inspected by SEM. DAPI-staining was used to count attached cells.
Results: MTT results for cells cultured on anodized titanium  and unanodized titanium surfaces  was equal to 1.56 and 0.55 fold change compared to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). The surface had no cytotoxic effects on cells. The average cell attachment to TCPS, unanodized and anodized titanium surface was 2497±40.16, 1250±20.11 and 4859.5±54.173, respectively. Cell adhesion to anodized titanium was showed 1.95 and 3.89 fold increase compared to TCPS and unanodized titanium, respectively (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Anodized titanium surfaces can be potentially applied for enhanced recruitment of H9C2 cells. This unique property makes these inexpensive anodized surfaces as a candidate surface for attachment of cardiac cells and consequently for cardiac regeneration purposes.

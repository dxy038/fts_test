The present investigation focuses on the study of design parameters for a generic fan-in-wing configuration. The objective is to evaluate the performance of a fan-in-wing concept in a Short-Take-Off and Landing situation. The results presented are also of interest for transition between hover and a wing-sustained flight for a Vertical Take Off and Landing concept. Steady Reynolds Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes computations using an actuator disk technique are performed. The results show a good agreement with experimental data and simulation results obtained in previous investigations for a generic wind tunnel model. A parametric study is conducted for a more realistic wing planform. For a single fan installed in the wing, the streamwise and spanwise influence on the wing aerodynamics is studied. In addition, the effect of the fan diameter and the fan rotation axis inclination is analyzed. For all variations, a discussion concerning the induced lift due to the jet flap effect is given. A fan installed in the wing improves significantly the lift coefficient but reduces considerably the wing efficiency in terms of lift-over-drag ratio. At high jet speeds, the jet has the tendency to roll up in a pair of counter rotating vortices on a preferred side depending on the fan spanwise position and the angle of attack. On this preferred side, one vortex is dominant in the pair. This study highlights other critical parameters with possible benefits on the wing performance.

E-Learning personalization topic has attracted the interest of many research studies in recent years. Several E-Learning personalization systems have been proposed. Each system implements a specific approach and includes a set of software components. However, many of these components are not reused. This paper presents first, a review of the literature related to the software components which are commonly used, then, a discussion about the different alternatives for reusing components of E-Learning personalization systems. The objective is to optimize the effort investment of the community in developing personalized E-Learning systems.

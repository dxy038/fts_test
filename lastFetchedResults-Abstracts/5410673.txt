Automotive electronic throttle is typical non-linear system with variable parameters, based on the establishment of engineÂ´s electronic throttle nonlinear movement model, combining sliding mode variable structure control and fuzzy logic technology, multi-objective satisfaction optimization algorithm of the fuzzy sliding mode controller is developed. A two-dimension fuzzy scheduling mechanism was designed for boundary width tuning due to the sliding mode plane function and its change rate as a regulator of the fuzzy input, and boundary width as output. The satisfactory functions of overshoot, rise time, setting time and steady-state error of the system response are designed, and the multi-objective satisfaction optimization algorithm was used to optimize the parameter of sliding mode variable structure contro1ler.Simulation results show that the algorithm is effective for electronic throttle contro1, based on the simulation system of the hardware in the loop of Matlab/Simulink and MACS565.

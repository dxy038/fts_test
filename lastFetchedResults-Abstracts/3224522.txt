Graph partitioning is a NP-hard problem referring to partitioning of graph into multiple smaller graphs minimizing their inter-relationships, hence maximizing the intra-partition relationship and balancing the partition load satisfying the constraint of cell bound size. Thus graph partitioning is a multiple and conflicting objective problem making it hard to find an optimum solution. In this paper, we propose an approach to find optimum graph partitions using Edge Table as the representation structure of graph, thus using ETS (Edge Table Scanning).

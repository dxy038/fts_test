Objective
The aim of this study was to describe the computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with demonstrated peritoneal tuberculosis (TB) and their concordance with the three types from the traditional classification (wet, fibrotic, and dry plastic).
Methods
We reviewed the CT images of all patients with microbiologically proven peritoneal tuberculosis over a 6-year period (1996â€“2001).
Results
Seven patients were included. Ascites was present in 5 patients (free ascites in 3 patients and loculated in 2). Involvement of the mesentery was found in 5 patients, the omentum in 4, and the parietal peritoneum in 3. Tuberculous lymphadenitis was the most common associated finding (6 patients). Two patients had hepatic lesions. The fibrotic type was found in all the patients, and 5 patients had an association of the fibrotic and wet types. None of the patients had lesions consistent with the dry plastic type.
Conclusion
Peritoneal tuberculosis is best described as a combination of ascites, peritoneal lesions, and lymphadenopathy, rather than the three types from the traditional classification.

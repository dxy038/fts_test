The objective of this study is to examine the phenomenon of vortex-induced vibrations and reduction of its effects using the control body. For that reason, first the circular cylinder located on the elastic foundation and subjected to uniform fluid flow, is simulated.After comparing the obtained results with those of other similar numerical and laboratory investigations and ensuring the accuracy and correctness of the results, the control body with a circular cross-section is placed behind the master cylinder at 5 different distance ratios and examining its effect on the mean lift and drag coefficients and maximum amplitude of oscillations in lock-in area and the optimal configuration and location of control cylinders are defined. Then, the effect of changing the arrangement and cross-section of the control body are studied. For that reason, first the effect of two control cylinders in parallel and perpendicular arrangement to the current at the optimal distance are studied. Finally, the impact of using the control bodies with different noncircular cross-sections, which have hydraulic diameter equal to the master cylinder, are investigated

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in morbidity, progression-free interval, and survival in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer treated with initial chemotherapy versus initial surgery.
Study design
All women with epithelial ovarian cancer who were treated surgically at our hospital between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2003, were eligible; the cases of 200 patients met the criteria and underwent retrospective chart review.
Results
Ninety-eight patients (49%) had initial chemotherapy, and 102 patients (51%) had initial surgery. Patients who received initial chemotherapy were more likely to have stage IV disease (initial chemotherapy, 27%, vs initial surgery, 8%; P = .042) and grade 3 disease (initial chemotherapy, 73%, vs initial surgery, 61%; P = .025). Optimal cytoreduction was achieved more often in patients who received initial chemotherapy (initial chemotherapy, 86%, vs initial surgery, 54%; P< .001). Only optimal cytoreduction (P = .022), and not treatment choice (P = .089), had an impact on median survival.
Conclusion
Initial chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to initial surgery for the treatment of selected patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

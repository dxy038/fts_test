Spectrum is one of the most precious radio resources. With the increasing demand for wireless communication, efficiently using the spectrum resource has become an essential issue. With the Federal Communications CommissionÂ´s (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing has gained increasing interest. One of the policy reforms introduces the concept of an interference temperature - the total allowable interference in a spectral band. This means that secondary users can use different transmit powers as long as the sum of these power is less than the interference threshold. In this paper, we study two problems in secondary spectrum access with minimum signal to interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) guarantee under an interference temperature constraint. First, when all the secondary links can be supported, a nonlinear optimization problem with the objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary users is formulated. The nonlinear optimization is solved efficiently using geometric programming techniques. The second problem we address is, when not all the secondary links can be supported with their QoS requirement, it is desirable to have the spectrum access opportunity proportional to the user priority if they belong to different priority classes. In this context, we formulate an operator problem which takes the priority issues into consideration. To solve this problem, first, we propose a centralized reduced complexity search algorithm to find the optimal solution. Then, in order to solve this problem distributively, we define a secondary spectrum sharing potential game. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are investigated. The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized. It is shown that distributed sequential play and an algorithm based on stochastic learning attain the equilibrium solutions. Finally, the performances are examined through simulations

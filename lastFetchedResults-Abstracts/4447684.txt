The main objective of routing protocol is to transfer data more efficiently from the source to the destination. All routing protocols have the same in this goal, but the method that adopts to achieve this is different. This paper propose a new modification of CBRP protocol called Vice Cluster Head Cluster Based Routing Protocol (VCH-CBRP) that elect one Vice Cluster Head (VCH) in each cluster rather than one cluster head to increase the lifetime of the cluster in the network in case of the absence of the cluster head suddenly. We evaluate our contribution of CBRP protocol and compare the results with the traditional CBRP protocol. Simulation results show VCH-CBRP has better performance than the traditional CBRP.

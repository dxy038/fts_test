Laser speckle strain and displacement measurement is a well established method for noncontacting sensing in material science applications. This paper deals with a simulation of the forming of laser speckles for free field propagation of the diffracted light-wave-field whose intensity distribution on the observation plane is the objective speckle pattern. A need for simulation of laser speckles is the analysis of accuracy and sensitivity of different measurement set-ups as well as the analysis of decorrelation effects due to structural changes on the specimenÂ´s surface, known and unknown object translation and rotation and changes in the illumination conditions.

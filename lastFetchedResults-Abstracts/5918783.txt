Despite a widely spread intuition about growing needs for energy storage solutions over the world, there is still no consented scenarios on the requirement for additional storage capacities within main power systems. Besides, storage value assessment and economics are mostly not proven yet in the frame of Smart Grids. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the need for coordinated energy policies regarding energy storage, especially in the matter of optimal choice of incentive mechanisms.

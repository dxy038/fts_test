This paper proposes a new concept to augment direct robot programming with sensor-based branching and looping. The objective is to derive a new robot programming paradigm in order to enable non-programmers to use robots for different tasks. Inspired by the ancient programming style based on the GOTO-statement, this approach requires the user to deal with only two basic concepts: Intuitive Control Expressions and Spatial Labels. This simplicity yields a very intuitive robot programming interface. We introduce these new concepts and derive some statements about the power and the limitations of this approach.

Objective: This study was done for comparing efficiency of
Intravenous Heparin and Oral Aspirin among patients who had cerebral thrombi cmbolitic vascular accidents. Effective u! Heparin and Aspirin on prognosis and recovery of these patients were evaluated.
Materials & Methods: This study was a clinical randomized trial.
Patients were classified randomly in one of the heparin (n=32) and
one group Aspirin (n=30) treatment. At first in the Heparin treatment
group. patients were medicated by I leparin 100 1U/kg and then it was followed by 10001U/hour for 48 hours. In the Aspirin treated group, whom took 325mg/day for 48 hours. The effectiveness of both treatments were evaluated after 48 hours on neuro- muscular, speech. vision. and sphincter function.
Results: The results showed that both treatments were effective on improvement ofneuro - muscular, speech, vision, and sphincter function; while Heparin effectiveness was more than Aspirin. Improvement of Nervous function in the Heparin group was 43.8% in compare of 33.3% for Aspirin (p=0.40).In addition, in the Heparin treatment group 56.3% of muscular dysfunction was attained optimum muscular function in compare of 33.3% with Aspirin (p--0.001 ).It was found significant relation for improvement of speech function in I leparin treatment group(P=0.01 ). There were not a significant finding relation fear improvement of vision, and sphincter function between Heparin and Aspirin treated groups.
Conclusion: Beginning primary medication with 1-leparin would he effective for achieving optimum function among patients with cerebral thrombi embolitic vascular accidents.

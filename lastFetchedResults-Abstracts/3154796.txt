According to the given measure points of the objective cam, and by selecting some of them in sequence as the sample points to the interpolation calculation based on some kind of fitting curve, the cam profile can be reconstructed accurately with high precision. In this paper, B3-spline is adopted as the fitting curves for the interpolation algorithm, and the corresponding reverse design model is presented. As an application, the reverse design of a main cam of the down-swing paper transferring mechanism around fixed center on high-speed printing press is implemented, the result and precision of renconstruction with different sample points are discussed in detail.

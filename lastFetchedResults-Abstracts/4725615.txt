The objective evaluation of somatic sensations is expected without a patientÂ´s subjective opinions to reduce social problems such as those related to lawsuits for nerve injuries or malingering. In this study, the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) using the mechanical stimulations of the tactile sensation was measured and analyzed in spatiotemporal domains. The cortical potential mapping projected onto the realistic-shaped model was estimated to improve the spatial resolution of the SEP maps by application of cortical dipole layer imaging. The experimentally obtained results suggest that the spatiotemporal distributions of the SEPs reflect the differences for positions, strengths, and patterns of somatosensory stimulations.

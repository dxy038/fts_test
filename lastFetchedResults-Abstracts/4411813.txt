This paper presents the structuration and the first results of a research program dedicated to the co-design and the co-integration of a multiband antenna array for a GPS/Galileo receiver. The objective is to develop a novel design approach taking into account all parts of the RF system simultaneously. By this way, the aim is to improve the performances of the RF front-end compared to a traditional approach where RF circuits would be designed separately.

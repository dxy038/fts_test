The objective of this study was to identify the proteins involved in bovine intramuscular fat (IMF) development. Global proteins were monitored in bovine skeletal muscle at muscle-developing versus IMF-increasing stages and with higher versus lower IMF scores, respectively. We identified two differentially expressed (two-fold or more) proteins at the IMF-increasing stage, up-regulated heat shock protein beta 1 (HSPB1) and down-regulated ATP synthase D chain (ATP5H), and two down-regulated proteins with higher IMF scores, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3). In vitro, after adipogenic differentiation, the mRNA expression of HSPB1 and ATP5H did not be changed, but that of CA2 and MYL3 decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). After myogenic differentiation, the mRNA expression of HSPB1 increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), but expression of other genes did not vary. We suggested that CA2 and MYL3, which expressed down during adipogenic differentiation, could be indicative markers for negative regulation of IMF development.

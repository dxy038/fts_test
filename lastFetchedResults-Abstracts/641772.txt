Objective: We reviewed the literature and examined the issues surrounding the use of glutamine in pediatrics and neonatology.

Methods: We reviewed the literature using Medline, Embase, Current Contents, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Additional information was obtained from bibliographic citations and personal communications.

Results: Evidence showed that glutamine levels are affected in a number of life stages and conditions. Useful, indicative studies are emerging but many fail to demonstrate significant differences. The problems of researching in this patient population were demonstrated.

Conclusion: A need for a great deal of further research in this area, including larger multicenter trials, clearly emerged.

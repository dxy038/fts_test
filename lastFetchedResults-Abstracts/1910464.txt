Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) plays a major role in the execution of apoptosis. Attenuation of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. Through systemic examination of FADD in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and adjacent nontumor kidney tissues from 85 patients, we demonstrated a significant reduction of FADD in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) compared with the respective nontumor kidney tissues. In human kidney, FADD is expressed in both the proximal and distal tubules. As ccRCC originates from the proximal tubular epithelium, reduction of FADD in ccRCC indicates that FADD-mediated apoptosis may inhibit ccRCC tumorigenesis.

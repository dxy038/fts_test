The main objective of this paper is to study the behavior and design of thin-walled centrifugal concrete-filled steel tubes under torsion. The thin-walled centrifugal concrete-filled steel tubes were a steel tube with a centrifugal concrete tube inside. A test program has been carried out to study the behavior of thin-walled centrifugal concrete-filled steel tube under torsion. Material properties of the concrete and steel used in the test specimens were measured. In addition, torsion tests were also carried out on the steel tubes. Current design standards are used to predict the specimen strengths under torsion. It is shown that design strengths predicted by standards are conservative. Design method proposed by other researchers for concreted-filled steel tubes under torsion are also used to predict the strengths of centrifugal concrete-filled steel tubes. It is shown that design strengths predicted by other researchers are unconservative.

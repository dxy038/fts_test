The objective of this study is to present new methodologies, systems, and techniques for early cancer detection, assessment of disease, based on molecular imaging and nanophotonics concepts. The physical and engineering principles of a novel Near-Field Scanning Microscopy System operating on multispectral, Muller Matrix polarimetric/Stokes Polarization Parameter principles, for single-molecule imaging, tissue metabolic studies. In addition, the use of polar molecules, as new optical contrast agents for early cancer detection, is introduced and discussed. The system can be implemented with Mueller matrix/Stokes Polarization Parameters spectral difference (dual-energy) capabilities, providing both high contrast and high noise rejection.

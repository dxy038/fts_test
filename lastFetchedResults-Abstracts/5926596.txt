The network delay is one of the most important impairments for VoIP (voice over IP). This paper focuses on the bi-objective optimization problem of minimizing sampling cost and also minimizing the error in the estimation of the actual delay traces. We also analyze the real network delay measurements and the simulated network delay trace for fractional Brownian motion (fBm) traffic. We find that a shifted Gamma distribution models the network delay marginal distribution very well. The simulation based on the simulated network delay trace shows that our novel optimal sampling strategy can obtain a 20 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR) in measurement accuracy at as low as 1.3 HZ sampling frequency.

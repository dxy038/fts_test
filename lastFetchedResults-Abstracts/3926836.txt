This study proposes a novel methodology that employs fuzzified binary real coded artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for solving multi-objective unit commitment problem. On solving unit commitment problem, the proposed binary coded ABC algorithm finds the ON/OFF status of the generating units whereas the economic dispatch is solved using the real coded ABC. Here, three conflicting functions such as fuel cost, emission and reliability level of the system are considered. These functions are formulated as a single objective optimisation problem using the fuzzy set theory. Also, the fuzzy membership design variables are tuned using real coded ABC thereby requirement of expertise for setting these variables are eliminated. The proposed method is validated on six unit system, IEEE 30 bus system, ten unit system, 40 unit system and IEEE RTS 24 bus system. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated by comparing its performance with other methods reported in the literature.

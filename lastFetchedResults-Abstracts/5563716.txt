Internet Service providers offer today a variety of of audio, video and data services. Traditional approaches for quality assessment of video services were based on Quality of Service (QoS) measurement. These measurements are considered as performance measurement at the network level. However, in order to make accurate quality assessment, the video must be assessed subjectively by the user. However, QoS parameters are easier to be obtained than the QoE subjective scores. Therefore, some recent works have investigated objective approaches to estimate QoE scores based on measured QoS parameters. The main purpose is the control of QoE based on QoS measurements. This paper presents several solutions and models presented in the literature. We discuss some other factors that must be considered in the mapping process between QoS and QoE. The impact of these factors on perceived QoE is verified through subjective tests.

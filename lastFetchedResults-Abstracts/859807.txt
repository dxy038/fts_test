It is shown, on examples, how to compute the balance set and the balance number in Vector Optimization Problems (VOPs) of different nature. New developments are presented concerning possible interrelation between the balance set and the balance number, a new notion of the projection of the balance set onto the parameter space, new approaches for solving VOPs with unbounded objective functions, and some approximation techniques in determining the balance set.

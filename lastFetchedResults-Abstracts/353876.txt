Reactive oxygen species (ROS) including nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2–) are associated with cell migration, proliferation and many growth-related diseases. The objective of this study was to determine whether there was a reciprocal relationship between rat coronary microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) growth and activity/expressions (mRNA and protein) of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase enzymes. Proliferating namely, 50% confluent CMEC possessed approximately threefold increased activity and expression of both enzymes compared to 100% confluent cells. Treatment of CMEC with an inhibitor of eNOS (L-NAME, 100 μM) increased cell proliferation as assessed via three independent methods, i.e. cell counting, determination of total cellular protein levels and [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Similarly, treatment of CMEC with pyrogallol (0.3–3 mM), a superoxide anion (O2–) generator, also increased CMEC growth while spermine NONOate (SpNO), a NO donor, significantly reduced cell growth. Co-incubation of CMEC with a cell permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic (Mn-III-tetrakis-4-benzoic acid-porphyrin; MnTBAP) plus either pyrogallol or NO did not alter cell number and DNA synthesis thereby dismissing the involvement of peroxynitrite (OONO–) in CMEC proliferation. Specific inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase but not other ROS-generating enzymes including cyclooxygenase and xanthine oxidase, attenuated cell growth. Transfection of CMEC with antisense p22-phox cDNA, a membrane-bound component of NAD(P)H oxidase, resulted in substantial reduction in [3H]-thymidine incorporation, total cellular protein levels and expression of p22-phox protein. These data demonstrate a cross-talk between CMEC growth and eNOS and NAD(P)H oxidase enzyme activity and expression, thus suggesting that the regulation of these enzymes may be critical in preventing the initiation and/or progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

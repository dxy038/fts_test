This research aims to create a cooperative robot team. Nowadays, multiple robots are widely applied in a great number of industrials. Robots are required to have their own special abilities, such as high accuracy, rapid working and continuous operations, in order to imitate or duplicate human behaviors. The main objective of the research is to respond to the demand of industrials which are increasingly requiring cooperative robot teams to decrease malfunction and increase efficiency in working. This project has planned to develop a number of robots with possess cooperative abilities to do mission mutually. For instance, each robot can move to different places to pick up the aimed targets, then merge in with electromagnet and put them away in the set-up places. The aimed targets support two systems; automatic system and manual system. The manual system was set up to grab the target by hands which will appear on the monitor. We had already designed the robots on 3D model program and studied method to remotely control the robots by using wireless device by image processing with camera. Moreover, we have already studied about how to design the experiment field. Finally, we have planned applying many techniques and knowledge to develop the robots to cooperate together with an easy and suitable mechanism to transform.

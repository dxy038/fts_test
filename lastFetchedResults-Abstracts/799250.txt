The primary objective of this article is to elicit some interesting extensions of the simple but powerful Banachâ€™s contraction principle to the case of non-self-mappings. In fact, due to the fact that best proximity point theorems fit the bill to this end, the proposed extensions are presented as best proximity point theorems for non-self proximal contractions which are more general than the notion of self-contractions.

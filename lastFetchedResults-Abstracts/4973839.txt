The term Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) has been defined and still being redefined. However, ultimate objective of SDI is to improve the availability and accessibility to interoperable multiple geospatial data for a wide range of user community. One of the preliminary requirements to improve the availability and accessibility to geospatial data is to know, who has what and where, of which quality and contents as well as what are the conditions to exploit it. All these generic but very important questions are possible to be addressed by establishing a data advertising, sharing, discovering, and dissemination system known as geospatial data clearinghouse.

This paper describes a high speed fault detection strategy to detect and identify open-circuit device failures in matrix converter motor drive systems. The proposed fault detection algorithm is based on analysis of the currents circulating through the drive system and the bidirectional switches gating signals. The presented technique described in this paper is used to identify not only a fault caused in a single device but also multiple device failures. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection technique.

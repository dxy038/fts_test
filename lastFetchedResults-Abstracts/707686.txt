The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy of two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography (echo) in predicting adverse cardiac events in patients presenting to the ED with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients 25 years of age or older having symptoms consistent with ACS and a non-diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) were evaluated with 0-, 3-, 6-, and 9-hour creatine kinase -MB (CK-MB) assays and continuous 12-lead ECG ST-segment monitoring. Patients with normal serial CK-MB assays and no ECG changes after 9 hours had a resting 2-D transthoracic echo performed. A positive 2-D echo was defined as segmental or global wall motion abnormalities. Patients were followed up after 6 months to identify adverse events resulting from ACS. Of the 1112 patients receiving an echo, 18 had positive studies. None had adverse events on follow-up. Of the 1094 patients with a negative 2-D echo, 15 had adverse events (2 acute myocardial infarctions, 2 coronary artery bypass graftings, and 11 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties). Resting 2-D echo did not predict cardiac adverse events in patients with possible ACS and non-diagnostic serial 12-lead ECG and normal serial CK-MB at the end of a 9-hour evaluation.

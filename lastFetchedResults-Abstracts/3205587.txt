With various kinds of intelligent metering equipment coming into service, there has been an urgent need for a set of examination system in the electric power industry to check the staff´s level of measuring electric energy. In this paper, we design and implement a random test paper generation algorithm for this examination system, and analyze the experiment´s data, based on the practical requirement of a training system for the electric energy measurement in a certain electric company. At the same time, in order to get a set of test papers to satisfy the given conditions, this paper discusses how to use optimized genetic algorithm to generate test papers from the question bank. This paper introduce fishnet algorithm to generate test papers automatically for getting a better, more fair and more objective test paper.

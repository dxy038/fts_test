This paper proposes a tour route planning problem to flexibly reschedule the initial route plan with uncertain traveling times and satisfaction values of sightseeing places dependent on sightseeing. The objective of our proposed model is to maximize the total satisfaction value in all possible conditions after visiting a sightseeing place under such time-dependent parameters. Since traveling times are dependent on the time of day, it is hard to represent our proposed model using the general static network model. In this paper, Time-Expanded Network (TEN), which contains a copy to the set of nodes in the underlying static network for each discrete time step, is introduced. Using the proposed TEN-based model, it is possible to construct various types of tour route planning problems in a single static network. Furthermore, a 0-1 mixed integer programming problem is formulated to the above-mentioned objective, and the strict algorithm is also developed to equivalently transform the main problem into the existing TEN-based problem.

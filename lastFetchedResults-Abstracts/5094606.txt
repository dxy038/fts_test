As energy crisis poses a huge threat to human welfare, the electric vehicle is of vast potential for future development as an newly emerged traffic tool which is energy-conserving and environment-protective. However, the layout method of its charging station is far from a mature system even though the construction is being undertaken. Thus this paper presents a multi-objective planning model which is comprehensive for the layout of electric vehicle charging station taking in account factors including electric vehicles sustainable development, characters of charging station, characters of charging consumers, distribution of the charging demand, the power grid and factors of municipal planning. Then a solution algorithm is designed based on demand priority and the usage of the existing gas station. The model and the solution algorithm is sustainable and expandable. Many considered factors can be revised and optimized with the development of the electric vehicle and its charging station. This is of great importance and can promote the development of this new energy vehicle. In order to illustrate and verify the proposed model and algorithm, a numerical case is studied based on the background of Chengdu City in China, making decisions on the position to construct the charging station.

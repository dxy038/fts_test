We have recently initiated a program of basic research on image structure, image characteristics, image models and their application to various image processing tasks. The objective is to achieve a better understanding of image structure and to use this knowledge to develop improved mathematical and statistical models for use in image analysis and processing tasks such as image enhancement, image restoration, coding, information extraction, etc. The ultimate objective of this research is to form a basis for the development of technology relative to machine extraction of information from aircraft and satellite imagery of the earthÂ´s surface.

This paper presents a fast motion compensated de-interlacing algorithm based on true sub-pixel accurate motion estimation scheme. This algorithm aims at two existing motion compensated de-interlacing problems: one is the computational complexity of motion compensated de-interlacing method and the other is robust to erroneous motion vectors. A new motion compensated de-interlacing method using forward, backward and bi-directional motion estimation which has accuracies of 1/4 pixel and a new updated strategy for motion vector reliability are proposed in this paper. The experimental results demonstrate this new motion compensated de-interlacing improves the subjective video quality and provides better objective video quality in video sequences.

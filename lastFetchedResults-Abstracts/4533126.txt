The relationship between two factors of variety and the cost of manufacturing system was studied on the basis of the variety reduction program VRP theory. Based on the Grey system and the new information principle, taking the mean relative error as objective function and taking the modified nth component of each variable as initial value of response function and finding the optimum background value coefficient q and modified value of initial value of response function by optimizing, new information multi-variable optimization Grey model NMGM (1,n,q,r) of the cost- variability function in manufacturing system was put forward which is used to check validity for the relation of plasm-yarn machine product and variety. Calculation results show that this method is very effective to data processing which has high precision and easy to use. The method has wide applications in various engineering fields.

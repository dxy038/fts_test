image Dichlofluanide is a common fungicide in glazing paints, varnishes, and paints.

image The objective of this study was to describe 5 patients with allergic contact dermatitis from dichlofluanide and to examine the sensitizing capacity of dichlofluanide in a predictive assay.

image Patch testing in humans and sensitization studies in animals were performed with the guinea pig maximization test.

image Four of the patients were primarily sensitized to dichlofluanide, whereas 1 patient had probably been primarily sensitized to tolylfluanide when exposed to this pesticide. Sensitization studies in guinea pigs showed dichlofluanide to be a strong sensitizer.

image Dichlofluanide can cause allergic contact dematitis in humans and is a strong sensitizer in guinea pigs.

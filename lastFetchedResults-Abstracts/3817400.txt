Much has been written on the application of high-speed (3600 r/min) motors to pumps and compressors relative to vibration and lateral critical speeds. A reciprocating compressor coupled to an induction motor is a complex torsional system and can present a more complex set of problems to the equipment suppliers because of the wider range of forcing frequencies present. The problems encountered on a specific application with the objective of developing guidelines to be used to avoid similar system torsional problems on the application of induction motors to reciprocating equipment are discussed.

The objective of the work described is to provide a software tool to assist real-time system specifiers and designers to predict quality improvement by allowing early assessment of whether or not a design can satisfy its requirements. A high quality software system must meet both its functional and non-functional system requirements. A reliable real-time software system is not only a logically correct system but is a system which guarantees all of its timing constraints. Realtime software tools can, therefore, enhance the quality of the software by providing timing information earlier in the development cycle. The tool SRT (Simulation of Real-Time systems), allows a model of a real-time system to be constructed and then evaluated by simulation. The construction of the model is achieved by using a graphical user interface. Icons from the control panel are copied onto the design panel and then joined together with lines that represent the databuses. Each icon has a number of attributes which can be specified by selecting the form option on the icon menu

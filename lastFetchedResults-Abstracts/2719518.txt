Modeling charge transport and linking charge dynamics with dissipative processes responsible for electrical ageing are a challenging objective for developing a mature approach in insulation design. Such an approach is exemplified here for polyethylene-based materials by introducing two models describing bipolar Space Charge Limited Current in transient and steady states. They rely on two classical descriptions of the distribution function of the energy levels of trap states -single trapping level or exponential distribution. Their predictions are discussed as regards the experimental behavior. They notably highlight the importance of recombination processes in explaining the sigmoidal shape of the steady-state current-voltage characteristic. Also, bipolar charge transport seems to be a necessary factor for the observed features of oscillatory charge packets. The energetic features of charge dynamics is reviewed with particular emphasis on recombination phenomena because the latter promote electronically excited states that are chemically reactive and could be involved in ageing reaction. The relationship between charge recombination and electroluminescence is highlighted through experiments and simulation. The spectral analysis of the emitted light advocates the existence of massive chemical/physical degradation in the electrical regime where recombination is a major factor of the Space Charge Limited Current (SCLC).

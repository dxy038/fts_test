The objective of the paper is to propose a strategy in order to develop accurate numerical models to describe the behaviour of a ductile adhesive in an assembly under mechanical proportional monotonic loads at different low temperatures. This study requires the use of precise 3D numerical analysis of the stress state within a bonded assembly in order to develop an inverse identification technique starting from the load–displacement curves obtained using a modified Arcan apparatus. First, the influence of the geometry of the bonded assembly close to the free edges of the adhesive on the stress state under a mechanical load at a given temperature is analysed with a 2D numerical analysis. These results allow us to propose some rules in order to define accurate experimental devices for such thermo-mechanical loads. The second part is associated with the estimation of the residual stresses within an adhesive in an assembly and the identification of the material parameters of a 3D elastic–plastic Mahnken–Schlimmer type model, for tensile/compression–shear proportional monotonic mechanical loads and for a temperature range between 20 °C and −60 °C.

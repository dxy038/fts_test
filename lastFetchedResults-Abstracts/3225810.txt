In broadband wireless channel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system combined with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique can achieve reliable high data rate transmission and to mitigate intersymbol interference. High data rate system suffer from inter symbol interference (ISI). To estimate the desire channel at the receiver channel Estimation techniques are used and also enhance system capacity of system. The MIMO-OFDM system uses two independent space-time codes for two sets of two transmit antennas. The objective of this paper is to improve channel estimation accuracy in MIMO-OFDM system because channel state information is required for signal detection at receiver and its accuracy affects the overall performance of system and it is essential for reliable communication. This paper presents channel estimation scheme based on Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) algorithm proposed for BPSK-QPSK-PSK MIMO OFDM System. So by designing this we are going to analyze the terms of the Minimum Mean Squares Error (MMSE), and Bit Error Rate (BER) and improve Signal to Noise Ratio.

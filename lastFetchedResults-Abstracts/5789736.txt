In this paper, we present a novel rule evaluation support method for post-processing of mined results with rule evaluation models based on objective indices. Post-processing of mined results is one of the key issues to make a data mining process successfully. However, it is difficult for human experts to evaluate many thousands of rules from a large dataset with noises completely. To reduce the costs of rule evaluation procedures, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models, which are obtained with objective indices of mined classification rules and evaluations of a human expert for each rule. To evaluate performances of learning algorithms for constructing rule evaluation models, we have done a case study on the meningitis data mining as an actual problem. Then we discuss the availability of our rule evaluation support method.

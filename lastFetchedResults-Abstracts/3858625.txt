The mathematics of product-form queueing networks has traditionally dealt with the "analysis" of computer systems. That is, the system is assumed to be given and the question of how it performs is answered. In this paper the opposite process of system "synthesis" is dealt with: i.e., we answer the question of what the system topology and parameters should be in order to achieve a given performance objective. Possible research and industry applications range from the hierarchial top-down design of software systems to the management and design of computer installations.

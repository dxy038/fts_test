Imagine with the dawn of the new technologies of this world, what if the next is enabling a mute to speak? How can a mute person verbally communicate via a phone? The primary objective of the Real-time interactive voice communication system is to enable a mute to communicate verbally via a smart phone. Simple and user friendly methodologies were used for the implementation of this system. The user inputs a word composed in English to the system via the mobile phoneÂ´s GUI and it will be transliterated to Sinhala Unicode characters and the system will convert the text to a Sinh ala male or female synthesized voice clip and transfer it to the on-going call. Therefore the person who is in the other end will not be aware that he/she is communicating with a mute person. The purpose of this paper is to present a briefing of the development, planning and implementation methodologies that was undertaken to implement the Real-time Interactive Voice Communication for a mute person in Sinhala.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of five dosage of vitamin
C (0, 50, 250, 750 and 1500 mg vitamin C per kg diet) on fatty acid composition of
Caspian brown trout fry (Salmo trutta caspius). Fish (initial average body weight
of 0.1Â±0.02 g) were fed by formulated diets for 6 weeks in triplicate. The findings
of growth parameters and survival showed significant difference among groups
(P < 0.05). The lowest amount of SGR, BWG and survival was observed in control
group while the group of 750 mg/Kg had the highest amount of SGR, BWG and
survival than those from others. The results showed that fish fed 750 mg/Kg diet
had a higher PUFA, HUFA, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids than those from other groups
without significant difference (P > 0.05). Control treatment had a lower amount of
PUFA, HUFA, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids than those from other treatments without
significant (P >  0.05). The SFA fatty acids had a higher amount in 1500 mg/Kg diet
than those from others without significant difference (P > 0.05). These results
showed that vitamins C could be had an important role in protection of fatty acids
against oxidation.

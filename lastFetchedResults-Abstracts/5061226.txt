Imperfect test outcomes, due to factors such as unreliable sensors, electromagnetic interference, and environmental conditions, manifest themselves as missed detections and false alarms. The main objective of our research on on-board diagnostic inference is to develop near-optimal algorithms for dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD) problems in the presence of imperfect test outcomes. Our problem is to determine the most likely evolution of fault states, the one that best explains the observed test outcomes. Here, we develop a primal-dual algorithm for solving the DMFD problem by combining Lagrangian relaxation and the Viterbi decoding algorithm in an iterative way. A novel feature of our approach is that the approximate duality gap provides a measure of suboptimality of the DMFD solution.

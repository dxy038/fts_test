The present study aims at evaluating ecological capacity of Shahid Abbaspour dam’s typical tourism region focusing on determininig sustainable development of tourism by means of Geographical Information System. In order to achieve this objective, documental research and field study were employed. To evaluate the ecological capacity of understudied zone, GIS was used, which was based on Boolean method in order to incorporate ecological information by GIS. Then, the categorization of ecological capacity of this zone was performed by comparing ecological model of tourism categorization. Findings indicated that Shahid Abbaspour dam’s typical tourism zone includes two centralized and widespread tourism zones. Furthermore, findings showed that economical investment in centralized tourism is not economical with respect to the high gradient of its land. Also, regarding high gradient and unsuitable soil of this zone, it can be concluded that widespread tourism is the best type of touristic use in this zone.

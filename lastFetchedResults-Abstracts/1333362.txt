The main objective of this paper is to investigate the composite effect of macro steel fiber and steel rebar on the mechanical behaviour of tunnel segment with fiber reinforced high-performance concrete (FRHPC). A new experimental method is used for simulating the loading state of the tunnel segment. The experiment including several symmetric-inclination beams with various steel ratios and fiber contents has been carried out. The results indicate that the addition of 50 kg/m3 steel fibers can partly replace the shear reinforcement, and increases the ultimate load and the energy absorption capacity as well as the toughness. The combination of steel fibers and steel rebars illustrates synergistic response and indicates an optimal choice of reinforcement for tunnel segment.

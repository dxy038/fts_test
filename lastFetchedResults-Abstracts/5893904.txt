The objective of the study in this paper is to find the possible effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) on the performance of an information systems which is composed of radar systems, communication stations, and an information processing center. The topology of the information system under study is presented. The performance of the information system especially the digital communication system is evaluated. The possible EMI sources are mainly from neighboring radar systems. This analysis is to help achieve the optimal design of the information system under the EM environment

Pollution is a subject of worldwide concern and discussion and various areas of science are seeking to integrate their knowledge in an attempt to improve understanding of the harmful effects of modern human activities. Thus, the objective of the current study was to assess the potential for using the horse as a bio-indicator of environmental pollution. Blood and serum samples from 120 horses from locations with different degrees of urbanization and industrialization and the feeds used for these animals were analyzed to determine their heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Zn) content. The data obtained were compared. The results did not show increases in heavy metal concentration in the blood and serum of the horses with the intensification of urbanization and industrialization around the farms. Only Cd, as determined in the blood of the animals, showed a certain potential for using horses as bio-indicators of environmental pollution. The data for sex, age, and chemical composition of the foodstuffs supplied to the animals were not determinants in explaining the variation in the concentrations of heavy metals observed.

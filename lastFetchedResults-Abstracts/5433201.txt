In resent time there is no such system by which doctors can relate their qualitative result of Histopathological image, which varies person to person. Histopathological images are the images of diseased tissues of any section of the body. All these are microscopic digital images. To analyze these images by naked eye, it is very difficult. So we develop such a black-box that analyzes the quality of the Histopathological Images using Neural Network. This basically comes under the domain of Digital Image Processing. Objective: Produce a research based system that works on image processing to calculate quality analysis. We have the opportunity to be the first to market in this category.

As part of its task of reinforcing the US power infrastructure security, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) developed and deployed the Infrastructure Security Initiative (ISI) to address a wide range of utility security concerns. A key activity of the ISI is a project that examines the feasibility of creating a population of rapidly deployable recovery transformers to help respond to and quickly recover from simultaneous failure of a number of power transformers. The primary objective was to design, manufacture, and store recovery transformers as a short-term stopgap to minimize the impact of electric supply interruptions on the US economy. The project results in the development of the basic specifications for the recovery transformers in great detail, created electrical designs to cover a specific need of the largest number of transmission transformers in service in the US, and detailed the mechanical components and field installation processes necessary to support expedited deployment and installation.

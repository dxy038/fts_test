Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the calciuric response in symptom-free primigravid women to an oral calcium load between those with normal urinary calcium excretions and those with relatively low urinary calcium excretions. Study Design: This was a prospective clinical trial. Eligible primigravid women between 16 and 20 weeks’ gestation provided a 24-hour urine sample for determination of urinary calcium/urinary creatinine ratio. On the basis of these results the patients were divided into 2 groups: a relatively hypocalciuric group, in which the urinary calcium excretion was ≤3.4 mg • kg–1 • 24 h–1, and a normocalciuric group, in which the urinary calcium excretion was >3.4 mg • kg–1 • 24 h–1. All participants undertook a 3-day low calcium dietary regimen. On the fourth day women underwent an oral calcium challenge. A 2-hour urine sample was collected before ingestion of 1 g calcium carbonate (preload). One hour after ingestion the women again collected a 2-hour urine sample (postload). The urinary calcium/urinary creatinine ratios in the preload and postload samples were determined and compared within and between the groups. Results: The mean change (±SD) between the preload and postload urinary calcium/urinary creatinine ratios in the relatively hypocalciuric group was 0.60 ± 1.44 (P = .04); that in the normocalciuric group was 3.09 ± 2.26 (P = .11 ). There was a 5-fold difference in the response to calcium load between the hypocalciuric women and the normocalciuric women (0.60 vs 3.09), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .20). Conclusions: Both hypocalciuric and normocalciuric women responded to an oral calcium challenge by an increase in the calcium excretion. The cause of the hypocalciuria in women at increased risk for preeclampsia is therefore not simply poor absorption of calcium. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:1419-21.)

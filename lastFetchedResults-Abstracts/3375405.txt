A new technology needs to offer more than just 100 Mb/s. To succeed in the LAN marketplace, a new LAN technology must be very cost competitive with the established LANs, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, while also providing backwards compatibility with existing network software. We describe a new 100-Mb/s LAN technology that has these characteristics This technology is being defined as an open standard within the IEEE Project 802.12 Demand Priority group. Two important objectives were established for this LAN technology: first, it should be able to use the unshielded twisted pair (UTP) wiring found in a large number of installations and, in particular, to use the same wiring as defined for use in 1OBase-T. This objective was later extended to encompass support for the shielded twisted pair (STP) used for IEEE 802.5. This will enable the majority of current LAN users to benefit from their enormous investment in cable plant. The second objective was that the network should support new applications, such as video conferencing and remote training, while also providing backwards compatibility with the massive installed software base. Both objectives have been met. The Demand Priority MAC protocol currently being standardized in IEEE 802.12, offers substantial benefits over the CSMA/CD protocol of IEEE 802.3. By preserving both the current wiring infrastructure and investment in software, and by using the very simple Demand Priority MAC protocol, 100 Mb/s LANs could soon be as low-cost as 10Base-T is today

Controlled oxidation of GaN powders was performed inside xerogel cavities with the objective of demonstrating formation of composites of GaN nanoparticles embedded in a silicate matrix. A 60% reduction in GaN particle size was observed due to the oxidation of bulk particles dispersed inside the xerogel. The microstructure and phase chemistry of the nano-GaN in xerogel composite were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

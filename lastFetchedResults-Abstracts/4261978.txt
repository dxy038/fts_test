The simulation of excitation in a model whose gross physical characteristics are representative of the human ventricular conduction system is discussed. This objective was realized, and the resultant behavior reproduced the major features of a sequence estimated from previous work. Further, simulations were performed in a reasonable period of time. The activation sequence following a stimulus to the atrioventricular node was compared to a sequence estimated from a synthesis of whole heart measurements reported by other investigators. The gross features of the estimated sequence are recreated in the activation sequence simulated with the model

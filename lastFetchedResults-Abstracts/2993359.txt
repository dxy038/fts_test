Summary form only given. The objective of this work is to develop a widely tunable source in the infrared for use in high-resolution spectroscopy and trace gas detection. We have begun development of a diode laser-pumped spectroscopic source based on difference frequency generation (DFG) in gallium selenide (GaSe) that is continuously tunable in the 7-18 micron region and will operate at room temperature.

Objective
The goal of this study was to determine the influence of the third-year obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) clerkship on male and female medical students' interest in a career in OB/GYN.
Study design
Third-year medical students were surveyed about anticipated career field before and at the completion of the OB/GYN clerkship. The percentage of students considering OB/GYN as a career was computed before and after the clerkship. A multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the influence of various demographic factors on interest in OB/GYN. A Chi-square test was performed to establish different effects on males and females.
Results
A total of 268 students (55%) completed both surveys. Eight percent (mostly females) considered an OB/GYN career pre-clerkship and 15% post-clerkship. Interest in OB/GYN pre-clerkship was the strongest predictor of interest post-clerkship.
Conclusion
The OB/GYN clerkship increases students' interest in a career in OB/GYN. Most males are not considering OB/GYN as a career choice before the start of the clerkship.

Discrete event simulation is an important decision support tool to evaluate changes in manufacturing, distribution or process facilities. The challenge arises when it comes to the integration of simulation as an effective tool to detect manufacturing constraints and to suggest improvement alternatives. This paper describes the application of a method for detecting bottlenecks in discrete event models developed by Toyota Motor Company. The objective in this case is to automate the bottleneck analysis facilitating the understanding and adoption of simulation by decision makers without knowledge of simulation. The main results of this paper are the validation of the bottleneck detection method and its integration with MS Excel spreadsheets. Moreover system improvement alternatives are presented by the use of design of experiments.

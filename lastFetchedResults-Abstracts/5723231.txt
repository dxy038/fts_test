A beam-space processor structure is described that reduces the data from element-space to a reduced-dimension beam-space while focusing broadband sources that are within the selected location sector. The objective is principally to reduce the data observation dimension, thereby reducing computation in subsequent source location estimation and focusing sources within the sector. Additional advantages include: spatial filtering to eliminate multiple source cluster processing; improved spectral resolvability relative to element space processing; and reduced sensitivity to assumed noise characteristics

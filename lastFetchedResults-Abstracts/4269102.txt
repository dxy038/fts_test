A variant of alternate circular aperture synthesis is presented. The goal of this synthesis is defined in terms of system performance, and not in terms of pattern shape; the shape of the radiation pattern is therefore not a consideration here. The objective is to find the field distribution over a given circular aperture such that the minimum gain in a specified area is maximized. Only the aperture with radial variation field is considered. The gain-area product of the computed patterns is given.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

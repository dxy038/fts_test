After the successful launch of the SMOS satellite, on November 2009 at 02:50 CET (01:50 UT) from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia, a preliminary evaluation of the payload calibration strategy has been undertaken in order to assess the instrument performance and establish the operational measurement and calibration configuration. With this objective in mind, this work presents a preliminary study on the performance of the amplitude calibration strategy, a key issue in achieving a stable and accurate operation of the sensor.

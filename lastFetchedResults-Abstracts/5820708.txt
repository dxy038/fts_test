Permeation is a complex phenomenon. Today the unique tool ITER QA pedigree qualified is a one dimensional tool, TMAP7, not suitable for the complex geometries present in the Breeding Blanket concepts, where 2D/3D simulation capacities of the permeation phenomenon are a real need. In pursuit of this objective, a group of new operators describing some of the different phenomena which make up the permeation process have been implemented in a Cast3M-based code, profiting from the capacities of this finite elements tool for multidimensional calculation. These operators have been compared with the reference 1D code in 1D geometries in order to prove their performance, and finally adapted and tested in 2D geometries. Quality check is given together with ongoing developments and expectable future work.

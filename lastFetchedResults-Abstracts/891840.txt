Identification and evaluation of post operative pain had always been inseparable part of clinical science. The objective of this study was to test the suitability of two frequently used pain scales, VAS and UMPS, in evaluation of post ovariohysterectomy pain in dogs. VAS method is the most ordinary method that is basically evaluates pain by the use of behavioral factors. UMPS is other method that not only includes behavioral changes but also applies physiological parameters. Ten female mixed breed dogs mean weight 14.2, were selected for this study. Pain scores were recorded by a single observer in predesigned tables using both UMPS and VAS before and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 following ovariohysterectomy in all dogs. In addition serum levels of cortisol were measured at 0, 3, and a24 hours after the surgery. All dogs recovered from anesthesia uneventfully and there was not significant different between mean pain scores at 0 and 24 hours following the surgery (P > 0.05). Higher pain score was measured when UMPS was used (P < 0.05). Significant correlation was observed between pain scores recorded in UMPS and serum level of cortisol in dogs at 0 and 3 hours following the surgery (P < 0.05). It is concluded that because of the existence correlation between UMPS and serum level of cortisol, this method is more reliable than VAS in evaluation of pain following ovariohysterectomy in dogs.

The paper examines two location management procedures for a third-generation mobile communications network. The overlaying of macrocells on microcells and indoor picocells, proposed as a promising solution to achieve higher user capacity, requires new handover algorithms where accurate subscriber position information is important. An objective of such procedures is to minimize signaling overhead and delay on the radio link created when locating a roaming subscriber terminal. The accuracy of the described procedures rely on the optimal placement of the base stations or access points to realize temporal diversity, spatial diversity and area coverage sufficient to perform the position and tracking operations. Refinements to the algorithms include a multiple step paging strategy for mobile subscribers

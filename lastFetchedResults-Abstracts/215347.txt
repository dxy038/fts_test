Objective: Since colposcopy biopsy test plays a significant role in the evaluation of cervix, especially in patients with an abnormal result of Pap smear test, therefore, this research study was conducted to compare the results of Pap smear and colposcopy directed punch biopsy tests at Firoozgar and Akbarabady hospitals from 2001 to 2003. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 80 convenientlysampled women at different ages with an abnormal result of Pap smear test. In this respect, colposcopy directed biopsy was taken from suspicious areas of these patients. Results: A positive predictive value equal to 67.5% was found in patients with an abnormal result of Pap smear and colposcopy directed biopsy tests which confirmed the reliability of the study. Conclusion: These findings strongly suggest the necessity to obtain cervicovaginal smears from all sexually active women and for this purpose colposcopy directed biopsy is the best
choice for evaluation of patients with an abnormal result of Pap smear test.

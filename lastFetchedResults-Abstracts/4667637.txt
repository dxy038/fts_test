This study proposes a methodology for comparing the dynamic effectiveness of two different kinematic structures based on actuator torque requirement criteria. The objective of this comparison is to find out what type of robot structure is best suited as a lightweight industrial robot in the conceptual design phase. As a proof of concept this method is applied to compare Serial and Parallelogram linkage anthropomorphic kinematic structures with respect to torque requirements. Several directions for future research are discussed to include additional comparison criteria and also to extend the application of the proposed method to compare two versions of same structure in the design phase of light weight industrial robots.

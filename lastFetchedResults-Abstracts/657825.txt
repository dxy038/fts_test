Moisture management remains the most critical factor for controlling mold growth on wood and wood products during storage, construction, and while in service. When moisture management practices fail to adequately control moisture, plant extracts demonstrating antifungal properties may provide protection for these applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antifungal properties of natural plant extracts, such as essential oils, for use on wood. Seven essential oils were evaluated for their ability to inhibit growth of Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride, and Penicillium chrysogenum on southern yellow pine (SYP) stakes that were either dip treated or exposed to vapors of the test oils. Thyme and Egyptian geranium oil inhibited growth of all test fungi for 20 weeks. Likewise, dill weed oil vapors inhibited all test fungi for at least 20 weeks. Comparison of two mold test apparatuses—Petri dish test and tank test chambers—gave similar results for thyme oil. These findings support the application of essential oils for surface treatment or vapor exposure of wood to prevent mold infestation.

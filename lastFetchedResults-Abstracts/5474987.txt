In this paper an adaptive field oriented control of induction motor drive is proposed. The adaptive scheme uses a genetic algorithm for the identification of the rotor time constant, which is used to adjust the estimate of the slip angular speed. The identification method is presented as an optimization problem where the objective function is the total square error between the motor and the commanded stator currents. Computer simulation results are obtained and the performance of the resulting field oriented controller is analyzed. Further, this paper indicates that the genetic algorithm approach amounts to a promising methodology to handle adaptive control of indirect field oriented induction motors

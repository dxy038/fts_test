This work proposes a mathematical model to aid variety selection and planting quantity of sugarcane in order to reduce crop residues, maximize energy generated by this residue, and satisfy all the supply of the mill. We propose Linear Programming with two objective. The conflict between these objectives allows the use of the Nonzero-sum Game Theory.

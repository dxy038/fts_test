The following paper documents the development of an RFID based system that alerts vehicle drivers about approaching road oddities at an optimum distance before encountering them. The objective is to design a wireless system that delivers road signs (and other road-related information) to the commuter inside his/her vehicle visually and aurally, at an appropriate distance before encountering the corresponding road aberrations. The final aim is to bring about a change in the current road safety paradigm by providing a more efficient and ergonomic electronic alternative to static road signs. In addition to reducing dependency on road signs, the device will also aid in averting accidents and traffic jams, and in better implementing traffic law and order.

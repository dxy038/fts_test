Stockbridge dampers, which consist of a clamp, a messenger cable, and two attached masses, have been successfully used throughout the world for many decades to provide additional damping to transmission-line conductors and reduce aeolian vibration amplitudes. An alternative damper, the Hydro-Que&#769;bec damper, has a rotational joint with elastomer cylinders to provide stiffness and damping. The objective of this study is to develop a nonlinear model for both types of dampers that predicts their dynamic response for all expected amplitudes and frequencies. These models are built from simple experimental characterization tests to identify stiffness and damping properties. As a validation of the models, the force and phase shift with respect to frequency are obtained numerically and compared successfully to experimental results. These models will be fixed to a conductor model in Part II to predict aeolian vibration amplitudes of damped spans.

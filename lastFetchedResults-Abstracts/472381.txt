Recent data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-IIIB) suggest that detection and treatment of hypertension is improving, but only 27.4% of American hypertensives achieved controlled blood pressure ([BP] < 140 and < 90 mm Hg). Our objective was to assess the degree of BP control in a group of steelworkers and their families whose health care is financed by a large corporation.
A random sample of 792 adults (age > 18 years, average 55 ± 1 years, 50.4% male) was selected from a roster of patients who were known (from claims data) to have visited a physician in 1995 to 1996. Office charts were reviewed by trained nurses, who abstracted dates of 4095 visits, 3352 BP readings, and 3331 prescribed medications. Filled prescriptions were identified from 54,689 claims submitted for pharmacy services. Hypertension, defined (per NHANES) as more than one BP reading of 140/90 or higher, or taking antihypertensive medication, was found in 437 (55%). At least one antihypertensive medication was prescribed for 386 (88%) of the hypertensives; only 10 failed to have any prescription for antihypertensive medications filled. Controlled hypertension, as defined by Healthcare Employer Data Information Sheet (HEDIS) 3.0 (average BP < 140 and < 90 mm Hg in the office during a yearlong period of observation), was observed in 189 patients (43% of total sample, or 50% of the 382 with at least one recorded BP measurement).
These data suggest that in this population, insured by a jointly run employer-union health benefits plan, Healthy People 2000’s BP goal—at least 50% of hypertensives having BP under control by the turn of the century—may be achieved ahead of schedule.

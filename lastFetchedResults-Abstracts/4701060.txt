Due to the nonexistence of natural free-wheeling paths the commutation in matrix converters is more complicated than in voltage source converters. For bidirectional switches where the current flow is controllable separately for both directions this paper proposes new commutation strategies. Based on the measurement of the current direction and the signs of the line to line input voltages commutation in one step is enabled. Compared to multistepped proposals this strategy presents a much smaller deadtime near the switching time.

Objective
m of this study was to investigate the effects of PRP on SAOS-2 cells in terms of cytokine expression, cell activity and oxidative stress.

ine SAOS-2 (1 × 105 cells/mL) were grown in culture medium α-MEM with 10% FBS for 24 h and stimulated (or not) with PRP at concentrations of 3, 10 and 20%, LPS (E. coli, 10 g/mL) and IL-1β (1 mg/mL) for 24 h. The supernatant was collected and analyzed for the expression of cytokines in a panel array, ALP using a commercial kit and NO2− with Griess reaction method. Also, the cells were analyzed using Western blot for RANKL and slot blotting for nitrotyrosine expression.

were no significant differences amongst the groups in terms of NO2−, protein nitrotyrosine content and RANKL expression. However, all stimuli increased ALP activity and in case of PRP, it was in a dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.001). Also, all stimuli induced an increase in cytokines and chemokines expression, but only PRP promoted an increase of component C5, sICAM-1 and RANTES expression. Whilst IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) expression was down-regulated by PRP, both LPS and IL-1β caused up-regulation of this cytokine.
sions
n stimulate osteoblast activity and cytokine/chemokine release, as well as indicate some of the mediators that can (and cannot) be involved in this activation.

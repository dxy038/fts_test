Objective: This study reports the effect of radial artery harvesting on forearm blood flow in operated patients.
Materials and Methods: Thirty patients who had radial artery grafts taken and used for myocardial revascularization were selected. Brachial, ulnar and right radial artery diameters and blood flow velocity and resistance index (RI) were measured using plus-wave color Doppler.
Results: Mean diameter and blood flow velocity of the left ulnar and brachial arteries were consistently greater then right forearm (p<0.05). Also RI for above arteries was reduced significantly as compared to right (p<0.05) side.
Conclusion: Harvesting of radial artery does not affect forearm blood flow to a clinically significant degree. Compensatory increase of ulnar blood flow is adequate to meet the physiologic demands of hands.

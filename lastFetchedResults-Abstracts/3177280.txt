Delivering digital video content with enhanced quality of experience to the end users over error-prone multi-hop wireless networks is a challenging issue. In video transmission over such wireless networks, many network-based (packet loss, delay etc.) and source-based (encoding quantization level etc.) parameters can impair the perceived video quality. In a video quality enhancement strategy, accurate video quality metrics play a crucial role in the designing process of optimal rate (bandwidth) allocation algorithms. Many cross-layer optimization (CLO) based rate allocation strategies have been developed for this purpose which consider different objective functions (congestion level, total packet loss etc.) in wireless networks. The main contributions of the proposed work are twofold. At first, an optimal bandwidth allocation framework is being developed in which based on some network-specific constraints and by incorporating an accurate video quality metric, the total weighted quality of experience of some competing video sources is being optimized bases on cross-layer design techniques. Secondly, these optimal rates have been used for differentiated Quality of Experience (QoE) enforcement between multiple competing video sources. The resulting optimal rates can be used as rate-feedbacks for on-line rate adaptation of a moderate video encoder such as MPEG4. The aforementioned weight parameters are selected based on the importance of each video sequenceÂ´s quality and can be associated with some previous service level agreement (SLA) based prices. Some numerical analysis have been presented to validate the theoretical results and to verify the claims.

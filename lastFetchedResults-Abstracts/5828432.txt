Tracheal stenosis is a condition where the diameter size of trachea wall decreases and leads to the obstruction of the breathing airflow. Investigation on the effect of the stenosis to the airflow pattern in the trachea and main bronchi is the objective for this study. CT-scan images of two airways models were modeled, one with the stenosis and one without. Numerical solution was used to study the airway pattern inside the airway. Different boundary conditions of inspirations flow rate were applied; 15 l/min, 60 l/min and 100l/min where the ratio for the right main bronchus is 55% and for the left main bronchus is 45%. The results showed that the pressure drop inside the stenosis model is higher compared to that of healthy model. The pressure drop was also shown to interrupt the inlet condition into the main bronchi.

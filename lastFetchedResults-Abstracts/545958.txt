Technique of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) involves methods conducted for desirable
objective management of Decision Making Unit (DMU) that is same increasing of efficiency level.
Data envelopment analysis furthermore determines the efficiency level, provides situation, removes
inefficiency with evaluated benchmarking information. In this paper the use of the improvement
Least-Distance measure with relation previous model by coplanar DMU, is proposed for
computational dissipation at assess distance on these interior combinations, for determination the
shortest projection from a considered unit to the strongly efficient production frontier. Therefore locate
nearest path to improvement efficiency the evaluated DMU.

AbstractObjectives
e level 1 evidence demonstrating a survival benefit of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in well-selected patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in the cytokine era, its role in the contemporary period of targeted therapy remains understudied. To help facilitate improved patient selection for CN and clinical trial design in the targeted therapy era, this study sought to identify factors associated with RCC-specific survival in patients diagnosed with mRCC and undergoing CN between 2005 and 2010 using a large population-based cohort.
als and methods
ts diagnosed with mRCC and undergoing CN between 2005 and 2010 were identified from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer database. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate disease-specific survival. Stepwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with risk of RCC-specific death.
s
l of 2,478 patients were identified who were eligible for analysis with a median disease-specific survival of 21 months (95% CI: 19, 22). Factors independently associated with an increased risk of RCC-specific death included age at diagnosis≥60 years, African American race, higher American Joint Committee on Cancer T stage (≥T3), high Fuhrman nuclear grade (3 or 4), primary tumor size≥7 cm, regional lymphadenopathy, both distant lymph node and visceral metastases, and sarcomatoid histology. A higher number of adverse factors correlated with an increased risk of RCC-specific death (P&lt;0.001).
sions
s associated with RCC-specific survival identified in this large population-based study can be used to better stratify patients suitable for CN and to help with future clinical trial design and interpretation.

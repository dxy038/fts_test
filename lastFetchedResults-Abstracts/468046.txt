OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms that play a role in intrauterine death in monochorionic twins and that contribute to the high perinatal mortality and morbidity in the survivors.
STUDY DESIGN: In 8 monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated by the intrauterine death of a single twin, we took samples from 5 twin fetuses immediately before death and from 4 of their cotwins and also from 4 surviving fetuses within 24 hours after death of the cotwin.
RESULTS: Four of the 5 fetuses sampled who subsequently died were acidemic and 3 were hypoxemic. None of these fetuses or their cotwins were anemic at that time. All 4 survivors sampled within 24 hours of the death of each cotwin had low hematocrits.
CONCLUSION: Fetal anemia, probably the consequence of acute blood loss just before the time of death of the cotwin, may play a role in the high mortality and morbidity found in the surviving twin. It is unlikely that immediate delivery of the surviving twin after death could affect the outcome. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:800-3.)

Background: Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum - graecum L.) is an annual medicinal plant belongs to the legume family and has anti-diabetic, anti-fertility, anticancer, anti-microbial, anti-parasitic and hypocholesterolaemic effects.
Objective: Evaluation of growth and trigonelline /mucilage content in fenugreek under application of plant growth regulators (PGR).
Methods: The experiment was conducted on randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) with 13 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments were consist of control (distilled water application), Giberrellic Acid (GA3) 25 and 50 ppm and Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) 25 and 50 ppm (for each concentration by soaking the seeds before planting, spray after planting, and soaking seeds before planting with spray after planting).
Results: Application of plant growth regulators significantly increased trigonelline and mucilage content of seed, shoots and pods dry weight per plant and 1000-seed weight. Application of plant growth regulators had no significant effect on the SPAD value. Mean comparisons showed that the highest shoot dry weight was related to NAA, GA3 50 ppm (soaking seeds before planting with spray after planting), and also the highest pods dry weight, 1000-seed weight, mucilage and trigonelline content of seeds were obtained from GA3 50 ppm (soaking the seeds before planting with spray after planting).
Conclusion: Application of GA3 50 ppm as the soaking seeds before planting with spray after planting are effective to obtain maximum trigonelline and mucilage content in fenugreek.

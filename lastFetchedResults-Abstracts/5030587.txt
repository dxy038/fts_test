In telecommunication, Intersymbol interference (ISI) is caused by multipath propagation. The bandlimited frequency selective time dispersive channel distorts the transmitted signal, causing successive symbols to blur together. Therefore, the main objective of designing the transmitter and receiver is to minimize the effects of intersymbol interference, and thereby deliver the digital data to its destination with the smallest error rate possible. In this paper Adaptive Equalization technique is used to combat intersymbol interference. The proposed model is synthesized with ISE, simulated with Modelsim and implemented on Virtex2 based xc2v1500-5bg575 target device. The result shows that proposed model has the advantages of reduction in ISI using simple and less computational complex LMS algorithm along with enhanced performance in terms of speed, cost and area with existing results.

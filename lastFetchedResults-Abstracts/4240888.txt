In recent years, body-centric wireless communications have become an active area of research because of their various applications. Whereas UHF bands are subjects of great interest especially in Europe, relatively low frequency bands like HF bands have been used especially in Japan and Korea. Thus, all of the prospective frequencies are in an extremely wide range. Our target is to bring objective and unified idea on the frequency characteristics of body-centric wireless communication channels. In this paper, we have numerically observed the open voltage at several receiving antennas. Furthermore, we have examined several body postures and surrounding environments.

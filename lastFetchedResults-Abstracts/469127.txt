Objective
The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics of women with obstetric vesicovaginal fistulas at a hospital in north central Nigeria.
Study design
A retrospective record review was conducted of all women who were seen with vesicovaginal fistulas at Evangel Hospital in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria, between January 1992 and June 1999.
Results
A total of 932 fistula cases were identified, of which 899 cases (96.5%) were associated temporally with labor and delivery. The “typical patient” was small and short (44 kg and <150 cm); had been married early (15.5 years) but was now divorced or separated; was uneducated, poor, and from a rural area; had developed her fistula as a primigravida during a labor that lasted at least 2 days and which resulted in a stillborn fetus.
Conclusion
Obstetric vesicovaginal fistula is extremely common in north central Nigeria. A complex interaction that involves multiple biologic and socioeconomic factors appears to predispose young women to this devastating childbirth injury.

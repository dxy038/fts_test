Special nuclear material in long-term storage in a vault is an attractive target for a diverter. A shelf-monitor system has been designed that will enable constant surveillance of this material using a variety of sensors. A single-component microcomputer collects data from a GM tube that monitors gamma emissions and from a scale that monitors the total weight of the container and contents. A network of the microcomputer shelf monitors reports the acquired data to a minicomputer for analysis, alarm if necessary, and storage. The objective of this research program has been to develop a reliable, inexpensive monitor network and associated data processing equipment capable of real-time monitoring.

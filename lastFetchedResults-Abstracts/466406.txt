Objective: Our goal was to investigate the short-term and intermediate effects of low-dose hormone replacement therapy on echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function in healthy postmenopausal women. Study Design: In a prospective, controlled study 30 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age, 52 ± 3 years) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Women in the hormone replacement therapy group (n = 15) received 1 mg micronized 17β-estradiol daily sequentially combined with 5 or 10 mg dydrogesterone for 14 days of each 28-day cycle during 12 months and thereafter 2 mg 17β-estradiol combined with 10 mg dydrogesterone for a period of 3 months. The control group (n = 15) received no treatment. M-mode, quantitative 2-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline and within the 17β-estradiol phase at 3, 12, and 15 months. Results: After 12 months significant differences in change between the 2 groups were found for left ventricular end-diastolic and left ventricular end-systolic diameters, left ventricular mass index, and stroke volume index. These differences were caused by changes in the control group rather than in the hormone replacement therapy group, in which no significant within-group changes were found. All other parameters measured showed no effect. Conclusion: Within 15 months of 17β-estradiol and dydrogesterone treatment no clinically relevant differences were found in the M-mode, quantitative 2-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic parameters measured in this study. It is suggested that 15 months of treatment probably is too short a period for detection of direct effects on the heart itself. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:910-6.)

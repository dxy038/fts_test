The explosive growth of information in recent years has brought up a new question/challenge of disseminating information from a huge plethora of data. This has led to an upscale development of interest in Data warehousing. Different indexing techniques have been developed which are being used for fast data retrieval in Data warehouse environment, but it is quite difficult to find an appropriate technique for a specific query type. So an investigation is needed to find an indexing technique for a specific query type. The objective of this paper is to compare indexing technique and to identify the factors which are to be considered in selecting a proper indexing technique for data warehouse applications, and to evaluate indexing techniques on the basis of different types of data warehouse queries. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of three data warehouse queries with three different indexing techniques and to observe the impact of variable size data with respect to time and space complexity.

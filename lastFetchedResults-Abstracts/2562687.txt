In doing so, it first represents each principle in the words of some trainers to provide the ground for better understanding of that principle. Then, it brings forth the Islamic view on that principle. One of the most important results of this paper is that Islam’s moral substance involves concerning the principles of moral upbringing. Also, without restricting the Islam’s principles of moral upbringing to a few number of principles, this paper proves that Islam focuses on four principles: compatibility of means and ends; complete commitment to moral behavior, observance of individual differences; subjective and objective reflection of morality.

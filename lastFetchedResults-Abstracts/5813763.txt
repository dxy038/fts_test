Summary form only given. Security handles in an active mode properties that bad things from happening. There is no space for risks. A password should not be broken. In social systems the exploration of the "unknown" is the main objective, i.e. find a new friend or better offer. From a security point of view, there are no security properties known. The participant runs a risk. Risks are a source of progress, because something "Good" should happen. Resilience incorporates risk and specifies alternative paths, if a risk situation occurs. Resilience has many traces of security events, and can be specified for each of them, but not yet for the interrelationship. The acceptable traces are a member of the resilience set.

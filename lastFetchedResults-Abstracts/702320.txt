After an overview about the criteria of odour nuisance in different technical laws, about electronic noses analysers and about dynamic olfactometry, in the present paper the authors describe an application of dynamic olfactometry in combination with the determinations of electronic noses. The coordination of the two approaches permits optimisation of the advantages offered by both methods to the measurable and objective evaluation of the odour nuisance from waste treatment plants and chemical plants.

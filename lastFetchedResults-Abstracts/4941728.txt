This paper proposed multi-objective fuzzy particle swarm optimization (MOFPSO) for the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) generation system. The PEM fuel cell generation system efficiency decreases as its output power increases. Thus, an optimum efficiency should exist and should result in a cost-effective PEM fuel cell generation system. In the optimization approach, the efficient and economic aspects are considered simultaneously. MOFPSO algorithm is used to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the aforementioned objective functions. The performance of the proposed optimizer is demonstrated under various operating conditions. Both experimental and simulation results show the optimizer works well.

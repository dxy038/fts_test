A total of 20 patients of Duane's syndrome were identified and were followed-up for 40 days. A separate performa was used for every patient, which included detailed history, preoperative assessment and postoperative follow-up.Results:- Out of 20 patients 15 were female and 5 were male. Their ages ranged between 5-25 years. Horizontal rectus recession was performed on all of them. The postoperative ocular alignment was between 4-8Â°.

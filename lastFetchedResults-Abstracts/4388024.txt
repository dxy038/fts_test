The availability of an objective clinical evaluation in the diagnosis and monitoring of parkinson´s disease is a primary importance objective in neurology. Furthermore, in many patients next to resting tremor typical of the disease are also found other types of tremor as kinetic and postural tremor so making the diagnosis difficult. The ability to classify the different types of tremor specific for each patient through an examination of the instrumental, non-invasive and very simple and fast is a great tool to aid the clinical diagnosis of the disease. Our system meets the above requirements. It consists of an inertial sensor that allows the acquisition of the quantities of interest, and by a series of algorithms able to provide an objective and quantitative assessment of the type and severity of tremor in patients with Parkinson´s disease. The availability of an objective report on the severity of the disorder developed according to a strict correlation with the valuation provided by the UPDRS scale is a good starting point towards the personalization of care as well as being a useful tool in the analysis of the course of the disease.

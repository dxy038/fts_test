The energy regenerative system of the burden vehicle based on hydraulic accumulator has arousing a wide attention because of its particular higher power density in recent years. Taking hydraulic hybrid vehicle as a study object and the speed following of the secondary component (hydraulic motor mode) as the control objective, the state space math model of the electrical-hydraulic control system has been established in this paper. The math model of the control system imported the quadratic optimal control theory or not has been simulated and analyzed all alone. The results of simulation showed that the vibration and overshoot of the response course of the control system obtained inhibited and attenuated largely when the system imported the quadratic optimal control theory and the control system behaved a better response performance at the same time. Besides that the response performance of this control system behaves well or not has a close relationship to the value of the parameter Q and R of the weighted matrix.

Grids are a form of distributed computing whereby a ´super virtual computer´ is composed of many networked loosely coupled computers acting together to perform very large tasks. This technology has been applied to computationally intensive scientific, mathematical and academic problems through volunteer computing, and it is used in commercial enterprises for many diverse applications. Computational grid provides resource sharing through multiinstitutional virtual organizations for dynamic problem solving. Load balancing is an important property in grid computing as the load scenarios of individual grid resources are dynamic in nature. In order to make computational grids more effective and reliable, balanced load across the grid is necessary. The objective of this paper is to review different existing load balancing algorithms or techniques applicable in grid computing. This paper also proposes an algorithm to solve the prevailing problem of dynamic load balancing with respect to deadline of job submitted by the clients.

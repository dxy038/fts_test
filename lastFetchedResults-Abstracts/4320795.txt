An EDFA involves the use of Single Mode Fibers (SMFs) and Erbium Doped Fibers (EDFs). Studies have indicated that the splicing of an SMF to another SMF is less sensitive to fusion splicing parameters, if they are selected within an appropriate range. However, splicing of dissimilar fibers such as an SMF to an EDF poses a new set of requirements on the splicing specifications. Due to the variation in physical properties of the two fibers, the splice loss between them is much higher compared with that between SMF-SMF. The objective of this research endeavor was to develop a systematic procedure to minimize the losses between an EDF and an SMF. Relevant splicing parameters were identified through statistically designed experiments. Significant parameters were screened out and their interactions studied. The experimental results are discussed. Through this research effort, a systematic procedure for evaluating an EDF and identifying the parameters that could be used for a specific batch of fibers was developed. Guidelines for the characterization process are also discussed.

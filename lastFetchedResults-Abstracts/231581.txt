The objective of the work of the Activity was to develop and assess new cultural techniques in short rotation forestry(SRF), and to investigate factors affecting yield optimisation. Nine countries participated in the work (Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, UK, USA and CEC). The high level of interest in the work of the activity is a reflection of the increasing importance of short rotation forestry, particularly coppice, in many of the participating countries where it is being used to produce heat or electricity.
The main elements of the work involved: • • Collection of information on SRF cultural treatments• • Collection of data on yield, spacing and rotation length• • Collection of data on costs of production and economic analysis of short rotation coppice production systems• • Revision of the production systems handbook• • Development of a coppice decision support system which articulates with a computerised information system for SRF production.• • Liaison has been maintained with the other Task VIII activities concerned with short rotation forestry and the Mechanisation Activity of Task IX.
Data has been collected from many of the participating countries on the relationship between clone/site/spacing/cutting cycles. Similarly, data has been collected on the economics of SRF production systems. This information has been analysed and the results presented.
The Production Systems Handbook has been updated with information provided by the participating countries. Significant advances have been made in Sweden where most of the short rotation forestry for energy is grown, around 11,000 hectares currently.
A computerised version of the Production Systems Handbook has been produced. This information system has been developed using spreadsheets and utilises Visual Basic to run the program and provide a User interface with the underlying information and data on yield and economics.

This paper describes a mixed-integer linear programming optimal power flow. The objective function consists of minimizing transmission losses and generator reactive outputs. The problem constraints are the power flow equations and the bounds of the power system variables (generator reactive outputs, bus voltages, transformer taps and branch power flows). The proposed method is an iterative process that linearizes in each iteration both the objective function and the constraints. In addition, the objective function is represented by a set of tangent cuts. The discrete nature of shunt reactors and capacitors is modeled by integer variables. The performance of the method is illustrated in an actual scenario of the Spanish power system

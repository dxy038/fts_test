The estimation of field resistance of potato cultivars to
Phytophthora infestans are usually carried out in expensive
and time consuming field experiments over several
years. Therefore, a procedure is required for the fast and
objective determination of qualitative and quantitative
field resistance of new cultivars. This study correlated
level of field resistance to P. infestans in leaf discs or
leaflets of various potato cultivars to characteristic changes
of Chlorophyll-a fluorescence (CF) parameters F^,
(maximal fluorescence) and F^. (maximal variable fluorescence).
Two different inocula, both containing virulence
genes 1-11 were tested. The results were achieved
when leaf discs from greenhouse or field plants were
each inoculated with a P. infestans spore suspension and
incubated for 24 h. In field measurements, comparable
results were obtained 48 h after inoculation. The estimation
of field resistance by measuring specific CF parameters
could be an economical and rapid procedure to
reduce or substitute visual lesion assessment for determining
cultivar field resistance.

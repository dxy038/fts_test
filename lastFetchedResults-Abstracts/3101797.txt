This paper analyzed the shortages of S/KEY OTP system in mobile commerce identity authentication and suggested an improved one-time password system based on bidirectional virtual authorization in mobile application systems. On one hand, this suggestion can reduce the calculation stress of both client and server, accordingly increases the efficiency of authorization and withstands the DoS attack. On the other hand, the suggestion can implement the bidirectional authorization and reduce the possibility of fishing attack.

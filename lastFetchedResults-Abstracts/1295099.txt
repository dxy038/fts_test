A fleet sizing problem arising in anchor handling operations related to movement of offshore mobile units is presented in this paper. Typically, the intensity of these operations is unevenly spread throughout the year. The operations are performed by dedicated vessels, which can be hired either on the long-term basis or on the spot market. Spot rates are frequently a magnitude higher than long-term rates, and vessels are hired on the spot market if there is a shortage of long-term vessels to cover the ongoing anchor handling operations. Deciding the cost-optimal fleet of vessels on the long-term hire to cover future operations is a problem facing offshore oil and gas operators. This decision has a heavy economic impact as anchor handling vessels are among the most expensive ones. The problem is highly stochastic because durations of anchor handling operations vary and depend on uncertain weather conditions. Moreover, future spot rates for anchor handling vessels are extremely volatile. The objective of this paper is to describe a simulation model for the fleet sizing problem. The study was initiated by the largest Norwegian offshore oil and gas operator and has received considerable acceptance among the planners.

This work deals with the differential-evolution (DE)-based method for simultaneous identification of the electric, magnetic, and mechanical subsystem parameters of a line-start interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (LSIPMSM). The parameters are determined in the optimization procedure using the dynamic model of the LSIPMSM; the time behavior of voltages, currents, and speed measured on the tested LSIPMSM; and the DE, which is applied as the optimization tool. During the optimization procedure, the DE changes the parameters of the LSIPMSM dynamic model in such a way that the differences between the measured and calculated time behaviors of individual state variables are minimized. This paper focuses on the objective function definition, the constraint settings for individual parameters, the normalization of parameters, and, above all, the test and measurement procedures performed on the LSIPMSM, which all together make it possible to determine the LSIPMSM dynamic model parameters valid for a broad range of operation, thus ensuring proper evaluation of the LSIPMSMÂ´s line-starting capability. Some of the LSIPMSM parameters that can be determined by finite-element analysis and experimental methods are compared to the values obtained by the DE, thus validating the DE-based approach.

Urban terrain is complex and they present a very challenging and difficult environment for simulating virtual forces as well as for rendering. The objective of this work is to research on binary space partition technique (BSP) for modeling urban terrain environments. BSP is a method for recursively subdividing a space into convex sets by hyper-planes. This subdivision gives rise to a representation of the scene by means of a tree data structure known as a BSP tree. Originally, this approach was proposed in 3D computer graphics to increase the rendering efficiency. Some other applications include performing geometrical operations with shapes (constructive solid geometry) in CAD, collision detection in robotics and 3D computer games, and other computer applications that involve handling of complex spatial scenes.

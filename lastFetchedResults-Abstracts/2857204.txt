In this paper the authors propose new heuristics for automation of software partitioning and mapping onto heterogeneous multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) platform - Longest Parallel Path mapping algorithm (LPP). In contrast with traditional approach to solving this NP-complete problem - the Integer Linear Programming (ILP), our method uses a modified version of Critical Path Method with additional heuristics that rely on greedy approach. The algorithm performs one-to-many mapping of application to platform with minimizing the overall execution time of the application as the main objective. Our experiments with generic application model and several different platform layouts show that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient mapping scheme enabling significant execution speedup. In addition, the comparison with another greedy mapping algorithm shows that LPP algorithm exploits available task level parallelism better.

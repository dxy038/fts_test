Objective: Despite the fact that the ‎mobile phone has become a pervasive ‎technology of our time, little research ‎has been done on mobile dependency. ‎Therefore, a valid and reliable ‎instrument, conforming to Iranian ‎culture seems essential. The aim of our ‎study was to validate the Iranian version ‎of MPPUS (Mobile Phone Problematic ‎Use Scale).‎
Methods: This was a cross-sectional ‎research, in which data were collected ‎from 600 students studying at Tehran ‎universities.  Stratified sampling ‎method was used to collect data.  All ‎participants completed Demographic ‎Questionnaire, Cellular Phone ‎Dependency Questionnaire (CPDQ) ‎anonymously. Finally, a clinical ‎interview (based on DSM-IV-TR) was ‎conducted with 100 participants.  Data ‎were analyzed using concurrent validity, ‎factor analysis, internal consistency ‎‎(Cronbach's’?), split half, test-retest and ‎ROC Curve by SPSS18 Software‏.‏
Results: As a result of reliability ‎analysis and factor analysis by principal ‎component and Varimax rotation, we ‎extracted three factors including ‎preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms ‎and overuse of mobile phones in both ‎males and females. Internal ‎consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the ‎MPPUS was .91; Cronbach's alpha of ‎the factors was .87, .70, .82 ‎respectively. The test-retest correlation ‎of the MPPUS was .56. The best cut off ‎point for this questionnaire (MPPUS) ‎was 160‎‏.‏
Conclusion: The MPPUS proved to be ‎a reliable questionnaire with adequate ‎factor models to assess the extent of ‎problems caused by the “misuse” of ‎mobile phones in the Iranian society; ‎however, further studies are needed on ‎this topic.‎

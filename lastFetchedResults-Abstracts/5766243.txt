In this paper we describe the intelligent information systems that are used by the Dutch railway operator NS Reizigers for supporting its internal planning processes of generating efficient and robust duties for train drivers and guards. We focus on the TURNI system that provides real active support in creating such duties. The underlying model of the TURNI system is a set covering model with additional constraints, which is solved by applying dynamic column generation techniques, Lagrangean relaxation and powerful heuristics. We illustrate the use of the software and the underlying model by the Noord-Oost case which involves the scheduling of train drivers and guards for four interconnected Intercity lines of NS Reizigers. The Noord-Oost case was carried out with the objective to obtain an efficient schedule for the drivers and guards with a high robustness with respect to the transfer of delays of trains.

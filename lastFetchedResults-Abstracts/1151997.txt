The objective of the study hereby presented consisted on the analysis of different finishing milling strategies of a complex geometry part containing concave and convex surfaces. The machining quality was assessed through the comparison of surface roughness, surface texture and dimensional control parameters. Three typical milling strategies were studied: radial, raster and 3D offset. The tool-cutting parameters were maintained constant for all strategies tested. The 3D offset machining strategy evidenced to be the suitable one for the geometry model used within the study.

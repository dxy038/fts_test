The problem of cell sites planning in a given service area in LTE cellular networks is studied in this paper, the optimization objective of which is to minimize the power consumption of both users and cell sites under the constraint of cell load balancing. Non-uniform traffic distributions across the entire service area are considered. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which first works out a proper range of the optimal sites number, and then determines the cell sites locations for each number in the range by iteratively solving a convex problem to minimize the power consumption of both users and cell sites. The optimal cell sites number is the one with minimal power consumption and the locations are determined accordingly. An example scenario is presented to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

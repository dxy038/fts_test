A fully geometric and constitutive nonlinear model for the description of the dynamic behavior of beam structures is developed. The proposed formulation is based on the geometrically exact formulation for beams due to Simo but, in this article an intermediate curved reference configuration is considered. The resulting deformation map belongs to a nonlinear differential manifold and, therefore, an appropriated version of Newmarkâ€™s scheme is used in updating the kinematics variables. Each material point of the cross-section is assumed to be composed of several simple materials with their own constitutive laws. The mixing rule is used to describe the resulting composite. An explicit expression for the objective measure of the strain rate acting on each material point is deduced in this article. Details about its numerical implementation in the time-stepping scheme are also addressed. Viscosity is included at the constitutive level by means of a thermodynamically consistent visco damage model developed in terms of the material description of the First Piola Kirchhoff stress vector. The constitutive part of the tangent tensor is deduced including the effect of rate dependent inelasticity. Finally, several numerical examples, validating the proposed formulation, are given.

Hazardous materials incidents during transportation will lead to undesirable consequences for people and environment. An emergency response network is designing for offer quick arrival of specialized response teams at the accident site. The emergency response center location-routing problem is aim to decide where to open emergency response centers and maximize the ability to respond to such incidents in a region. To be more comprehensive and practical, based on the known maximal arc-covering model, adding time and cost to the objectives, a new multi-objective 0-1 integer linear programming model was proposed for the location-allocation problem in emergency response network design. The solving algorithm was designed by adopting multi-objective linear programming method. Finally, a computational example was experimented and analyzed to demonstrate the practical feasibilities of the model and algorithm.

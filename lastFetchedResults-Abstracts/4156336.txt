The extraction of sensitivity information from a clustered neuro-fuzzy model is addressed in this paper. Subsequently, this permits the application of deterministic methods on the approximated objective function, significantly improving the optimization process. Results from an analytical and a practical electromagnetic problem, which show the applicability of the formulation, are presented

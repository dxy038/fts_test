Frequent loss-of-function somatic mutations of the VHL gene have been detected in sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), indicating that inactivation of the VHL gene plays a critical role in RCC. In this study, we collected 35 archived Swedish sporadic RCCs identified from an epidemiological study on occupational exposure and kidney cancer to test how well stored pathological specimens could be retrieved and analyzed for VHL mutations. Thirty specimens were successfully analyzed with PCR-SSCP and sequencing. Aberrant SSCP bands were detected in 16 out of the 30 samples (53%). Sequencing analysis of the aberrant bands revealed seven deletions, one insertion, one base substitution on a splicing site, six missense mutations, one silent mutation and several base substitutions in the 5â€² non-coding region and intron 1. Most were novel somatic mutations that have not been reported in sporadic RCC. The mutations were found in three types of non-papillary RCC cases, i.e. 14 clear cells, one granular chromophilic and one sarcomatoid RCC. Interesting multiple mutations were found in three cases (5, 3, 2 mutations, respectively).

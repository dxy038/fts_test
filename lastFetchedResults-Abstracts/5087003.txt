The objective of this study is to propose a low cost scalable architecture for embedded applications, using pools of personal computers for high performance storage, retrieval and processing of information through the study of traces and real solutions for companies operating in this niche market. By predictable intelligence (Box-Jenkins) itÂ´s possible to predict the future behavior of the application and make adjustments to keep the deadlines of the different classes of information.

We present a robust algorithm to synchronize, under the master/slave configuration, a class of piecewise linear chaotic systems known as Sprott circuits. The synchronization objective is to obtain identical synchronization between the master and slave systems in spite of the existence of external perturbations and parametric variations. The sliding control technique is used to design the coupling signal. This discontinuous controller renders the closed loop system robust with respect to matched bounded disturbances and to terms produced by parametric variations. The performance of the proposed controlled synchronization is illustrated numerically and experimentally.

In this paper we propose a multi-objective optimal routing protocol named Multi-path load balancing protocol (MLBP), which uses hop count and load (link loss rate) as optimal objectives and combines distributed algorithm with centralized algorithm. MLBP uses multi-path routing algorithm to get multiple separate paths while the smallest hop count is guaranteed and monitors link loss rate with passive network tomography technologies. Source node distributes traffic according to link loss rate in order to achieve load balancing. Local repair technique is used to gain a new link for replacing the link whose packet loss rate is higher than detection threshold. Protocol is simulated with NS2 and the results show that our algorithm can balance network load effectively and cut down the routing overhead simultaneously.

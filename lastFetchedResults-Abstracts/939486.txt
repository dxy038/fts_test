A mixture of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (CP) (Telone C35) is an
increasingly used fumigant product for pre-plant soil fumigation in California, USA.
Atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds, including these important
pesticides, is more heavily regulated in an effort to improve air-quality. Research has
identified various methods of reducing fumigant emissions but effective and economically
feasible field methods are still needed. The objective of this field study was to determine the
effectiveness of several surface seal and soil treatment methods on emissions of 1,3-D and
CP from shank-injected Telone C35. Treatments included control (bare surface), preirrigation
(irrigation prior to fumigation), post-fumigation water seals with or without
potassium thiosulfate (KTS) amendment, and standard high density polyethylene (HDPE)
tarp over soils amended with either KTS or composted manure. The two KTS treatments
resulted in the lowest fumigant emissions; but the soil surface in the treatments developed
a reddish-orange color and an unpleasant odor that lasted for a few months. The preirrigation
reduced emissions more than post-application water seals. An application of
composted manure at 12.4 Mg haâˆ’ 1 spread over the soil surface followed by HDPE tarp did
not reduce 1,3-D emissions compared to the bare soils in this trial, indicating that a better
understanding of processes is required in order to effectively use organic amendments for
minimizing fumigant emissions. Chloropicrin emissions were generally lower than 1,3-D for
all treatments.

This paper presents an optimization technique of the resonant controller based on the minimization of an objective function through the Nelder-Mead method. This function allows to evaluate the behavior of the system in steady state and transient conditions. The optimized controller has been compared with the Naslin polynomial based one. The results show that by means of the optimization technique it is possible to achieve better performances also in presence of harmonics the control system has not been designed for.

At first, all patients completed the questionnaire of demographic information, and then they were evaluated by the Fatigue Severity Scale (Fatigue Severity Scale), depression, anxiety, Stress Scale (depression, anxiety, stress scale-21) and Quality of Life questionnaire (Short Form-36). 
Results: Correlational analyses indicated a significant association between fatigue severity and patient's age, depression, anxiety and stress (p < 0.05) and quality of life (p < 0.01), While there were no significant relations between fatigue severity and duration of MS. The results of multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that only the factor of quality of life as a selected variable in final model could explain 27% of the shared variance of fatigue severity results (p=0.002).

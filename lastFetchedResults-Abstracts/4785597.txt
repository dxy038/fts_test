This paper describes the formulation and application of a multilayer multiobjective genetic algorithm (MLMOGA) in the robust controller design. The MLMOGA is developed based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm formulated by Fonseca and Fleming (1993). A brief introduction of the H<sup>&#8734;</sup> loop shaping design procedure is included. A design example is presented to illustrate the capability of the MLMOGA to design robust control systems.

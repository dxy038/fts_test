Due to the scarcity of resources, it is essential to identify the industrial priorities. The main objective of this study is to rank the industrial sectors. To this end two types of economic and non-economic factors were selected to rank industrial activities based on International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC-3). AHP technique was applied to analyze the research data. Consequently, the highest and lowest rank among the 61 industrial activities were (code 269 of ISIC-3) and (code 231 of ISIC-3) respectively. These industrial alternatives may lead to the future industrial policies.

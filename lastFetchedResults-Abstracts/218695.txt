Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in women worldwide especially in developing countries. There is limited number of literature available on factors associated with the relapse of TB and very few studies on gender differences in this regard. This study aimed to compare the factors associated with the relapse of TB in males and females.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the medical department of Civil Hospital in Hyderabad from August 2008 to November 2008. A total of 100 consecutive patients of any age or gender, diagnosed with relapse of TB who had positive sputum smear after completion of a standard course of anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) were included in this study. Those with newly diagnosed tuberculosis and cases of treatment failure or treatment defaulters were excluded from the study. Demographic variables, factors associated with the previous TB infection and underlying medical conditions were among the variables compared in both sexes.
Results: The mean age of patients was 36.84±17.40 years in males and 36.21±16.41 years in females. There were 38 females and 62 males. Among the factors associated with the relapse of TB, there were statistically significant differences between males and females in regard to addiction (p=0.01), employment (p<0.001), weight gain (p=0.01) and mean hemoglobin value (p=0.05).
Conclusion: Further studies with larger sample sizes are required for evaluation and comparison of factors associated with the reactivation of TB in males and females. This would provide solutions for TB control agencies in the future.

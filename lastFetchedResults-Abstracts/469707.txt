Objective
This study was undertaken to explore the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and serologic markers of periodontitis and preterm birth (PTB).
Study design
We compared women with a singleton gestation giving birth before the 37th week (cases, n = 83) with term delivery controls (n = 120). Periodontal examination and collection of dental plaque and blood samples were performed within 48 hours after delivery. Microbial levels and maternal immunoglobulin G titers to oral bacteria were analyzed. Multivariate regression models were fitted controlling for common covariates.
Results
Cases showed greater mean attachment loss (1.7 vs 1.5 mm, P = .003) and higher prevalence of periodontitis (30.1% vs 17.5%, P = .027). No differences in microbial or serum antibody levels were detected between the groups. Logistic regression revealed that PTB was associated with attachment loss (adjusted odds ratio: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.01-7.54). Linear regression indicated a significant (P = .04) association between attachment loss and low birth weight (LBW).
Conclusion
The data support the notion that periodontitis is independently associated with PTB and LBW.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of constipation symptoms and anal incontinence with vaginal wall and pelvic organ descent in a general gynecologic population.
Study design
In this multicenter, cross-sectional study, 1004 women attending routine gynecologic healthcare underwent pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POPQ) measurements, and were surveyed regarding anal incontinence, digitation, <2 bowel movements (BMs)/week, and >25% frequency of: straining, hard/lumpy stools, and incomplete emptying. Constipation scores reflected the sum of positive responses. Associations between POPQ measurements (Ba, C, Bp, gh+pb), constipation scores, and anal incontinence were evaluated using multivariable regression.
Results
Of 119 women with Bp ≥−1.00, 47% reported no constipation symptoms. Hard/lumpy stools (26%), incomplete emptying (24%), and straining (24%) were more prevalent; fewer women reported <2 BMs/week (15%) or digitation (7%). Constipation scores were weakly correlated with Bp, gh+pb (both r < .1, P< .02). Women reporting ≥2 symptoms had greater gh+pb measurements than women reporting 0 or 1 symptom (P = .03). Women with anal incontinence had greater gh+pb and gh values than women without anal incontinence (P< .01). POPQ measurements were regressed separately onto (1) total constipation scores, (2) dichotomized scores, and (3) individual symptoms, with BMI, age, number of vaginal deliveries (NVD), weight of largest vaginal delivery (WLVD), race, hysterectomy, study site, and income included as covariates. Total constipation scores and dichotomized scores were nonsignificant in all models. With regard to individual symptoms, straining at stool was significant in the models for Ba and gh+pb, with greater Ba and gh+pb measurements among strainers relative to nonstrainers.
Conclusion
Most associations between bowel symptoms and vaginal or pelvic organ descent were weak. After controlling for important covariates, straining at stool remained associated with anterior vaginal wall and perineal descent.

In this paper, the newly-developed space systems engineering education tool &#8220;classroom pico-satellite HEPTA&#8221; is introduced. The objective of this pico-satellite HEPTA kit is easy to understand space systems engineering by using low-cost component over a short amount of time. It is based on former CubeSat development experience at Nihon University, SEEDS and SPROUT. This kit can provide learning opportunity to large number of students with varied background. The minute detail of HEPTA kit of hardware &amp; software and outline of the hands-on training is introduced in this paper.

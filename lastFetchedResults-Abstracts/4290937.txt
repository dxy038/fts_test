This paper addresses the optimization of voltage control in distribution systems in the presence of distributed generation. The objective is minimizing the voltage deviations at the load nodes with respect to specified reference values. The optimization is solved by means of a new approach based on nested evolutionary programming. Results are shown on a test system including controls at the HV/MV and MV/LV substations, and voltage-controlled local generation sources.

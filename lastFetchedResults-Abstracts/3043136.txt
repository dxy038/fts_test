The objective of this survey is to characterize personal magnetic field exposure of the general population in Korea. The participants of the survey on magnetic field exposure were selected randomly, by occupation. The participant wore the magnetic field meter for about 25-28 hours and the data were stored in the meter. In this first step survey, the number of participant is 244 and the second step, about 400 subjects is surveyed in the near future. The statistics of the 24-hour exposure data are the major concern of this survey. However the survey provided the opportunity to analyze exposures corresponding to different types of activities. It was analyzed by the separating periods of time corresponding to the following activities: entire 24-hour period, in bed, at work and by occupation. Therefore the database will be established to analyze the status of personal magnetic field exposure and safety.

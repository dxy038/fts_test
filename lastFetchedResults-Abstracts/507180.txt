Objective
Assessment of risk predictors for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 1 year of age in term and near-term infants.
Material & Methods
This case-control study was a representative sample of infants from different health-care centers of north and east of Tehran. The association between
risk factors and delayed motor development (developmental quotient below 70 indicating a significant delay) was analyzed using correlating risk factors;
including the perinatal and neonatal data to the developmental status. The case group consisted of 143 infants whose DQ score was less than 70 and the
control group consisted of 140 infants who had a DQ score of more than 70.
Results
Neonatal seizures, Apgar score less than 3 after 5 minutes of birth (OR = 2.87 [95% CI; 1.68, 4.92]), low birth weight (OR = 5.86 [95% CI; 3.07, 11.18]), preterm
delivery (OR =6.17 [95% CI; 3.04, 12.52]), Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) > 24 hours (OR = 6.18[95% CI; 2.07, 18.51]) and hyperbilirubinemia
leading to phototherapy or exchange transfusion (OR =3.75 [95% CI; 2.12, 6.65]) were associated with an increased risk for neuromotor delay on developmental
examination at 1 year.
Conclusion
This study identified distinct risk factors for an adverse outcome in infants. In this environment, perinatal risk predictors are most important.

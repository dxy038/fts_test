In this letter, a planar elliptical metal antenna (PEMA) is proposed for wideband applications. To predict the lower cutoff frequency of the antenna, a modified formula is reported. A shorting strip is introduced as a top inductive load to reduce the size of the antenna. Also, a modified coplanar waveguide (CPW) line is designed to feed the antenna. The impedance bandwidth for |S<sub>11</sub>| &lt;; 10 dB of the shorted PEMA exhibits from 0.81 to 40 GHz. The proposed antenna yields bidirectional radiation pattern in E- and H-plane. Various characteristics of the proposed antenna are studied using commercial software CST Studio. The simulated and measured reflection coefficients are in good agreement.

Background
The treatment strategy of acute intramural hematoma involving the ascending aorta remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical treatment for this condition.
Methods

A total of 41 patients underwent operation for acute intramural hematoma involving the ascending aorta between 2000 and 2006. Mean age was 67.2 ± 10.1 years, with 26 female patients and 10 in cardiogenic shock at presentation. Early and midterm results, including mortality, morbidity, survival, event-free rates, and the persistence of residual hematoma, were analyzed retrospectively in all patients. Mean follow-up period was 29.7 ± 18.1 months.
Results

All but one patient underwent operation within 72 hours from the onset of symptoms. Thirty-four patients underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement, three had hemiarch repair, and four required total arch replacement. There were no in-hospital deaths. Stroke occurred in two patients and transient neurologic dysfunction in one. Postoperative computed tomographic scan showed residual distal hematoma progression to classical double-barrel dissection in two patients. At five years follow-up, survival was 100%. During the follow-up period, one patient had a new type B aortic dissection. A follow-up study confirmed hematoma resorption in 29 patients (70.7%). The estimated freedom from intramural hematoma-related events was 92.6 ± 4.1% at five years. No independent predictor of intramural hematoma-related events was found on multivariate analysis.
Conclusions

Immediate surgical treatment of acute aortic intramural hematoma involving the ascending aorta with open distal replacement of ascending aorta results in lower mortality rates and excellent midterm survival.

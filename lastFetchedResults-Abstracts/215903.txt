Background: Methanol poisoning may result to death and
permanent complications, sporadic cases of methanol poisoning
are fairly rare and the largest experience are generally gained
from managing methanol intoxication epidemics. The main metabolite
of methanol is acid formic that is the prime metabolite
responsible for toxic effects of methanol and since folate dependent
systems are responsible for the oxidation of formi c acid
to CO2 and water. It is belie ved that administration of folic acid
enhances the metabolism of form ate. Though therapeutic effects
of folic or folinic acid has never been fully tested in clinical
trail s in human. Our objective was to evaluate therapeutic effect
of folinic acid in methanol poisoned persons.
Methods: In recent methanol poisoning epidemic due to
"bootleg" Liquor consumption in Shiraz at 2004, Sixty-two
patients have hospitalized. Folinic acid was admin istered to 19
patients and therapeuti c effe ct of folinic acid was studied.
Results: There was no signi fi cant difference between two
groups of patient s and number of decreased visual acuity , renal
function, hospital stays and needs to bicarbonate therapy
and hemodialysis. The only effect was decreasing acidosis in
folate treated patients.
Conclusion: Regardless of prior animal studies and case reports, with attention to our study limitation we didn 't found
significant protective ef fect of folinic acid infusion among
methanol poisoning patients. The only effect was decreasing
acidosis in folate received patients. Further studies in optimal
situation is needed for definite judgment.

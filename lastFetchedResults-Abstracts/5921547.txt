This paper presents an optimal load shedding approach to enhance voltage stability employing a combination of the modal analysis and the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA). The proposed approach is organized as a multi-objective optimization problem which reveals the best location and the lowest level of load shedding for Special Protection Systems (SPSs) in the direction of improving the voltage stability margin as well as the voltage profile. The proposed approach is employed to the Gharb and Bakhtar areas of the Iranian transmission network for its annual peak load during 2009. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison with the current scheme.

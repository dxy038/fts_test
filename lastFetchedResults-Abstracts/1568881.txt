In 1993 a new Fisheries Act was passed in Barbados. Part I of the Act focuses on Fisheries Management and Development. The Act states the objective of fisheries management and development as being the “optimum utilization of the fisheries resources in the waters of Barbados for the benefit of the people of Barbados”. It requires that the process of management and development be guided by fisheries management and development schemes (plans)(FMPs), which the Chief Fisheries Officer shall develop and keep under review. The Act also provides for the appointment, by the Minister, of a Fisheries Advisory Committee (FAC). The FAC first met in December 1995. Its primary focus has been the development of the FMPs. The overall FMP includes a general description of the fishing industry, and separate plans for each fishery, as well as for developing the harvesting, post-harvest and institutional components of the industry. The 8 fisheries covered are: large pelagics, flyingfishes, reef fishes, deep-slope fishes, coastal pelagics (seine and cast net), lobsters, sea urchins and turtles. The plans were subjected to public review before being submitted to the Minister for approval. Following approval, regulations and supporting educational programs are being put in place. The development of national FMPs are considered to be an important precursor to effective regional and international collaboration in the management of shared, straddling and highly migratory stocks.

The primary objective of this paper is to detect and identify breast cancer tumor from the scattered field signal. It is known that the scattered electromagnetic fields from a dispersive media contain information about the resonance frequencies of tissues as complex poles or complex natural resonances. These poles for cancerous tissues depend on the tumor shape, depth and size. The computed complex poles are used to identify the existence of a malignancy, shape, size and depth.

Introduction: Pain control is one of the most important issues of post operation. Uncontrolled pain can be due to the complications such as rise of myocardial oxygen consumption, hypercoagulative state and suppression of respiratory system. There are several methods to control post operative pain, among which peripheral methods, due to fewer associated complications than others, (such as opioids and noroagsial methods) is more fruitful.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare efficacy of marcaine 0.25% with that of lidocaine 2% for controlling the pain after cesarean section.
Materials and Methods: In a double blind clinical trial, we selected 90 women with gravid one and term pregnancy.They were randomized into three groups. Patients underwent spinal anaesthesia. Following the surgery, we injected marcaine 0.25% in dose of 0.5 mg/kg with 20 cc distilled water, in 3 layers of abdomen (peritoneum, muscle, sub derm) in group 1, lidocaie 2%, 4mg/kg with 20 cc distilled water in group 2 and 30cc normal saline in group 3.The severity of pain was measured by VAS in 1, 2,3,4,8 and 12 hours after surgery. Also, the first dose administration time and mean consumption of diclofenac were assessed and compared among the three groups. We used SPSS, One Way ANOVA and Repeated Measure for analysis.( P.value less than 0.05 was considered significant)
Result: The mean values of VAS in hours of 1,2,3,4 in group of marcaine were (3.33,3.6,3.46,3.33), respectively, in lidocaine group were (3.56,4.16,4.8,4.43) and in normal saline group were(4.06,5.3,5.66,5.43). The mean time of the first dose administration of diclofenac in marcaine group was 2.56, in lidocaine group was 2.53 and in normal saline group was 1.53.
Conclusion: The local infiltration of marcaine 0.25 % in puncture of cesarean seems to be more effective than lidocaine 2% for pain control and decreases analgesic consumption in early hours after cesarean section.

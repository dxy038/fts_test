This paper presents a H-infinity synthesis with pole clustering based on LMI region schemes to control the speed of a DC motor. The dynamic system composed of converter/motor is considered in this investigation and derived in the state-space and transfer function forms. The performance of the control schemes is examined in terms of time response specifications of angular velocity, duty cycle input energy and armature current. The implementation results show that the regional pole placement known as LMI region combined with design objective in H-infinity controller guarantee a fast angular velocity tracking capability with very minimal controlled duty cycle.

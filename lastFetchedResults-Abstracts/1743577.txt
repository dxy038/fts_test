In our previous publication on the structure–property behavior of segmented polyurethanes based on castor oil [Petrović ZS, Xu Y, Zhang W. Polymer Preprints 2007;48(2):852–3.], the results showed that these materials which possessed a soft segment weight concentration (SSC) of 70% have both low tensile strength and elongation at break. This behavior is distinctly different from segmented polyurethanes of comparable soft segment content obtained from petrochemical polymeric diols that possess terminal hydroxyl groups. The poor elastic properties of these segmented polyurethanes were ascribed to the low molecular weight of the polymers as well as due to the presence of the six-carbon “dangling chain”, which may influence the morphology of the resulting segmented polyurethanes. To further understand this behavior, four segmented polyurethanes with the SSC of 70, 60, 50, and 40%, respectively, were synthesized from a polyricinoleate diol with an Mn of 2580, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and butanediol. The objective of this work was to study the effect of SSC on the morphology of the resulting polyurethanes, and to correlate the morphology with the properties of these bio-based segmented polyurethanes. Polymers were characterized by GPC, viscometry and spectroscopic methods. Thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers indicated good microphase separation. Microphase morphology was also noted by SAXS and AFM. Finally, “spherulitic-like” superstructures were noted in the solution cast films that are believed to arise from the nucleation and crystallization of the hard segments.

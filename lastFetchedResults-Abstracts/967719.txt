The main objective of this study is to design and construct the new, spouted bed dryer, for food drying sensitive foods specially. For this purpose, firstly a new design of dryer was planned to achieve the maximum efficiency and flexibility for liquids and solids drying. After constructing and initial setup of spouted bed, basic experiments such as investigation of an inert particles motion, pressure drop, energy consumption were conducted and optimal system requirements for two particle size (5.8 & 7.8 mm) were determined. The results indicated that changes in pressure drop in the dryer chamber containing inert particles are followed from the Ergun equation. Energy consumption in this system is variable in the range of 3-8 kW per hour. Also results reveals that the energy consumption of the new design of spouted bed dryer is less than the spray dryer for liquid foods drying.

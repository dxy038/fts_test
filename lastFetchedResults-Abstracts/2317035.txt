Criteria for inclusion were: current withdrawal users, married, sexually active, did not intend to be pregnant, no identifiable risks to the participants beyond OCs use. The intervention group received an educational program while the control group received routine procedures. Evaluation was performed before, one and three months after intervention. The data was analyzed by SPSS software Repeated measure, Wilcoxon and t test were used to analyze the data.
Results: The results showed that after intervention there were significant differences in the mean behavioral and normative beliefs scores between two groups indicating an increase in believing to use oral contraception.

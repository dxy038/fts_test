Introduction & Objective: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults and the 6th cause of
diseases burden, globally. Different methods such as methods of alternative medicine can help
nurses to improve patients’ health. Foot reflexology massage is one of the techniques that can
be used. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of this method on physiological
parameters of patients with stroke.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial study 68 patients with stroke were selected and
randomly divided into two groups of intervention (34patients) and control(34). In the
intervention group, foot reflexology massage was performed about 30 minutes for each
patient. Data collection devices were a demographic questionnaire and a check list of
physiological parameters. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics and analytic tests such
as ANOVA with repeated measurements using spss software
Results: Repeated measurements showed that during the process of controlling physiological
parameters, there was not any statistically significant change in the patients’ temperature,
respiration and blood oxygen saturation. But it was found a significant difference in heart rate
in both groups (P=0.00).
Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that foot reflexology massage can be used as
a safe, effective and economical nursing intervention to reduce the heart rate in patients with
stroke.

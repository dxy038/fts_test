In this paper, the bending moment induced by piezoelectric patch actuators embedded in a plate is taken as the objective function to study the optimal thickness and optimal embedded depth of piezoelectric patch actuators. The purpose of optimization is to make the piezoelectric actuating force as large as possible in active vibration control of piezoelectric laminated structures with embedded piezoelectric patch actuators.

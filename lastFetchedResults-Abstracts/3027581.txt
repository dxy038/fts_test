In this paper, an efficient way of implementing a constrained min-max predictive controller is presented. The new approach modifies the objective function in such a way that the resulting min-max problem can be solved in polynomial time. Different modifications are proposed. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a robust constrained min-max predictive controller that can be implemented in real time. The new controller stabilizes the uncertain system.

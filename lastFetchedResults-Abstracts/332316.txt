Objectives.
The objective of this study was to compare the effect of an oscillating/pulsating power toothbrush (Oral-B ProfessionalCare™ 7000; PC 7000) and a high-frequency power toothbrush (Philips Sonicare® Elite®; SE) on the reversal of experimental gingivitis.
Methods.

The study had a randomised, examiner-blind, split-mouth design. After dental prophylaxis, subjects refrained from brushing mandibular teeth for 21 days to allow development of gingivitis. During a 4-week treatment phase, the right or left side of the mouth was brushed with either the PC 7000 or the SE toothbrush as randomly allocated. Plaque and gingivitis were assessed at baseline (Day 0), after 21 days of no oral hygiene, and after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of brushing twice daily. Gingival abrasion was assessed at Day 0 and after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of product use.
Results.

Of 38 enrolled subjects, 35 provided evaluable data. The experimentally induced gingivitis (EIG) phase resulted in higher bleeding and plaque scores as compared to Day 0. During the treatment phase, plaque and bleeding scores were significantly lower with the PC 7000 than the SE toothbrush. After 4 weeks of use, the mean plaque scores changed from 2.78 (Day 21 of EIG phase) to 0.70 for the PC 7000 and from 2.67 (Day 21) to 0.88 for the SE. The mean bleeding scores changed from 1.86 (Day 21) to 1.24 for the PC 7000 and from 1.88 (Day 21) to 1.42 for the SE. No major differences were found between brushes with regard to gingival abrasion.
Conclusions.

The oscillating/pulsating power toothbrush (Oral-B ProfessionalCare 7000) was more effective than the high-frequency power toothbrush (Philips Sonicare Elite) at plaque removal and improvement of gingival condition, with no greater potential for causing gingival abrasion.

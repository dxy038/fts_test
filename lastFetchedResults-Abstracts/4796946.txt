In this paper the generated power regulation control problem of a single synchronous generator connected to an infinite bus is solved. The main objective of this work is to show how the controller design methodology known as passivity-based approach, reported by P.M. Anderson et al. (1991), can be applied in the solution of this kind of problem. For the sake of simplicity it is considered that all the parameters of the nonlinear model of this machine are known. However, the proposed controller has a structure such that it is expected that its extension to consider more real situations could be carried out without major problems

To propose such definitions and concepts as "social class" to categorize the merchants, with use of such themes as "class for itself' to denote the objective and actual existence of individuals who share the same life style, mode of production and a similar income level and compose a social group without a proper knowledge of belonging to the same social class, and also "class for itself' to refer to merchants as a social group who have attained class consciousness are illuminating and correct themes pertaining to describing merchants from a politico-sociological perspective at the time of the Constitutional Revolution.
A morphological study of this social class in the sense to define its internal mechanisms and the merchants' conduct towards other members of their class, and also their relations with other social classes would enhance an understanding of the class identity of the merchants.
This paper not only deals with the internal structure of the :merchant social class, but also throws light on the dealings of merchants with the government officials, state governors, clergymen, the masses of people, the inteligentsia, shop keepers, artisans , and the money changers.

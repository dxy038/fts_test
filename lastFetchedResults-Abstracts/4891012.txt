This paper addresses the modelling of land-use development described by users-services systems. On one hand, the increasing economical, technological, social and environmental changes in our world make the management of urban services to be a great challenge. On the other hand, new technologies provide efficient tools in order to obtain accurate information from various sensors or captors leading to targeted service delivery based on localized factors. Within this paper, we propose a descriptive model to deal with land-use development, based on a three level system in which the environment is an active level interacting with users and services. The three levels are represented in a form of a network of networks consisting of active nodes in dynamic system context. This descriptive model helps in isolating the decision making in a distributed autonomous fashion. Bio-inspired Swarm Intelligence techniques are utilized to realise this objective. The integration between environment sensing, services information handling and planning is a key and difficult part within this research.

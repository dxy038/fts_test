Background: Based on the authors’ knowledge, there is no study on the co-infection of opportunistic agents such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii in the lungs of Iranian patients with immunosuppression.
Objectives: The current study aimed to show the rate of co-infection of M. tuberculosis and P. jirovecii in patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
Patients and Methods: Forty-five pulmonary samples were collected from 30 patients with HIV who also infected with Tuberculosis and Pneumonia. All of the patients were admitted to two university hospitals of Mycobacteriology and the Iranian HIV/AIDS research centers. DNA of P. jirovecii was detected using nested-Polymerase Chain Reaction (nested-PCR) assay.
Results: All of the patients were male with the mean age of 32.95 ± 7.15 years. The mean of CD4 cell count was 109.25 cell/mm3. Of 30 patients with HIV, three (10%) were co-infected with M. tuberculosis and P. jirovecii. No other causes of pneumonia were found in those three patients and CD4 cell counts less than 50 cell/mm3 was reported.
Conclusions: The results of the current study showed a high rate of co-infection of M. tuberculosis and P. jirovecii in the Iranian patients with HIV. As the immune system condition worsened, the probability of occurrence of Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) increased. Therefore, more specific, most rapid and sensitive tests should be utilized for diagnosis of PCP in this group of patients.

In this paper, we consider the issue of clustering when outliers exist. The outlier set is defined as the complement of the data set. Following this concept, a specially designed fuzzy membership weighted objective function is proposed and the corresponding optimal membership is derived. Unlike the membership of fuzzy c-means, the derived fuzzy membership does not reduce with the increase of the cluster number. With the suitable redefinition of the distance metric, we demonstrate that the objective function could be used to extract c spherical shells. A hard clustering algorithm alleviating the prototype under-utilization problem is also derived. Artificially generated data are used for comparisons.

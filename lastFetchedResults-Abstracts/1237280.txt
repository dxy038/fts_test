Introduction and Objective: Enquiry into researches for achieving more confirmed results, removing existing discrepancies among various studies, and discovering knowledge gap are of main concerns of scientific research. As a systematic approach, meta-analysis tends to orientate this goal by statistical synthesis of quantitative results obtained from independent studies relating to a research problem. This article aimed to set forth an introductory context for conducting meta-analysis in the various research problems of information and knowledge science (IKS). 
Method: This analytical review article described the history, methods, statistical approaches, and challenges and opportunities of meta-analysis in IKS.
Findings: As a systematic review, meta-analysis has some ordered and written stages directed by a protocol. Statistical summarization of the findings of included studies is the main stage which has three approaches. Despite its importance in developing a scientific field, meta-analysis has not been widely known and conducted in LIS field and there are some discrepancies in its conduct. The authors of original research articles and journal editors should consider some guidelines for authoring them in such a way that they can be easily included in meta-analysis.
Originality/value: This study is a step for introducing the principles and references of meta-analysis to IKS scientific communication as a new and necessary approach to synthesizing and evaluating the increasing studies in IKS, especially those conducted in Iran.

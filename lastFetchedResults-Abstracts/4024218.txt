Knowledge of the directional and hemispherical reflectance properties of natural surfaces, such as soils and vegetation canopies, is essential for classification studies and canopy model inversion. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), an instrument to be launched in 1998 onboard the EOS-AM1 platform, will make global observations of the EarthÂ´s surface at 1.1-km spatial resolution, with the objective of determining the atmospherically corrected reflectance properties of most of the land surface and the tropical ocean. The algorithms to retrieve surface directional reflectances, albedos, and selected biophysical parameters using MISR data are described. Since part of the MISR data analyses includes an aerosol retrieval, it is assumed that the optical properties of the atmosphere (i.e. aerosol characteristics) have been determined well enough to accurately model the radiative transfer process. The core surface retrieval algorithms are tested on simulated MISR data, computed using realistic surface reflectance and aerosol models, and the sensitivity of the retrieved directional and hemispherical reflectances to aerosol type and column amount is illustrated. Included is a summary list of the MISR surface products

Distributed generation (DG) have significant benefits in the electric power industry, such as a reduction in green house gas emissions in generation, improvement of voltage profile in distribution lines, maintaining voltage stability in heavy load levels, reduction in power losses, etc. The placement of DG has significant impact on the performance of the power system. In addition to placement, sizing of DG should also be done for getting more benefits like cost. The objective of this paper is to find optimal placement and sizing of DG in a distributed system using genetic algorithm (GA) for improvement of voltage profile t and reduction in power loss. The impact of increase in DG units is also carried out for various load demands. Simulation is carried on a 33 IEEE bus system with out and with the presence of DG and the results are presented and analyzed

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been investigated extensively with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and identified as a neural correlate of emotion regulation and decision-making, particularly in the context of moral utilitarian dilemmas. However, there are two limitations of previous work: (1) fMRI requires strict constraints on the physical experimental environment and (2) experimental manipulations have yet to consider the role of agency on the dilemma outcome and the corresponding neural activity. In this paper, we extend previous work by first evaluating an alternative neuroimaging technique, functional near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), for observing decision-making processes in a less-constrained environment. We then examine the role of agency in deciding emotional (moral) and non-emotional dilemmas through a 2-part, 20-subject preliminary investigation. Our findings are two-fold: they suggest (1) NIRS is a potential alternative to fMRI in this decision-making context and (2) agency shows some influence on prefrontal neural activity, making NIRS a promising method for objective evaluation of agency and emotional value in human-agent interactions.

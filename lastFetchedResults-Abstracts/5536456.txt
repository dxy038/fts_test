This study focuses on online collaborative learning. The main objective is to analyze how and why the students who start studying at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) use the wiki as a tool in order to develop a virtual project in small groups (3-5 members). Starting from a qualitative point of view, we analyzed a pilot test where wiki was introduced for collaborative work in the digital literacy subject. Two different student profiles were involved in this study: students from computer engineering and psychology. The outcomes show that there are several factors that affect how students use the wiki. At the same time, the most important aspects of the wiki to construct a virtual project are analyzed.

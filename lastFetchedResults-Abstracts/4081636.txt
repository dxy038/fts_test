Compared to the traditional single-phase-shift control, dual-phase-shift (DPS) control can greatly improve the performance of the isolated bidirectional dual-active-bridge dc-dc converter (IBDC). This letter points out some wrong knowledge about transmission power of IBDC under DPS control in the earlier studies. On this basis, this letter gives the detailed theoretical and experimental analyses of the transmission power of IBDC under DPS control. And the experimental results showed agreement with theoretical analysis.

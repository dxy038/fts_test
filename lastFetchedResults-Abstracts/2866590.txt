The main objective of the present work is to investigate the robustness of the interval system. In this paper robust stability analysis of closed loop system is presented using simplified conditions of Arguon´s theorem which is comparatively efficient and expeditious than that by Kharitonov´s theorem. Here it has been shown that even if the closed loop pole lies in the left half of s-plane the system may exhibit unstable response under perturbed condition.

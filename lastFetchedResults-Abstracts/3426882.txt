A Phillips ion gauge source (Fig. 1) of the type used by the heavy ion accelerator in Berkeley has been adapted for use at the Bevatron. The objective was to achieve high charge state ions (4+, 5+) of carbon and nitrogen. All source parameters are pulsed. The ion source performance regarding linac acceleration is discussed. The light ion (deuteron, alpha) performance of the PIG source and duoplasmatron is compared.

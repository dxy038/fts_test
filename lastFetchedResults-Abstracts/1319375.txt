
The objective of the present study was the utilization of rose flower residues for the production of medium density fiberboard. MDF was produced applying two  moisture gradients of 0 and 4%  between surface and core layer, two press temperatures of 175 and 185 Â°C and three pressing times of 3,4 and 5 minutes. The mechanical and physical properties of the boards were measured and statistically analyzed using factorial experiment and complete randomized design. In case statistical difference was observed between the averages, then Duncn multiple range test was used for grouping of the averages. The results revealed that the moisture gradient statistically influenced the flexural strength and internal bonding of the boards. In both moisture gradients, the internal bond of the boards increased and the maximum was reached when 5 minutes pressing time was applied. The pressing time also statistically influenced the thickness swelling and the lowest values were measured on boards pressed for five minutes. Generally, the strength properties of the boards were in accordance with the required specification of EN standard, which indicates that rose flower residue can be considered as a suitable raw material for medium density fiberboard production.

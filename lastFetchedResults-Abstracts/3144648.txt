In this paper we investigate the design and operating principle of a pattern reconfigurable multi-mode slot antenna with a hybrid feed. The slot antenna is excited by an orthogonal arrangement of a co-planar waveguide (CPW) fed circular disc and a microstrip fed square patch. The design objective is to be able to change the direction of the main lobe by feeding the two orthogonal elements with different phases.

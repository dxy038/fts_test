Modern developments in wireless technologies lead to scarcity of spectrum due to fixed spectrum allocation policy. Cognitive Radio which uses Dynamic spectrum allocation is proposed to utilize spectrum efficiently. In a given wireless scenario optimization of transmission parameters for cognitive radio become complex due to many transmission parameters and large number of values it can have. In this paper we have proposed a cognitive radio decision engine that determines the optimal values of radio transmission parameters using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal spectrum allocation in cognitive radio. Initially we have strived to achieve subset of parameters and evolve them till the optimal value is achieved for given performance objective. To control the evolution process for GA we have defined fitness measures for different performance objective. Simulation results clearly show that optimization of transmission parameters is achieved with the overall efficiency of 94% for fitness measures.

Man” has always been a center of attention in many artworks especially in paintings. It is notably and remarkably interesting to see how an eastern artist and a western one tend to express such concept visually. Dimensions of Man existence in Italian Humanist thought, became the manifestation of visual factors in Raphael’s works and as the western attitude during the Renaissance has overshadowed any fields of art of its time, it has also progressed in Iran towards a position in the age of art to the extent that the earth man has changed any visual criteria of the period and established an evolution or visual and perspective cleaning up at its own era which is evident in Bihzad’s works. Seemingly the present study is the first study and research performed on Bihzad and Raphael’s works comparatively which examines the role and position of human being. 
The objective here is to study the role and position of “Man” in Bihzad and Raphael’s works, by the virtue of the approximate contemporarity of the two artists and it is attempted to put the similarities and differences existed in the works of these two painters on the concept of Man in terms of form and meaning under research. In the same line, it will be evaluated considering the nature of the research utilized by the comparative and historical method and by the iconographical and iconological approaches based on Erwin Panofsky’s theory and the method used will be of descriptive, analytical and comparative data analysis.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether women with a family history of ovarian cancer are at reduced risk of ovarian cancer from the use of oral contraceptives and to compare their risk with that of women with no family history of ovarian cancer. Study Design: A population-based case-controlled study was conducted from May 1994 through July 1998 in which 767 women aged 20 to 69 years with a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer were ascertained from 39 hospitals in 3 northeastern states. Personal interviews with the women and 1367 control subjects provided data that allowed us to estimate the relative risk of ovarian cancer in relation to a family history of cancer and total duration of oral contraception. Results: Among the 33 case patients and 24 control subjects with a first-degree family history of ovarian cancer, risk of ovarian cancer declined with increasing duration of oral contraception (P = .01). Risk reduction from short-term use of oral contraceptives (â‰¤48 months) did not differ significantly by family history (combined estimate of odds ratio, 0.72; 90% CI, 0.59%-0.87%). Risk reduction from long-term use of oral contraceptives (>48 months) was greater in women with a positive family history of ovarian cancer (odds ratio, 0.12) than in women with a negative family history of ovarian cancer (odds ratio, 0.51; test of interaction, P = .04; 692 case patients, 1279 control subjects). Conclusion: Four to 8 years of oral contraception may substantially reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by age 70 years in women with a family history of the disease, from approximately 4 women per 100 women who did not use oral contraceptives to only 2 women per 100 women who did use oral contraceptives.

In this manuscript, a property of Lyapunov matrices is proposed and its application to sliding mode design is addressed. It will be shown that the sliding modes which guarantee the desired sliding behavior can be obtained by manipulating Lyapunov matrices associated with the full order systems. The proposed approach enables us to adopt a variety of Lyapunov- (or Riccati-) based approaches for the sliding mode design. Applications to uncertain systems, systems with uncertain state delay, pole-clustering problems, multi-objective approach etc. are discussed

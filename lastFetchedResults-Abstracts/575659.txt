Developmental, and personal characteristics ‎of children's sample (N = 11) were described by a ‎demographic questionnaire family, and children play ‎behaviors  has been studied and  described by the scale of ‎Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and ‎Preschool Play Behavior Scale (PPBS)., quantitative data ‎analysis, issues (themes) that emerge from in-depth ‎interviews have been grouped and discussed in the form ‎of seven categories. According to narrative inquiry, the ‎most significant features of autistic children that was ‎emerging from mothers` narratives, are as follows: lack ‎of pleasure from the play, reluctance to play, escape ‎playing, forgetfulness, lack of objective, Repetition of ‎play-like activities, superficiality, Tendency towards ‎unusual and sensory motor stimulating toys and ‎activities, play resistance, inflexible playing.

NP-Hard problems are hard to solve, it requires considerable computational power to generate solutions. The objective is to achieve better solution in less time. To obtain better solutions in semi-automated examination timetabling systems, we introduce visual interface tools to assist human to identify conflicts and turn the direction towards the feasible solution. We propose visual interface as a tool for the user to interact with the schedule generations.

In this paper we consider the control objective of step tracking and pole placement in the context of significant plant uncertainty and occasional, but persistent, jumps in the plant parameters. Here we have a compact set of admissible single-input single-output, controllable and observable plant models of a fixed order. The controller incorporates an integrator, and its action emulates the behaviour of a pole placement state feedback compensator. We demonstrate that this controller has the facility to tolerate occasional (but persistent) switches between these models without an undue effect on the performance.

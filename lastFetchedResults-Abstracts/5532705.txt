With the increasing attention on the operation stability of the high-capacity bidirectional converter, unbalance factor should be taken into account during the design of bidirectional converter system so as to reduce the influence of the power grid unbalance. This paper analyzes the relationships between the dip depth of the grid voltage and the unbalance factor caused by different types of grid faults. Then the mathematical expression of system parameters is deduced from the perspective of unbalance factor. Systems by different parameters with and without considering unbalance factor are separately simulated to show the practicability and validity of the adopted parameter-design theory.

In a lot of countries and regions there are requirements regarding electromagnetic emissions from electrical equipment. Such emissions can be looked at under two aspects: the emissions might interfere with other equipment in the vicinity causing potential malfunction (EMC aspect), or might be considered with regard to human exposure (EMF aspect). Limitation of such emissions related to the EMC aspect is part of EMC activities and is mostly due to the need to protect radio services from being interfered. Applicable limits depend on the type of equipment under concern and of the locations where equipment is intended to be operated. However, more and more such emissions are looked at also under a human exposure point of view within the frame of EMF regulations. As both aspects deal with entirely different objective targets consequently different limits, different measurement procedures and different assessment methods are to be applied. This could mean in practice that basically two kinds of measurements have to be carried out. This paper introduces an approach how to use results obtained by means of EMC measurements for the purpose of EMF assessments. As an example for an assessment the EMC data in the frequency range between 30 MHz and 230 MHz are used as part of an EMF assessment.

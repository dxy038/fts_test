As a result of the R&amp;D project &#8220;Smart Storage&#8221;, Enexis developed and currently operates an electricity storage system called the Smart Storage Unit (SSU), which is part of the greater Smart Storage System (SSS). Its objective is to enable field-testing and research of advanced smart storage technologies in low voltage (LV) distribution grids. The SSS was installed in the LV distribution grid for the purpose of enabling applications such as, but not limited to: the increase of local PV consumption, improvement of reliability and flexibility, reduction of losses, and maximizing the utilization of local infrastructure. In this paper a detailed technical description of the SSU and its subsystems will be presented.

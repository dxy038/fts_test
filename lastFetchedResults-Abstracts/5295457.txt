This paper presents a novel method for capacitor placement in radial distribution feeders to reduce the real power loss and to improve the voltage profile. The location of the nodes where the capacitors should be placed is decided by a set of rules given by the fuzzy expert system. The sizing of the capacitors is modeled by the objective function to obtain maximum savings using Particle Swarm Optimization. A voltage constraint is taken and compared without the constraint. A case study with an IEEE 34 bus distribution feeder is presented to illustrate the applicability of the algorithm.

The objective of the study is to modify supported liquid membranes (SLMs) by designing a self-made double-supported liquid membrane (DSLMs). SLMs is a traditional extraction system that adopts organic solvent immersed membrane to separate the donor and acceptor phase. However, the system cannot maintain long extraction time due to the fast evaporation of the organic solvent where the easy volatile organic solvent is selected as organic phase. DSLMs system manages to solve the problem by enclosing the organic solvent between two membranes. This system has been successfully applied to the extraction of nicotine from local tobacco. The optical conditions for extraction nicotine were found and the amount of extracted nicotine were analyzed by GC/MS. Results showed that the extracting time could be held for 24 h and the amount of extracted nicotine got to 43%.

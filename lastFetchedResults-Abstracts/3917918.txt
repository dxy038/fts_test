The digital imaging technology has grown explosively for multimedia applications in recent years. The need for the copyrighted digitalized media becomes urgent nowadays. An approach for the digital copyright protection is to employ advanced watermarking techniques, where watermarks can reveal the ownership identities. Generally speaking, the watermarks are embedded into image or video signals. In this paper, we will investigate digital watermarking techniques and propose a new optimal watermarking scheme. When multiple embedded watermarks are considered, a new analysis for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (SINRs) with respect to the subject signal and the watermark signals is carried out. The objective quality measure for the digital watermarking applications should essentially consist of both signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio for the subject signal and similarity coefficients for the watermarks. In order to optimize the aforementioned objective measure, we design a novel efficient scale-factor optimization scheme, which can lead to the maximum overall SINR for both subject signal and watermarks. Simulation results are also demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

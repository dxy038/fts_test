The objective of this study was to investigate the enhanced osteoblast activity of MG-63 cells cultured on titanium (Ti) with a heparin/BMP-2 (Hep/BMP-2) complex. The Ti substrates were initially modified by chemical grafting poly-l-lysine (PLL) using condensing agent, followed by immobilizing the heparin/BMP-2 complex to the PLL-grafted Ti substrate via electrostatic interactions. The surface modification of Ti substrates with PLL and/or Hep/BMP-2 complex were confirmed with scanning electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Immobilized BMP-2 was released from the Hep/BMP-2/Ti substrate in a sustained manner. In vitro studies revealed that osteoblasts grown on Hep/BMP-2/Ti substrate increased ALP activity, calcium deposition, ALP and osteocalcin levels as compared to those grown on pristine Ti or PLL-Ti. These results indicated that heparin/BMP-2 complex immobilized Ti substrate can be useful to effectively improve osteoblast activity.

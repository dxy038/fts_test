The objective of this project is to evaluate the advantages of the system interconnection, to identify the barriers and to find out the countermeasures and, finally, to give birth to an international organisation for discussing the future plan for the system interconnection. In order to accomplish this objective, it is required to build a database for analyzing the technical and economic effects of the system interconnection on system operation and long term power supply planning and, in addition, to evaluate technical, economic and market feasibility.

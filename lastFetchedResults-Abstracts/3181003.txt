Compensation structure, which should match with the overall enterprise system and be vital to the development of enterprises, has been the focus of theory and practice circles. Through the Delphi method by industry expert experiences, we attribute the decision-making factors of compensation structure as industry competition situation, labor factor, compensation function, business strategy, enterprise development stage, enterprise culture and enterprise organization structure. Compensation structure decision-making model is constructed in the paper employing fuzzy evaluation method that utilizes the relation between the size of degree of membership and compensation structure. Actual case is provided to illustrate the whole decision-making process, through setting up the aggregate of factor, the aggregate of evaluation, single-factor fuzzy evaluation, the aggregate of weight. Empirical results show that the power enterprise should adhere to post-oriented primarily and performance-oriented and ability-oriented peripherally. The decision-making result is more scientific, quantitative and objective, as a result that the enterprise finds out a suitable actual compensation structure.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if preeclampsia is associated with a reduced risk of cancer later in life.
Study design
We performed a cohort study where women with preeclampsia over the interval 1947 to 1999 were identified from the Utah Population Database. Preeclamptics (n = 17,432) were matched 1:3 with nonpreeclamptics (n = 52,296) on maternal age and birth year. Pregnancy, demographic, and cancer information was extracted from subjects and their offspring in linked datasets. Relative risk and hazard ratios were calculated.
Results
In a matched analysis using univariable random-effects Poisson regression, preeclampsia was protective against the development of cancer later in life (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99 with P = .027). In a multivariable clustered Cox regression model with the end point of cancer later in life, preeclampsia was associated with a lower risk of cancer (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99 with P = .039). These findings were supported by stratified and competing risk analyses.
Conclusion
Women whose pregnancies were affected by preeclampsia have a decreased risk of developing cancer.

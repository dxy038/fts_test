Objective: To study the startle reflex and the effect of the startle reflex stimulus over reaction time (start-react effect) in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS).
Method: Ten GTS patients and ten matched healthy volunteers underwent a simple RT paradigm (4 blocks of 50 trials). Forty acoustic startle reflex stimuli (110 dB) were randomly delivered with a 20% occurrence probability and presented unexpectedly at the same time as the imperative stimuli of the RT. Variables of interest were: amplitude, onset latency, degree of spread and rate of habituation of the startle response, and RT and the start-react effect caused by the startle stimuli.
Results: GTS patients showed a significantly higher amplitude, a major degree of spread and fewer habituation phenomena of the startle reflex. GTS patients showed poorer non statistically significant RT performance compared to controls, with a significant correlation between RT and severity of the disease. The start-react effect was significantly less pronounced in GTS patients.
Conclusions: The present study confirms that GTS has an exaggerated startle reflex response and extend the spectrum of abnormalities to the start-react effect. A state of dopaminergic hyperactivity may have contributed to these results.

This paper presents an analysis of two different control strategies applied to a bidirectional dc-dc boost converter in a permanent magnet synchronous motor drive for hybrid electric vehicles. A constant rated voltage-fed inverter and a variable voltage control strategy that takes into account the motor mechanical speed to adjust the dc-dc converter output voltage are considered. Moreover, single IGBT open-circuit faults are introduced in the inverter and their effects evaluated. For all the considered operating conditions, the drive performance is evaluated by the analysis of some key parameters such as efficiency, machine power factor, electromagnetic torque, voltage and current rms and harmonic distortion values.

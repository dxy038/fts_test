This paper presents a multi-agent (MAS) solution to energy management in a distributed hybrid renewable energy generation system. An introduction and analysis of the system, including its constituents, characteristics, excitation mechanism, are presented firstly. Then, basic mathematical models of each components and the objective function of the overall system are proposed. The MAS is shown of having attributes of distribution, heterogeneity, autonomous, dynamism and openness. Identification and building of the agent model under the MAS framework are presented in succession. Finally, the MAS is formulated and implemented using the JADE (Java Agent Development) platform. A scenario case study on the MAS and its testing process are included in the paper

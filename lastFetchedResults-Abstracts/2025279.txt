Exploratory field survey was conducted with the objective of to understand climate change effects, potato value chain actors, processes, activities and supportive services providers in 2013, Awi-Zone, Ethiopia. Expert and key informant interviews, focused group discussions and review of literature were used as study methodology. A total of 51 value chain actors composing farmers, traders, processors consumers and supportive service providers were involved. The survey result indicates that climate change affects the whole value chain of potato. Drought and  erratic, delay and early cessation of rain- fall, heat wave, strong winds, and more flood and night frost were the observed effects of climate change in the study area. Heavy flood impeded input supply and transport services to farmers by damaging roads, while delayed and erratic rain fall reduced the yield of potato and enhanced more diseases and insect pest pressure, which in turn resulted in inconsistent supply of produce to the traders. Consumers were also affected by inconsistent potato market supply. Moreover, poor linkage among value chain actors and support service providers contributed for inadequate action on the use of adaptive measures.  The sub sector in general faces a number of structural and technological challenges that need immediate attention to improve potato sector development. Hence, vertical and horizontal integration will be required among value chain actors, supportive service providers and private investors to enhance the sector.

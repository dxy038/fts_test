Background: Different protocols are used for controlled ovarian hyper stimulation (COH), but the optimal method has not yet been determined. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) using clomiphen citrate (CC) plus HMG versus CC plus rFSH in intra uterine insemination cycles (IUI). Materials and Methods: 144 women with unexplained or male factor infertility undergoing IUI cycles were randomized (72 patients in CC plus rFSH group and 72 patients in CC plus HMG group) and included in this single blind study from October 2006 to June 2010. The primary outcomes were clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates. The number of dominant follicles, mean of follicular size, endometrial thickness on the day of HCG administration, total dose of gonadotropins and duration of stimulation with gonadotropins were secondary outcomes. Results: Clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates were not significantly different in the two groups .There was a significant higher multiple pregnancy rate in CC plus rFSH group (33.3%) versus CC plus HMG group (12.5%; p < 0.005). There were no statistically significant differences in the secondary outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion: According to our results it seems that CC plus HMG is a more suitable and cost-effective regimen than CC plus rFSH in IUI cycles in patients with unexplained or male factor infertility.

The objective of this study is to develop a numeric simulator able to quantify the discomfort during the automobile accessibility movement. An experimental protocol and device were set up in order to record the automobile accessibility movement using the motion analysis system Vicon. A biomechanical human model composed of rigid bodies articulated was also proposed to simulate it. After reconstruction of the ingress/egress movement, a position error exists between the simulated and the experimental trajectories of the hands and feet. This error could imply collisions with the vehicle. In order to correct this error, an optimization procedure is suggested. This method modifies the experimental joint angles so that the simulated trajectories of the limb extremities fit to the experimental data.

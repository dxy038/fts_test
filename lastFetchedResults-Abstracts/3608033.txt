The resolution of the refracted near-field measurement method for optical-fibre refractive-index profiles has been improved by a factor of about three by simply using a lens-shaped liquid cell and an oil immersion objective. The resulting optimum resolution is below 0.2 &#194;&#191;m and at 0.633 &#194;&#191;m wavelength with polarisation normal to the refractive index gradient.

Knowledge from studies in force reflection and control theory have application to problems in Rehabilitation Engineering. One objective in Rehabiitation Engineering is to judiciously produce a force to assist a human in the performance of a task. Using principals of how man-machine systems interact with force reflecting controllers provides insight on how to achieve this result.

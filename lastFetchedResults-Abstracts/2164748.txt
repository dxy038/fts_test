Abstract 
Introduction: There has been growing public concern on the effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by cellular phones on human health. Although few studies showed cell phone usage may have a detrimental effect on human sperm motility and viability, the harmful effects of cell phone radiation on sperm DNA has not been evaluated.  Objective: This study aimed to determine the effects of cell phone radiation on sperm viability, motility, and count and DNA damage by a fluorescence method and evaluate abnormal chromatin condensation.
Materials and Methods: This is an experimental study in which semen samples were collected from 18 fertile males presenting to an infertility center. Each sample was divided equally into two aliquots: control group (sample not exposed) and exposure group (sample exposed to cell phone by 1 centimeter distance for 10 minutes continuously). Sperm parameter was performed based on WHO standard criteria and we determined the mean of concentration, motility (I, II, III and IV), and viability of each group and DNA damage evaluated with acridine orange (AO) staining. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test using SPSS version 16 software.
Results: The results indicated that exposure group showed a significant decrease in the rapid progressive, slow progressive sperm movement and viability. It also increases the no–motility category of sperm movement and abnormal sperm significantly (p < 0.05). However, the AO staining showed that the exposure group samples had a greater DNA damage as well as yellow and red to green sperm, compared to control group. 
Conclusion: We can conclude that electromagnetic waves emitted from cell phones may lead to a significant decrease in sperm viability and motility. Also, the exposure samples exhibited a greater DNA damage, compared to the controls.

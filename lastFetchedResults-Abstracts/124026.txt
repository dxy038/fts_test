BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Portulaca oleracea (P.0) overgrows in the different parts of Iran, that is used there as both a salad green and a medicinal plant. In previous studies, a 10% ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts (leaf and stem) of P.O showed antinociceptive activity in mice and rats. This study was designed to evaluate antinociceptive effects of different doses of the aqueous decoction extracts of P.O (seed).
METHODS: In this study, 65 male mice (25 - 30 gr) in model Tail flick were used. Different doses of the extract 25, 50, 75, 100 mg/kg (IP) were injected to the separated groups of four (test group) and water (l0ml/kg IP) was injected to the one control group. The antinociceptive effect was determined 15 and 30 min after injection (N-15 mice for pilot study).
FINDINGS: The results showed that there was a significant difference between two groups (p< 0.05), but the animals of test groups did not show significant difference in different doses and time.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the aqueous extract of P.O has antinociceptive activity, which is not related to dose and time.

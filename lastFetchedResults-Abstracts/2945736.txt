The objective of this study is to provide a personalized three dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction method of human thoracic facet joints. The proposed reconstruction method consist of a combination of biplanar radiographic reconstruction and computed tomography techniques. 3D facet joint geometry of a thoracic spine have been computed in terms of eight parameters with the new method and compared with a serial tomographic reconstructed model. A mean difference of 3.5&#176; in axial orientation and 2.1 mm in 3D position of facet joint were found between both representations. The new 3D personalized model of facet joints will help to understand their significance in spinal disorders and provide an important data for personalized biomechanical simulations

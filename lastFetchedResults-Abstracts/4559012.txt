Energy sources and storage devices of (H)EV powertrain are usually designed for the maximum ratings of the drivability conditions (cruise speed, gradeability and acceleration). This leads to a costly solution because the components are oversized. This paper develops a methodology based on the combination of the standard driving cycles to optimize the sizing of the devices. ItÂ´s applied to the design of the FC stack and the Energy Storage System associated (battery or/and ultra capacitor). The numbers of series and parallel branches respectively Ns<sub>i</sub> and Np<sub>i</sub> are computed so as to minimize an objective function, to fulfill the performance requirements and respect the technologic constraints. Simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the methodology.

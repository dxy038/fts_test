This paper presents two graduate courses in the area of real-time control and operation of power systems. The objective of the courses is to study real-time control functions as performed by modern energy control centers. The main topics addressed are: 1) data acquisition and estimation, 2) energy management/automatic generation control, and 3) security monitoring and control. A unique feature of the courses is the use of a number of interactive computer programs. These programs assist students in studying in depth and understanding the concepts underlying the real-time operation of power systems. The paper describes course contents and the utilization of computer programs to enhance student comprehension of the concepts involved. Typical homework assignments are described to illustrate the utilization of the computer programs. The courses are presently offered at Georgia Tech, with excellent student response.

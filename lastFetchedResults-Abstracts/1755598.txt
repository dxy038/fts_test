Objective
al of this study is to examine the association between asthma and mental disorders and the impact of asthma and mental disorder comorbidity on functional impairment and mental health care service use among adults in the community.
s
ame from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 (N=36,984; age â‰¥15 years; response rate, 77%). Mental disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Chronic physical health conditions, quality of life, and disability were also assessed. Asthma diagnoses were based on self-report of having been diagnosed with asthma by a health care professional.
s
 was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of a range of mental disorders among adults in Canada, with the strongest links between asthma and posttraumatic stress disorder, mania, and panic disorder. Adults with both mental disorders and asthma had significantly higher rates of functional impairment and use of mental health services, compared with those with either asthma or mental disorders but not both.
sions
ndings provide new information suggesting that adults in the community with asthma and mental disorders have higher levels of both short- and long-term health-condition-related functional disability and greater use of mental health services, compared with those with asthma without mental disorders. Results are also consistent with previous studies showing a significant link between asthma and mental disorders. Implications of these findings for efforts aimed at secondary prevention and improving treatment strategies for individuals with both asthma and mental disorders are discussed.

Preliminary results from an investigation on the application of dynamic power flow controllers to a stretch of the Qatar Transmission System (QTS) along the western coast of Qatar. The main objective of applying the power flow controller is to maintain balance of power flow between the networks or lines that supply to this weaker region of the QTS, and in turn support network security should the demand in this region grows. The paper will investigate the impact on steady-state power flow control using a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), and the potential application of a Generalized Power Flow Controller (GUPFC), in the QTS to check if these controllers provide a viable solution looking into the future. In controlling of the power flow controller, this paper looks into the possibility of using phasor measurement units (PMUs) and synchrophasor based control. An assessment on the existing infrastructure of the QTS and necessary improvement needed to support implementation of the power flow controller and its control will be included in this paper along with a preliminary cost analysis. The modeling work and preliminary studies in this paper were conducted with PSS/E.

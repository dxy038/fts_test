The primary objective of pervasive computing environments (PCE) is the creation of an environment saturated with seamlessly integrated devices with computing and communication capabilities. It seeks to provide proactive and self-tuning environments and devices to seamlessly augment a personÂ´s knowledge and decision-making ability, while requiring as little direct user interaction as possible. The realization of this vision requires that distributed context manipulation be conducted in an effective and efficient manner. In these environments, devices and associated software of diverse software and hardware providers will pervade everyday life. We propose a UML Profile for modeling such PCE including context modeling and distributed knowledge manipulation.

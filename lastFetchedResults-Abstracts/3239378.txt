Contents in image repository are highly complicated and semantically unknown. The image annotation task is categorized as classification of low-level or atomic concepts and classification of high-level concepts in a domain-specific ontology. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is well-defined that acts as an interface between system and people for performing information retrieval, image retrieval and video retrieval. Semantic web, ontology and metadata languages provide a new way for annotation and retrieving images. Complexity to locate, access, or maintain available electronic information on the web can prevail over by incorporating ontology. Ontology plays a vital role in providing information access, exchange of information, sharing of knowledge, use and reuse of knowledge base and common understanding of specific domain are communicated among people for developing their applications. Resource Description Framework (RDF) framework for describing and interchanging metadata that provides intelligent access to heterogeneous and distributed information. Web Ontology Language (OWL), is widely used to construct domain ontology. The objective of this paper is to create ontology using prote&#769;ge&#769; software and to provide semantic annotation for image using SPARQL query language. OntoViz and OntoGraph are used for generating graphical representation of Ontology.

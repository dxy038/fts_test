In multiprocessor systems, an efficient scheduling of a parallel program onto the processors that minimizes the entire execution time is vital for achieving a high performance. This scheduling problem is known to be NP-complete. The objective is minimization of scheduling length, i.e. we want the final job to be completed as early as possible. In this paper we introduced a scheduling particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with some modification to get near optimal schedule for task scheduling.

A novel electric-circuit simulation model considering the contact and interface physics for electromagnetic railgun is suggested. The contact velocity skin-effect resistance and the contact resistance are considered. The pulsed-power supply is implemented with Simplorer V8, and the railgun is modeled by Matlab/Simulink. The data exchange is controlled by Simplorer V8. Nine experimental data have been used to validate the new model. Then, based on the validated model, a two-objective optimization pursuing both the highest velocity and the highest efficiency is carried out with the help of iSIGHT.

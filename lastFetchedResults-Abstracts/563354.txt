The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a polyclonal antibody preparation (PAP) against specific ruminal bacteria on the in situ degradability of dry-grounded maize grain (DMG), high moisture maize silage (HMMS) starch and citrus pulp (CiPu) pectin. Nine ruminally cannulated cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square design, replicated three times in a factorial arrangement of treatments of two rumen modifiers represented by monensin and PAP plus a control group, and the three energy sources (DMG, HMMS and CiPu). Each period had 21 days, where 16 were used for adaptation to treatment and five for data collection. The group treated with PAP showed an effect on the soluble fraction ("a") of DMG starch, decreasing it by respectively 45.3% and 45.4% compared to the CON and MON groups. No effect of PAP was observed for any in situ degradability parameters of starch from HMMS or pectin of CiPu. It was concluded that the polyclonal antibody preparation had limited effect on the in situ degradability of the tested energy sources

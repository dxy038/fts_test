The authors examine a novel approach to online identification and control that requires substantially weaker excitation and works in closed-loop systems. This approach also uses multiple objective optimization theory to resolve the conflict between identification and controller performance as they compete for the only available resource, the inputs to the aircraft. The approach is applied to a longitudinal model of a representative linearized high-performance aircraft model. Simulation results compare the final controller with a conventional gain scheduled pitch command augmentation system. It is demonstrated that, by allowing some control input to be given to the identification process, the controllerÂ´s overall performance is improved

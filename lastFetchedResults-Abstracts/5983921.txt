The main objective of earthquake engineering is to anticipate the impact of earthquakes on buildings and other civil structures in order to minimize the risk of damage. In contemplation of this purpose, high-grade, accurate and extensive pools of building-specific parameters like construction types, construction year and dwelling information can dramatically assist in risk assessment, analysis and evaluation thereof. In order to collect this information, we propose an on-line web service for easy assessment of civil structures, addressed primarily to non-professionals and non-technicians with a dedicated focus on accessibility.

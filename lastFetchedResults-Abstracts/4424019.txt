This paper presents a new strategy for robust dynamic output-feedback control synthesis for uncertain discrete-time linear time-invariant systems represented by polytopic models. It is proposed a multiobjective optimization problem to guarantee tracking response specifications, disturbance rejection, and noise attenuation. The novelty is to consider as an additional objective function the minimization of the H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm of the error between the closed-loop transfer function from the reference signal to the controlled output and a reference model to attain the tracking response specifications. It is applied a two step iterative procedure to solve the bilinear matrix inequality problem. A numeric example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of combining the closed-loop reference model together with other control objectives.

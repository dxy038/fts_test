A solution technique is formulated and provided for the electricity procurement problem faced by a large consumer. The objective of this consumer is to minimise procurement cost while limiting the risk of cost fluctuation due to pool price volatility. Electricity sources include the pool, bilateral contracts and self-production. Uncertainty is related to electricity pool prices. A realistic case study is analysed and results presented. Conclusions are duly drawn.

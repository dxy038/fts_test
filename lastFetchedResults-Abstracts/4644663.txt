This paper describes the main challenges of implementing a multimedia on demand system (TetraMoD) for emergency scenarios. The objective of this system is to offer a complete solution for providing multimedia services (video on demand and reliability file transfer) to a rescue team in an emergency situation. This multimedia system will improve the traditional emergency communications. We propose to integrate the use of different networks, TETRA and DVBT, characterized by a wide geographical coverage and broadband broadcast, respectively. This system consists of the following elements: a TetraMoD gateway - the unit deployed on as interface between TETRA and DVBT networks- and a middleware TetraMoD client -the software for the client terminal. A real scenario and example of communication using standard protocols (SDP, RTP/RTCP, RTSP, FLUTE) are showed.

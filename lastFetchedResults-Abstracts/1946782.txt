The objective of this research was to investigate cellulase adsorption and recycling during enzymatic hydrolysis of two differently pretreated wheat straws (WS). Dilute acid treated WS showed lower hydrolysis yield of polysaccharides fraction and adsorbed more cellulase with hydrolyzed residue than dilute alkali treated sample. Four methods capable of recovering and recycling the enzyme bound to the residual substrate and the enzyme free in solution were used for three consecutive rounds of hydrolysis to compare their recycling efficiencies. Compared to the absorption recycling method, ultrafiltration recycling method possessed the capacity to retain β-glucosidase, thereby avoiding the supplementation of fresh β-glucosidase in subsequent rounds of hydrolysis. It was found that whatever recycling method was used, better recycling results were obtained for dilute alkali treated substrate than for dilute acid treated substrate. These results suggested that the great difference in the lignin content between acid treated WS and alkali treated WS would significantly affect enzymatic hydrolysis, cellulase adsorption and cellulase recycling efficiencies.

The mathematical model and the self-organizing optimization algorithm are proposed to solve the cast planning problem which determines the cast number as well as the selection and the sequence of charges. The cast planning problem is modeled as the traveling salesman problem with the objective of the minimum of the sum of fixed cast fees, continuous-cast penalty costs of consecutive charges and unselected charges costs. The proposed self-organizing optimization algorithm, which is inspired by Synergetics, is composed of competition factor, cooperation operator and order parameters. The actual example shows the effectiveness of the model and the self-organizing optimization algorithm for the cast planning problem.

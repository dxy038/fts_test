Nowadays, optimization is becoming one of the most important techniques in engineering and industry to provide competing products in design and manufacturing. Therefore, it is necessary  to search for optimum designs with productibility. In aerospace industry reducing weight and improving the reliability of  products are major concerns. Regarding the gearbox one of the most important parts in the helicopter propulsion system, these objects should be considered further. However, most of the existing designs consider only one object, hence, it is vital to implement optimization techniques to include different objectives to improve the existing designs and provide optimum products. In this paper, optimum design parameters including module and face width of gears for the main gearbox of Sikorsky ASH-3D helicopter have been determined (modified) using single and multi-objective mixed discrete- continuous optimization method to minimize weight of the gearbox, increase the safety factor and reduce the difference between safety factors of different gears. The results show that the weight of the gears can be reduced by 27.24% compared  with the existing gearbox. The results of the multiobjective optimization have also been presented as Pareto front diagram which can be used by  manufacturers to satisfy the preferred requirements.

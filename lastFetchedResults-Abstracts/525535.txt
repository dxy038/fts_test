The present research aims at surveying the impact of police performance over feeling secure on the part of Tehrani citizens.

Material and Methods: The research was of survey and descriptive type. A questionnaire was used for gathering information. The statistical community includes all individuals over 16 who live in Tehran; the sample was selected through cluster and random sampling methods (n=980). Findings: The results of the research indicates that police capability that is to say, its hardware power foregoes its moral factors and social activities. Testing the hypotheses indicates that there was a significant relationship between the two variables of police's operational capability (promptitude, advanced equipment and facilities, and regular patrols) and police's social activities (more contribution and interaction with the public) with feeling secure on the part of citizens. The professional attitude of police including commitment and performance accuracy, law orientation, not giving favor to some people and bribery can make citizens feel more secure. Conclusion: The result of the analyses indicate that police operational capability can not solely impact the citizens' feeling of security, but it is police training and professional attitude and its interaction with the society, and promoting the quality of police performance all over the society, will enhance feeling of security among citizens, as well.

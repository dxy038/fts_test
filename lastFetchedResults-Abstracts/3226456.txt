The objective of this paper is to develop mathematical model of Photovoltaic (PV) module and study effects of environmental factors on its performance. Output of PV module strongly depends on environmental conditions like solar irradiance, ambient temperature and wind speed etc. Mathematical model is developed in Matlab/Simulink environment by considering effect of above conditions. Maximum power point voltage and PV module temperature relationship is determined utilizing simulated results. An attempt has been done to develop Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on cell temperature and solar irradiance to improve the efficiency of PV power generation system.

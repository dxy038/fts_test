The high-field phenomena in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with various physical and chemical properties have been investigated at 90&#176;C. The objective of this paper is to present the influence of film density and carbonyl groups. The high-field conduction and the electrical breakdown were found to strongly depend upon the film density. It was also shown that not only the concentration but also the type of carbonyl groups affect the high-field conduction

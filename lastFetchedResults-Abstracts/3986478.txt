A hybrid fuzzy neural networks and genetic algorithm (GA) system is proposed to solve the difficult and challenging problem of constructing a system model from the given input and output data to predict the quality of chemical components of the finished sintering mineral. A bidirectional fuzzy neural network (BFNN) is proposed to represent the fuzzy model and realize the fuzzy inference. The learning process of BFNN is divided into off-line and online learning. In off-line learning, the GA is used to train the BFNN and construct a system model based on the training data. During online operation, the algorithm inherited from the principle of backpropagation is used to adjust the network parameters and improve the system precision in each sampling period. The process of constructing a system model is introduced in details. The results obtained from the actual prediction demonstrate that the performance and capability of the proposed system are superior

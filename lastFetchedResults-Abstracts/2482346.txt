Objective: The present study aimed to clarify dissociative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and its
association with negative and positive symptom of schizophrenia.
Methods: Based on the 4th edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)
criteria, 80 schizophrenic subjects were randomly selected from patients who referred to the clinics of psychiatry
hospital in Kerman, Iran. Eighty non-schizophrenic patients were chosen as the control group. Both groups were
evaluated for dissociation symptom using the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES). Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score was also used in the case group for determination of positive and negative
symptom of schizophrenia.
Results: The prevalence of dissociation symptom was 13% and 4% among schizophrenic and control groups,
respectively (p = 0.02). In addition, there was a statistical significant association between DES score and positive
symptom in schizophrenia (p = 0.02).
Conclusion: The association between dissociative symptom and schizophrenia was significant and
dissociative symptoms were associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

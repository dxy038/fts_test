Background and Objective: Phenol presence in water and wastewater is interesting because of its stability in environment and health problems. Therefore, it must be removed for water pollution prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate phenol adsorption from aqueous solutions using walnut green hull. Materials and Methods: This was an experimental study in which walnut green hull was used as biosorbent with a range of mesh 40. In this study, stock solution of phenol was prepared and effects of effective parameters such as pH (4,6,8, and10), contact time (3-60 min), adsorbent dosage (0.25-5 g/L), and initial phenol concentration (10,20,40, and 50 mg/L) on adsorption process were evaluated. Moreover results were evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and first order and pseudo-second order kinetics. All experiments were conducted in double and the mean adsorption rate was reported. Results: The maximum adsorption capacity of 30.30 mg/g corresponded with Langmuir model. Kinetic evaluation indicated that the adsorption of phenol by the walnut green hull clearly followed the pseudo-second order reaction. It was found that increasing contact time and adsorbent dosage would lead to increasing of adsorption of phenol and increasing pH and initial phenol concentration lead to decreasing of phenol adsorption. Maximum phenol removal was achieved at pH 4, with more than 99.9 % efficiency. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the walnut green hull can be used effectively in phenol removal, because walnut green hull is agriculture waste and is produced annual in high volume hence, it can be used as adsorbent in phenol removal from wastewater.

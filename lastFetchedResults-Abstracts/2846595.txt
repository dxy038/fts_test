Most of the current operations are supported by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) potentially augmented with Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) and Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS). ABAS system integrates on-board information that can for example be provided by Inertial Navigation System (INS) so as to enhance the performance of the navigation system. GNSS/INS hybridization is already performed on current commercial aircraft. This solution allows reaching better performance in terms of accuracy, integrity, availability and continuity than the two separated solutions. Hybridization principle is based on the use of GNSS to estimate the inertial drift. It allows navigating in oceanic en-route operations down to non-precision approaches for long range aircraft. The most stringent requirements for precision approaches or automatic landings cannot be reached with the current GNSS/INS hybridization schemes. In the framework of my PhD stud, the idea is to extend the hybridization filter by including other data available onboard. The global objective of the work is to propose a system that will be able to fuse the multiple sources of information or measurement in a global architecture. The current paper focus on a solution that integrates a video system within an EKF GNSS/INS architecture during approach and landing of an aircraft.

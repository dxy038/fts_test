Object tracking is the process of locating moving objects over time using the camera in video sequences. The objective of object tracking is to associate target objects in consecutive video frames. Object tracking requires location and shape or features of objects in the video frames. So, object detection and object classification is the preceding steps of object tracking in computer vision application. To detect or locate the moving object in frame, Object detection is first stage in tracking. After that, detected object can be classified as vehicles, human, swaying tree, birds and other moving objects. It is challenging or difficult task in the image processing to track the objects into consecutive frames. Various challenges can arise due to complex object motion, irregular shape of object, occlusion of object to object and object to scene and real time processing requirements. Object tracking has a variety of uses, some of which are: surveillance and security, traffic monitoring, video communication, robot vision and animation. This paper presents the various techniques of object tracking in video sequences through different phases using image processing.

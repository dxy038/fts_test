Nowadays the market of halal products is widely distributed throughout the world. This has caused an increase in the demand for halal products not only by Islamic countries but also by non-Islamic countries. Hence, as halal is applicable not only to the Muslim people but also to the others, this causes the products to become well known globally as well as emphasizes the need for a halal supply chain. In view of that, a halal supply chain is vital in ensuring that the concept of halal is not only applicable for the food itself but also for the entire supply chain starting from the farm to the customer. Furthermore, the `halalan toyyibanÂ´ concept which means wholesome also encompasses safety, quality and cleanliness of foods, and its logistics process becomes more attractive and lucrative. As a consequence, the aim of this study is to identify and distinguish the factors which lead to an effective halal supply chain in the food industry in Malaysia. In order to achieve this objective, a conceptual model is proposed based on the results of the interviews conducted with those who deal directly or indirectly with the poultry industry. The study found that halal animal feed, proper slaughtering and proper segregation are the three pertinent areas that need to be focused on in the halal food supply chain. Thus, the proposed conceptual model can be used as a guide or information for future halal logistics research.

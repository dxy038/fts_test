Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that merges virtual objects with real-world images seamlessly. The power of real-time interaction and complete immersion makes AR ideal for language learning in that the exposure and motivation are two important factors. Therefore, we propose a Virtual English Classroom empowered with marker less AR technologies and 3D gesture interactions, called VECAR. The proposed vision-based interface is intuitive and convenient for users to play around with free hands, without the need of keyboard and mouse. The objective of VECAR is to make English teaching more interesting to increase learnersÂ´ motivations.

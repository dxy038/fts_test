
Background and Objective: Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection causing ulcers, diabetic foot and enhance nail infection. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of onychomycosis in type II diabetes.

Material and methods: This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 300 diabetic patients selected randomly among those referred to Panje Azar endocrinology clinic. They were examined for peripheral vascular disease, Skin lesions, diabetic foot and Peripheral neuropathy. The Laboratory tests such as FBS, HbA1c, Direct smear and fungal culture were used.  

Results: The patients with onychomycosis were 19 (6.3%) their mean age was 53.65Â±1.04; the youngest was 28 and the oldest 84. The male to female infection ratio was of 1.08 that was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in regards to ethnicity, age, BMI, FBS, HbA1C. The location of the infection was 16 on feet (29.6%), and three on both hands and feet   (P = 0.000)  

Conclusion: The prevalence of fungal infection was less frequent than that of other studies. Given that there was no significant relationship between different demographic data and its prevalence, further studies with larger sample size are needed.

The objective of the present study is to drive or charge a ZigBee device by intermittent microwave power transmission, which is compatible with the wireless sensor network. We found out that intermittent microwave power transmission drove the rectifier circuit with high efficiency at the average consumed power of the ZigBee devices. Also we confirmed that the ZigBee device could communicate correctly in high power density with intermittent microwave irradiation; whereas it could not communicate robustly in slight power density with continuous microwave irradiation. We finally demonstrated that the ZigBee device worked and communicated correctly without a battery by intermittent microwave power transmission.

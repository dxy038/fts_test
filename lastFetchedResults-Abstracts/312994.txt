The objective of this study was to compare knee angles and moments of healthy subjects (n=20) and subjects that were anterior cruciate ligament deficient (ACLD) (n=16) during stepping and crossover cutting activities. Subjects that were ACLD were separated into high (n=7) and low (n=9) functioning groups based on knee functional ratings. Knee angles and moments were estimated using three dimensional motion tracking and force plate data. The results suggest that knee angle and moment data were associated with level of functioning of ACLD subjects. Primarily knee frontal and transverse plane moments distinguished the stepping and crossover cut activities. Only some of the findings for the ACLD group were attributed to increasing knee stability.

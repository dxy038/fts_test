The modified Bark spectral distortion (MBSD), used for an objective speech quality measure, was presented previously (see IEEE Speech Coding Workshop, p.55-6, 1997). The MBSD measure takes into account the noise masking threshold in order to use only audible distortions in the calculation of the distortion measure. Preliminary simulation results have shown improvement of the MBSD over the conventional BSD. In this paper, performance of the MBSD is reported in terms of frame sizes, speech classes, and spectral regions. The performance of the MBSD is not very sensitive to the frame size. The performance of the MBSD for voiced speech is almost the same as for non-silent speech. The high frequency region appears to play an important role in human perception of speech quality

Intercom headsets are mandatory communication apparatus in high noise environments (HNE). The headset selection in HNE, such as combat vehicles, is crucial for achieving the objectives of communication, as it serves the needs for both noise reduction and voice reproduction. Although military-grade intercom headsets are typically used under extreme environmental conditions, a standard performance evaluation method exists only for the earphone elements. In the present work we propose an integrated method for the assessment of the electroacoustic performance of HNE headsets in conditions of maximum reproduction level and high environmental noise, focusing on the voice communication quality. Objective methods, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and Speech Transmission Index (STI) are comparatively evaluated and their results are compared to subjective scores using Multiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) in order to reveal the best fit metrics.

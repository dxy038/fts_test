This paper solves an economic multi-objective optimization problem through two improved intelligent optimization methods, one is multi-objective genetic algorithms named RNPGA (random niche pareto genetic algorithms), and the other is improved PSO (particle swarm optimization) with linear inertia weight reduction, which the constraints is in a specified region. Moreover we calculate the model through programming and give the simulation results. Computing results show the validity and advancing of the methods and the PSO algorithm is more quickly to solve the actual problem.

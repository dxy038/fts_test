Studies of obesity and eating disorders need objective tools of Monitoring of Ingestive Behavior (MIB) that can detect and characterize food intake. In this paper we describe detection of food intake by a Support Vector Machine classifier trained on time history of chews and swallows. The training was performed on data collected from 18 subjects in 72 experiments involving eating and other activities (for example, talking). The highest accuracy of detecting food intake (94%) was achieved in configuration where both chews and swallows were used as predictors. Using only swallowing as a predictor resulted in 80% accuracy. Experimental results suggest that these two predictors may be used for differentiation between periods of resting and food intake with a resolution of 30 seconds. Proposed methods may be utilized for development of an accurate, inexpensive, and non-intrusive methodology to objectively monitor food intake in free living conditions.

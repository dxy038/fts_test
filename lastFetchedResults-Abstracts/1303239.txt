The objective of this paper is to describe an unusual coordination polymer, M4(μ4-O)(bipy)(m-BDC)3 (sM4 = Zn2.36 Co1.64, bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine, m-H2BDC = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid) (1), which has been hydrothermally synthesised and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, XRPD, IR, TGA, ICP, atomic absorption, and element analysis. 1 crystallizes in the P42/mnm space group and contains a M4O(O2C)6 secondary building unit (SBU) with an inclined interpenetrated (4, 4) topology, and is a rare combination of the two most successful approaches to coordination polymer design: generation of metal carboxylate SBUs and the use of pyridyl donor bridges. Moreover, complex 1 exhibits intense fluorescence at about 424 nm (λex = 312 nm) in the solid state.

This paper describes the philosophy and the implementation of a preventive control algorithm for application in power system dynamic security assessment. The methodology consists of an optimization procedure where: the objective function takes into account economic costs; inequality constraints confine the trajectory of the system in a practical domain of the state space; and equality constraints derive from the discretization of the differential-algebraic equations of the power system sparse representation. The algorithm has been implemented to reschedule the power system generation in order to guarantee transient stability. The feasibility of the approach is shown through computer simulation tests on a realistic sized test network

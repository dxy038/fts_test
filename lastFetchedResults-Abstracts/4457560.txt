In Qualcomm High Data Rate System, a base station chooses the user with the highest ratio between demand rate and cumulative rate to transmit in each slot time. This scheduling method, namely propositional fairness scheduling, solves a trade-off between fairness and efficiency. This fairness corresponds to a network utility maximization problem with the logarithmic aggregate objective function. However, this approach only considers the instant rates while fairness should be considered for the long term where the cumulative rates are more suitable. This paper proposes a proportional quasi-fairness optimization framework for wireless ad hoc networks to guarantee fairness of the cumulative data rates. The framework can be extended for other schemes such as max-min fairness and throughput maximization.

The purpose of environmental design practice is not only to provide an artistic medium to express themself artistically. Best design solutions and satisfactory design approaches arise from identification of problems and objective orientation toward design issues. This necessitates the identification of users’ needs and concerns in the beginning of the design process, in order to produce desirable and efficient solutions, although it may not always interest designers.
Identification of various aspects of design problems includes getting access to the proper knowledge regarding to environment and its constituent parts such as suitable settings and furnishings as well as identification of the activities. This implies that the product of designing buildings and any other physical environments must be based on understanding the human nature and characteristics which means that design need to respond to culture.
In fact  no design solution can claim perfection, it can only achievable when it is based on the best available information and data at any given moment in time; Therefore culture as representative of people - environment interaction, should be regarded as the main area of investigations and it is the subject of change and transformation according to the advances in human knowledge. Design must consider culture and information that leads design process towards achieving appropriate human - environment relationship. This requires to give  priority to a comprehensive research,  based on the state of  the art of related studied, and the most up- to- date available  knowledge, rather than to the designer’s personal preferences. Their intuition might form hypotheses which is important for design disciplines to learn.In order to examine the success of a design solution, it is critical for designers to set the goal and objectives in advance to any exploration of ideas and artistic endeavors.

The paper describes a more efficient and effective standardized framework for distributing information in a networked or Web-based environment. This architecture provides a framework where many diverse networked applications can work in a collaborative environment sharing data and displays. Technologies such as CORBA, DCOM, and RMI provide the mechanism for communication and distribution of information. The objective is to provide an architecture where multiple distributed applications and users can share information in a heterogeneous environment using a wide range of applications and data within the framework without compromising any of the COE DII/NGII standards and objectives. This architecture is designed to support maximum platform portability and adherence to software standards. The paper describes the existing data sharing problem, presents an architecture to solve the problem, and describes the integration of these application components and services into existing C4I systems

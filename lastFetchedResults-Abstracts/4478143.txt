Contacts Address Book (CAB)´s maintenance is a big problem because each user has to deal with hundreds of contact information in his or her address book. Data Lock-in also hurdle their desire to change mobile platform for new applications. In this paper, we solve this problem by exploiting the online social network (OSN), making mobile users maintain their own contacts information and still get every friend´s most recent information by sharing the information through the social network We transform the existing contacts address books function with social network aware function and build a social network since a huge network with enormous number of nodes (users) and edges (relations) could be built very quickly as there are billions of mobile users and almost every mobile user has an contacts address book inside the mobile phone and that address book is the real relationships (contacts). This social network is named LiveS Cube because its design objective is making mobile devices simple, secured and shared (LiveS3). We deploy the LiveS Cube in the real campus environment for about a half year and collect interesting data and problems. The implementation of this social network is also presented and some unexpected problems came out and it turned out to be quite difficult to be built from scratch.

In this paper, we propose an objective metric for quality evaluation of individual object segmentation in images. Using the Jaccard Index as a base, additional compensation terms are integrated into our metric. These terms not only allow our metric to combine region-based and boundary-based methods, they also describe human visual tolerance and saturation. This metric can also can adaptively adjust &#8220;perception function&#8221; under different image sizes. The experiment on our subjective object segmentation quality assessment database demonstrates that the proposed metric performs well in matching subjective ratings.

This paper presents dynamic performance improvement of the bidirectional battery chargers using predictive current control. The proposed controller is designed using the small signal analyses and derived transfer functions considering the equivalent battery circuit to extend an effective operational range for wide input voltage variations via or from wide battery voltage variations. With analytical modeling and control, the proposed controller achieved over the wide input voltage and load current range. For validation, the converter showed better and fast performance in both steady state and transient state than conventional linear control methods. Simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed PPC.

Distribution system optimization tools can be used to solve different planning and operation problems. The conceptual development of these tools has been carried out by using single-objective and multi-objective formulations. In the latter case, the results are characterized by a plurality of non-dominated solutions forming the Pareto front. A further step is to provide a ranking of these solutions to assist the decision maker in choosing the preferred solution. This paper illustrates the various types of optimization approaches used to formulate problems involving the distribution networks, setting the focus on the application of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools. Some details are provided on the effectiveness of using MCDM algorithms for ranking the solutions determined in a multi-objective framework, both inside the multi-objective optimization solvers and in the final best-known Pareto front.

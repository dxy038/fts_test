Both the fungus Monascus sp. and adlay possess functional components effective in improving human health. The fungus was inoculated into adlay and a new product was produced after the colonization of fungal mycelia. Our objective was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of methanolic extracts from inoculated products [monascal polished adlay (MPA) and monascal dehulled adlay (MDA)] as compared to uninoculated products [polished adlay (PA) and dehulled adlay (DA)]. With regard to EC50 values (mg extract ml−1) of methanolic extracts, antioxidant activities were excellent and in the descending order of MDA (0.05) ≫ MPA (0.75) &gt; DA (0.83) ≫ PA (6.35). Effectiveness in reducing powers was in a descending order of MPA (0.78) &gt; MDA (1.53) ≫ PA (13.24) ∼ DA (13.67 mg ml−1). Scavenging abilities on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and chelating abilities on ferrous ions were in the descending order of MPA &gt; MDA &gt; DA &gt; PA. Total phenols were the major naturally occurring antioxidant components found. Overall, monascal adlay products displayed higher antioxidant activity, reducing power, scavenging and chelating abilities and higher in total phenol content than uninoculated adlay products.

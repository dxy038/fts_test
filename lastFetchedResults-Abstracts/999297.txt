Introduction: According to the world statistics, Breast Cancer (BC) is the second common cancer among women and Iran is also faced with the increase of this disease. Based on current studies, methods of early BC-detection may reduce mortality caused by BC. 
The main objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of training breast cancer screening on beliefs in university students of Tehran University by application of heath belief model (HBM).
Methods: By the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of training breast cancer screening on beliefs of dormitory students of Tehran University, this quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was carried out. The participants were selected from the undergraduate dormitory students of Tehran University in 2008-2009. Date collection instrument was a self-made questionnaire whose validity and reliability was approved. Training was based on HBM through lectures, pamphlets, films and slides. Data were analyzed by SPSS statistical software version 14 and analytical indicators and descriptive statistics. Paired T-test was used in order to compare the participants before and after training. Statistical test was measured by 95 percent assurance. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Results: Mean age of participants was 21Â±1.11. 92 cases (92.9%) of them were single and 7 cases (7.1%) were married. Paired T-test revealed a statistically significant difference between the mean score of HBM constructs (sensitivity, severity, obstacles, perceived benefits, performing instructions) at pre-test and post-test studies. (p < 0.0001). According to chi-square test, no significant difference was observed between marital status, place of birth, students' age and constructing elements of HBM (p=0.35).
Conclusion: Training breast-cancer screening can promote beliefs about self-examination of breast among university students.

Structural optimization, when approached by conventional (gradient based) minimization
algorithms presents several difficulties, mainly related to computational aspects for the huge
number of nonlinear analyses required, that regard both Objective Functions (OFs) and
Constraints. Moreover, from the early '80s to today's, Evolutionary Algorithms have been
successfully developed and applied as a computational alternative to many optimization
problems, such as structural ones. In this study the effectiveness of a relatively new
Evolutionary Algorithm, namely Differential Evolutionary, is investigated for constrained
optimization. This presents many interesting advantages and so that it is a candidate to be
widely used in many real structural optimization problems. The algorithm version here used
has been developed by hybridizing some recent versions of Differential Evolutionary
algorithms proposed in literature, and uses a specific way for dealing with constraints which,
always, concern real structural optimization problems. The effectiveness of proposed
approach has been demonstrated by developing two cases of study, which regard simple but
very significant structural problems for steel structures, one of which is a standard benchmark
in structural optimization. The analyses show the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed
approach, so that it can be suitably ready for practical uses out of academic contest.

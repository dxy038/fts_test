In digital television networks, where the bitrates used for the transmission of video signals are variable, the issue of quality of service is of great importance. The QoS parameter of concern in this paper is the quality of MPEG-2 compressed video. Objective video quality assessment methods that can be used for continuous picture quality monitoring of digital encoding equipment at the entrance of the DVB network will be surveyed, along with parameters that can be extracted and transmitted to other parts of the network. The main objective of the contribution is to give an overview of the possibilities that exist and the progress that has been made so far

Austenite is a semi-stable phase in most stainless steels that deforms to martensite under Md30 and forms martensite type ά and ε due to the deformation in the steels. Since the distribution of strain induced martensite plays an important role in achieving desired properties, the main objective of the present work is to model martensite distribution of ά during cold rolling using finite element method and Olsen-Cohen model. In this study, the strain induced martensite transformation of 301 stainless steel during cold rolling has been simulated by ANSYS software. First, the mesh sensitivity analysis was performed and mesh optimization was set to stimulate the strain induced martensite transformation of 301 stainless steel during cold rolling. Martensite fractions in cold-rolling was simulated and compared with experimental data. Finite element analysis was performed to obtain strain and stress during cold rolling. The amount and distribution of martensite during cold rolling has been modeled. The highest stress level was observed and applied on a friction plate which was in contact with rollers and, as a result, was under the most friction; thus, the stress reduced away from the surface toward the center of the sheet. Moreover, a similar phenomenon was observed for changes in the strain. These results were also compared with experimental data that had been obtained with X-ray diffraction, with the use of a Ferritoscope, X-ray diffraction and experimental results.

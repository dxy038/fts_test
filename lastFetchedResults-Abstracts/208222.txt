Community" and "dialogue" are two basic concepts of Sociology and Critical
Theory outlined by classical sociological theories. However, these terms have
not historically been used within the discourses of Cultural Studies. Attention
has been paid to their humanistic and abstract roots but their tangible and experimental
dimensions have not yet been dealt with. Within Anthropological thought
also the objective truths of the concepts "community" and "dialogue" have not
been addressed although Foucault's focuses on issues of "power" and "space"
and Habermas' concept of'tcornrnunicative action" have tried to materialise these
issues within social sciences. In this article we show that such issues are not
merely subjects of intellectual elite discussions. We adopt an experimental orientation
in our methodology to see how much "community" and "dialogue" play
an impotant role in the everyday life of Tehrani youth. We ask how much the'
youth are aware and interested in experiencing these terms within their daily
lives. Based on our evaluation we can now conclude wether or not participation
in youth gatherings and discussions has resulted in the acquisition of a more free
and autonomous identity.

There has been an increasing need recently to develop objective quality measurement techniques that can predict perceived video quality automatically. This paper introduces two video quality assessment models. The first one requires the original video as a reference and is a structural distortion measurement based approach, which is different from traditional error sensitivity based methods. Experiments on the video quality experts group (VQEG) test data set show that the new quality measure has higher correlation with subjective quality evaluation than the proposed methods in VQEGÂ´s Phase I tests for full-reference video quality assessment. The second model is designed for quality estimation of compressed MPEG video stream without referring to the original video sequence. Preliminary experimental results show that it correlates well with our full-reference quality assessment model.

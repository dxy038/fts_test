A new objective image quality evaluation method is proposed based on DWT and HVS (Human Visual System). The sensitivity of HVS is weighted with both subband and its energy. In order to verify the reliability of WEWMSE method and to demonstrate the effectiveness, image quality evaluation experiments based on the proposed method are performed on a set of images after JPEG and JPEG2000 compression. The results show that the assessment values of the proposed method are more agreed to MOS (Mean Opinion Score) than those of the conventional method.

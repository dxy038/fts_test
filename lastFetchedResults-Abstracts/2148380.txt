Background and Objective: Nowadays, although umbilical cord blood is a commonly used source of hematopoietic stem cell, its low frequency of these cells is the main factor limiting its clinical application. The transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells derived from placenta tissue along with umbilical cord blood cells of the same sample may be an appropriate approach to solve this problem.  In this study, we tried to mimic the niche of placenta by nano fiber scaffold in order to expand the hematopoietic stem cells derived from placenta tissue.
Materials and Methods: Different stromal cells along with hematopoietic stem cells derived from placenta tissue were seeded on nano fiber scaffold produced from PLLA coated with collagen. Then, the rate of proliferation in these niches was studied.
Results: The expansion in the mimicked niche associated with 3.6 fold increase in the number of cells but the capacity of forming colonies decreased significantly (P < 0.0001). Also, the percentage of hematopoietic stem cells increased. Nevertheless, the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).  
Conclusion: Due to a decreased capacity in forming colonies of hematopoietic stem cells derived from placenta, the expansion of stem cells from a part of placenta is not an appropriate solution and other approaches such as isolation of hematopoietic stem cells from the whole placenta tissue should be considered.

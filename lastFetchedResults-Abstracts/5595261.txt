The paper presents the European ACTS project &#8220;M2VTS&#8221; which stands for Multi Modal Verification for Teleservices and Security Applications. The primary goal of this project is to address the issue of secured access to local and centralised services in a multimedia environment. The main objective is to extend the scope of application of network based services by adding novel and intelligent functionalities, enabled by automatic verification systems combining multimodal strategies (secured access based on speech, image or other information). The objectives of the project are also to show that limitations of individual technologies (speaker verification, frontal face authentication, profile identification...) can be overcome by relying on multi modal decisions (combination or fusion of these technologies)

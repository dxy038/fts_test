On the base of character of quality and quantity of mine water, ant colony algorithm is applied to optimize the site of purification plant. Aiming to industry, irrigation of agriculture, water supply of ecologic and living rural and urban residents, setting the maximum of net yield water supply, environment efficiency and society overall efficiency as object functions, using the capacity of water supply and delivery and coordination development of the social economy as constraint conditions, a multi- objective mathematical model is established to utilize different quality of mine water The model optimizes allocation of 8&#215;107 m3/a and that is the basis for reasonable utilization of coal mine water.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of a multi-scale roughness description in order to better understand the EM scattering from natural bare soils. By using a previous approach which incorporates a multi-scale description of natural surfaces into available asymptotic scattering models, a comparison between theoretical and experimental results acquired over two different sites is carried out

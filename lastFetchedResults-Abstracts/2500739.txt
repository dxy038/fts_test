Objective: Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the greatest and debilitating&nbsp;disorders, which many of its patients do not respond to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.&nbsp;In this regard, paying attention to new treatments such as transcranial direct current stimulation&nbsp;(tDCS) is important. The purpose of the present research was to examine the effects of tDCS&nbsp;on the obsession-compulsion (OC), anxiety, and depression of a patient suffering from OCD.
Methods: The present study conducted on a 23-year-old female patient with OCD. tDCS&nbsp;sessions were lasted 10 days, one session per day and each session of about 20 minutes with 2.0&nbsp;mA intensity. The results of Beck depression inventory, Hamilton anxiety rating scale, and Yale&nbsp;Brown obsessive-compulsive scale showed decrease in OC, depression, and anxiety symptoms&nbsp;after 10 sessions of tDCS.
Results: The results of the present research using cathodal tDCS on orbitofrontal cortex in&nbsp;10 sessions showed that this montage is a powerful and successful treatment for patients with&nbsp;OCD and alleviate their OC, depression, and anxiety symptoms.
Conclusion: The data were analyzed by diagram analysis and improvement percentage. This&nbsp;study showed that anodal tDCS on O2 and cathodal tDCS on orbitofrontal cortex improved&nbsp;OC, anxiety and depression symptoms. However, our findings give introductory confirmation&nbsp;that our patient with OCD has a positive response to cathode tDCS of the OFC.

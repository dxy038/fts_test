The paper discusses the application of a kinetic energy storage system, based on a high-speed composite flywheel, to regulate the DC 3/sup rd/-rail voltage on a metro network. The process of modelling the system behaviour to rate the installation correctly is described. Practical results prove the principle of using energy storage in such an application, and demonstrate that the system fulfils the metro operatorÂ´s objective.

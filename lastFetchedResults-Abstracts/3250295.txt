For the first time, a novel area-efficient, 12F<sup>2</sup> crossbar switch block featuring a bidirectional TaO diode-selected, complementary atom switch (DCAS) with diagonal programming lines has been proposed. The compact BEOL-diode, having a high current rectification ratio of 1.7&#215;10<sup>2</sup> with J<sub>max</sub>=0.6MA/cm<sup>2</sup>, enables three-terminal operation of the DCAS, realizing select-transistor-less programming and high off-state disturbance of the crossbar. The developed DCAS is a strong candidate for realizing a nonvolatile and low-power programmable logic.

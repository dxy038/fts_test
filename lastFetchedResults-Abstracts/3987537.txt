Microwave filters play an important role in modern wireless communications. A novel method for the design of multilayer dielectric and open loop ring resonator (OLRR) filters under constraints is presented. The proposed design method is based on generalized differential evolution (GDE3), which is a multiobjective extension of differential evolution (DE). GDE3 algorithm can be applied for global optimization to any engineering problem with an arbitrary number of objective and constraint functions. GDE3 is compared against other evolutionary multiobjective algorithms like nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and multiobjective particle swarm optimization with fitness sharing (MOPSO-fs) for a number of microwave filter design cases. In the multilayer dielectric filter design case a predefined database of low loss dielectric materials is used. The results indicate the advantages of this approach and the applicability of this design method.

In Japan, Japanese Black and Holstein cattle are appreciated as popular sources of meat, and imported beef from Australia and the United States is also in demand in the meat industry. Since the BSE outbreak, the problem of false sales has arisen: imported beef has sometimes been mislabeled as domestic beef due to consumer concerns. A method is needed to correctly discriminate between Japanese and imported cattle for food safety. The objective of this study was to develop breed discrimination markers between Japanese and US cattle using a 50K SNP array. As a result, five US-specific markers (BISNP7, BISNP15, BISNP21, BISNP23, and BISNP26) were developed with allelic frequencies that ranged from 0.102 (BISNP15) to 0.250 (BISNP7) and averaged 0.184. The combined use of the five markers would permit discrimination between Japanese and US cattle with a probability of identification of 0.858. This result indicates the potential of the bovine 50K SNP array as a powerful tool for developing breed identification markers. These markers would contribute to the prevention of falsified beef displays in Japan.

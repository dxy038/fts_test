The authors propose a novel post-processing technique, which reduces blocking artefacts by restoring the surface continuity of images disturbed during the compression process. The proposed technique reduces blocking artefacts by representing a blocky image by a linear combination of continuous functions with directional property. The simulation results show that the proposed technique provides good subjective, as well as objective, qualities

The complication of multiple reciprocating plunger pumps and centrifugal multilevel pumps connected in parallel in the pumping stations has been a challenge for decision makers to meet the demand of the efficiency and cost-effective production. In this paper, an efficiency mathematical model and an effective pump scheduling problem based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) are proposed. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of pumps operation to balance the total water flow rate of the system within the constant-pressure constraint and constraints of optimal operation for pumps in the system. An improved GA with competition cross method is designed and applied to solve this problem. Computative simulations show that the proposed method is effective for pump scheduling in an oilfield water injection system.

The objective of this work is to recreate the sensorial conditions of scuba diving in the most frequented public aquatic spaces - Beaches and Swimming pools. The version of the device included is autonomous, mobile and easily transportable by one person in a backpack. It can also be easily installed, equipped with GPS and wireless systems, and has positive buoyancy. Also, the possibility to integrate a component that may give a self-propelling capacity may be considered. In fact, by reducing the length of the anchoring cable, it will be possible to modify the depth of immersion. The device will be used at water surface as well as underwater using a tuba (- 40 cm). Moreover, the device is equipped with one (can be upgraded for more) video camera pointing downwards. In fact, Augmented Reality contents combining actual underwater images with 3D animated images will be one of the preferred ways to use the device. Priority will be given to technical options leading to a &#8220;green&#8221; device, with renewable power consumption and built with recyclable materials.

This paper investigates energy efficient resource allocation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multi-relay networks, where the source node communicates with the destination node via multiple relay nodes. Both transmit power and circuit power consumption are taken into consideration. The objective is to minimize the overall power consumption so as to achieve high energy efficiency (EE). Relay selection, bit loading, power allocation and subcarrier reduction are involved in this paper. Moreover, we propose a frequency reuse strategy named highest frequency reuse (HFR), to cut down the interference between cells. This HFR strategy deletes subcarriers which suffers from serious frequency selective fading and uses better subcarriers for transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation can enhance the EE of the system.

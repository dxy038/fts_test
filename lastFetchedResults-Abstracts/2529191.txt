
Objective: Personality is the most important infrastructure factor in addiction, and substance
abusers have certain personal weaknesses that make them vulnerable to addiction. This study
examined the role of sensation-seeking and coping strategies in predicting drug addiction in
high school students. Methods: This study is a descriptive–correlational research. Multi-stage cluster sampling
was used to select 230 high-school students in Kermanshah City. To measure the variables,
Zuckerman’s Sensation Seeking Scale Form V, Coping Strategies Questionnaire (Billings and
Moos), and the Addiction Potential Scale (Weed and Butcher) were used. Data were analyzed
using Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. Results: There was a significant relationship between sensation-seeking and drug addiction
potential among the students. Moreover, coping strategies could predict drug abuse potential,
and emotion-focused coping was the most powerful predicting variable. Conclusion: According to our results, people with a higher level of sensation-seeking and
those who use emotion-focused coping strategies are more prone to substance abuse.

Herein, a 12-year-old Afghan boy with chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis on the face and verrucous lesions on the body and pleural effusion suspected of having co-existent tuberculosis has been presented. The cutaneous lesions were appeared for five years before his admission. Leishman-Donovan bodies were seen in H&amp;E (Hematoxylin and eosin) slide of skin lesion specimens. The pathogenic species was proved to be Leishmania tropica using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method. Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) and Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) were strongly positive. The patient was treated with systemic and intralesional meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and then with anti-tuberculosis drugs for pleural effusion. Afterwards, pleural effusion was disappeared and cutaneous leishmaniasis cured.

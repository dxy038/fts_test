Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the prevalence and comorbidity of acute postoperative pancreatitis after gynecologic and obstetric surgery. Study Design: We reviewed the Mayo Medical Center surgical database (January 1953â€“January 1997) to identify all confirmed cases of acute pancreatitis occurring within the standard 6-week postoperative convalescence after obstetric and gynecologic surgical procedures. Pancreatitis as a result of concurrent pancreatic or biliary surgery was excluded. Pertinent clinical data were reviewed. Results: Eleven cases of postoperative pancreatitis were identified, with an overall incidence of 1 in 17,000 surgical procedures. Postoperative pancreatitis was more common after obstetric surgery. Identifiable risk factors were noted in 45% of cases, with occult cholelithiasis the predominant factor. Presenting signs and symptoms were primarily epigastric pain, oliguria, and ileus. Significant morbidity or mortality was noted in 27% of the cases. Conclusions: Acute postoperative pancreatitis is a rare complication after gynecologic and obstetric surgery. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis are nonspecific in the postoperative setting. Prompt diagnosis and supportive therapy are essential to minimize morbidity and mortality.

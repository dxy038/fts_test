When an image identifier is generated by using features which are extracted from the global image space and the information used for the identifier generation is not distributed over the overall image space, the generated image identifier might failed to satisfy its objective - identification of image. In this paper, in order to resolve the problem, we discuss an entropy based approach which utilize local region with enough information for identifier generation.

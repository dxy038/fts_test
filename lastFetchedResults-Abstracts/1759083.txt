Objective
ermine whether parental reports and electronic health record documentation of physician counseling on nutrition and physical activity reflect actual counseling provided.
s
ipants were parents of 198 children 2 to 12 years of age seen in a primary care pediatric clinic at an academic medical center for well child care and their 38 physicians. Parents completed a post-visit questionnaire to report discussions on weight, nutrition, and physical activity that occurred during the visit. Electronic health records were reviewed to measure documentation of these topics during the visit. Parental reports and records were compared with actual discussions on the basis of coded audiotapes. Counseling was coded as having occurred if specific topics were mentioned during the encounter, however brief this mention was.
s
l of 48% of the children were female, they were a mean age of 5.4 years, and 28% were overweight or obese. Sensitivity of parental report was high (63%–96%), but specificity was low (43%–77%) because of parents’ tendency to overreport counseling. Sensitivity of electronic health record documentation was generally low (40%–53%) except for discussion of screen time (92%) and physical activity (88%); the specificity of these data was also poor (42% and 21%, respectively, for screen time and physical activity).
sions
onic health record documentation may not be the most valid method of measuring physician counseling on weight, nutrition, and physical activity in pediatric primary care. Parental report via the use of a questionnaire administered immediately after the visit is a better alternative in quality improvement or research studies when resources do not allow for direct observation, with the caveat that parents may overreport whether counseling was provided.

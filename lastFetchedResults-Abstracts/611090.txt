It is not possible to eliminate the workplace emergencies but can be
mitigated by effective planning. In all the construction organizations
the possibility of facing emergencies is common. The objective of
emergency management is to minimize losses that result out of
emergencies. The employees in construction organizations are
susceptible various workplace emergencies like fire, explosion,
collapse of a structure/excavated side walls, scaffolding and tower
cranes etc.. Site-specific emergency plan is to be prepared to prevent
emergencies in construction organizations. The emergency
preparedness plan must comprise of identifying probable emergencies
and how to respond to emergency situation so as to minimize the total
response time of employees to report to emergency assembly point. In
most of the construction organizations in India are following
conventional methods instead of implementing scientific techniques in
emergency planning particularly while earmarking emergency
assembling points and also allocation employees to assembly points
resulting into wastage of time, damage to employees and property. A
study was conducted in a construction organization involved in
construction of 2*660MW thermal power plant in India by using
combination of optimization techniques like shortest route algorithm
for identifying optimal paths and depending on the capacities of
assembly points ,the employees are allocated to different assembly
points by using transportation model .In a case of a major emergency
, the minimal spanning tree technique is used to identify the shortest
route for a specific assembly point.

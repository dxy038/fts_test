Background: Premature ejaculation is the most common disorder in men. Different methods have been proposed to recover this problem while, often most of them have been unsuccessful in practice due to multiple after comes. 
Objective: Our study aimed to compare the effect of combination extracts of “Boswellia serrata” and “Lavandula angustifolia” and placebo on recovery of premature ejaculation.
Methods: Both plants were extracted and formulized for administration. Choosing patients was based on medical standards, questionnaire of premature ejaculation and standard criteria test. The proper cases were categorized randomly in one of three groups under study regarding DSM5 criteria. The number of samples in each group has hypothesized 30 and investigation continued for two month for all groups: oral extract administered group, placebo treatment group and no premature treatment as a control group. The scores gained form fast ejaculating questionnaire were assessed in early stages of treatment (pretest), one month after treatment (posttests), and two month after treatment (fallow).
Results: The results showed that combination therapy with plant extracts was significantly potent to reduce premature ejaculation performance scores index than placebo and control group; the F value calculated for assessing drug effect in recovery of premature ejaculation in various stages will be meaningful in the level of 0.05 (F=14.23, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that, compounds of “Boswellia serrata” and “Lavandula angustifolia” extract can be effective in recovery of premature ejaculation opioid addicted patients. The mechanism and effective ingredients causing this effect are needed to be further investigated.

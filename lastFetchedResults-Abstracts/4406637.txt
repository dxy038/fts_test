This paper presents a new meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm using Cat-Swarm-Optimization (CSO) for an optimal placement of multiple distributed generators to achieve a higher overall system reliability in large-scale primary distribution networks. Normally, reliability issues are of major importance in power distribution system. Thus, a composite reliability index is used in the proposed work as the objective function in the optimization process. Furthermore, the effect of multiple DG placements on power transfer capacity (PTC) and power loss reduction (PLR) have been addressed. Simulations are carried out based on two practical distribution systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, an adaptive weight particle swarm optimization (AWPSO) and particle swarm optimization with constriction factor (PSO-CF) are developed for comparison purpose. The proposed algorithm results obtained indicate reliable placement of DGs with improved performance indices.

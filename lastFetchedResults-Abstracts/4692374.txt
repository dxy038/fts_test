We describe a step-by-step methodology for the design and construction of hypermedia applications and illustrate our approach using a small application. The Relationship Management Design (RMD) methodology begins with a data model of the application domain and proceeds through the design of the hypertext network, user interface and run-time dynamics finally concluding with the construction and testing of the target hypermedia system. Our ultimate objective is to use the RMD approach as the basis for the construction of computerized tools to support the design and development of hypermedia applications.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Objective: The value of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in the prediction of coronary artery disease (CAD) or myocardial infarction (MI), is an established independent risk factor for premature mi. This study was conducted to diagnose offspring at risk.Material and Methods: A total of 120 subjects were investigated. Serum Lp (a) and total serum cholesterol were measured by ELISA and serum cholesterol by enzymatic colorimetric (CHOD-PAD) method using standard kits from Spincreact, Spain.Results: Differences in levels of total Lp (a) and cholesterol were found between patients and control. Both Lp (a) 16.23Â±1.99 mg/dL and cholesterol 175.0+7.63 mg/dL of patients were higher than the controls.Conclusion: Lp (a) is a strong lipid variable predisposing to CAD.

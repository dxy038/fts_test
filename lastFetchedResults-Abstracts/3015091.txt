This paper presents a new pre-regulator boost operating in the boundary area between the continuous and discontinuous conduction modes of the boost inductor current, where the switches and boost diode performing zero-current commutations during its turn-off, eliminating the disadvantages related to the reverse recovery losses and electromagnetic interference problems of the boost diode when operating in the continuous conduction mode. Additionally, the interleaving technique is applied in the power cell, providing a significant input current ripple reduction. It should be noticed that the main objective of this paper is to present a complete modeling for the converter operating in the critical conduction mode, allowing an improved design procedure for interleaved techniques with high input power factor, a complete dynamic analysis of the structure, and the possibility of implementing digital control techniques in closed loop.

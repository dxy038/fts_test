A retrospective analysis was performed on 31 consecutive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients who commenced exemestane 25 mg/d orally following previous treatment with Tamoxifen and a non-steroidal third-generation aromatase inhibitor (AI). Patients were seen 3 monthly until clinical or radiological disease progression.

Median age was 64 years (range 34–90 yrs). The average number of recurrences before starting exemestane was three (range 1–6). There were two complete responses (CR), four partial responses (PR), 12 with stable disease (SD) and 12 with progressive disease (PD). Objective response rate (CR+PR) was 19.4% and overall clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD greater-or-equal, slanted24 weeks) was 54.8%. The median durations of objective response and overall clinical benefit were 18 and 14 months, respectively.

This data support the anti-tumour activity of exemestane 25 mg daily in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer who have been previously exposed to non-steroidal AIs and Tamoxifen.

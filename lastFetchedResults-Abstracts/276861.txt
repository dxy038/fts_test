The non-Newtonian fluid flow in a bifurcation model with a non-planar daughter branch is investigated by using finite element method to solve the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations coupled with a non-Newtonian constitutive model, in which the shear thinning behavior of the blood fluid is incorporated by the Carreau–Yasuda model. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the non-Newtonian property of fluid as well as of curvature and out-of-plane geometry in the non-planar daughter vessel on wall shear stress (WSS) and flow phenomena. In the non-planar daughter vessel, the flows are typified by the skewing of the velocity profile towards the outer wall, creating a relatively low WSS at the inner wall. In the downstream of the bifurcation, the velocity profiles are shifted towards the flow divider. The low WSS is found at the inner walls of the curvature and the lateral walls of the bifurcation. Secondary flow patterns that swirl fluid from the inner wall of curvature to the outer wall in the middle of the vessel are also well documented for the curved and bifurcating vessels. The numerical results for the non-Newtonian fluid and the Newtonian fluid with original Reynolds number and the corresponding rescaled Reynolds number are presented. Significant difference between the non-Newtonian flow and the Newtonian flow is revealed; however, reasonable agreement between the non-Newtonian flow and the rescaled Newtonian flow is found. Results of this study support the view that the non-planarity of blood vessels and the non-Newtonian properties of blood are an important factor in hemodynamics and may play a significant role in vascular biology and pathophysiology.

This paper presents a case study for investigating a spatial rainfall distribution. This study looks at the area of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia whose a big problem in flooding during rainy season. The need of a good quality of the spatial rainfall distribution as an input for hydrological model is the motivation of this papers. The objective of this study is to find the most reliable method to describe spatial rainfall distribution according to the limited data from rain gauge stations. The present study employs deterministic and geostatistical methods. In this paper both results are compared and analyzed. Findings indicate that deterministic model give the most efficient computation, particularly spline method performs rainfall estimation very well with smallest mean square error.

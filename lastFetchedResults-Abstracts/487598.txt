Objective: Fatigue process in patients with neck pain was happened more quickly than healthy persons and neck muscle fatigue increased body sway during standing, but there is less evidence about the behavior of these muscles in dynamic conditions such as external perturbation, so this study was done to investigate the effect of muscle fatigue on onset latency of upper trapezius muscle in posterior-anterior perturbation among patients with chronic neck pain and healthy individuals. Materials & Methods: In this quasi experimental and interventional study 16 patients with chronic neck pain (intervention group) and 16 healthy individuals (control group) were selected by simple and convenient sampling and based on inclusive and exclusive criteria. Data coilcction was done by using questionnaire and doing some tests and the main equipments were dynamometer, accelero meter and surfacc electromyography. The weight equal to 30% of maximum voluntary contraction used to produce fatigue process and 10% of body weight used to produce perturbation. Independent T test, Paired T test and Repeated ANOVA were used for data analysis.

Results: There was significant difference in onset latency of upper Trapezius muscle in posterior - anterior perturbation between two groups, before (P=0,006) and after (P=0.026) fatigue, This means that the onset latency was increased in healthy individuals and decreased in patients after fatigue. Also, there was significant difference in onset latency of Trapezius muscle in posterior - anterior perturbation between before and after fatigue in patients group (P<0.001) and healthy persons group (P=0.04).

Conclusion: Pain can change the onset latcncy of trapezius muscle and possibly it can decrease musclc activity in deep muscle and change the pattern of muscle activation. Fatigue as an exaggerated risk factor can decrease onset latency of superficial musclc in patients with chronic neck pain to stabilize the system, that it can increase the risk of injury

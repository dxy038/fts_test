Mixed reality (MR), sometimes called enhanced reality, is a variety of virtual environment (VE) which explores various approaches to combine natural environment with immersive display technology. VE technologies completely immerse a user inside a synthetic environment. In contrast, MR system adds electronic data from a cyberspace on the physical space as a base, allows the users to see the real world with virtual objects superimposed upon. Moreover, MR can assist the users interact with the virtual object in the more realistic environment. The objective of our research is to investigate the potential of MR technique on improving interaction between human and computer through developing a video-see through mixed reality system. Further applications would be built upon this generic platform.

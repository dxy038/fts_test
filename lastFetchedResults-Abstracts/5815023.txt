Blocking artifacts influences image quality most important factor in the low bit-rate. New generational video coding standard for H.264, the adaptive deblocking filter plays a very important role in order to detect and analyze real and artificially edges on coded block. This paper presents a new approach for the adaptive deblocking filter of the H.264/AVC in order to improve quality. Comparing with the standard algorithm, the experimental results demonstrate the improvement in both the objective and the subjective qualities, which can achieve the improvement about 0.25~0.35 dB PSNR in average compared with the original H.264/AVC reference software JM11.0.

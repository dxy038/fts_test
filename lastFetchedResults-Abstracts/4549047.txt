The ZEUS CAL-SLT (calorimeter second-level trigger) and calorimeter data-acquisition systems, implemented on a transputer network of more than 100 transputers, are fully operational. Requirements for the CAL-SLT and readout system led to: assignment cabling of calorimeter cells to processors; the use of the INMOS transputer on account of its built-in multitasking capabilities and its straight-forward application as a building block in processor networking using its four DMA-driven bidirectional serial data links for communication; and the use of two processors for each calorimeter region, one dedicated to triggering, the other to data readout

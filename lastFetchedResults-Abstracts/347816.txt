Objective: Several studies presented evidence for magnocellular deficits in dyslexics both in behavioural as well as in electrophysiological data of local electrode sites. We investigated two well-known paradigms (motion-onset and random-dot-kinematogram) with regard to global electrophysiological parameters.
Methods: Twenty-one-channel event-related potentials (ERPs) of 16 dyslectic and 15 control children were analyzed with reference-independent methods. For each paradigm quasi stable microstates were identified by means of a data-driven segmentation procedure and compared between both groups.
Results: Differences in global ERP responses between dyslexic and control children could be found for rapid moving gratings but not for the dot coherence.
Conclusions: Dyslexic children seem to have some highly specific visual deficits in processing moving stimuli. These deficits can be related to the magnocellular system.

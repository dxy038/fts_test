Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) depends on the dense deployment of sensor nodes over a wide area. In WSN, battery is the most important resource in sensor nodes. The main objective of sensor nodes is comprised of sensing, processing and for communication. It consumes more energy mainly during transmission of data. In previous papers, virtual backbone scheduling for maximizing network lifetime has been proposed. Multiple overlapped backbones are used for scheduling the sensor nodes during transmission. This proposed work integrates Virtual Backbone Scheduling (VBS) with clustering based algorithm for low energy consumption. Here we deploy a node sleep scheduling in the context of clustered networks. Energy Efficient Data Collection (EEDC) is an effective clustering technique for wireless sensor networks. This method is based on hierarchical based clustering for cluster evolution. Therefore it leads to less reduction of energy of each sensor node during communication to the base station. This proposed method has considered to be efficient for energy minimization, data aggregation and so on.

We present two blueprints of ad-hoc wireless applications implementable on low-cost hardware platforms. For this demo we focus on a combination of MSP430F148 microcontroller with CC1100 RF module. In addition to the actual working hardware, we demonstrate a powerful emulation engine, which allows us to study virtual deployments of wireless ad-hoc networks running our applications. Our objective is to illustrate the main components of OlsonetÂ´s framework for practical ad hoc networking.

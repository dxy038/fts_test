This paper presents a new method of cancelling wideband interference from digital acoustic communication signals used in underwater communication systems. The interference is from other co-channel acoustic systems, such as navigation systems, that have a bandwidth comparable to the acoustic communication signal. The effectiveness of the new successive interference cancellation algorithm is largely due to a blind interference estimator that uses a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm

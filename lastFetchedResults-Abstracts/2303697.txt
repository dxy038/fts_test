In recent years, research on ozone variability has mainly focused on the analysis of its trend. Additionally some studies have analyzed the annual, seasonal and day-to-day ozone variations. However, intra-diurnal total ozone variations are notably less explored. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the diurnal variability of total ozone column (TOC) as recorded by a Brewer spectrophotometer in Madrid (Spain). The results show that about 90% of days present non-negligible diurnal variability, indicating that, in general, it should not be assumed that TOC remains constant throughout a particular day in urban areas. In addition, this variability has a notable seasonal behavior which should be considered (the spring and summer months show higher diurnal TOC variations than autumn and winter months). This pattern is likely caused by the diurnal photochemical processes in the lower troposphere related to the formation of tropospheric ozone near the earthâ€™s surface at populated urban locations. Thus, these diurnal fluctuations in tropospheric ozone could explain part of diurnal TOC variations (between 20% and 70% depending on the mixing layer height).

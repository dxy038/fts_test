We propose a novel evanescent wave scattering imaging method using an objective-type total internal reflection system to image and track single gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in solution. In this imaging system, only a millimeter-scale hole is employed to efficiently separate GNPs scattering light from the background reflected beam. The detailed experimental realization of the imaging system was discussed, and the effect of the hole size on imaging was investigated. We observed that the hole diameters from 2.5 to 4 mm are suitable to perform the scattering imaging by adjusting the incidence angle. The technology was successfully applied to track single gold nanoparticles in solution and on live cell membrane via the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody. Compared to total internal fluorescence microscopy, the resonance light scattering detection has no photobleaching or blinking inherent to fluorescent dyes and quantum dots. Compared to conventional dark-field microscopy, the evanescent wave illumination can be conveniently applied to study membrane dynamics in living cells. Additionally, the objective-based configuration provides a free space above the coverslip, and allows imaging and concomitant manipulation of live cells in culture by microinjection, patch-clamping, AFM and other techniques.

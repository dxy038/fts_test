The objective of this study was to evaluate the oil extraction process from walnut seeds by pressing followed by extraction with supercritical CO2. In pressing experiments, a factorial arrangement was conducted in order to study the combined effects of seed moisture content (2.5%, 4.5% and 7.5%) and pressing temperature (25, 50 and 70 °C) on oil recovery and quality parameters. For all conditions tested, the oil quality compared well with that of cold-pressed walnut oil. Oil recovery increased significantly as moisture content raised. Highest oil recovery (89.3%) was obtained at 7.5% moisture content and 50 °C temperature. The cake resulting from pressing at these conditions was extracted with CO2 in a high pressure pilot plant with single stage separation and solvent recycle. The effects of two different pressures (200 and 400 bar) and temperatures (50 and 70 °C) with regard to oil yield and quality, and time required for extraction were analyzed. At each condition, the extraction rate changed with the mass of solvent and extraction time. At first, the mass of oil extracted was determined by the oil solubility in CO2 and a linear relationship was observed, where the slope results in the solubility of oil in CO2 at the experiment conditions. After that, the extraction rate was governed by solubility and diffusion, and continuously decreased with time. The colour changed along the extraction from a whitish clear product to a yellow one. Tocopherol and carotenoid contents were significantly higher than those obtained by pressing. Extraction conditions did not affect significantly the fatty acid composition.

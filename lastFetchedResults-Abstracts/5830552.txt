This study scrutinizes service quality in academic libraries in the Northern Region of Malaysia. By studying their implementation of quality service, it is hoped that this paper may give a useful insight to the academic libraries and other related bodies on the extent of the quality service provided to the users. It could also be useful as a guideline to develop an appropriate model of quality service in academic libraries. The main objective of this study is to examine the users´ acceptance of the service quality implementation in academic libraries. This study adopted a modified SERVQUAL model by Parasuraman [1988]. Five determinants of service quality were identified, which are Library as a Place, Access, Collection, Realibility and Empathy. The Stratified Random Sampling was used to choose the sample of this study. With an estimation of 36,000 users of academic libraries at all five public universities in Northern Regions, at least 379 respondents are needed to ensure a well representative of the population [Sekaran, 2003]. Results from Pearson´s Correlation Matrix suggested that all null hypotheses should be rejected, thus, confirmed that all six dimensions of service quality in this study significantly explained the customers´ satisfaction level.

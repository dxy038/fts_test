The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effect of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine, Improvac (Pfizer Ltd.), on the levels of GnRH antibodies, testosterone, estrone sulphate (E1S) and androstenone, as well as skatole and indole in male pigs. Additionally, the long-term effect of immunocastration on social and sexual behaviour was studied. Male pigs were assigned to two treatment groups: a treatment group given two doses of Improvac (n = 12) and a control group of entire male pigs (n = 12). The pigs were kept either 16 or 22 weeks after vaccination. Blood samples were collected five or six times; prior to both first and second vaccination, then three or four times during the 16 or 22 week period after second vaccination. Immunocastration significantly reduced levels of testosterone and E1S in plasma, and levels of androstenone in fat (P &lt; 0.001 for all). Skatole and indole levels in plasma and fat were also lower in immunocastrated pigs than in entire male pigs. These effects lasted up to 22 weeks after the second vaccination. Testis weight and bulbourethral gland length were lower in immunocastrated pigs at slaughter and these pigs showed less social, manipulating and aggressive behaviour than entire male pigs. The immunocastrated pigs remained sexually inactive throughout the study. Our study represents a further step in the evaluation of the effectiveness of Improvac as an alternative to surgical castration of entire male pigs. It shows that Improvac may have an extended effect compared with that currently implied by the directions for use.

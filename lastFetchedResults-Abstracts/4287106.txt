This work presents the first results of a part of a project under way that has a wide scope. This part of the project addresses the development of Learning Objects in Linear Time-Invariant Systems. This work communicates the use Concept Maps to identify topics in the area where Learning Objects must be developed. The final objective is that the products, the Learning Object, can be shared and reused among many disciplines in the undergraduate engineering courses of the university.

By representing the assembly by a simplified column model, a constitutive theory, referred to as sliding–rolling theory, was recently developed for a two-dimensional assembly of rods subjected to biaxial loading, and then extended to a three-dimensional assembly of spheres subjected to triaxial (equibiaxial) loading. The sliding–rolling theory provides a framework for developing a phenomenological constitutive law for granular materials, which is the objective of the present work. The sliding–rolling theory provides information concerning yield and flow directions during radial and non-radial loading. In addition, the theory provides information on the role of fabric anisotropy on the stress–strain behavior and critical state shear strength. In the present paper, a multi-axial phenomenological model is developed within the sliding–rolling framework by utilizing the concepts of critical state, classical elasto-plasticity and bounding surface. The resulting theory involves two yield surfaces and falls within the definition of the multi-mechanism models. Computational issues concerning the solution uniqueness for stress states at the corner of yield surfaces are addressed. The effect of initial and induced fabric anisotropy on the constitutive behavior is incorporated. It is shown that the model is capable of simulating the effect of anisotropy, and the behavior of loose and dense sands under drained and undrained loading.

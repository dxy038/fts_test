Earlier works on Goal Programming models for portfolio selection problem under uncertainty did not utilize the combination of the different types of uncertainty for a given problem and they only assumed the existence of stochastic or fuzzy uncertainty: These models may be too restrictive in modeling of real life decision making problems where randomness and fuzziness are often coexist. In this paper, we develop a novel fuzzy goal programming model for solving a stochastic multi-objective portfolio selection problem. In this model, the fuzzy chance-constrained goals are described along with the imprecise importance relations among them. The developed model will be utilized to build a new portfolio selection model that considers the tradeoffs between expected return, Value-at-Risk (VaR), the price earning ratio and the flexibility of investorÂ´s preferences.

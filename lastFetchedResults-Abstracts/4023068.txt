A variable-bit look-ahead Huffman decoding problem is investigated in this paper. The objective is to maximize the decoding throughput rate by exploiting different equivalent state diagrams. The decoding throughput rate is estimated based on the state transition probability of the corresponding Huffman encoding table. We propose an efficient algorithm to search for a heuristic solution that usually yields very good optimization results in polynomial computation time.

This paper aims to provide a new robust control system for an induction motor used in electric vehicle (EV). The speed control is based on a polynomial RST controller which can reject disturbance with no steady state errors. High-dynamic performance is obtained using the indirect stator-flux-oriented control (ISFOC) and the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) techniques. For current regulation, we proposed a new fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller based on the multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithm (EA). Therefore an excellent start-up response is obtained furthermore the desired dynamic response without unexpected switching behaviour. The proposed control strategies have been simulated on a 3-kW induction-motor drive for an EV. Simulation results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

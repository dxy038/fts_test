The use of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) for cryogen-free gyrotron magnets will greatly reduce the power requirement and overall physical size of the system. Because some gyrotron systems are mounted on a vehicle and need to be mobile, the refrigeration system must be as lightweight and compact as possible. Cryomagnetics previously built a BSCCO magnet based on the design of a NbTi magnet. The limiting factors with this magnet were the cost of the BSCCO material and the excessive weight due to the necessity of field-shaping iron. Since it is projected that the cost of 2G YBCO tape will become significantly lower than BSCCO, and the critical current will also increase, the next generation of these magnets will mitigate those problems. The first objective was to study quench behavior in HTS coils. Cryomagnetics has also designed, built and successfully tested a 3.57 T magnet wound with 2G YBCO tape. This is the first full-scale magnet of its kind built using 2G YBCO tape. It consists of 10 double-pancakes operating at 140 A and 20 K. A single-stage cryocooler is used to cool the magnet. Because the performance of YBCO material is improving quickly, future magnets will be able to operate at lower current, higher temperature and will be lighter weight.

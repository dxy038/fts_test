The objective was to examine whether previous coronary artery disease (CAD) influences the add-on effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan on cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients who participated in the Kyoto Heart Study. The primary end point was the same as in the main study: a composite of new-onset and/or worsening of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Median follow-up was 3.27 years. According to the presence of previous CAD at baseline, the study population was divided into 2 groups (with CAD, n = 707; without CAD, n = 2,324) in which primary end-point events occurred more frequently in patients with CAD than in patients without CAD (15.1% vs 5.6%, hazard ratio [HR] 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.11 to 3.42). Add-on valsartan significantly decreased the occurrence of the primary end-point events in patients with CAD (11.3% vs 19.0%, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) and without CAD (3.7% vs 7.6%, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70) compared to non-ARB treatment. In the presence of previous CAD, patients with valsartan add-on treatment had a significantly lower prevalence of angina pectoris and stroke than those with non-ARB treatment, whereas the valsartan add-on effects on angina and stroke were not significant in the absence of CAD. Changes in blood pressure during the follow-up period did not differ significantly between study subgroups. In conclusion, in the presence or absence of previous CAD, valsartan add-on treatment prevented more cardio-cerebrovascular events than conventional non-ARB treatment in high-risk hypertensive patients. In addition, valsartan add-on treatment conferred not only an antianginal effect but also stroke prevention exclusively in hypertensive patients with CAD compared to those without CAD.

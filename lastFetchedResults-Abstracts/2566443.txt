Objective (s): Dysmenorrhea is a common problem among young girls and leads to several limitations for this age group including limitations in daily activities and failure to attend to school. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with dysmenorrhea among young girls in Iran.
Methods: All research conducted on the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in Iran, regardless of timeframe were examined. Dysmenorrhea, prevalence, incidence and menstrual disorders were used as key words for search strategy.
Results: In all 310 studies were identified and after excluding irrelevant papers 9 papers included in this review. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was found to be conducted 70% [59%-82%]. Studies showed that increased fluid, sweets, fruits and vegetables intake was reduced dysmenorrhea. Two studies also showed significant relationship between the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and family history.
Conclusion: There was no consistent reporting of prevalence of dysmenorrhea among Iranian girls. Due to lack of sufficient knowledge on the prevalence and pattern of dysmenorrhea, the topic deserves further investigation.

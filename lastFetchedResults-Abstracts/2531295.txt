shame in constructing narcissistic traits. However, studies on the exact relationship between
these two and overt and covert facets of narcissism have been equivocal. Methods: The current study is correlational. It examined these relationships among 308
Iranian college students (155 males, 153 females, mean age=23.49 years, SD=2.83). The target
population was all students of national universities of Tehran, Iran. The sampling method was
non-random multi-step clustering. Participants were asked to fill four self-report measures:
Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPD), Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES), Test of Selfconscious
Affect (TOSCA-3), and Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS). The data were
analyzed by SPSS 19.0.0 software, using Pearson’s Correlation, T-test and Multiple Regression
Analysis methods. Results: Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between men and women with respect
to NPI scores. Findings also revealed that shame was negatively related to overt narcissism
(r=-0.22, P<0.05) and positively related to covert narcissism (r=0.23, P<0.05). Self-esteem
was found to be positively correlated with overt narcissism (r=0.42, P<0.01) and negatively
correlated with covert narcissism (r=-0.30, P<0.01). Conclusion: The results provide support for the models of overt narcissism in which the
narcissistic self serves as a buffer against inner feelings of inferiority. It also supports the
importance of shame and low self-esteem in shaping the covert narcissistic traits. However,
shame could not differentiate between overt and covert narcissism. The empirical, cultural, and
clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

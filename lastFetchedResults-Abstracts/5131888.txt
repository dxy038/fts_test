This paper deals with nonholonomic systems in chained form with nonlinear parameterization. The objective is to design adaptive nonlinear state feedback laws such that the closed-loop systems are globally exponentially regulated at the origin, while the estimated parameters remain bounded. The systematic strategy combines the parameter separation, input-state-scaling technique and integrator backstepping procedure. The efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated by practical example.

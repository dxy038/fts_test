The Matrix Converter (MC) chosen in this work is capable of providing a variable three phase output voltage from a fixed single phase input using single stage phase conversion principle. This MC effectively provides three phase power to three phase variable speed drives. The implementation of MC requires solid state bidirectional switches. A new pulse generation scheme is developed to produce three phase voltage at the output. The performance of the Matrix converter is evaluated using MATLAB/SIMULINK for different frequencies. Simulation results for three phase resistive and inductive loads are presented. The simulation results validate the developed conversion strategy.

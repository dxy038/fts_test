The protection of multimedia data has become a necessity due to the generation of illegal copies, watermarks are proposed to help to easy this problem. In this paper, is shown a method to embed watermarks in Waveform Audio Format (WAV) sounds by echo modulation. Quality assessment was measured using the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) by calculating the Objective Difference Grade (ODG) to verify the inaudibility of the watermark and we obtained an ODG value average of -0.72045 that according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the watermark is slightly perceptible if you listen with extreme care and the robustness of it against attacks from resampling and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) by estimating the Bit Error Rate (BER). The process was applied to hundred WAV clips classifieds in five musical rhythms.

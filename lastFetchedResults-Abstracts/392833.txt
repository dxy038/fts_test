Objective
To investigate the cause of dizziness after Epley's maneuver using stabilometry.
Methods
Subjects were 35 patients with posterior canal type BPPV. First we performed stabilometry, next Epley's maneuver, then stabilometry was performed again. The enveloped area and the locus length per second of stabilometry were compared.
Results
Seventeen patients reported a feeling of dizziness after the treatment, whereas the other 18 patients did not. The patients were divided into two groups: 17 patients with dizziness (WD) and 18 patients without dizziness (WOD) after the treatment. In the WD group, the enveloped area (P = 0.0495) and the locus length per second (P = 0.0099) before Epley's maneuver were significantly lower than those after Epley's maneuver. In the WOD group, there was no significant difference in the stabilometry parameter between values obtained before and after Epley's maneuver. There were no significant differences found in either parameter between these two groups either before or after applying Epley's maneuver.
Conclusions
Epley's maneuver is a treatment for the posterior semicircular canal. Malfunction of the otolith organ remains. It is considered that the cause of dizziness after Epley's maneuver comes from otolith dysfunction.

In this paper, we use the Multi-Team System Theory (MTS) to explore how multi-team learning from multi-dimensional, multi-view, and multi-objective in different levels. Meanwhile, we put forward a multi-team learning model based on the analysis of how knowledge flows in MTS. We found that, in order to improve the overall effectiveness of MTS learning, each component team must share their knowledge with others and eventually build a coherent knowledge system. The process of knowledge synergy can be realized through knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation mechanisms.

Introduction & Objective: Epidemiologic data linking adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and metabolic syndrome in Iranian population is sparse. We aimed to evaluate the association between adherence to the DASH dietary pattern and risk of metabolic syndrome in a group of Isfahani female nurses.
Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 420 female nurses aged  > 30 years selected by a multistage cluster random sampling method. Usual dietary in-takes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were drawn to measure metabolic profiles and blood pressure was recorded. Additional co-variate information was obtained using questionnaires. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to the guidelines of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). The DASH score was constructed based on high intake of fruits, vegeta-bles, whole grains,  lean meat,and low-fat dairy. The data was analyzed by SPSS18 software and one-way ANOVA, Chi-square and ANCOVA statistical tests.
Results: After controlling for confounders, individuals in the highest tertile of the DASH diet score had 81% lower risk of metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest category 
(OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07-0.96). In addition, participants in the highest tertile of adherence to DASH diet had 62, 72, 78 and 86% lower odds for enlarged waist circumference, hyper-triglyceridemia, low HDL-c levels and high blood pressure than those in the lowest tertile, respectively.
Conclusion: Findings of the present study revealed that adherence to the DASH eating plan reduced the risk of metabolic syndrome and all of its features, except hyperglycemia.

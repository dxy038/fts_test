Objective(s): To determine the quality of midwives' performance in delivering prenatal cares in urban health
centers in Mashhad in 2001.
Methods: In this descriptive study, the performance of 37 midwives from 26 urban health centers (selected by
multi-stage random sampling) was observed on three separate occasions. Data were collected by
administrating a self-report questionnaire dealing with personal characteristics of the midwives and an
observation form used for assessing the quality of prenatal care based on the existing prenatal care guidelines.
Data analysis included chi-square and T- tests and was perfonncd using the SPSS package.
Results: In this study, the practice score was good in 18.5~·o of the midwives, while 70~·o showed moderate,
and 11.5% showed poor performance. Only 55.8% of prenatal care items were performed appropriately. ,
referral for laboratory tests, fetal heart rate auscultation. control of vaccination status, estimating the date of
delivery and history taking were good in most cases, whereas physical examination, assessment of common
complaints, consultation and recommendation for the place of delivery were at an undesirable level.
Conclusion: It seems that certain areas of prenatal care, such as physical examination and assessment of
common complaints, which are important in the diagnosis and treatment of obstetric disorders, are largely
neglected in urban health centers. Hence to address these problems and improve practice in prenatal care,
midwives and other health workers must receive further training. The quality of prenatal care in urban health
centers must be supervised and monitored accurately.

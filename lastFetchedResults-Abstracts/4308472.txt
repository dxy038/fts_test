This paper describes the application of a fuzzy control temporal reasoning paradigm for the development of navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The ability of an AUV to undertake real-time navigation is a critical performance determinant. The objective to this paper is to employ temporal reasoning to estimate an obstacleÂ´s location within a complex underwater environment. It is expected that with the support of fuzzy temporal reasoning the control system can manage the complexity of this problem. The aim is to provide an AUV controller with robust reactive rules capable of performing real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance in a wide variety of underwater situations.

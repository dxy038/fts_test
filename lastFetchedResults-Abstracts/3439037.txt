The objective of this paper is to demonstrate reduction of return loss of bonding wires using comb capacitors attached to bonding pads. The measured results show the magnitude of return loss of molded bonding wires was improved by 17.7 dB at 900 MHz and by 8.63 dB at 2.4 GHz with reference bonding pads, respectively. With attachment of comb capacitors, the return loss at the other end of the bonding wires (i.e., leads) was also reduced by 8.6 dB at 900 MHz and by 2.4 dB at 2.4 GHz.

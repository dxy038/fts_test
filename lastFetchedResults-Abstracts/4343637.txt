The paper reports the design, fabrication and operation of a two-dimensional (2D) micromirror that can generate large bidirectional scans at low actuation voltages. The micromirror device has been fabricated using a unique DRIE CMOS-MEMS process that can simultaneously provide thin-film and single-crystal silicon microstructures. A fabricated micromirror has negligible initial tilt angle, and can perform large bidirectional 2D optical scans (over &#177;30&#176;) at less than 12 Vdc. 2D scanning using this mirror has been demonstrated by obtaining a 14&#176; by 50&#176; angular raster scan pattern.

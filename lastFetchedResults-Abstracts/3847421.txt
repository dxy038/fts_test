An automatic mesh generator of triangular finite elements, based on an artificial neural network, is optimized by means of Design of Experiments techniques and Genetic Algorithms. The optimization concerns the various parameters which are defined in the mesh generator, whereas the objective function is related to the mesh quality. By means of this optimization the generator allows us to obtain very high-quality meshes.

In order to effectively control education quality, the educational administration hopes to continue to improve education quality through regular evaluation; however, quality criteria possess inter-dependence and feedback situations among them, therefore, setting the weights becomes complicated and the relationship among the criteria is also an objective evaluation of education quality. This has become a problem that must be overcome. This study proposes an evaluation method of education quality different from the past methods. The study uses Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to construct an applicable education quality evaluation model, to examine the key factors of education quality of the University of Technology and the importance of their improvement. This method can calculate the relations and connections of the cause and effect of the various criteria and clarifies the mutual relationships among them, so that when the evaluation feedback is provided, the maximum weight or the highest degree of connection can be selected to show unsatisfactory items, which can be used to continue the improvement of important items, so as to effectively control the key evaluation criteria. The relevant conclusions and suggestions can be provided as references for educational adm- nistrations and interested researchers.

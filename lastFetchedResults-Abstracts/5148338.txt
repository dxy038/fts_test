Multi-objective metaheuristics are over and over again used by analog designers. Pareto fronts linking conflicting parameters are usually generated using different optimisation techniques. Conclusions on these fronts are generally made in a subjective manner; no performance measures are used! In this paper we deal with the use of two metrics, namely the C-metric and the hypervolume indicator. The simulation-based technique is used to generate the non-dominated set of points of the Pareto fronts. Two current mode circuits are considered: a conventional and a differential CMOS current conveyor. The used metrics are detailed, their utility is highlighted, and the results are discussed.

The objective of this study was to investigate the adhesion, spreading and extracellular matrix synthesis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) derived cells on non-absorbable scaffold materials to ultimately provide a durable stress-absorbent framework within tissue-engineered disc transplants. Scaffolds were prepared by polyamide monofilaments, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) monofilaments, polyglycolic acid monofilaments (control) or natural bone mineral blocks (control). These scaffolds were incubated for 2, 4 and 8 weeks under common culture conditions with cells (human and porcine) harvested from the TMJ-disc or the articular eminence. The specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The type of collagen synthesized was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The cells were strongly adherent to all of the materials. Independent of their origin the cells became confluent on all scaffolds within four weeks. They filled recesses loosely and covered the constructs by an envelope of dense stratified cell layers. Moreover, the cells expressed collagen type II, which is specific for chondrocytes. Thus, it could be demonstrated, that ePTFE, polyamide, polyglycolic acid and natural bone mineral have an excellent compatibility in a three-dimensional cell culture system. ePTFE and polyamide scaffolds may be well suited for the development of tissue-engineered stress-resistant articular disc transplants.

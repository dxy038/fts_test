In this paper, three isolated bi-directional DC/DC converter topologies are designed for a backup photovoltaic system as battery charge controller. These converters are: isolated bi-directional cuk (IBC) converter, isolated bidirectional full-bridge (IBF) converter and isolated bidirectional half-bridge (IBH) converter. Items such as efficiency, weight, volume, required heat sink and failure rate are calculated for them. Moreover, their efficiency is obtained by simulation with SIMULINK. A comprehensive comparison is done between these topologies on the basis of these items. It is found that isolated bi-directional half-bridge (IBH) converter is the best choice for this backup photovoltaic application.

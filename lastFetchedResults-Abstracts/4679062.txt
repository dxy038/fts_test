The Department of Technical Graphics at Purdue University offers a unique Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree program designed to prepare students for a professional career in applied computer graphics. Graduating its first class of students in 1993, the B.Sc. program blends the rigor of math and science with the demands of art, design and communication in preparing students for emerging career opportunities based on computer graphics. The success of this program is due in part to an abiding commitment by the programÂ´s faculty to start students with 3D computer graphics and visualization at the very beginning of the program and to continue the integrated use of 3D throughout. The objective of this paper is to establish a philosophy and rationale for structuring an entire degree program based on an interactive 3D paradigm for learning

This paper considers an admission control problem for a mobile cloud computing hotspot with a cloudlet. We first formulate the admission control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to maximize the average reward in terms of revenue for cloudlet service providers. However, the MDP could suffer from the complexity problem (i.e, curse of dimensionality). Therefore, we apply the simulation-based algorithm to obtain the optimal policy for the MDP. The algorithm can estimate the performance measure to update the policy gradient in an online fashion. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm uses parameters setting profiled from real mobile applications. The extensive simulation results clearly show the convergence and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

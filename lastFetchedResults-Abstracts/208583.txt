What differentiates between objective and factual propositions is the
fact that the first one takes only the existents into account, while the
second one includes the suppositional existents too. The dispute over
the reality of existence notwithstanding, this article supposes the
predicate of existence as non-identified, and by adding it to the logic
of predicates, introduces three systems of logic: free logic (which is
known for a long time), and two other systems (which are called by
the author as "the logic of predicates and existence" and "the logic of
public existence").
The author tries to show that free logic is not a suitable medium for
analyzing old logic and for differentiating factual propositions from
objective ones. He considers the two alternative logics capable of
doing so. He also shows that the logic of predicates and existence is
the proper logic for factual propositions, while the logic of public
existence is appropriate for objective propositions.

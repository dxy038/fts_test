FACTS, is an effective means to enhance capacity of existing power transmission network to their maximum limits. This paper deals with an approach for the optimal allocation of FACTS devices in a power system network to improve line loadability and provide voltage support and thus minimize total generation cost. Minimizing total generation cost implies optimal scheduling of generation by different generator units to satisfy load demand. The same objective is analysed in a normal power system and to a system with the integration of wind energy. In the wind energy integrated system the objective function is to minimize the standard deviation of voltage in the system so as to reduce the voltage flicker. As FACTS devices are costly devices and improper placement leads to voltage instability, optimal allocation of FACTS devices is important. Particle Swarm Optimization method is used for optimization and is implemented using MATLAB programming.

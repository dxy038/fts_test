The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salts on the physicochemical, microstructural and thermal properties of potato starch. The salting-out ions were able to decrease the solubility, swelling power, transparency and particle size of potato starch significantly (p &lt; 0.05), while the salting-in ions increased these properties significantly (p &lt; 0.05). The microstructure of potato starch granules, observed by a light microscopy at 50 °C and 70 °C, was consistent with the above results. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis demonstrated an increase in gelatinization temperature and enthalpy with the addition of salting-out ions, whereas there was a reverse trend for the addition of salting-in ions. The effects of anions on these properties of potato starch follow the order of SCN− &gt; I− &gt; NO 3 - &gt; Br− &gt; Cl− &gt; SO 4 2 - &gt; F−, while effects of the cations follow the order of Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+, matching to the order of the Hofmeister series.

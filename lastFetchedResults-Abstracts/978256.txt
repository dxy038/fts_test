The objective of the study was to evaluate whether cardiac autonomic neuropathy was associated with insulin resistance in centrally obese people of Bhavnagar. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional, case control study was conducted on 70 individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostatic model assessment of Insulin resistance (HOMA) IR formula with the help of fasting insulin & glucose level. Subjects were divided in to insulin resistant people (cases) & insulin sensitive people (controls). All the subjects underwent a battery of cardiovascular reflex tests designed by Ewing. We observed that there was significant difference was between parasympathetic and sympathetic function tests in between these case & control. Conclusion: Evaluation of autonomic nervous system revealed that CAN is more prevalent in insulin resistant people than normal persons.

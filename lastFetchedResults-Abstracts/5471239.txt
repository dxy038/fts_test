Power system restructuring and deregulation introduces new functions the so-called open access to transmission network for transmission system providers. Transmission system operators are dealing with facilitating more room for electric power transfer. Transmission expansion is a crucial issue especially it can help competition under new scheme of power system reform. There is only a very limited capability in controlling this natural tendency of power flows, while transmission expansion is a major task in terms of long-term planning to meet load demand growth. There are some researches in the filed of transmission expansion planning, while in this paper a hybridization of real GA associated with goal attainment method (CORGA) is developed as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Case studies and results analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Objective We aimed to clarify the publicâ€™s
mental health literacy of autism spectrum disorders
(ASD). Methods Using a vignette of a young
child, 500 Japanese participants were asked their
perspectives, such as causes and appropriate coping
strategies. For each response from those respondents
who correctly identified the child as having autism, we
tested the effects of sex and generation. Results Two
hundred twenty-nine respondents (45.8%) correctly
identified the child as having autism. Significantly
(P < 0.05) more females planned practical coping
strategies such as contacting public agencies, whereas
males had relatively more irrelevant perceptions,
for example, significantly more males attributed ASD
to social environment. Significantly more young
respondents expected psychiatric treatments such
as antipsychotic administration to be effective, and
more seniors estimated low that the prevalence is
approximately 0.01% or less. Conclusions The mental
health literacy of ASD among the Japanese public
appears to be acceptable but there is still much room
for improvement. Females showed more accurate
knowledge, possibly reflecting gender roles. Some
young people are not likely to know of the impact of
psychiatric treatment, and seniors appear to be unaware
of the current broadened recognition of ASD.
Continued efforts to disseminate accurate information
are required, particularly among males

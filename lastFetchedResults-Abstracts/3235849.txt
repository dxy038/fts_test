The objective of this article is to optimize the screen printing process. A comparison is made between the full factorial ANOVA, a one half-fraction design and the Taguchi technique to optimize the screen printing process. The Taguchi technique was the most powerful for this particular experiment. The significant were determined with only half of the runs needed on a full factorial and another advantage is that you do not require the use of any statistical software to get the optimal factor levels. Too little will cause a faulty joint or an unreliable joint with an electrical continuity failure potential. Too much will create solder short problems or worse yet, solder balls. Solder paste can become detached after the product has been tested, causing potential field failures.

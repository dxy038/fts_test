This paper deals with optimal control of switched piecewise affine autonomous systems, where the objective is to minimize a performance index over an infinite time horizon. We assume that the switching sequence has a finite length, and that the decision variables are the switching instants and the sequence of operating modes. We present two different approaches for solving such an optimal control problem. The first approach iterates between a procedure that finds an optimal switching sequence of modes, and a procedure that finds the optimal switching instants. The second approach is inspired by dynamic programming and identifies the regions of the state space where an optimal mode switch should occur, therefore providing a state feedback control law.

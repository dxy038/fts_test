This paper proposes an efficient intra-field deinterlacing algorithms using local adaptive rational interpolation filter (LARF). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides satisfied performances in terms of both objective and subjective image qualities. What is more, it just exploits the local spatial gradient information among the neighboring pixels without complex preset-conditions which has lower complexity than most of the existing algorithms.

We consider the problem of power controlled minimum frame length scheduling for TDMA wireless networks. Given a set of one-hop transmission requests, our objective is to schedule them in a minimum number of time slots, so that each slot schedule is free of self-interferences and meets desired SINR constraints. Additionally, the transmit power vector corresponding to each slot schedule should be minimal. We consider two different versions of the problem, a per-slot version and a per-frame version, and develop mixed integer linear programming models which can be used for solving the problems optimally. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm for the per-slot version.

Many studies have stated that tourists are searching for authenticity – or what they perceive as such – within foreign cultural contexts. Accepting forms of culture that reflect day-to-day life as tourist attractions, many tourists have developed an interest in the real life of their hosts. Yet, the definition of authenticity in tourism has become multifaceted. Divided between experiences and objects, authenticity has been perceived through either objective, constructive or postmodern approaches. This paper examines the various elements on which a new tourist attraction, namely Los Angeles Gang Tours, bases its commercialization upon authenticity as communicated through online communication channels. For this purpose, content analysis was applied to the textual and visual online data available. Finally, the discussion is developed as to what form of authenticity this tour represents, as well as the perception of authenticity that tourists share online after experiencing the tour.

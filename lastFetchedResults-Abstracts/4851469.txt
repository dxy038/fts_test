The objective this paper is to present the development methodology, called Adaptive-Selective Tabu Search - ASTS, proposed to optimization of the transmission power systems restoration. The methodology is based on Tabu Search (TS) and Reactive Tabu Search (RTS) techniques with elements similar to those found in other Artificial Intelligent Methods, as elitism, aleatority and future analysis. These elements provide diversification and intensification mechanism to the search, beside of the predictive controlled characteristics. The proposed method is applied to the 20-nodes transmission real system and the simulations results obtained are satisfactory as well as the comparisons with other methodologies.

Objective
ermine if gender distinctions of force generating capacity existed in murine masticatory muscles.

er to investigate the effect of sex on force generating capacity in this muscle group, an isolated muscle preparation was developed utilising the murine anterior deep masseter. Age-matched male and female mice were utilized to assess function, muscle fibre type and size in this muscle.
s
m isometric force production was not different between age-matched male and female mice. However, the rate of force generation and relaxation was slower in female masseter muscles. Assessment of fibre type distribution by immunohistochemistry revealed a three-fold decrease in the proportion of myosin heavy chain 2b positive fibres in female masseters, which correlated with the differences in contraction kinetics.
sions
results provide evidence that masticatory muscle strength in mice is not affected by sex, but there are significant distinctions in kinetics associated with force production between males and females.

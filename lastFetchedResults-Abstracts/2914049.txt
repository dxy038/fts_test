The use of adaptive Viterbi detectors on fast-varying mobile-radio channels is studied. The main objective is to propose two new methods that may significantly improve the performance of the detector. The first method is to use prediction to combat the inherent delay of the channel estimates. The second method is to use so-called leaky algorithms in the channel estimator. This will make the detector significantly more robust against severe error bursts, which are due to error propagation in the channel estimator

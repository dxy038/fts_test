Dynamic maneuvers are an important part of legged locomotion used to adapt to varying terrain conditions. Quadrupedal dynamic maneuvers have received little attention in the literature due to limitations of traditional analytical approaches. In this study we look at several dynamic maneuvers in a 3D galloping quadruped robot using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In particular, we consider the jump-start, the high-speed turn, the running jump, and the sudden-stop. The control approach and fitness criteria are described for each maneuver, and biological-mode solutions are presented

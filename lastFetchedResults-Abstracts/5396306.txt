This paper describes a Combined Cooling, Heating and Power Plant (CCHP) that was designed and commissioned to supply a commercial building that hosts a data centre, which requires the availability of 99.995%. The main objective of this paper is the study of the two control systems of the CCHP in order to output electricity but also heating and cooling: hot water, heating, cool water, cool air, with a decentralized distribution between the two primary systems, while considering the building topology and consumer needs.

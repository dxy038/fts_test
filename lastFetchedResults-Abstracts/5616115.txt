Next generation long reach hybrid WDM-CDM-PON based on Code Division Multiplexing presented here. We describe system configuration, key merits such as bidirectional transmission (on same wavelength), extend the reach by coding gain and simplified network solution. We show initial experimental results over 100km bidirectional, multi-channels CWDM transmission without an optical amplifier.

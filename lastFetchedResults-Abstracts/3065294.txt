This paper contributes to the analysis and the prediction by the artificial neural networks, taking into account uncertainty, of the deviated intentional behaviours of the human operators in the human-machine systems. This type of behaviours is a particular violation called barrier removal. The objective of the paper is to propose a predictive Benefit-Cost-Deficit model by considering a multi-reference, multi-factor and multi-criterion based evaluation. Human operatorÂ´s evaluation can be uncertain. Uncertainty on their subjective judgements is therefore integrated in the prediction of the barrier removal. The proposed approach is validated through a railway application within the framework of a European project Urban Guided Transport Management System. Finally, the prediction convergence of the uncertainty-integrated model is demonstrated.

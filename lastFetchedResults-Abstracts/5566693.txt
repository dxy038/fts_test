We describe the first set of chips to be designed and manufactured with the specific objective of use in an education environment. The chips are the result of a collaboration between educators and industry and introduce students to complex microelectronics technology by presenting simple building blocks fabricated using standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Current usage indicates that the chips are a valuable resource in microelectronics education

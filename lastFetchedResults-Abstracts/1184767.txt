The main objective of the production of cement - wood products or mineral-bounded composite panels is to combine the mineral components of lignocellulosic materials such as wood and organic particles with inorganic binders such as cement, plaster, etc. Wood cement products which are presently produced in most countries possess desirable functional properties such as good weather ability, resistance to atmospheric, biological agents and fire and are lighter weight as compared with other building materials, and provides improved dimensional stability. The flat panels using conventional presses can be produced, and also other products such as concrete blocks, bricks and pieces of different forms can be produced using appropriate frames. Large wood cement- based panels are widely used in construction of residential and commercial buildings. In this research, with respect to the availability of lignocellulosic material (agricultural residues such as rice straw, wheat straw, cotton stalk) in various areas (Gilan, Mazandaran and Golestan Provinces)) and the additive material (as calcium chloride), boards with similar structural was produced. Mechanical strength values including static bending strength, modulus of elasticity and elastic bending strength were measured. MSTATC based computer package was used to analyze the data. In terms of the maximum load strength, wood cement board made of poplar wood as the control boards (4.4146 MPa) had the highest mechanical strength followed by cotton stalks (2.463 MPa), wheat straw (1. 6776 MPa) and rice straw (0. 8622 MPa), respectively. In general, the study has indicated the suitability (given the appropriate ratio) of the agricultural residues in construction of wall and warehouse in farmlands.

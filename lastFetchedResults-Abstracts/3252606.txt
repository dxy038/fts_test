Passive radar, which using existing commercial digital signals as the illuminators of opportunity, is an emerging technology in new radar systems. Most of modern digital TV and broadcasting systems adopt a novel network technology-single frequency network (SFN). One of the main difficult points of tracking in SFN-based passive radar is to handle ghosts, i.e. resolve measurement-to-transmitter association ambiguity. To achieve this objective, all the information available should be exploited to its optimization. In this paper we particularly investigate the benefits of velocity threshold constraint (VTC) to deghosting. The improvement brought by VTC is quantitatively evaluated with deghosting rate. Specifically, we interpret the original problem from geometry perspective. Then the complex problem is solved elegantly with geometrical method. The theoretical conclusions are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

This article discusses the recently developed performance-oriented macromodel of the solidly mounted resonator and its advantages manifested in high-order piezoelectric filter design. The proposed model allows the straightforward integration of the thin film resonatorÂ´s electrical behavior into the most of modern CAD systems as a part of complex RF circuit solutions and enables the precise evaluation of the output characteristics in a relatively wide near-resonant frequency range. It is shown further that an important feature of the model is its homogeneous multiloop structure which opens the possibility of fine complexity adjustment in order to obtain either high accuracy results or high performance during calculation. In addition, the model takes into account the influence of the most significant electro-acoustic effects related to the electrode mass loading and quarter-wavelength stack reflectance. Validation was performed on the example of PCS CDMA 3<sup>1/2</sup>-stage ladder filter design and showed more than 15-fold improvement in calculation time in multi-objective optimization case.

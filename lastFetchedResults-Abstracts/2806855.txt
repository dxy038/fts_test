In this paper, a novel power flow control method for a hybrid AC-DC microgrid with solar energy, and energy storage is proposed for the integration of a pulse load. This micro grid works in islanding mode with a synchronous generator and PV farm supplying power to the systemÂ´s AC and DC sides, respectively. A bidirectional AC-DC inverter is used to link the AC and DC sides by controlling the active and reactive power flow between them. The PV farm is connected to the DC bus through a DC-DC boost converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) functionality. A Battery bank is connected to the DC bus through a bidirectional DC-DC converter. The system is tested with a pulse load connected to the AC side. Simulation results verify that the proposed topology is coordinated for power management in both the AC and DC sides under critical loads with high efficiency, reliability and robustness in islanding modes.

The primary objective of DRAM-dynamic random access memory-is to offer the largest memory capacity at the lowest possible cost. Designers achieve this by two means. First, they optimize the process and the design to minimize die area. Second, they ensure that the device serves high-volume markets and can be mass-produced to achieve the greatest economies of scale. SLDRAM-synchronous-link DRAM-is a new memory interface specification developed through the cooperative efforts of leading semiconductor memory manufacturers and high-end computer architects and system designers. SLDRAM meets the high data bandwidth requirements of emerging processor architectures and retains the low cost of earlier DRAM interface standards. These and other benefits suggest that SLDRAM will become the mainstream commodity memory of the early 21st century

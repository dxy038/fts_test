Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for evaluation internal
structures of biological macromolecules has been recently developed as a quick
and non destructive method. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of stage of maturity of alfalfa hay (early bud, late bud and early flower) on
FTIR vibration spectroscopy of carbohydrates molecular structures. Structural
characteristics of carbohydrates bands in typical infrared molecular spectrum in
alfalfa samples (n=60) were revealed using principle component and cluster
analysis. These analysis methods distinguished little differences of carbohydrates
molecular structures between alfalfa hay at early bud and early flower stage while
no differences distinguished between alfalfa at early bud and late bud or at late
bud and early flower stage. These results indicate molecular structure of total
carbohydrates in alfalfa hay affected in less extent by stage of maturity from early
bud to early flower

Mobile learning scenarios are often restricted to - mostly short-lived funded pilot projects and pilot institutions outside the scope of mainstream educational methods and institutions. To overcome the marginal status of m-learning, in 2006 we established a mainstreaming team at our university (Ilmenau University of Technology in Germany) with the objective of identifying, implementing and evaluating mainstream-suitable m-learning scenarios. We thoroughly researched and documented available m-learning solutions, defined mainstreaming criteria and initiated student-/teacher-centered scenario design processes. The evaluation data from the first project phase indicate that the cell phone cardbox trainer and the interactive notebook revision lecture are useful m-learning scenarios with mainstream potential

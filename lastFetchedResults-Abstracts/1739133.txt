The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of posturographic parameters (PP) to changes in acquisition settings. A group of eight young adults underwent a set of typical orthostatic posture trials, and selected PP were then calculated from a set of centre of pressure (CoP) displacement time series obtained by applying different cut-off frequencies to the same set of raw data. Four PP out of 11 showed significant changes with respect to cut-off frequency. Statistical mechanics parameters exhibited smaller sensitivity than summary measures. On the basis of the results obtained, a proposal for a standard cut-off frequency and a sampling rate value is embodied in the paper together with some suggestions on measurement settings, with a view to standardized use of instrumentation for quantitative analysis in orthostatic posturography.

Our objective is to analyze EEG signals recorded with depth electrodes during seizures in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Usually, different phases are observed during the seizure process, including a fast onset activity (FOA). We aim to determine how cerebral structures get involved during this FOA, in particular whether some structure can &#8220;drive&#8221; some other structures. This paper focuses on a linear Granger causality based measure to detect causal relation of interdependence in multivariate signals generated by a physiology-based model of coupled neuronal populations. When coupling between signals exists, statistical analysis supports the relevance of this index for characterizing the information flow and its direction among neuronal populations.

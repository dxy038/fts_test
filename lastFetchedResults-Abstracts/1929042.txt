The objective of this study was to determine the effects of monensin (M) and altered forage:concentrate ratio (F:C) on feed intake, hormonal profiles, and ovarian function in beef heifers. Four ruminally cannulated heifers were maintained in metabolism crates and fed twice daily. Diets contained 0 or 200 mg per day M in diets of 70:30 (high forage, HF) or 30:70 (high concentrate, HC) F:C. Diets were limit fed to achieve isocaloric intake of calculated ME. Monensin supplementation had no effect on feed intake, but heifers fed HF had greater refusals compared with heifers fed HC (P&lt;0.005). Serum insulin, progesterone, and estradiol concentrations did not differ between diets or treatments (P&gt;0.10). Diet and/or treatment tended to alter the size or number of follicles on either or both ovaries. Monensin resulted in more waves of follicular development per estrous cycle with HF diets, but fewer with HC diets (P&lt;0.07). The interovulatory interval, lifespan of the corpus luteum, and the size of the dominant follicle in the first two follicular waves were not different due to diet or treatment. However, the HC diet tended to produce a larger ovulatory follicle compared with the HF diet (HF=12.25, HC=13.5; P&lt;0.08). We conclude that feeding monensin affects estradiol secretion and a higher proportion of concentrates alters ovarian dynamics, which could affect fertility in beef heifers.

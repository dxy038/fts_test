This paper proposes two minimized switch count ac-ac converter. The proposed topologies allow single-phase to three-phase power conversion for supply three-phase four-wire load without the capacitor dc-bus mid-point connection. The converters provide bidirectional power flow and power factor control. Pulse-width modulation techniques based on scalar and vector approaches are developed, introducing the concept of local and general apportioning factor. The overall control strategy for providing dc-bus voltage, power factor control and PWM generation are presented. Experimental and simulated results are presented

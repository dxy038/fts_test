The core topic of the paper discuses bidirectional buck/boost converter implemented using soft switching. In addition to a soft switched DC-DC conversion, the circuit also facilitates an additional output which makes the system capable of supporting multiple applications. The circuit under discussion uses fuzzy logic for the closed loop operation which has better overall performance compared to other conventional converters. The circuit has been simulated in Mat lab Simulink software and analysis of both the closed loop and open loop operations are discussed below.

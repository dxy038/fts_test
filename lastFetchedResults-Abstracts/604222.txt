 ABSTRACT: Environmental issues such as global warming and climate change are highly related to consumption increase which is enabled by international trade. Consumption increase leads to more environmental effects resulted from production procedures, transportation and waste handling. Therefore, having a more prosper and dynamic economy increases the use of fossil energy and fuels to the extent that the environment is no longer responsible and this has resulted in newer and stricter environmental legislations. Companies present more environment-friendly products and consider modern procedures which reduce energy and hazardous material consumption. The present paper is a summary of a MA thesis for Business Administration and uses descriptive â€“ analytical method. In order to obtain data required for hypotheses testing the researcher has used questionnaire as the main data collection tool. Research population consists of household consumers of electric products having A and B energy labels of which 311 individuals are selected as sample by random sampling. Based on the main objective and model, this paper aims to evaluate the relationship between four variables (approach toward purchasing green products, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and past experiences with green products) and tendency to purchase these products (and the contribution of those variables in this attitude). Findings indicate that all variables have a positive relationship with attitude to purchase green products. Besides, the contribution of each variable is predicted.

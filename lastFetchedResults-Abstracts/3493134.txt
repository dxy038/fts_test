With this issue the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits completes its second full year of publication. This Journal is sponsored by the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Council on behalf of the Groups on Circuit Theory, Electron Devices, Electronic Computers, Microwave Theory and Techniques, and Magnetics. Its paramount objective is to bring to the members of these groups a new and stronger level of reporting in a major technical area that previously had not been served by a single publication. The interests of the Journal in the technical area of solid-state circuits correspond well with the content of the annual International Solid-State Circuits Conference. As sponsor of the Journal and cosponsor of the ISSCC, the Solid-State Circuits Council has provided a salutory connection between these two complementary activities.

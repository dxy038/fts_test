We consider the problem of designing optimal stabilizing decentralized controllers subject to an arbitrary structural constraint, where each part of the controller has access to some measurements but not others. We develop a parametrization of the stabilizing structured controllers such that the objective is a convex function of the parameter, with the parameter subject to a single quadratic equality constraint.

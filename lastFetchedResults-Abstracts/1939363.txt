Inroduction & Objective: With the industrialization of the nanotechnology, application of nanoparticles will increase in modern technology and many people exposure to this particles. So, study of effect of different concentration of nanoparticles on health impacts is necessary. The main aim of this study was to assess acute toxicity of Mo nanoparticles on serum biochemical function of liver in rat.
Material and Methods: In this experimental study, 24 male rats were randomly divided into four groups of six. The first was control group and tree groups were treatment. Animals in the first group (control) received 1 ml distilled water and treatment groups received intraperitoneally injection of Molybdenum nano particles (5, 10, 15 mg/Kg/BW) daily during 28 days. After the last dose, blood samples were taken from all groups and levels of LDH, ALT, AST and ALP were measured and groups were compared together.
Results: The results showed that both doses of 5 and 10 mg/Kg/BW decreased significantly AST level compared to control group (p < 0.05).  Significant decrease in LDH level at 5 mg/Kg/BW dose obtained in compared to control group (p < 0.05) and no significant difference obtained in ALT and ALP levels.
Conclusion: The result of this study showed that Molybdenum nanoparticles at low concentrations because of its antagonistic effects on copper metabolism are not acute toxic.

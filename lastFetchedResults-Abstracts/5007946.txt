This paper discusses the monolithic integration of a bidirectional front-end and analog pre-processing circuits for pulse compression radar (PCR) system. The W-band front-end circuitry includes a bidirectional amplifier that operates as either an LNA or PA, a bidirectional analog phase shifter, and a double-balanced passive mixer. The baseband circuitry includes a two-stage VGA for high dynamic range, a correlator/integrator circuit, a comparator, and offset calibration circuits. Circuit simulations and measurement results for the front-end elements in a 0.12-&#956;m SiGe BiCMOS process and circuit simulations of the baseband elements in a 90-nm CMOS process are presented.

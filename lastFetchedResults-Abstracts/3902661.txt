The past ten years have seen a large growth in the use of communication protection relays in LV and HV switchgear on offshore platforms. They are used to simplify the interface between the process control system, which is part of the control monitoring and safety system, and the switchgear. The primary objective is to reduce overall costs by reducing cable and racking requirements, with the additional benefits of enhanced motor protection and monitoring, and greater flexibility during the design phase. This article looks at some of the recent offshore projects incorporating these relays and reviews the benefits and shortcomings of their design and implementation.

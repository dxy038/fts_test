This paper presents a model for constrained multiobjective optimization of mixed-cropping planning. The decision challenges that are normally faced by farmers include what to plant, when to plant, where to plant and how much to plant in order to yield maximum output. Consequently, the central objective of this work is to concurrently maximize net profit, maximize crop production and minimize planting area. For this purpose, the generalized differential evolution 3 algorithm was explored to implement the mixed-cropping planning model, which was tested with data from the South African grain information service and the South African abstract of agricultural statistics. Simulation experiments were conducted using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to validate the performance of the generalized differential evolution 3 algorithm. The empirical findings of this study indicated that generalized differential evolution 3 algorithm is a feasible optimization tool for solving optimal mixed-cropping planning problems.Â

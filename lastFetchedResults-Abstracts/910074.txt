Dynamic model development for describing complex ecological systems continues to grow in popularity. For both academic research and
project management, understanding the benefits and limitations of systems-based software could improve the accuracy of results and enlarge
the user audience. A Surface Wetness Energy Balance (SWEB) model for canopy surface wetness has been translated into four software packages
and their strengths and weaknesses were compared based on ‘novice’ user interpretations. We found expression-based models such as Simulink
and GoldSim with Expressions were able to model the SWEB more accurately; however, stock and flow-based models such as STELLA,
Madonna, and GoldSim with Flows provided the user a better conceptual understanding of the ecologic system. Although the original objective
of this study was to identify an ‘appropriate’ software package for predicting canopy surface wetness using SWEB, our outcomes suggest that
many factors must be considered by the stakeholders when selecting a model because the modeling software becomes part of the model and of
the calibration process. These constraints may include user demographics, budget limitations, built-in sensitivity and optimization tools, and the
preference of user friendliness vs. computational power. Furthermore, the multitude of closed proprietary software may present a disservice to
the modeling community, creating model artifacts that originate somewhere deep inside the undocumented features of the software, and masking
the underlying properties of the model.

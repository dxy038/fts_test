Impulse radio-ultra wideband (IR-UWB) communication is a strong candidate for short-range biomedical wireless sensor networks (BWSN). In this paper, we propose a multiband/multiuser IR-UWB scheme, which is robust against unknown narrowband interference (NBI), by deploying multiband signaling with forward error correction (FEC) coding and subband scheduling. We define our problem with an n-transmitter Jamming game and find a Nash equilibrium (NE) for such a game. By the NE result we say that a uniform access to all the subband resources from all the sensors can form a fair situation for the system. In addition, we propose a fair subband scheduling that is required to provide each sensor with uniform opportunity of avoiding the unknown NBI. We cast the problem of finding the fair subband schedule into a multi-objective integer programming, and plan to solve it using Nash bargaining solutions (NBS).

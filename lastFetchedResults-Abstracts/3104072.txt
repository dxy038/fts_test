Power electronics researchers try to apply new electronic controller solutions with the capacity to implement new and more complex control algorithms for the distributed power generation systems (DPGS). With this objective, this paper presents the FPGA-implementation and test used as coprocessor module in the controller of a 150 kVA back-to-back three-level NPC (neutral point clamped) VSC (voltage source converter). This converter operates as interface between the grid and a variable-speed wind turbine based on a squirrel cage induction generator.

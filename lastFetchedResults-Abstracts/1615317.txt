Fluoride volatility method is based on direct fluorination of powdered spent fuel with fluorine gas in a flame fluorination reactor, where the volatile fluorides (represented mainly by UF6, partially NpF6) are separated from the non-volatile ones (e.g. PuF4, AmF3, CmF3, fluorides of majority of fission products), the objective being to separate a maximum fraction of uranium component from plutonium, minor actinides and fission products. The current research and development work in the area of fluoride volatility method is focused on the experimental program carried out at the semi-technological line called FERDA, which is a follow-up of the previous FREGAT-2 technology. The experimental test program, launched in 2004 by the Nuclear Research Institute Řež plc, has been focused mainly to the study of flame fluorination process, which is considered to be the crucial unit operation of the technology. The fluorination experiments were realized in the first instance with pure uranium oxide fuel and later on with simulated spent oxide fuel. Follow-on tests are planed with oxide fuels with inert matrixes. The experimental program is further supplemented by the system studies focused mainly to the process flow-sheet design and calculations and to the requisite modification of some apparatuses for the future verification of the process with irradiated fuel in hot conditions.

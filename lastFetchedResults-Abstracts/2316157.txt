The objective of this paper is to present the improvement of quantitative forecasting of daily rainfall in Catalonia (NE Spain) from an analogues technique, taking into account synoptic and local data. This method is based on an analogues sorting technique: meteorological situations similar to the current one, in terms of 700 and 1000Â hPa geopotential fields at 00 UTC, complemented with the inclusion of some thermodynamic parameters extracted from an historical data file. Thermodynamic analysis acts as a highly discriminating feature for situations in which the synoptic situation fails to explain either atmospheric phenomena or rainfall distribution. This is the case in heavy rainfall situations, where the existence of instability and high water vapor content is essential. With the objective of including these vertical thermodynamic features, information provided by the Palma de Mallorca radiosounding (Spain) has been used. Previously, a selection of the most discriminating thermodynamic parameters for the daily rainfall was made, and then the analogues technique applied to them. Finally, three analog forecasting methods were applied for the quantitative daily rainfall forecasting in Catalonia. The first one is based on analogies from geopotential fields to synoptic scale; the second one is exclusively based on the search of similarity from local thermodynamic information and the third method combines the other two methods. The results show that this last method provides a substantial improvement of quantitative rainfall estimation.

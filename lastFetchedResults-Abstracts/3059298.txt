This paper presents B fault detection and isolation (FDI) filter design for a lateral dynamics of a F-16 aircraft. The FDI filter is based on robust residual generator design via multi-objective optimisation and genetic algorithms (MOO-GA). In our case the fault detection filter is sensitive to roll and sideslip sensors. The FDI filter is implemented in linear and non-linear F-16 aircraft and is tested by means of LQG/LTR lateral track controller. A sensible incipient fault detection method, suitable time responses as well as satisfactory robustness properties arc obtained, where genetic algorithms are employed to satisfy design specifications for a fault tolerance flight control system.

ABSTRACT: Kohgiluyeh-va-Boyerahmad (KB) province is the tenth apple producer province in Iran. Due 
to weather conditions, climate and having good potential, planting and cultivation of the apple in north of 
this province has good advantage. So, based on production, apple is the first product and based on the 
area under cultivation, apple  is the second horticultural product, after  the walnut, in this province. The 
main objective of this study is to investigate the use of rational amount of inputs by apple growers and 
evaluate their technical efficiency. The statistical population in this study is the apple growers. In order to 
achieve the research objectives, the statics and related data were collected by survey methodology. The 
results showed that about 82.6% variability of dependent variables (the amount of the apple produced) 
are  explained by  independent variables including land,  fertilizer, manure, pesticide, the number of 
irrigation and workers. The results of the elasticity of production inputs  indicated that the growers, based 
on using the land,  performed in third area of production function and based on using the pesticide 
performed in first area of production function. The way of using the manure inputs and labor force were 
both economic and in second area of production function. The estimation results of stochastic frontier 
production of the apple showed that the technical efficiency average in growers was 76%. Based on the 
application of new technologies in production of the apple, the technical efficiency difference between the 
best grower and weakest grower was calculated 46%. Therefore, there is very high potential in production 
of the apple in KB province by improving the technical efficiency in apple growers.

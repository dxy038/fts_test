The authors address the buffer size requirements for a CCSDS-based packetized and multiplexed video transfer system. The objective is to minimize the delay of the video data through the buffer and at the same time maintain continuous video data flow at the output. Due to the various delays, multiplexer operation, and buffer data accumulation in the system, the buffer size must be properly chosen to prevent buffer overflow which causes loss of video data and buffer drain-up which causes disruption of continuous video output. An analytical procedure to compute the upper bound of the minimum buffer size requirement has been derived. This procedure is applicable to the generic packetized data transfer system. The upper bound of the required buffer size for the video data transfer system has been obtained using this procedure. A bit-by-bit computer simulation program for the video transfer system has also been developed and used to verify the analytical results

Aiming at the high-precision mechanism model of the greenhouse and the problem of the nonlinear strong coupling between temperature and humidity, this paper employs the method of accurate linearization in the nonlinear system. The exact linearization of the system is realized through state feedback", "and then realizes the gradual tracking of the ideal output of this system. It is proved by the simulation of MATLAB software that the controller designed has favorable performance, and is able to track and adjust the objective curves of temperature and humidity.

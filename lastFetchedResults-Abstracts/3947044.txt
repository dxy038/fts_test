In this paper, a new technique for shaping the line current and reducing the total harmonic distortion in a three-phase bridge rectifier, feeding a capacitive load, is presented. Using the topology of a three-level three-switch pulsewidth modulated (PWM) rectifier, a new control technique has been implemented. The main objective here is to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line current under different load conditions (20%-100% of full load). A review of the problems inherent in a bridge rectifier feeding a capacitive load and the possible solutions are first presented. Subsequently, the analysis of the new circuit and the control technique used are described, along with simulation results. Finally, the experimental results on a 1.6 kW prototype are presented

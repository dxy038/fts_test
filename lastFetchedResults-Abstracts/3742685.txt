In this letter, we proposed a new recoloring method for people with protanopic and deuteranopic color deficiencies. We present a color transformation that aims to preserve the color information in the original images while maintaining the recolored images as natural as possible. Two error functions are introduced and combined together to form an objective function using the Lagrange multiplier with a user-specified parameter lambda. This objective function is then minimized to obtain the optimal settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method can yield more comprehensible images for color-deficient viewers while maintaining the naturalness of the recolored images for standard viewers.

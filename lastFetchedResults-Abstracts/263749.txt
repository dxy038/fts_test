As the nations of the world continue to develop, their industrialization and growing populations will require increasing amounts of energy. Yet, global energy consumption, even at present levels, is already giving rise to concerns over both the security of future supplies and the attendant problems of environmental degradation. Thus, a major objective for the energy industry — in all its sectors — is to develop procedures so that the burgeoning demand for energy can be tolerated without exhaustion of the planet's resources, and without further deterioration of the global ecosystem. A step in the right direction is to place lead/acid batteries — serviceable, efficient and clean technology — at the cutting edge of energy strategies, regardless of the relatively low price of such traditional fuels as coal, mineral oil and natural gas.

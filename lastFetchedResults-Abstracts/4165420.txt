The objective of this paper is to realize a fuzzy logic controller for an aeroload simulator, which simulates the aerodynamic load that a missile is subjected to on flight. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy logic controller using the phase plane, in order to improve the overall performance of the aeroload simulator system. The design procedure and method of this controller are easy and simple such that performance evaluation of the aeroload simulator is carried out in a phase plane mapped from a decision rule table. The effectiveness of this control scheme is verified by comparison with a proportional integral derivative (PID) and a fixed fuzzy control through a series of simulation studies

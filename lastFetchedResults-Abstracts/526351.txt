Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the information-seeking behaviors (e.g., information resource usage patterns, access to types of sources and to medical libraries, and use of particular information technologies) of members in a primary care practice-based research network (PBRN) to inform future efforts supporting primary care practitioners in their daily care of patients. Methods: Every primary care practitioner who was a member of the Kentucky Ambulatory Network—including family practitioners, general practitioners, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants—was surveyed. The cross-sectional survey included twenty-six questions to investigate the information-seeking behavior of primary care practitioners. Results: The response rate was 51% (59 of 116). Most practitioners (58%) stated they sought information to support patient care several times per week, and most (68%) noted they do this while the patient waited. Many practitioners (40%) never or almost never perform literature searches from online sources such as MEDLINE, although 44% said they did so a few times per month. A significant correlation

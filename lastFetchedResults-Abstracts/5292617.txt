The stochastically fluctuating offer of wind energy limits the supply capacity in electrical grids by means of technical and economical reasons. To increase the supply, a concept of dynamic conditioning with the objective to increase the quality of supply was developed. The concept envisages supporting and managing of the electrical grid respectively by compensating active and reactive power with static converters ("electronic synchronous machine") and short term storage. Short term fluctuation of the energy sources and changes of the load can be absorbed or smoothed directly on location using the four-quadrant operation of the converters. Stochastically offered primary energy is intermediately stored by using dynamic storage systems. This low order energy can thereby be converted into high order recallable energy, which can even be used to satisfy peak demands. The local compensation of the fluctuating energy supply on the one hand and of the changes of the demand on the other hand, permits a more steady energy demand from the nation-wide electrical grid

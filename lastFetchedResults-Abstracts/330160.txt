Objective:  Electronic databases are an excellent resource for identifying relevant references for research and education projects. However, these databases are not yet a substitute for direct inspection of the literature because: (a) there still is a lag of many months between journal issue publication and updates of the database, and (b) most databases selectively report a portion of the entire literature. The objective was to identify and categorize all the dental materials citations in biomedical journals that were published from January 1995 through June 1995.

Methods: Seventeen primary and 56 secondary dental journals were manually searched via their tables of contents to detect dental materials publications from January to June of 1995. Dental materials citations were categorized into 17 major sections and further divided into several subsections. The review excluded case reports and literature primarily related to dental implants or biomedical materials outside of dentistry.

Results: Three hundred-sixty-nine citations were identified. The greatest number of citations were associated with dentin bonding, composites, and glass ionomers. There was no significant increase in dental materials publications vs. the number reported for 1994.

Significance: This list provides a comprehensive source for review by academicians and researchers to bridge the gap between initial publication and electronic citation.

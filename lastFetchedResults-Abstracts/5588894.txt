This paper presents the modeling, analysis, and design of a thyristor-based AC-DC converter, featuring bidirectional power flow and unity power factor at the AC side in both powering and regenerating modes. The unified controller regulates the voltage at the DC side and operates as a feedback control in the powering mode and a feedforward control in the regenerating mode. Systematic procedures for designing the power conversion stage and the controller are given

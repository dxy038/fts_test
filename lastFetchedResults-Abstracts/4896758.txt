This paper presents a new method for the diagnosis of faults in matrix converters. The method is based on the monitoring of nine modulated error signals, each one associated to a bidirectional power switch of the converter. Using the proposed technique, an open-circuit in a given switch is detected whenever the associated modulated error voltage signal rises above an established threshold limit. This new method allows a fast detection and location of the faulty switches, independently of the type of load of the converter or its working conditions, namely amplitude and frequency of the output voltages. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique to detect open-circuit faults in matrix converters, even with more than one faulty switch at the same time.

In this paper, a model-predictive control of medium voltage, grid-tied four-level diode-clamped inverter for use in high-power wind energy conversion systems is presented. The control objectives such as regulation of net dc-link voltage, reactive power generation to meet the grid operator request, dc-link capacitor voltages balancing, and switching frequency minimization are included in the cost function. The latter objective is an important requirement for high-power converters, and this has been achieved without any modifications to the software or hardware configuration. The future behavior of the grid currents and dc-link voltages is predicted for all the possible switching states using the discrete-time model of the inverter, dc-link, inductive filter, and grid. The switching state that minimizes the cost function has been chosen and applied to the inverter directly. During different operating conditions, the switching frequency is regulated between 750 and 850 Hz with the help of a lookup-table-based weighting factor, and thus, the proposed methodology appears as a promising tool to control the high-power grid-tied inverters. The results obtained through the MATLAB simulations on 4 MVA/4000 V system and dSPACE DS1103-based experiments on 5 kW/208 V prototype are in a close relationship and thus validate the proposed control strategy.

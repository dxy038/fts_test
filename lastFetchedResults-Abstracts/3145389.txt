The paper proposes a fuzzy based method to evaluate the level of physical preparedness of both nonathletes and athletes based on a number of physiological parameters. Having an objective tool to assess whether their athletes are responding correctly to the training, coaches could prevent undesirable events such as under-training or overtraining. In the case of nonathletes, monitoring the physiological parameters and determining the cardiorespiratory fitness level could prevent the modern chronic diseases. The proposed assessment fuzzy method was implemented in Java 2 Standard Edition. Data were collected from three subjects during a six months training program. The obtained results are in accordance with the values given by the scientific literature.

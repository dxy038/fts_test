This study concerns with the application of multi-objective H<sub>&#8734;</sub>/GH<sub>2</sub> preview control to a real quarter vehicle suspension system. To this goal both linear and nonlinear models of the test rig are derived, and a unified design framework for preview design schemes of LQG-preview and multi-objective preview is introduced. Simulations are carried out to compare both strategies. The study involves the inclusion of actuator dynamics in both analyses and syntheses. It also considers the effect of system nonlinearities in the analyses. Finally, it reports the practical implementation results.

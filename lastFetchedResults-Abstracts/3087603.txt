This paper presents MOJITO, a system which optimizes across thousands of analog circuit topologies simultaneously, and returns a set of sized topologies that collectively provide a performance tradeoff. MOJITO defines a space of possible topologies as a hierarchically organized combination of trusted analog building blocks. To minimize the setup burden: no topology selection rules or abstract behaviors need to be specified, and performance calculations are SPICE-based. The search algorithm is a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that uses an age-layered population structure to balance exploration vs. exploitation. Results are shown for a space having 3528 one- and two-stage operational amplifier topologies.

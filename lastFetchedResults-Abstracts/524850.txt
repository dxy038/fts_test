Background/Objective: To determine the equality in safe delivery indices, i.e., appropriate place of delivery, type of delivery and skilled attendant for delivery, and their determinants in Iran. Methods: This study was performed using the data of Iran demographic and health survey, performed in 2000. Our sample was nationally representative and included 17,991 Iranian married women aged 10 – 49 years who had delivered during two years before the survey. The equality status was assessed by concentration index. The relationship between different factors and safe delivery was investigated by logistic regression. These factors included age, occupation, resident place (urban vs. rural), mother’s educational level and household economic status (weighted asset index). Results: Concentration index (95% CI) for appropriate place of delivery, normal vaginal delivery and skilled attendant for delivery, were 0.111 (0.107 to 0.115), -0.100 (-0.105 to -0.095) and 0.095 (0.091 to 0.099), respectively. In other words, the opportunity of delivery in appropriate place and by skilled attendant were more common in those with higher economic levels; while normal vaginal delivery was less common. Also, mother's age and educational level had significant correlation with safe delivery indices; in all cases mother's education was the most important factor. Conclusion: In spite of the improvement in delivery care in Iran during the past decades, there are significant differences between the current situations of safe delivery in people with different socioeconomic states.

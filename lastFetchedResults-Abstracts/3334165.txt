Long Term Evolution (LTE) is an all IP packet system in which guaranteeing QoS is a real challenge. The LTE aims to provide a maximum data rates of 100Mbps for downlink and 50Mbps for uplink when 20 MHz bandwidth is used. The scheduler takes different considerations into account such as throughput and fairness when deciding the allocation of the scarce radio resources. Therefore the LTE MAC scheduler should consider not only the throughput optimization but also the QoS differentiations in an effective manner. The objective of this project is to focuses on enhancing the performance of LTE downlink scheduling. This project work proposes and implements a, &#8220;Dynamic Multitraffic Scheduler&#8221; which uses dynamic bandwidth and Resource Blocks (RBs) allocations based on number of service classes. The proposed scheduler also considers the different users channel conditions and tries to create a balance between the Quality of service (QoS) guarantees and the multi-user diversity in a proportional fair manner. Round Robin (RR), Best Channel Quality Indicator (BCQI), Proportional Fair (PF) and Opportunistic scheduling are investigated and compared for both existing and proposed scheduler.

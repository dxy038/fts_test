The objective of this study was to investigate the removal mechanism of U(VI) from groundwater by magnetite as the main product of anoxic steel corrosion. For this purpose, a systematic sequence of batch experiments was conducted to focus the active role of magnetite in the reduction of U under different conditions. Results indicated that under anoxic conditions U(VI) was sorbed at the magnetite surface, whereas under reducing conditions at different H2(g) pressures, U was present in tetravalent form as amorphous UO2.

Bulk synchronous parallel ML is a functional parallel language based on the bulk synchronous parallelism model of computation. Deadlocks are avoided and programs are deterministic. The performance of programs can be accurately predicted. This paper addresses the optimization of BSML programs through the compilation of BSML primitives to Objective Caml code with calls to a low level library rather than their direct implementation as a high level library.

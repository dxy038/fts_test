A residue is a trace (μg kg−1, ng kg−1) of a substance, present in a matrix. Residue analysis is a relatively young discipline and a very broad area, including banned (A) substances as well as registered veterinary medicinal products (B substances). The objective of this manuscript is to review future trends in the analysis of residues of veterinary drugs in meat producing animals out of historical perspectives. The analysis of residues in meat producing animals has known a tremendous evolution during the past 35–40 years. In the future, it can be foreseen that this evolution will proceed in the direction of the use of more and more sophisticated and expensive machines. These apparatus, and the necessary human resources for their use, will only be affordable for laboratories with sufficient financial resources and having guarantee for a sufficient throughput of samples.

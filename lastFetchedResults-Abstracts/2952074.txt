For systems described by Euler-Lagrange equations and involve high order interconnections in the states, this paper proposes a decentralized control, which guarantees the uniform ultimate stability when the control objective is tracking a smooth desired trajectory. The controller design is based on some physical properties of such systems and Lyapunov design methodology. The performance of the proposed control scheme is illustrated through the longitudinal control of a string of vehicles within an automated highway system

Ethambutol is one of the front-line agents recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of tuberculosis. In an effort to develop more potent therapies to treat tuberculosis, novel unsymmetrical ethambutol analogues were successfully synthesized by a new route utilizing novel building blocks synthesized using Ellmanâ€™s sulfinyl chemistry. The resulting analogues were tested for anti-tuberculosis activity yielding compounds with comparable anti-tuberculosis activity to ethambutol and increased lipophilicity that may instill better tissue penetration and serum half-life.

This paper presents two topologies for street lighting system with high power factor (HPF) based on light emitting diodes (LEDs). The main characteristic of this work is to develop a circuit that supplies the LEDs by an alternative source (battery) during the peak load time (PLT). The peak load time is considered as the period in which the demand for power from the mains is maximum, and therefore the generation of the power plants and transmission lines must be able to meet this demand. In this work, a bidirectional flyback converter with two outputs is used to supply the LEDs from the mains and also to charge the battery. One topology uses an auxiliary winding to supply the LEDs from the battery. The other uses the same primary winding to supply the LEDs from the battery or from the mains. The flyback converter is composed of a single core for both topologies. Besides, a buck converter is used as Power Factor Correction (PFC) stage. The integration of these converters is performed in order to reduce the number of components and consequently, the volume and cost of the circuit. The converters were implemented and experimental results are shown in order to validate the design methodology, and to compare both topologies.

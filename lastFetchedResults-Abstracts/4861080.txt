In the automated warehouse storage management process, due to changes in internal and external environment, the cargo space in the warehouse will become inappropriate and will have to be re-allocated to improve cargo management efficiency and reduce storage management costs. In view of the storage characteristics of pharmaceutical products and the characteristics of automated warehouse, in order to improve the efficiency of the goods moving into and out of the warehouse, store related products together, decrease transportation time of moving products, this paper puts forth a multi objective model, uses genetic algorithms to solve the model, and uses a simulation example to prove the model. The result shows that storage mode can, basically, satisfy the three objectives and achieve slotting optimization.

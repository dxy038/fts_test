This paper addresses the memory delay-dependent non-fragile L<sub>2</sub> - L<sub>&#8734;</sub> control for continuous-time systems with state delays. The additive controller gain variations are considered, where a more general type of controller gain variations is introduced with less conservativeness. The objective is to derive tractable synthesis conditions for the non-fragile design of controllers such that a prescribed energy-to-peak disturbance-attenuation level is attained for all admissible controller gain variations. The design results are developed for delay-dependent case via linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. It is worth pointing out that the information about the upper bound of delay derivative is taken into consideration even if this upper bound is not smaller than 1. Finally, we illustrate the proposed method with a numerical example.

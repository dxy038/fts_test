Objective measures of machine intelligence for four candidate control systems are calculated for the special case of a human-machine paradigm. Suggestions are then given to generalize this procedure for other types of interconnected control systems. Data from an experiment with augmented systems used in rehabilitation engineering are presented to illustrate a class of assistive devices that provide different levels of intelligence, which are both machine and task specific

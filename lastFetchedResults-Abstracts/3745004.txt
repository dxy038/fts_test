This paper presents coordination algorithms for networks of mobile autonomous agents. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to achieve rendezvous, that is, agreement over the location of the agents in the network. We provide analysis and design results for multiagent networks in arbitrary dimensions under weak requirements on the switching and failing communication topology. The novel correctness proof relies on proximity graphs and their properties and on a general LaSalle invariance principle for nondeterministic discrete-time dynamical systems

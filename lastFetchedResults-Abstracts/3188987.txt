Aims: In order to look for an objective methods to illustrate the condition of renal function changes, we analyze the correlation between the levels of cytokines/chemokines and the severity of renal function for the patient with IgAN. Methods: A total of 26 patients were applied by a novel design to analyze blood and urinary cytokines/chemokines, everyone of them were diagnosed IgA nephropathy (IgAN) by renal biopsy. Blood and urine samples were taken from patients after signing the informed consent. All of the ingredients were tested by using enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The renal function can be calculated by the regression equation. It was shown that the levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;)-1, the main composition of extracellular matrix (MC-ECM) such as collagen IV (col IV) , laminin (LN), hyaluronic acid (HA) and precollagen III (PIIINP) in patients with IgAN had different correlation with the condition of renal function. By the regression equation, we can monitor the change of renal function. Conclusion: Our study is the first to provide an utility regression equation as a way to monitor the condition of renal function to the patients with IgAN. By the regression equation, we would use it to find the severity and the change of renal function in early period.

Blood related invasive pathological investigations play a major role in diagnosis of diseases. But in India and other third world countries there are not enough pathological infrastructures for medical diagnosis. Moreover, most of the remote places of those countries have neither pathologists nor physicians. Telemedicine partially solves the lack of physicians. But the pathological investigation infrastructure canÂ´t be integrated with the telemedicine technology. The objective of this work is to automate the blood related pathological investigation process. Different white blood cells detection has been automated in this work. This system can be deployed in the remote area as a supporting aid for telemedicine technology and only high school education is sufficient to operate it. The proposed system achieves 97.33% accuracy.

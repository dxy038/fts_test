The objective of this paper is to examine fretting fatigue of laser shock peened (LSP) titanium to quantify the influence of LSP on fretting fatigue life. Contact conditions such as loads and pad geometry are chosen to generate fretting fatigue stresses similar to those occurring in blade/disk contacts in gas turbine engines. LSP treated specimens attained 5-, 10- and 25-fold increase in lives compared to untreated specimens. Metallography of the contact area and fractographic analysis of worn pads detail the fretting behavior of LSP treated specimens.

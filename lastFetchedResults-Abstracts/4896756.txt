This paper addresses the evaluation of image quality in the context of wireless systems using feature-based objective metrics. The considered metrics comprise of a weighted combination of feature values that are used to quantify the extend by which the related artifacts are present in a processed image. In view of imaging applications in mobile radio and wireless communication systems, reduced-reference objective quality metrics are investigated for quantifying user-perceived quality. The examined feature-based objective metrics provide options for controlling the processing complexity and implementation resources required for performing the quality evaluation. Furthermore, the metrics support the scaling of overhead needed for communicating the image features over the wireless link and the accuracy for predicting the image quality

The potentials of utilizing the controllability of DC lines to reduce the complexity of remedial schemes or to increase the stability performance of a system so that the impact of existing and future projects on nonproject systems can be minimized are explored. Less costly and perhaps more environmentally acceptable alternatives of utilizing power transfer overloads of the two existing DC lines of the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSSC) in the Western US are presented. In addition, a concept to overload one DC line for the outage of the other DC line is investigated. Reducing the complexity of the remedial action scheme would be definite benefit to the WSCC network operating reliability objective

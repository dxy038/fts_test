The objective of research was to enhance the production of glucose oxidase through mutagenesis of Aspergillus niger. Among colony restrictors, triton X-100 and ox-gall were used and it was found that 1% ox gall was the best. In order to produce depressed mutants for enzyme production, 2-deoxy-D-glucose was used at 1 mg mL-1 in PDA plates. A few colonies were selected based on large clearance zones than wild type microorganism. Glucose oxidase positive strain was identified on agar plate with o-dianisidine and peroxidase. The size and color of zone is an index of the formation of glucose oxidase, giving rise a brown color. The results indicated that A. niger mutant BCM-8 and BCE-6 produced 9 and 6 mm enzyme diffusion zone with 282 and 202% increased activity, respectively. Â© 2010 Friends Science Publishers

Coastal ocean observing systems can provide exciting, real-time data and information and link ocean science to classroom instruction. The Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence Mid-Atlantic (COSEE MA) has developed a course "Taking the Pulse of the Ocean" for secondary school teachers, which emphasizes the science associated with coastal ocean observing systems for educators. The main objective of this 7 day course is to bring together scientists and educators to study ocean science. The mechanism for this interaction is centered on coastal observing systems and the information they can provide on physical and biological processes. We emphasize the importance of observing systems, parameters measured and how the information can be used both in education and in the real world. More specifically, we study ocean movement and its influence on the ocean biota and on the dispersion of pollutants from human activities. We provide activities and lessons based on the content of the course for participants to use in the classroom. Additionally, we require teachers to develop specific uses of the content with their students. Follow-up activities for participants include two workshops and presentations of their experiences to their peers.

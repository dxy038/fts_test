A model to describe the operation of a bidirectional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is proposed. The performance of the power flow, voltage regulation and charging battery are considered in this model. By using this model, the steady-state characteristics of a bidirectional UPS can be simulated and the design of system parameters can be obtained. To verify the accuracy of this model, a prototype was developed. It is shown that the model is very accurate

Automation systems comprise often huge and complex communication networks which save resources such as energy, time, capital and effort for humans. Design of automation systems is often a highly complex problem. For creation of optimal building automation system design, if component variety on the market is considered, there emerge many trade-off design solutions. In our previous work high quality design solutions could be obtained by proposed problem-specific adaptations of multi-objective metaheuristics. In this paper, we propose a new domain-inspired hyperheuristic approach to obtain the majority of optimal solutions in the true Pareto front that concerns evolving variation applications and selection operations.

Objective
We sought to assess the gestational age at which elective delivery is considered in an otherwise uncomplicated patient with preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) by members of the Society of Maternal Fetal-Medicine (SMFM).
Study design
A 3-page survey was mailed to members of the SMFM for this observational study. Information solicited included demographic data and practice patterns for the timing of delivery in patients with preterm PROM.
Results
Seven hundred seventeen questionnaires (40%) were completed. The majority (81%) did not believe there is a consensus regarding the gestational age for elective delivery in patients with preterm PROM. With confirmed fetal lung maturity, the greatest number of respondents selected 32 and 34 weeks as the earliest gestational age for elective delivery. In the absence of fetal pulmonary maturity testing, the majority of respondents chose 34 weeks.
Conclusion
Most SMFM respondents electively deliver uncomplicated patients with preterm PROM by 34 weeks' gestation.

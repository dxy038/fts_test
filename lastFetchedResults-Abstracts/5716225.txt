The problem of traffic congestion is a daily occurrence in most major cities and requires an effective solution. New technologies such as the Automotive Navigation System (ANS) in finding the best path for a user helps commuters find their way without getting lost, but it only provides the best path for the user based on the distance factor without considering real traffic situations. The objective of this study is to create an optimum traffic system where traffic congestion can be reduced, besides providing a platform for further research on traffic congestion management. By using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, the determination of the best path for the user has a higher dependency on the time factor. The simulation was modeled using the JAVA programming language. From the study, the algorithm is shown to improve agent travelling time in the network by between 21.13% and 38.99%.

Introduction and objective: The soils are the major source of fungi. Some of the soil fungi can be pathogen to humans and animals. Rich keratinous materials in soil are the most reason for the incidence and growth of keratinophilic fungi. The purpose of this survey was isolation of keratinophilic and dermatophytic fungi from the soil samples which can be pathogen to humans and animals.
Materials and methods: Forty-five soil samples were collected from three different locations in Ahvaz, Khuzestan province, Iran. The isolated fungi were identified after slide culturing according to studies of their gross and micro-morphological features.
Results: Totally 644 colonies from soil samples collected from three different locations in Ahvaz. The dermatophytes isolated were identified as: Microsporum gypseum 3(0.47%) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes 2(0.31%). The most common non-dermatophytes fungi isolated were: Penicillium sp. 250(38.81%), Yeasts 115(17.86%), Fusarium sp. 81(12.58%), Chrysosporium sp. 57(8.85), Aspergillus flavus 34(5.28%), Mycelia sterilia 32(4.97%) and A. niger 25(3.88%). 
Conclusion: Our research shows the keratinophilic fungi and related dermatophytes present in the soils of Ahvaz, Iran. 
Significance and impact of the study: Survey results revealed the occurrence of keratinophilic fungi in soils of different locations in Ahvaz.

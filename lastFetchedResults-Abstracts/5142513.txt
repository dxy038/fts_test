Net by net routing is still a very important technique used to make connections in VLSI circuits. The maze routing algorithms used for this purpose correspond to shortest path searches derived from basic BFS or from A*, with many dedicated improvements. This paper proposes the use of a new path search algorithm, LCS*, for routing individual connections in VLSI circuits. LCS* is a generic and simultaneous bidirectional heuristic algorithm which is faster than A* in most graph domains, such as VLSI routing grids. This is achieved by using dynamic estimation with the separation of computed values for open and closed nodes. Results show that the running time is reduced and little storage space is needed

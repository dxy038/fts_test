This paper presents a technique to manage a building power for energy saving. A university building is examined as a case study. Objective of the case study is to schedule events in general purpose classrooms with minimum energy consumption. The proposed method is based on concepts of decision tree analysis and balanced three-phase system. The software written on LabVIEW is developed for scheduling events in classrooms and balancing three-phase current loads. Performance of the proposed method is confirmed through simulation results.

Image quality assessment plays an important role in various image processing applications. In recent years, some objective image quality metrics correlated with perceived quality measurement have been developed. Two categories of metrics can be distinguished: with full-reference and no-reference. Full-reference looks at decrease in image quality from some reference of ideal. No-reference approach attempts to model the judgment of image quality without the reference. Unfortunately, the universal image quality model is not on the horizon and empirical models establishes on psychophysical experimentation are generally used. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for quality assessment of colour reproduction based on human visual system modeling. A local contrast definition is used to assign quality scores. Finally, a good correlation is obtained between human evaluations and our method.

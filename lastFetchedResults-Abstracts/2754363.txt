Path following entails having the output of a control system approach a path and traverse it without a priori time parameterization of the motion along the path. We design path-following controllers for a class of mechanical control systems applicable to closed and nonclosed paths. Our approach uses transverse feedback linearization (TFL) to partially meet our objective by putting the system into a convenient normal form for control design. To meet the remaining control requirements, we present a method of refining the TFL normal form. Our approach is demonstrated experimentally on a five-bar robotic manipulator and in simulation on a nonminimum phase robotic manipulator with a flexible link.

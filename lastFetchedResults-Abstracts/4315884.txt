The development of a humanoid robot platform within the scope of the collaborative research centre 588 has the objective of creating a machine that closely cooperates with humans. This development area presents a new challenge to designers. In contrast to industrial robots - for which mechanical rigidity, precision and high velocities are primary requirements - the key aspects here are prevention of hazards to users, a motion space that corresponds to that of human beings and a lightweight design. In order to meet these requirements, the robot must have humanlike appearance, motion space and dexterity. Additionally, its kinematics should be familiar to the user, its motions predictable, so as to encourage inexperienced persons to interact with the machine. This article gives insight into the design of the mechatronic components of the upper body of the humanoid robot ARMAR III. Due to the special boundary conditions for the design of such a humanoid robot and complex interaction between system elements, the design process is very challenging. The robot has a modular structure. The modules for neck, torso and arms were designed and built at the Institute of Product Development (IPEK) at the University of Karlsruhe (TH). The design of these modules of the upper body and the problems solved by these designs are presented in this article

Background and Objective: Irisin was identified as a myokine secreted by exercise which plays an important role in energy metabolism and regulation of metabolic diseases such as obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eight weeks aerobic training on serum levels of irisin in male obese Wistar rats.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 16 adult rats (weight: 250 to 300 g, BMI  > 30 g/cm2) were divided into two groups: aerobic training with 70 to 75% Vo2max (moderate intensity) and control group. Aerobic training included: eight weeks walking on treadmill (5 sessions/per week for 60 min per session). After the training period, the level of irisin was measured. Statistical techniques for data analysis were paired and independent sample t-test to determine the intra- and inter-group comparisons between groups and the level of significance was considered at p < 0.05.

Results: The serum levels of irisin in the aerobic training group with moderate intensity significantly increased as compared to the control group (t=4.18, p=0.001). In addition, weight in aerobic training significantly reduced.

Conclusion: According to the results, eight weeks of aerobic training lead to a significant increase in serum levels of irisin. Moreover, it seems that aerobic training with moderate intensity has led to an increase in theremogenesis, weight loss, and energy expenditure.

The alarming rate at which global energy reserves are depleting, is a major worldwide concern at economic, environmental, industrial and community levels. A partial solution to this crisis is the use of decentralized generations and vehicle-to-grid (or V2G) plug-in electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel dasialiving and mobilitypsila concept, through which plug-in-vehicles can be utilized for harnessing renewable energy, storage, transportation, and providing power for both residential and commercial customers. The proposed concept uses an efficient energy management unit (EEMU), a bidirectional power module with a grid-interface, a Web and wireless communication interface and a hybrid plug-in vehicle, called dasiaBlueAnglepsila. The EEMU overseas the operation of the overall system with real time monitoring of system variables. The power module of the proposed system uses a common DC link for power exchange. The amount and the direction of power flow amongst the sub-systems, which include the grid, renewable energy sources, household load and BlueAngle, is controlled by the EEMU in accordance with the systems variables. The proposed system is versatile, and expected to gain popularity amongst both commercial and residential users interested in resolving the global energy crisis.

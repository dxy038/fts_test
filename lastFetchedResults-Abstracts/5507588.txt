A CMOS buffer for high capacitive loads is presented. The objective of the design has been a high-power, area-efficient buffer to be used in very large scale analog applications. The use of compensation capacitor has been avoided and therefore a significant saving of die area has been achieved. This was made possible by using two half-circuits at the input and eliminating the intermediate stage, and also resistive compensation at the output stage. The buffer can deliver a slew rate of 1.2 V/&#956;s to capacitive loads in excess of 5000 pF. It has a total harmonic distortion of less than 3% at 20 kHz. At stand-by, it consumes only 125 &#956;A (0.625 mW). The buffer occupies 100 mils<sup>2</sup> of die area in a 3 &#956;m technology

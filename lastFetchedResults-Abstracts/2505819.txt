<strong>Objective:</strong> We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy of an herbal sexual supplement (vigRX) on premature ejaculation (PE).<strong><br />Method:</strong> A randomized double blind study was conducted on a fixed dose of herbal vigRX at Roozbeh Psychiatry Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The sample consisted of 85 married patients diagnosed with primary PE according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Each patient underwent diagnostic evaluation by one trained psychiatrist, using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. Each patient was evaluated by researchers to exclude the organic sexual dysfunctions. The patients were randomly assigned in to two groups: group 1 consisting of 42 patients receiving placebo, and group 2 consisting of 43 patients receiving 540 mg herbal vigRX for a 4-week treatment course. The effects of the drug on the ejaculatory function in each group were assessed by the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), and the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (CIPE) before and at the end of the treatment course. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (15th version).The mean IELT increased 22.4 and 32.0 seconds in the placebo and the vigRX group respectively after the treatment course. The mean IELT differences between the two groups was not significant. The mean CIPE score increased 2.40 and 4.37 in the placebo and the vigRX group respectively.<strong><br />Results:</strong> The mean CIPE score differences between the two groups was not significant.No side effect was reported by the subjects in neither groups during the treatment course.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Although the improvement in IELT and CIPE scores in the herbal vigRX group was more than the placebo group, this difference was not statistically significant. The increasing of IELT and CIPE score in the placebo group may be due to the placebo effects. Further studies with higher vigRX doses, greater sample size and longer treatment courses are warranted.

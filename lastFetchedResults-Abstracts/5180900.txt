It is more Borehole induced polarization (IP) method plays a very important role in solid mineral exploration, especially in surface to borehole IP method. In inversion, the surface IP inversion has been some significant results, but less borehole IP inversion results, especially for surface to borehole IP inversion results. In this paper, the secondary field anomalies of spherical ore body for surface to borehole IP method in uniform current field was calculated, objective function of optimization inversion was established, the d (the distance from spherical ore body to borehole), h (the depth of spherical ore body) and i (IP inclination) was inversed using optimization scale transformation BFGS method. Inversion result is high precision and inversion effect is good.

Focusing on the deficiencies of conventional intrusion detection model, Wenke Lee, Salvatore J. Stolfo et al. propose the intrusion detection system based on data mining technology. It solves the problem that self-adaptability of the system is poor, and the conditions of misreport or omission are also further improved. However, as far as mass data are concerned, more and more resources need to be consumed in the intrusion detection system based on data mining technology, and the detection speed gets slower and slower. In the article, the multi-grade intrusion detection model based on data mining technology is proposed, and the objective to improve the detection speed is reached.

A new image sensor is presented that comprises a chopper-stabilised edge detector and a correlated-double-sampling readout circuit, based on 2 mu m BiCMOS technology for pattern recognition neural network VLSI applications operating at 77 K. With the chopper-stabilised edge detector and the correlated-double-sampling readout technique, the two-dimensional photodiode array, which can be efficiently built with only one readout circuit, provides a bidirectional edge detection capability for high resolution image sensing applications operating at 77 K.

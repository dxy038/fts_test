An experimental investigation of transient charge decay in a vessel partially filled with electrically charged liquid is reported. The test facility is an upright cylindrical tank with diameter and height equal to 50 cm. It is instrumented to permit continuous measurement of both the bulk charge density in the liquid and the electrostatic field during experimental runs. By correlating the time course of the bulk charge density to that of the electrostatic field, the transient redistribution of electrostatic charge can be characterized. One objective of this research is to ascertain the role played by surface charge in controlling the transient decay

Due to the involvement of various political institutions and agents, the structure of Saljuq dynasty (1040-1193 AD) is unique in comparison to the political structure of other Islamic regimes. "Saljuqnameh" written by Zahir al-din Nishabouri provides a brief objective narration about the establishment and development of Saljuq governmental structure. Nishabouriâ€™s detailed attention to the military generals as an important factor in the political changes of this period, and to the attempts by the bureaucrats to curb and control their power and to its use effectively to strengthen the Saljuq Government is an interesting characteristic of the book.
This article looks at the dialectic relationship and the intense competition between the military and bureaucratic institutions in Saljuq Dynasty. The secret alliance between military agents and the lack of unity between the bureaucrats prevented the bureaucratic institution to stop the military and break their exclusive domination in power.

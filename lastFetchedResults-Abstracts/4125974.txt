TWO 325,000-KW turbine-generator units operating at supercritical steam pressures are being installed in the new Eddystone Station of the Philadelphia Electric Company. The station is located southwest of the center of Philadelphia, near the city of Chester, Pa. The higher steam pressures involve greater auxiliary power requirements than usual, but the use of steam turbine driven high-pressure boiler feed pumps reduces the portion carried electrically to about the normal percentage. To achieve adequate reliability in the auxiliary power system and, at the same time, to provide an economical design has been a primary objective. Simplicity of layout with a minimum number of cross ties and the absence of complicated automatic throwover schemes contribute to this result. Furthermore, the electric system has been co-ordinated with the mechanical requirements to obtain a balanced design.

Application of multi-objective optimization method, the issue of portfolio risk is analyzed and simulated and the feasibility of the scheme is validated under the uncertain investment environment. Proposed the use of multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm portfolio risk measurement methods, this work educe the estimation Model of Risk-Minimization for Portfolio Investment Using such as Benefits and risks as Target, then gives a specific evolutionary algorithm, and finally, a simulation example.

Given the rising and renewed interest towards the study of Moon the European space Agency (ESA) approved, in March 2006, the phase-A for the feasibility study of the European Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO) mission proposed by the Student Space Exploration &amp; Technology Initiative (SSETI). The objective of the ESMO mission is to acquire images of the moon in stable orbit, transmit them to the Earth and then to actively involve European students in a real space program experience. In order to accomplish the ESMO mission objectives, a Micro Wave Radiometric Sounder (MiWaRS) has been selected as a possible choice for flying on board of the ESMO satellite. This work summarizes the preliminary results obtained during the phase-A for the MiWaRS with special attention to the description of the radiometric system design and its scientific objectives.

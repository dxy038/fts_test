Objective Suicides account for more than 30,000 deaths
per year in the US alone. Suicide rates change over time,
and the factors influencing them remain poorly understood.
Economic factors, in particular unemployment, have been
suggested as a major influence. However, the evidence for
this has been inconsistent, which may be partly explained
by shortcomings of the statistical methods used.
Methods Time series analytical techniques (unit root and
co-integration tests) were applied to test the associations over
time between economic factors, i.e. unemployment, real
gross domestic product per capita (RGDP) and the consumer
price index (CPI) and death rates by suicide as collected by
national agencies in the UK (1901–2006), US (1900–1997),
France (1970–2004) and Italy (1970–2001). Traditional
correlation analyses were used when appropriate.
Results Co-integration and correlation tests showed a
long-run association between economic factors and suicide
rates. Increase/decrease of unemployment predicted an
increase/decrease of suicide rates over long historical
periods and in different nations. RGDP and the CPI were
also linked with suicide rates, but this was not consistently
so and the direction of the association varied.
Conclusions Unemployment is a major factor influencing
suicide rates over long periods of time and in different
national contexts. It needs to be considered as a confounding
factor in evaluations of suicide prevention
strategies

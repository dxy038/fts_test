The main objective of this paper is to identify and understand the relationship dynamics among the quality enabled factors affecting the scheduling stage of production system life cycle. For this purpose, Interpretative structural modelling (ISM) approach has been utilized for developing the relationships among the various factors of the scheduling system stage. Afterwards, MICMAC (Matriced Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliqueeaun Classement) analysis has been carried out in order to classify the factors into different categories and to disclose the direct and indirect effects of each factor on the scheduling system. It is an approach for refining the decision making in the scheduling stage of production system life cycle.

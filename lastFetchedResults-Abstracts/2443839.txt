Because ITER magnet system has a limited number of mechanical and thermal stress cycles, shut down number of the toroidal field is limited during lifetime of ITER. Any inspection device able to withstand the toroidal field between two plasma shots will enhance the inspection frequency capacity of ITER during operation phase. In addition to the high magnetic field the system should also cope with high temperature, ultra-high vacuum and high radiation, in order to keep the reactor availability high.

ion, ultra-high vacuum and temperature constraints already addressed by on going R&amp;D activities within Europeâ€”considering the required level of radiation is to date the highest encountered in remote handling, and that facing all these constraints at once is an additional issue to overcome. Whereas, operating remote handling systems in high magnetic field is quite new field of investigation. This paper aims to be a guideline for future designers to help them choose among options the adequate solution for an ITER relevant inspection device. It provides the designer an objective view of the different effects that stem from technical choices and help them deciding whether a technology is relevant or not depending on the task's requirements.

e selected a set of technologies and products available for structural design, actuation, sensing and data transmission in order to design inspection remote handling equipment for ITER in the given constraints. These different solutions are commented with specific considerations and directions to have them fit in the specifications. Different design strategies to cope with magnetic field are then discussed, which imply either insensitive design or using the magnetic field as a potential energy source and as a positioning help.

nalysis is the first result of one of the projects in the PREFIT partnership, part of the European Fusion Training Scheme.

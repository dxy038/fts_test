WDM passive optical network with a simultaneous wireline/wireless data transmission in downlink and a wavelength reuse using a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) in uplink was proposed and experimentally demonstrated. This proposed scheme uses a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) in the central office (CO) and a RSOA in the optical network unit (ONU). We verified the feasibility of the proposed scheme through 1.25-Gbps bidirectional transmission experiment.

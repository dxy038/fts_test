Designing an optimal residue number system (RNS) processor in terms of area and speed depends on the choice of the system moduli. In this paper an optimal algorithm for choosing the system moduli is presented. The algorithm takes into consideration several constraints imposed by the problem definition. The problem is formalized as an integer programming problem to optimize an area/time objective function.

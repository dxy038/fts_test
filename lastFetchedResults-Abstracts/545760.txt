Objective
The diagnosis of de Morsier syndrome or septo-optic dysplasia is made on the 
basis of the diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia. Septo-optic dysplasia is defined 
by a variable combination of dysgenesis of midline brain structures including 
optic nerve hypoplasia and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction often associated 
with a wide variety of brain malformations of cortical development. 
The importance of direct ophthalmoscopy of optic nerve abnormalities is 
stressed, as well as of magnetic resonance imaging, which has become a 
guideline in the classification of this syndrome
This article reports a 19-year-old female with bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia, 
anterior encephalocele and intact septum pellucidum. She was diagnosed with 
diabetes insipidus, short stature and the history of seizure.

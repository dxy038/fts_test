Proposes the use of the Delaunay triangulation for feasible region division in constrained global optimization. The mathematical foundations for its use, along with the practical considerations for its implementation, are presented. The Delaunay triangulation algorithm is implemented in C.D. PerttunenÂ´s nonparametric method (1989). Results of this application are shown through the use of a standard set of test functions. The use of Delaunay triangulation is shown to yield a search in which the scatter plot of search points mimics the contour plot of the objective function under consideration

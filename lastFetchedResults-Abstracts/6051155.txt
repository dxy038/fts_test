Despite the numerous advantages of knowledge management (KM), its implementation is perceived to be a difficult and complex task. As a result, many enterprises fail to implement KM successfully. Therefore a deep and systematic assessment of the influencing factors is needed. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyze a set of critical success factors (CSFs) for KM implementation in Iranian small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Using DEMATEL methodology, a causal model of CSFs is developed and CSFs are categorized into two groups of driver and dependent factors. The findings indicate that three factors, namely &#8220;top management support and leadership&#8221;, &#8220;strategic planning&#8221; and &#8220;resources&#8221; are driver factors and need serious attention, because any action on these three driver factors will have an effect on the other factors.

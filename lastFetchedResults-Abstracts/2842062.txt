According to the modern control and optimal estimation theory, a mathematical model of the pilot attention resource allocation is developed This model analyzes the inherent characteristics of pilot input and output links in the pilot-vehicle closed-loop system, and the optimal control model of pilot is established by simplification and mathematical modeling. The control task chosen in this paper concerns the longitudinal motion of a hovering aircraft. To solve the pilot optimal attention allocation problem in the instrument-monitoring task of the pilot-vehicle closed-loop system an objective function is set up based on flight control system state equation. In the process of solving optimization problem, the constrained optimization problem is converted into an unconstrained problem, and is solved effectively with the method of steepest descent algorithm in the MATLAB.

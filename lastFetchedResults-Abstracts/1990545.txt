Three tomato allergens (Lyc e 1, Lyc e 2 and Lyc e 3) have been characterised until now. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of other proteins with capacity to bind IgE. The objective of this study was to identify new tomato allergens by molecular biology techniques. A tomato peel cDNA library was screened using a specific pool of sera from sensitised individuals. A clone was obtained and its sequence compared to other described allergens. This clone contained 34 aminoacids from the C-terminal region of an acidic ribosomal protein 60S. This protein showed more than 85% of homology with fungal allergens and 93.8% of homology with the almond allergen Pru du 5. The clone also contains 169 base pairs without homology with other known genes and could correspond to non-coding sequences. The IgE detection with a pool of sera was positive which confirms that is a new tomato allergen.

A contamination of off-site aquatic environments with pesticides has been observed in the tropics, yet only sparse information exists about pesticide fate in such ecosystems. The objective of our semi-field study was to elucidate the fate of alachlor, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, metolachlor, profenofos, simazine, and trifluralin in the aqueous environment of the Pantanal wetland (MT, Brazil). To this aim, water and water/sediment microcosms of two sizes (0.78 and 202 l) were installed in the outskirts of this freshwater lagoon environment and pesticide dissipation was monitored for up to 50 d after application. The physical-chemical water conditions that developed in the microcosms were reproducible among field replicates for both system sizes. Pesticide dissipation was substantially enhanced for most pesticides in small microcosms relative to the large ones (reduced DT50 by a factor of up to 5.3). The presence of sediment in microcosms led to increased persistence of chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and trifluralin in the test systems, while for polar pesticides (alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor, profenofos, and simazine) a lesser persistence was observed. Atrazine, simazine, metolachlor, and alachlor were identified as the most persistent pesticides in large water microcosms (DT50 greater-or-equal, slanted 47 d); in large water/sediment systems endosulfan β, atrazine, metolachlor, and simazine showed the slowest dissipation (DT50 greater-or-equal, slanted 44 d). A medium-term accumulation in the sediment of tropical ecosystems can be expected for chlorpyrifos and endosulfan isomers (11–35% of applied amount still extractable at 50 d after application). We conclude that the persistence of the studied pesticides in aquatic ecosystems of the tropics is not substantially lower than during summer in temperate regions.

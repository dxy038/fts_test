In this paper, a simplified image formation model is proposed for objective evaluation function of tone reproduction. According to the model and the evaluation function, the best tone reproduction is presented. It relies on baseline demographic characteristics of the image brightness, then compresses an array images having been geometrically corrected the same scene photos with exposure bracketing to get a normal image using the histogram of each input images. Combined with dynamic range reduction, the proposed algorithm also applies the chromatic adaptation technique in order to preserve the chromatic appearance and color consistency across scene and display environments. This approach can better maintain a perceptual match between the real world and the displayed image. It can be used for the rapid static images processing.

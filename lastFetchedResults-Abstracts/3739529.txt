Using databases derived from the pattern recognition approach, the paper presents a methodology for utilising fuzzy models to enhance the quality of decision-making using fuzzy-logic algorithms. In the paper, two multi-objective fuzzy-logic control algorithms for controlling power system static/dynamic security are presented and analysed. The first algorithm is based on the successive inferences of fuzzy implication rules for each individual objective, and the second algorithm is an application of the method of fuzzy linear programming. Using results from these algorithms, the paper discusses the properties, advantages and limitations of applying fuzzy decision-making logic in the pattern-recognition approach and concludes by highlighting potential areas for further development

The dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is analyzed. The study shows that under certain conditions the PMSM is experiencing chaotic behavior. To control these unwanted chaotic oscillations, a nonlinear controller based on the backstepping nonlinear control theory is designed. The objective of the designed control is to stabilize the output chaotic trajectory by forcing it to the nearest constant solution in the basin of attraction. The result is compared with a nonlinear sliding mode controller. The designed controller that based on backstepping nonlinear control was able to eliminate the chaotic oscillations. Also the study shows that the designed controller is mush better than the sliding mode control.

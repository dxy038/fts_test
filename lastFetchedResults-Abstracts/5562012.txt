We consider the problem of MIMO channel estimation subject to a given error and delay constraints. Our objective is to minimize the energy spent during the channel estimation phase, which includes transmission of training symbols, storage of those symbols at the receiver, and also channel estimation at the receiver. We develop a model that is independent of the hardware or software used for channel estimation, and use a divide and conquer strategy to minimize the overall energy consumption.

DIPLODOCUS is a UML profile targeting the design space exploration of Systems-on-Chip at a high level of abstraction. It is supported by an open source toolkit named TTool, which enables the designer to develop, simulate and formally verify SoC models. Up to now, performance criteria such as CPU and bus loads were the main metrics used for the exploration. The main objective of our research works is to provide methods and tools to quickly estimate the power consumption at the first steps of a system design. This work enhances DIPLODOCUS with power consumption modelling and analysis. Both software and hardware power management techniques can now be modelled in an abstract way. So enhanced, DIPLODOCUS offers the possibility to evaluate different power management policies, and to estimate the system power consumption.

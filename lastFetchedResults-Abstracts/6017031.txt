This paper deals with the assessment of the quality of the products resulting from the application of fusion methods, exploiting the synergy of multimodal images at a low spatial resolution and images at a higher spatial resolution but with a lower spectral content. It concentrates on the assessment of the geometrical quality through the analysis of the quality of selected contours. The first objective of our paper is to present a method for the estimation of the MTF. This method applies to excerpts of images containing long well contrasted linear features. The performance of the method is assessed by applying it to several Ikonos images and comparing the results to published works. The second objective is to demonstrate that the method may be exploited to assess the geometrical quality of the fused product

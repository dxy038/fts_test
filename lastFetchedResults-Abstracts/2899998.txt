The objective of this paper is to evaluate Bag-of-Colors (BoC) descriptor for land use classification. BoC can be used either as a global or local descriptor. In this paper we present and evaluate both approaches. We analyze the influence of different parameters on classification accuracy and introduce a modification of descriptor extraction process, which significantly influences the classification results and performance.

The objective of present study was to examine the effect of moderate and heavy resistance exercise on serum ghrelin, somatostatin and glucagon hormones. Study design was crossover and 13 volunteer male(age 37.38±5.92 year, body weight 79.66±7.59 kg, body fat 22.46±5 % and BMI 26.44±2.81 kg/m2) in acute resistance exercise include 8 exerciser, 3 sets, 70-75 % or 80-85 % of 1RM in 3 position control (n=13), moderate (n=13) and heavy (n=13) resistance exercise, before and after exercise days subjects self-recorded dietary intake. Blood samples were taken before, immediately, 3 and 9-h after the exercise protocol. Ghrelin showed an increase immediately and 3-h after exercise and 9-h after exercise returned to pre-exercise values over groups. There were no effect significantly serum ghrelin, somatostatin and glucagon by moderate and heavy resistance exercise. Conclusion: Moderate and heavy resistance exercise no effect signifi-cantly on circadian rhythm serum ghrelin, somatostatin and glucagon.

In this paper, we develop a bi-objective mathematical model for a Green Supply Chain considering profit maximization and carbon emissions minimization. The model is based on an integer programming formulation. Epsilon-constraint is used as solution method for the model. A numerical study is performed to provide insight into the behavior of the model. The results of a case study from practice show that for local supply chains, both objectives can be solved simultaneously; while in global supply chain is contradictory.

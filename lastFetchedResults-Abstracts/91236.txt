The instructional design of an introductory biomechanics class (BME 101) has gone through several iterations since its inception in 1988 at Vanderbilt University. Our objective is to modify BME 101 so that it becomes more effective through the introduction of learner-centered, community-centered, and assessment-centered activities. Challengebased instruction provides one method of instruction that can capture these various dimensions of effective learning environments. We have been exploring the potential of this instructional method and several innovative learning technologies to improve students' perceptions of the effectiveness of the course. We provide a short description of how challenges are created for biomechanics and how technology was used to make the course more learner centered, both in and out of class.

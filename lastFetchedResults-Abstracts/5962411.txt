Project management is one of central issues in management of technology and engineering. Kathy Schwalbe summarized recent statistics that average time overrun is 163% in 2001 and 227% in 1995, and average cost overrun is 145% in 2001 and 189% in 1995. The project management is not so much successful. A software development company is expected to provide high quality and functional software to the world. It is difficult to control software quality because software is invisible and cannot be felt with our finger. In addition, it is hard to make its productivity efficient because software is created as a result of brainwork. Generally speaking, a project team is organized to create software. Human relationships and work environment affect software qualities. Therefore, it is very important to study the project management of software development for the cost of management and the quality control. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the influential features of software development projects by analyzing questionnaires collected from several software development companies. In the analysis, a multivariate model is employed to quantitatively evaluate the influential features of software development projects

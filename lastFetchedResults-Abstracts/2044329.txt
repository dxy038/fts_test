Objective: This research has been conducted with the aim of examining the performance of slow-learner first grade elementary students in Wechsler, Laiter and Goodenough Intelligence scales.
Materials & Methods: The present study was a comparative study. The statistical population was consisted of slow-learner students who were studying in the 1st grade in elementary schools in Isfahan 50 students (25 girls, 25 boys) were selected randomly. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Leiter international performance scale and the Goodenough Draw-a-man test were used to measure verbal and nonverbal intelligences of students. Data were analyzed by using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and independent t-test.
Results: the results showed that slow-learner students in Wechsler and Leiter scales had subscales were similar function. A significant correlation was found between the Leiter score with Wechsler (P<0.05) and with Goodenough (P0.05).
Conclusion: the relationship between Leiter scale with Wechsler and Goodenough scales confirms the correctness of present assessment. Slow-learner boy and girl students of 1st grade in elementary school had the same performance on three intelligence scales.

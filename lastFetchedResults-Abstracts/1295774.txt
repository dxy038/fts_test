Make-to-order (MTO) operations have to effectively manage their capacity to make long-term sustainable profits. This objective can be met by selectively accepting available customer orders and simultaneously planning for capacity. We model a MTO operation of a job-shop with multiple resources having regular and non-regular capacity. The MTO firm has a set of customer orders at time zero with fixed due-dates. The process route, processing times, and sales price for each order are given. Since orders compete for limited resources, the firm can only accept some orders. In this paper a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) is proposed to aid an operational manager to decide which orders to accept and how to allocate resources such that the overall profit is maximized. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is devised to solve the MILP effectively. The MILP is first decomposed into a master problem and several sub-problems using Dantzigâ€“Wolfe decomposition. Each sub-problem is represented as a network flow problem and an exact procedure is proposed to solve the sub-problems efficiently. We also propose an approximate B&P scheme, Lagrangian bounds, and approximations to fathom nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. Computational analysis shows that the proposed B&P algorithm can solve large problem instances with relatively short time.

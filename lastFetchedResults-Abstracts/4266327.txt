Highly sensitive laser-induced time-resolved fluorescence spectrometry offers a fast and reagent-free analytical method for the detection and distinction of hydrocarbons in water. It has a significant potential for a wide range of marine applications as a submersible solution, e.g. for long-term application in environmental monitoring or observation tasks in the offshore oil and gas industry in combination with remotely operated vehicles. The objective of the project ldquosubLIFrdquo (submersible time-resolved Laser-Induced Fluorescence sensor) is the development of a real-time, reagent-free in situ detection system for the identification and quantification of hydrocarbons in natural waters. Within this paper we present the set-up and first results achieved with the prototype of the innovative measuring cell under laboratory conditions as well as the sensor principle and the applied detection-system of the ldquosubLIFrdquo project.

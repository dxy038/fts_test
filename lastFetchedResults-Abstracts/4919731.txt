The transfer of information over the wireless networks is emerging as a promising business model. In addition, new applications require the transfer of video content in real time. However, the unpredictable nature of wireless and mobile networks in terms of bandwidth, end-to-end delay and packet loss has tremendous impact on the transmission of video streams. In this paper, we adopt Network Adaptation Techniques applied together with Content Adaptation Techniques to achieve graceful performance degradation when network load increases and network conditions deteriorate. We present a new feedback mechanism that provides video adaptation to network parameters, working together with a fuzzy-based decision algorithm. Our preliminary performance evaluations indicate that our algorithm can finely adapt the video stream bit rate to the available bandwidth while providing fairness as well as high and stable objective quality of service.

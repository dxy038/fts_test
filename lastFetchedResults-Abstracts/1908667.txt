Objective
ess the safety of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with neobladder reconstruction in comparison to ileal conduit, as radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is an effective curative surgical treatment for muscle-invasive and high-risk superficial bladder cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy is usually considered for patients with clinical stage &gt; T2 and nodal metastasis.
ts and Methods
lysed retrospectively patients who had had a radical cystectomy and urinary diversion between 1992 and 2004. Patients with high-risk disease who had adjuvant chemotherapy were identified and stratified based on the type of urinary diversion (ileal conduit or neobladder). The chemotherapy regimen, complications from the adjuvant chemotherapy and other relevant data were analysed.
s
l, 343 patients had radical cystectomy, 40 had adjuvant chemotherapy; 25 had an ileal conduit and 15 had a neobladder. Patient characteristics including age, stage and follow-up were similar. In all, 55% of patients had grade 1 toxicity, 23% grade 2, 18% grade 3, and 13% grade 4. No patients had serious organ toxicity and none died. There were no significant differences in the toxicity among the two groups.
sions
nt chemotherapy appears to be safe in patients with a neobladder and equally safe in patients with an ileal conduit. Hence neobladder reconstruction should not be denied to patients with bladder cancer who are at high risk of recurrence and who might require adjuvant chemotherapy.

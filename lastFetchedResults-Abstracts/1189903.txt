In this paper, we develop a batch fuzzy learning vector quantization algorithm that attempts to solve certain problems related to the implementation of fuzzy clustering in image compression. The algorithmâ€™s structure encompasses two basic components. First, a modified objective function of the fuzzy c-means method is reformulated and then is minimized by means of an iterative gradient-descent procedure. Second, the overall training procedure is equipped with a systematic strategy for the transition from fuzzy mode, where each training vector is assigned to more than one codebook vectors, to crisp mode, where each training vector is assigned to only one codebook vector. The algorithm is fast and easy to implement. Finally, the simulation results show that the method is efficient and appears to be insensitive to the selection of the fuzziness parameter.

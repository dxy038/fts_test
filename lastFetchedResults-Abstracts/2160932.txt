The objective of this work was to study the production of catalase and nitrate reductase by staphylococci in order to understand their role in lipid oxidation during sausage manufacturing. Catalase and nitrate reductase were measured in resting cells and supernatants of staphylococci grown in different conditions. All staphylococci (except S. warneri) synthetized nitrate reductase. In static condition, the synthesis was maximal during exponential growth phase, whereas in shaking condition, the synthesis was maximal at the beginning of stationary phase. The production of nitrate reductase was increased in presence of nitrate, this effect was particularly important for the two S. carnosus strains which exhibited the highest activity. For all staphylococci, the production of catalase was maximal at the end of the exponential growth phase. The lowest amount of catalase was produced by S. warneri and the highest by S. carnosus. Only S. xylosus 873 and S. saprophyticus 852 released high amounts of catalase in the supernatant growth. Staphylococci produced higher amounts of catalase in shaking conditions. Addition of nitrate in the growth media favoured the synthesis of catalase, with a pronounced effect for S. carnosus. Nitrate also favoured the release of catalase.

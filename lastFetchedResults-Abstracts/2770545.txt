Photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the main actors in distributed power generation. In particular, in urban contexts, the PV generators can be subjected to mismatching phenomena due to the different orientation of the modules with respect to the sun rays or due to shadowing. In these cases, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) function must be designed carefully. In this paper, architecture, including one dc/dc converter for each PV generator, is considered. The converters´ output terminals are series connected to a high-voltage dc bus, where also a bidirectional dc/dc converter managing the power from/to a storage device is plugged. The functional constraints deriving from the dc/dc converters´ connection, the mismatching phenomena, the MPPT capabilities of the inverter, connected with its input terminals at the dc bus, are taken into account in order to determine the best operating point of the system as a whole. The real-time constrained optimization problem is solved by using the particle swarm optimization method, which needs the knowledge of the actual current versus voltage curve of each PV generator. The practical impact of this need is also discussed in the paper. The feasibility and the performances of the proposed approach are experimentally validated by using a laboratory prototype.

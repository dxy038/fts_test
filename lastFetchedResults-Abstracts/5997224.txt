In this paper a novel scheme for regulation of amplitude and frequency of an autonomous self-excited induction generator (SEIG) terminal voltage under perturbations in shaft speed and connected load has been presented, which does not require voltage and frequency feedback. In this technique, compensation of active and reactive component of SEIG stator phase current using a generalized impedance controller (GIC) provides the regulation of SEIG output. The stator current compensation is different from standard hysteresis current compensation technique. The GIC is a voltage controlled PWM voltage source converter, offering controlled bidirectional flow of active and reactive power, while connected at the PCC via coupling reactance. For wide range of shaft input to the given generator, the relationship between the shaft input and reference amplitude of active and reactive component of SEIG stator phase current, at rated PCC voltage and frequency, is pre-established for proper GIC based compensation. A mathematical model of SEIG-GIC-load integrated system has been developed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to demonstrate capability of the generating system to provide voltage and frequency regulated supply, under variety of source and load perturbations.

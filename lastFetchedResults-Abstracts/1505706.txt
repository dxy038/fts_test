The conversion of a solvolysis lignin to useful chemicals and fuels was investigated using HZSM-5 catalyst. The study was carried out in a fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure, over a temperature range of 500°C–650°C, and weight hourly space velocities of 2.5 to 7.5 h−1. The major objective was to investigate the use of HZSM-5 catalyst in the production of both liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon products directly from the lignin. Conversion was high and ranged between 50% and 85% for the reaction conditions used. Using a WHSV of 5 h−1, the liquid product (LP) yield was 39 wt.% at 500°C but decreased to 34 wt.% at 600°C and then to 11 wt.% at 650°C. The highest yield of liquid product (43 wt.%) was obtained at 550°C with a WHSV of 5 h−1. In all the experiments, the liquid product mainly consisted of aromatic hydrocarbons (mostly benzene, toluene and xylene — with toluene dominating). The yield of toluene increased from 31 wt.% of the liquid product at 600°C (WHSV=2.5 h−1) to 44 wt.% at 650°C (WHSV=5 h−1). The total gas yield increased dramatically with increasing temperature but only moderately with increasing WHSV. The yields of the major components in the gas stream (propane, ethylene, propylene, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide) were greatly affected by temperature.

The theoretical and experimental studies of linear antenna arrays with bidirectional phase center motion (BPCM) is presented. BPCM is achieved by exciting only part of the linear array elements and sweeping the excited part from one end to the other and back. The sidelobes of the linear arrays with BPCM experience both upper and lower Doppler frequency shift effect in turn, as compared to linear arrays with unidirectional phase center motion (UPCM). Numerical results show that linear arrays with BPCM are also capable of synthesizing low/ultralow sidelobes, but with a much lower excitation dynamic range ratio as compared to that in conventional arrays. In addition, some characteristics, such as passband bandwidth or sideband levels, are better than those of arrays with UPCM or time modulated variable aperture size arrays. An L-band 16-element printed dipole linear array with BPCM was designed. Experimental results show that a -35 dB relative sidelobe level (SLL) can be achieved.

Launched in 1972, the objective of the program is the development of cryoalternators adapted to the electrical systems for the end of the twentieth century. The principal criteria retained for utilizer overall cost optimization are availability, efficiency and construction costs. The cryogenic design has been validated by the construction and testing of a rotor model (diameter 1.06 m; 12 t of which 4t at 5 K, 5000 A, 3000 rpm). Electricit&#233; de France and Alsthom Atlantique are considering the costs and means for the industrial putting into operation of 250 MW cryoalternator in an existing coal-fired power plant.

This paper presents the evaluation of speech recognition. The main objective of the design is to develop new algorithm for control the motion of the robot such as forward, reverse, left, right and stop. The proposed method is divided to speech recognition and analytical engine. This system has been tested in two situation i.e. silent and noisy condition. It has been proved this system work very effectively in silent condition.

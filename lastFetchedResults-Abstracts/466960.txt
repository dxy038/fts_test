Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether United States Medical Licensing Examination scores during medical school predict resident-in-training examination scores and whether other criteria of medical student performance correlate with the faculty's subjective evaluation of resident performance. Study Design: United States Medical Licensing Examination step I and II scores for 24 residents were compared to their scores on in-training examinations. Faculty evaluated 20 graduated residents by rating both their cognitive and noncognitive clinical performance. Scores from these evaluations were compared with several criteria of their medical school performance. Statistical analysis for all comparisons was linear regression. Results: United States Medical Licensing Examination scores positively correlated with in-training examination scores. United States Medical Licensing Examination scores, honor grades in student clinical rotations, and student interview scores did not correlate with the faculty evaluation of resident performance. Conclusion: Standardized tests of medical student cognitive function predict the resident's performance on standardized tests. Selection criteria that are based on other medical school achievements do not necessarily correlate with overall performance as residents in obstetrics and gynecology.

While smart grid disturbances are inevitable, their effects can be minimized through intelligent power management and control. SmartParks (large numbers of electric vehicles capable of performing bidirectional power transactions) or energy storage systems can be used to improve the transient stability of a smart grid with wind farms when faults are experienced. In this paper, the speed oscillations in conventional generators are minimized by optimizing a fuzzy logic controller performing coordinated control between SmartParks and a wind farm. A novel heuristic search based algorithm, mean variance optimization, is applied for the optimization tasks. The results demonstrate the improvement in the overall transient stability of the system operating under disturbances at different locations in the system.

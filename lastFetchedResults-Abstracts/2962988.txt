This work develops a novel adaptive fuzzy line enhancer that, based on a fuzzy basis function expansion, successfully solves the non-linear problem of narrowband interference estimation and rejection in direct sequence-spread spectrum (DS-SS) in non-stationary environments. A fuzzy basis function representation provides a natural framework for combining both numerical and linguistic information in a uniform fashion and towards a least-mean-square objective. The result is a low complexity non-linear adaptive line enhancer (ALE), which presents a fast acquisition time and a better SNR improvement than other well-known non-linear ALEs

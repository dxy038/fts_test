The main objective of this paper is to present a software application developed for the practical training in programming, handling, and tuning industrial PID regulators. Because of the wide spread use of the PID control it is highly desirable that the professional qualification in PID control should be focused on achieving a practical training closely related to industrial practice. Some comments relating to industrial practice are offered in this context.

In this paper, finite element simulations of spherical indentation of a thin hard film deposited on a soft substrate are
carried out. The primary objective of this work is to understand the operative mode of deformation of the film corresponding
to various stages of indentation. The transition from contact dominant behaviour to that governed by flexure
of the film on the plastically yielding substrate is investigated from analysis of the load versus displacement curve as well
as the stress distribution in the film. It is found that onset of bending deformation in the film occurs when the contact
radius is about 0.2â€“0.3 of the film thickness. Further, distinct membrane stresses arise in the film for indentation depth
greater than half the film thickness. The implications of these results on indentation fracture of the film are briefly discussed.
Finally, the effects of substrate yield strength and presence of residual stresses on the indentation response are
examined.

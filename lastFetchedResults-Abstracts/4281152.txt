Currently, the integrated circuit facility is run by a paperless Process Flow Control computer system. This PFC system provides the operator with all the required information about any lots and allows the operator to make keyboard entries to provide feedback of data to the manager. The objective of the real-time factory monitoring system is to use the data collected by the PFC system to determine the following information: (1) machines that are currently down, (2) machines that are at 100% capacity, (3) machines that have been idle for more than 30 minutes, (4) machines that are currently working on nonproduction runs, (5) machines that have caused lots to fail

The objective of this study was to investigate how color stability of beef is affected by vacuum skin packaging (VSP) compared with vacuum packaging (VP) and high-oxygen modified atmosphere packaging (MAP; 80% O2 and 20% CO2). Longissimus lumborum muscles were aged in vacuum for 7 days and then cut into 2-cm-thick slices and repacked using VSP, VP and MAP for another 7 days. Color stability was measured during the next 5 days in air and samples for α-tocopherol and NADH analyses were obtained at the beginning and end of aerobic storage. Color stability, α-tocopherol and NADH of steaks were affected by packaging methods and storage time in air (P &lt; 0.05). Higher a* value was obtained in VSP on day 5 compared with VP. Steaks packed in VSP had better color stability than in VP and their color was similar to MAP at the end (day 5) of storage.

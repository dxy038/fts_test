Ceiling fans are frequently used in tropical areas of the world for low cost indoor comfort. An incremental work in improving energy efficiency of ceiling fans can directly reflect in substantial energy conservation across Pakistan. In this paper, computational modeling and simulation of the ceiling fan rotating inside the room is performed. The computational model is validated by the experimental data collected at Fan Development Institute Gujrat, a subsidiary of Pakistan Electric Fans Manufacturing Association. A parametric study of ceiling fans is carried out with the objective to improve flow field variables and fan efficiency. The performance indicators such as velocity profile, mass flow rate, torque, rated air delivery and service value are calculated. Different cases of rake angles are considered and compared to the baseline geometry. The study concluded that six degree rake angle show enhanced performance.

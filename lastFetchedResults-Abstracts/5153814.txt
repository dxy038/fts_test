Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have recently gained popularity in distributed monitoring and surveillance applications. The objective of these devices is to extract pertinent information under several constrains such as low computational capabilities, limited arithmetic precision, and the need to conserve power. One of the most revealing environmental cues is audio. In this paper, we propose a voice activity detector and a simple gender classifier for use in a distributed acoustic sensing system. This algorithm makes use of low-complexity audio features and a pre-trained regression tree to classify incoming speech by gender. The algorithm is implemented real-time on the Crossbow sensor motes and a series of results are given that characterize the algorithm performance and complexity. Challenges in this real-time implementation include designing the algorithm and software architecture such that the signal processing is appropriately distributed between the sensor mote and the base station. At the base station, a data fusion algorithm considers a linear combination of individual mote decisions to form a final decision

We proposed a method to amplify the signal in a double well system by dynamically adjusting the weight of the connections between the objective and its neighbors. This method is to increase the weights of the connections linking the objective unit with its neighbors in the different well while to decrease the weights of the connections linking the objective unit with its neighbors in the same well. This method is proved to be quite effective and efficient as only local information of a system is needed, and it can be utilized to arbitrary node as long as it has neighbors in both wells. Our theoretical analysis provides an explanation of the mechanism of this method. Moreover, we found that when extending this method by applying the dynamic adjusting strategy to all of the nodes, this method is also effective in enhancing the signal.

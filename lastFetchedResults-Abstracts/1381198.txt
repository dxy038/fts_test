Tensegrities are lightweight space reticulated structures composed of cables and struts. Stability is provided by the self-stress state between tensioned and compressed elements. Tensegrity systems have in general low structural damping, leading to challenges with respect to dynamic loading. This paper describes dynamic behavior and vibration control of a full-scale active tensegrity structure. Laboratory testing and numerical simulations confirmed that control of the self-stress influences the dynamic behavior. A multi-objective vibration control strategy is proposed. Vibration control is carried out by modifying the self-stress level of the structure through small movement of active struts in order to shift the natural frequencies away from excitation. The PGSL stochastic search algorithm successfully identifies good control commands enabling reduction of structural response to acceptable levels at minimum control cost.

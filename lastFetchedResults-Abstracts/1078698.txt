Pretreatment process is a significant factor in the success of desalination process. It plays a key role in enhancing the lifetime of RO membranes in desalination process. Microfiltration process is emerging as an alternative solution for desalination pretreatment process. The baffled microfiltration membrane has its attractive features in fouling control and flux improvement for the feed water for desalination. Turbulence promoters such as helical baffles have distinct possibilities to enhance permeate flux during crossflow microfiltration. Helical inserts reduce hold-up in the feed channel; increase fluid velocity and wall shear rates and produce secondary flows or instabilities. The overall objective of this work was to investigate the influence of helical baffles on permeate flux during the microfiltration process. TiO2 dispersion was used to represent the microfiltration particle. Tubular, single channel ceramic membranes with nominal pore size of 0.2 Î¼m were used. Variations of the helical baffle geometries, which are the number of turns per baffle length, were investigated. It was found that the insertion of helical baffles had increased the permeate flux. In some cases, the increase was more than 100%. The effect of a number of turns per baffle length showed that the permeate flux increased with the number of turns but decreased when the number of turns was more than 4 turns per 50 mm baffle length. Thus, the optimum number of turns was 4 turns per 50 mm.

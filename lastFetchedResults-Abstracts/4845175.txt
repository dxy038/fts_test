Studies on computer-based perception by vision modeling are described and applied to architectural design computation supported by multi-objective optimization. The visual perception is modeled from the computational viewpoint, where the model gives a probabilistic assessment for perceiving of an object. The computational visual perception is an important step in architectural design. Further, mention may be made to general design and monitoring applications. By means of computer experiments in a virtual environment the verification of the theoretical considerations are presented, and the far reaching implications of the studies are pointed out.

A novel method for monitoring air or dilute air-fuel mixture flow is initially developed and tested. Although many flow sensors are commercially available, none appear to have the combination of harsh environment durability (&gt;600degC), fast response, bidirectional flow sensitivity, and low pressure drop desired for the application in hybrid power generation systems. The flow sensor described here uses the ions produced in a hydrocarbon flame to seed the gas flow, and then detects the current resulting from the flow induced drift of charged species in two directions from the flame source. Initial results show that the sensor is sensitive to flow reversal, but suffers from difficulties with flame blowout at high gas velocities

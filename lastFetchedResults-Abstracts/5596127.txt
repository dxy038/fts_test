This paper puts forward a method to extract information from input image and further analyse using that information. However it is relatively difficult to extract the information as the segmentation technique required, is variable between images; a limit of segmentation performance. The main objective of our paper is to propose an algorithm on how to extract that relative information out of given images efficiently and then finally use that information to identify the nature of the images. We thus propose a method of edge-based segmentation in which the image is first reconstructed, it is then converted to the L*a*b* colour space, then the Intensity transformation and the Sobel edge detection is performed and finally the information is extracted using the eight-component connected method. Using this extracted information basically the pixel content and then matching it with the information from our trained files in the database we now can identify the nature of the images.

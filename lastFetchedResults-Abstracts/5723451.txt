A new fault location method for untransposed transmission lines with multiple derivations is presented in this article. It is based on pre-fault and post-fault voltage and current phasors, measured on steady-state at local and remote terminals, to determine the fault information, such as: the section of occurrence, the distance, i.e. the point of occurrence, and the resistance. The main feature of this new method is the grid scanning process, where the fault is searched throughout the line sections, where the error for the fault lying in each one is calculated by means of an objective function minimization where the error between measured and calculated voltages and currents at the local and remote terminals is minimized. At the end of the scanning process, the fault location method results the section of occurrence, the distance, and the resistance of the fault.

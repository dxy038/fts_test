HyperCASE, an architectural framework for integrating CASE tools under an extended hypertext system, is described. HyperCASE´s objective is to provide a powerful, user-friendly, integrated development platform that can significantly raise productivity. Its specific goal is to support software developers in project management, system analysis, design, and coding. HyperCASE integrates tools by combining a hypertext-based user interface with a common knowledge-based document repository. It includes extensive natural-language capabilities tailored to the CASE domain. These are used in the interface to the software repository, providing an alternative to hypertext information management and interdocument navigation. English input can be analyzed during informal system-requirements specification, allowing a significant degree of automation for design and concept reuse at the earliest development stages. HyperCASE´s three subsystems, HyperEdit, the graphical user interface, HyperBase, the knowledge base, and HyperDict, the data dictionary, are discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

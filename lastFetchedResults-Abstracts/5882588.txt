To meet the increasing demand of the energy crisis, attempts have been made to harness energy from renewable sources or by improving the operating efficiency of devices used in generation, transmission and utilization of electric energy. Induction motors are used in very large number in a variety of applications. Any significant improvement in the operating efficiency of induction motor will, therefore, help our effort at energy conservation. The optimized design of induction motor using RosenbrockÂ´s method is carried out with the objective of minimizing (i) the cost of active materials, (ii) the cost of annual energy consumed, and (iii) the total annual cost

Three REMUS UUVs were taken to the Kingdom of Bahrain for testing 15 to 24 October 2002. The objective of the test was to measure the Probability of Detection/Classification, Contact Localization Accuracy, and to observe internal vehicle temperatures while operating in warm water. Detection, classification, and localization evaluations were independently performed by human interpretation and by computer aided interpretation. Prior to the test, seventeen mineshapes were installed in three separate minefields to evaluate performance in different locations of a 1000-m by 1000-m operating area. The mineshapes and long baseline navigation transponders were accurately installed using submeter accuracy DGPS. The first week concentrated on installing the minefield and the second week involved three days of testing followed by two days of mineshape removal.

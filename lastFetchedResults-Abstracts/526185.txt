Background: Different clinical steps, weak and ineffective bond are some of the problems of using fissure sealant in primary teeth.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a total-etching adhesive (single bond) and a self-etching adhesive (G bond) on the shear bond strength (SBS) of a light curing pit& fissure sealant with primary enamel.
Methods: In this experimental study, the crowns of 10 caries-free primary molars were sectioned in a bucco-lingual direction. These 20 specimens were randomly assigned into two groups (single bond & G bond). A light curing pit & fissure sealant (Concise) was bonded to the enamel following application of each bonding system. After 24 hours, the shear bond strength was measured. The data were statistically analyzed using t-test. The failure mode was determined in a stereo microscope at×20.
Findings: The shear bond strength of single bond (16.71±0.72) was higher than the G bond (9.62±1.4). There was a significant difference between the shear bond strength in two groups (p < 0.05). Most failures were cohesive (80% in single bond & 90% in G bond).
Conclusion: According to our data, the self-etching adhesives (G bond) are not reliable alternatives to the total-etching adhesives, if strong bond strength is needed.

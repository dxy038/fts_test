OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare myometrial and omental resistance arteries from term pregnant women with respect to myogenic behavior in the presence or absence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and to compare distensibility and acetylcholine-mediated dilatation in these vessels.
STUDY DESIGN: Intramyometrial (n = 17) and omental (n = 14) resistance arteries from term normal pregnant women were studied in a pressurized arteriograph system. Myogenic tone was evaluated during increments in intraluminal pressure from 20 to 120 mm Hg with and without inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was assessed by evaluating the response to acetylcholine (10–6 mol/L) in arteries pressurized at 70 mm Hg.
RESULTS: Myogenic tone was greater at all pressure steps in the myometrial than in the omental arteries (p< 0.05). Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with Nω-nitro-l-arginine had no influence on myogenic tone in either group. Relaxation to acetylcholine was greater in myometrial (18% ± 4%) compared with omental vessels (7% ± 2%, p< 0.05). The passive distensibility (Ca++-free solution and in the presence of papaverine) of arteries from the myometrium and the omentum was similar.
CONCLUSION: Normal pregnancy is associated with different mechanical properties of resistance vessels from the two vascular beds studied. Basal nitric oxide release does not modify myogenic tone, at least under no-flow conditions. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation is greater in myometrial than in omental arteries.

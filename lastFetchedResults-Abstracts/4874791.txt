This paper presents a motion-compensated deinterlacing algorithm featuring spectrum-adaptive interpolation of interlaced field. Using motion-compensated reference pictures, the proposed spectrum-adaptive filter tactically identifies the baseband via spectrum analysis and removes the replicas of interlaced sampling, making overall algorithm adapt to versatile video scene and different degree of motion compensation scenarios. The experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm has better objective performance than other motion-compensated and non-motion-compensated algorithms do especially in complex moving textures. The subjective results also support the benefits of our spectrum-adaptive filter.

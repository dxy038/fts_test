The authors propose a novel BIST (built-in self-test) scheme for ROMs that has an extremely low possibility of error escape. The scheme is referred to as exhaustive enhanced output data modification (EEODM). For the test generation. EEODM uses the exhaustive test technique. This guarantees the complete coverage of all combinational faults in the ROM. For output data compaction, EEODM uses an enhanced form of output data modification (ODM), along with bidirectional polynomial division. The hardware and test-time overhead was compared with that associated with other known BIST schemes. EEODM turns out to be very attractive, since it achieves much higher fault coverage than any of the other known schemes, and yet the associated overhead is very reasonable

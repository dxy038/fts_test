Objective: To elucidate influences of the dentate nucleus on the generation of the related cortical potentials (MRCPs) preceding voluntary movement, Bereitschaftspotential (BP) and negative slope (NS).
Design and methods: MRCPs preceding self-paced voluntary finger movement were recorded in 5 cases with localized cerebellar lesions due to stroke or tumor. Comparing 3 of them involving the dentate nucleus and 2 others sparing it, as judged from CT or MRI findings.
Results: BP and NS preceding voluntary finger movement ipsilateral to the lesion were absent or markedly reduced in amplitude in those 3 cases with the dentate nucleus lesion, whereas those negative components were present in the 2 cases with no evidence of dentate lesion.
Conclusion: The dentate nucleus has a facilitatory effect on the generation of BP and NS.

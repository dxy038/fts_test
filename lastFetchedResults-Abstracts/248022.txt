A three-dimensional elastoplastic beam element being capable of incorporating large displacement and large
rotation is developed and examined. Elastoplastic constitutive equations are applied to the beam element
based upon the assumption of small deformational strain leading to a material formulation which is
completely objective for the application of stress update procedures. The continuum-type equations of
plastic model of J, mixed hardening are transformed into the beam equations by satisfying beam hypotheses.
An effective stress update algorithm is proposed to integrate elastoplastic rate equations by means of the
so-called multistep method which is a method of successive control of residuals on yield surfaces. It avoids
severe divergence when the displacement increments become large which is usual for the continuation
methods. Material tangent stiffness matrix is derived by using consistent elastoplastic modulus resulting
from the integration algorithm and is combined with geometric tangent stiffness matrix. Different from other
elements, the present element is shear flexible and can satisfy the plasticity condition in a pointwise fashion.
A great number of numerical examples are analysed and compared with the literature. The proposed beam
element is verified to be not only quite accurate but also very effective for the analyses of pre-buckling and
large deflection collapse of spatial framed structures.

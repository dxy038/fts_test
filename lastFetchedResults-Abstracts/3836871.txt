Questions about the dynamics of respiration following prolonged exposure to hypogravity led to a set of flowmeter requirements that included: ~240 Hz sampling rate, &#194;&#177;0.02 1/s accuracy, 500: 1 bidirectional range (&#194;&#177;0.02 to &#194;&#177;10 1/s), sample volume &#194;&#191;50 cm3, and small pressure drop. In the present laboratory feasibility study, the investigators modified an industrial ultrasonic flowmeter such that 100 kHz pulses, alternately transmitted upstream and downstream at a 300 Hz rate, interrogated inhaled or exhaled air flowing through a 2 &#195;&#151;2 cm square duct or a 1.27 &#195;&#151;2.54 cm rectangular duct. This communication emphasizes the electronic and programming aspects of the ultrasonic flowmeter developed for this study, and includes waveform illustrations and upstream-downstream time difference data obtained in laboratory tests.

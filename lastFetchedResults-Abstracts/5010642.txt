In this paper, a novel error concealment (EC) method for compressed stereoscopic image pairs is presented, which contains a new binocular EC mode and an improved monocular EC mode. The proposed algorithm selects appropriate EC mode to conceal the error block (EB) in the stereoscopic image according to the local characteristic of the EB. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has good subjective and objective EC performance in stereoscopic images as compared to monocular mode.

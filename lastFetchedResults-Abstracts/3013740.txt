There is a lot of multimedia data types, related compression algorithms and related code standards that have different characteristics and adapt to different application circumstances. Getting the characteristics of multimedia dynamically is helpful for clearly understanding and properly using the media data. The objective of this research is to develop a network multimedia evaluation platform based on the client/server mode, by means of analyzing and comparing the feathers of main media (the series of MPEG, ITU-H, ITU-G, JPEG, etc) compression algorithm. The platform, MATEP, can test and display the main parameters of related multimedia data. These parameters can be used in QoS control.

The objective of this study was to prepare cross-linked β-cyclodextrin polymers for immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase. The structures of synthesized macrocyclic compounds were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. Properties of the immobilized systems were assessed and their performance on hydrolytic reaction were evaluated and compared with the free enzyme. The influence of activation agents (glutaraldehyde (GA) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI)) and thermal and pH stabilities of the biocatalyst was evaluated. After the optimization of immobilization process, the physical and chemical characterization of immobilized lipase was performed. Obtained data showed that the immobilized enzyme seemed better and offered some advantages in comparison with free enzyme. It can be observed that the free lipase loses its initial activity within around 80 min at 60 °C, while the immobilized lipases retain their initial activities of about 56% by HMDI and 82% by GA after 120 min of heat treatment at 60 °C.

s showed that the specific activity of the immobilized lipase with glutaraldehyde was 62.75 U/mg protein, which is 28.13 times higher than that of the immobilized lipase with HMDI.

The objective of this study was to compare slaughtering performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality in lambs of two different genotypes. Sixteen crossbred Mouflon × Sarda (M × S) and sixteen pure Sarda breed (S × S) suckling lambs were analysed. Chemical and fatty acid composition were determined on semitendinosus and longissimus dorsi muscles and perirenal and pelvic fats. Dressing percentage was higher (P &lt; 0.01) in M × S group and after histological dissection M × S carcasses had more muscle tissue (P &lt; 0.01) and less separable fat (P &lt; 0.05). Muscles of M × S had less cholesterol than the S × S lambs (P &lt; 0.01). Polyunsaturated/saturated and n−6/n−3 fatty acids ratios of the intramuscular lipids were optimal in both groups. Indexes of atherogenicity and of thrombogenicity in muscles varied between 0.9 and 1.1. The results indicated several good qualities in both the genotypes, but M × S lambs have some traits which could provide a higher market price.

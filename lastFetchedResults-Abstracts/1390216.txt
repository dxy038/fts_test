The objective of this study was to compare the impact of health disorders and reasons for culling on the functional and biological longevity of warmblood breeding stallions using semi-parametric survival analysis accounting for competing risks. Complete breeding records were collected from 455 warmblood stallions serving between 1975 and 2010 at Marbach State Stud in Germany. The median length of life (18.0 years) was twice as long as the median length of service (9.0 years). However, both figures increased significantly over the time period examined (e.g., functional longevity increased from 5 years in the 1970s to 8 years in the 1980s to 12 years in the 1990s).

ed to disorders of the musculoskeletal system, hazards for termination of functional life were higher for infectious diseases with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.5, and for dissatisfaction with performance (HR, 2.0). Hazards were lower for disorders of the respiratory system (HR, 0.78), followed by accidents (HR, 0.58), disorders of the reproductive system (HR, 0.51), sale for non-breeding purposes (HR, 0.40), disorders of the gastrointestinal system (HR, 0.36), unknown reasons (HR, 0.32) and disorders of the cardiovascular system (HR, 0.25). For biological life, the relative importance of these disorders was similar.

s linked to demand for stallions such as coat colour and several parameters of the stallionsâ€™ genetic merit (negative influence) and own performance (positive influence) in dressage and particularly in show-jumping influenced (P &lt; 0.05) or tended to influence (P &lt; 0.1) functional, but not biological longevity. Furthermore, hazards for both functional and biological life declined with rising stud fees (both HR, 0.99; P &lt; 0.0001). A more direct consideration of both functional and biological longevity in breeding programmes might help to further enhance both figures, and therefore welfare of the horses.

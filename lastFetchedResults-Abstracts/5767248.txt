In this paper, a new MOS oriented multi-level logic simulator is presented in which primitives can be conventional unidirectional gates as well as high level functional blocks and bidirectional MOS transistors. First the simulator and its capabilities are introduced, then the simulation algorithm, the delay model and a new initialization scheme are presented. Finally, the use of the simulator in a hierarchical design methodology is illustrated.

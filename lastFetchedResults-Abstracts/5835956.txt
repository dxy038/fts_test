A reconfiguration system is needed to solve power balance problems and try to satisfy vital loads as much as possible. And it is important to restore the power system as soon as possible to a target network configuration after the fault, especially after combat damage occurs. Current reconfiguration techniques are centralized methods and cannot meet the NavyÂ´s needs for fight-through survivability and high reliability. This paper presents a novel multi-agent based reconfiguration approach to perform system restoration for navy ship. Each zone agent in this system communicates with other agents. With the same global information and the same target, all zone agents use the same algorithm and collaborate with each other to achieve the reconfiguration objective as soon as possible.

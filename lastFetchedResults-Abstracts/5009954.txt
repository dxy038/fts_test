A novel non-thermal dopant activation process is proposed based on coherent excitation of phonons in the frequency range of 10-100 GHz and 1-10 THz. Major objective of the proposed method is to achieve non-thermal annealing of the implanted dopants by directly and coherently inducing lattice vibration (i.e. phonons) to attain large amplitude for effective low-temperature activation of the dopants.

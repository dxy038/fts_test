Plate spacing is an important parameter in passive electromagnetic armor system. Its value directly influences the effect of passive electromagnetic armor on the metal jet. The parameter optimization is important for structural design for the passive electromagnetic armor system. The action time and the complete action time of current on the metal jet, and the armor plate inductance are associated with armor plate spacing. In order to reduce the armor plate inductance, prolong the action time and the complete action time, armor plate spacing is taken as optimization variables for objective function. Through Lingo solution to the objective function, and the verification of Matlab, Lingo solution results are found in line with the trend of the objective function image. Through the analysis of the impact of different weights on the objective function and optimal plate spacing, it should increase weight coefficient of complete action time and action time, decrease weight coefficient of armor plate inductance to make the object function to get a smaller value, weight coefficients with complete action time and action time are greater than 0.3333. When the three weight coefficients are 0.4, 0.35, 0.25, the optimal plate spacing is about 53mm.

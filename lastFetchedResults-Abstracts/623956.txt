Abstract
Background and Objective: Motherâ€™s satisfaction of childbirth is considered as an important criterion of maternal care quality and it has an effect on mental health of family and community, and Mother's mood is significant in the outcome of labor.   The parturient supported by significant others has less anxiety, experience of safe childbirth and   adequate satisfaction. Thus, we  aimed at assessing the effect of the presence of an attendant on satisfaction, anxiety and labor pain of primiparae referring to Hajar Hospital in Shahre Kurd, 2010.
Material and Methods:  This pre-experimental study was conducted on 60 primiparous women, referring to Hajar Hospital in Shahre Kurd (2010), who were divided into equal experimental and control groups.  The parturients of   both groups received common cares, while those of experimental group were allowed to be with an attendant.  Using a check list, we assessed the level of anxiety, labor pain, newborn's first- minute apgar, the onset of breastfeeding and  childbirth satisfaction from beginning to end of labor, and analyzed the data by  SPSS- 16 software, using t-tests and Chi-square. 
Results:  Our findings show that  the support given by an attendant during childbirth  significantly decrease the level of  anxiety, early start of breastfeeding and increased  mother's satisfaction of childbirth(p < 0/05). There is  no significant difference between two groups on length of active phase,   duration of second phase of childbirth and apgar of the first minute.  
Conclusion:   According to results, we conclude that being an attendant near parturient can bring about childbirth satisfaction, decreased anxiety, and early start of breastfeeding.

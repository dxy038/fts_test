Sterol 14&#945;-demethylase (CYP51) is one of the key enzymes of sterol biosynthesis and has been shown to be an effective target of antifungal drugs. To design novel antifungal compounds against UmCYP51, in this study, homology modeling and expression of CYP51 from U. maydis (UmCYP51) were carried out. A-three-dimensional structure model of UmCYP51 was built through homology modeling based on the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Only pET32-Um-35 could be highly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)successfully after many attempts, which indicated N terminal transmembrane regions and the lowest energy of mRNA structure are importment for the protein expression of UmCYP51, combining of bioinformatics analysis of transmembrane prediction and mRNA secondary structure of translation initiation region. These results will provide some information for predicting the expression of protein from the angle of bioinformatics, and will set the stage for insighting the feature of the UmCYP51.

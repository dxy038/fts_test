Background: Cymbopgon olivieri (Boiss.) Bor. with the common Persian names of kahmakki and Putar, an aromatic perennial grass of Iran, is distributed in tropical regions of south provinces of Iran.
Objective: The aim of this study was evaluation of quantitative and qualitative differences in the essential oil composition of wild and cultivated samples of Cymbopgon olivieri. Method: Aerial parts and rhizomes of plant were collected in June 2003 from Siahoo (Hormozgan province). Rhizomes were cultivated in the field of Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University. Air-dried aerial parts of wild and cultivated samples were subjected to hydrodistillation. The obtained oils were analyzed by GC and GC-MS.
Results: In total 40 and 33 compounds were identified, representing 95% and 96.3% of the oils of natural and cultivated samples, respectively. The quantitative and qualitative oil components were compared. The main constituent of both samples was piperitone (48.9% and 56.7%) followed by a-terpinene (13.8% and 14.2%), limonene (6.3 % and 7.5 %) and elemol (3.7% and 4%).

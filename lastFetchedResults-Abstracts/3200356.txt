Dynamic reconfiguration of mobile networks is gaining importance in context of new generation networks and has been independently analyzed from the perspectives of throughput optimization, energy conservation and load balancing. We propose a method that performs dynamic reconfiguration of transmission powers of eNodeBs based on information from terminal measurements for optimization of throughput and better management of energy which are dependent on the load conditions in the network. The possibility of powering off of eNodeBs in low/moderate load conditions is investigated and simulation results are presented. Simulation results show improvement in signal quality and throughput while reducing the energy consumption by around 20% in low load conditions. Comparison of the results of minimizing two different cost functions with the same bi-objective but different priorities demonstrates the importance of considering coverage (over network space) and throughput together during reconfiguration.

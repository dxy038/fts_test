Nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) can provide flexible multiresolution, anisotropy, and directional expansion for images. Compared with the original contourlet transform, it is shift-invariant and can overcome the pseudo-gibbs phenomena around singularities. Fuzzy logic is an efficient intelligent method to handle uncertain information. In this paper, a novel image fusion algorithm is proposed based on the NSCT and fuzzy logic. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can improve subjective and objective results compared to some other fusion approaches.

Most cars today are run on the 14Volts Direct Current (DC) system i.e. 12Volts batteries with provision for 14Volts battery chargers. However, with new electrical gadgets installed in the automobiles, more and more power would be needed. Thus, the 42Volts system was proposed to replace the current 14Volts system. The main objective of this paper is to design and implement a reliable, cost-effective 42Volts battery charger, charging off board 36Volts batteries for the anticipated new generation motor vehicles. In this research, Alternating Current (AC) to DC converter with Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit, having a power Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) for switching operation and a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) based feedback circuit for driving the switching of the MOSFET, is designed and simulated before implementation. The 42Volts off board battery charger was subsequently built and tested with three batteries connected in series. The converter functioned as designed. The final product was able to regulate to 41.643Volts DC.

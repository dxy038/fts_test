This paper presents an integrated supplier selection and inventory management using grey relationship model (GRM) as well as multi-objective decision making process. The proposed model of this paper first ranks different suppliers based on GRM technique and then determines the optimum level of inventory by considering different objectives. To show the implementation of the proposed model, we use some benchmark data presented by Talluri and Baker [Talluri, S., & Baker, R. C. (2002). A multi-phase mathematical programming approach for effective supply chain design. European Journal of Operational Research, 141(3), 544-558.]. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed model of this paper is capable of handling different criteria for supplier selection.

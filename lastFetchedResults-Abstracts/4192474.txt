Following the deregulation of electric power utilities around the globe, it has been widely acknowledged that quantifying power system transfer capability is of increasingly importance in todayÂ´s large-scale and interconnected power system operation and planning procedures. This paper introduces a novel framework to evaluate transfer capability incorporating electricity market dispatching considerations, which we termed it as economic constrained transfer capability (ETC) problem. A mathematical model of a multi-objective optimization (MOOP) approach is presented to solve this ETC problem. The proposed methodology has been tested on a classical 3-machine 9-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus system. Preliminary simulation results from several case studies are presented with relevant analyses and discussions.

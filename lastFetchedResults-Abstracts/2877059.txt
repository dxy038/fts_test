In this paper we present a novel tool, using both OpenMP and MPI protocols, for optimising the efficiency of Urban Transportation Systems within a defined catchment, town or city. We build on a previously presented model which uses a Genetic Algorithm with novel genetic operators to optimise route sets and provide a transport network for a given problem set. This model is then implemented within a Parallel Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm and demonstrated to be scalable to within the scope of real world, [city-wide], problems. This paper compares and contrasts three methods of parallel distribution of the Genetic Algorithm´s computational workload: a job farming algorithm and two variations on an `Islands´ approach. Results are presented in the paper from both single and mixed mode strategies. The results presented are from a range of previously published academic problem sets. Additionally a real world inspired problem set is evaluated and a visualisation of the optimised output is given.

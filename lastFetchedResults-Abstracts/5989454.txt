Our purpose is to model the imaging process in 2D PET imagery. More directly, considering a unit point source located at point M<sub>n</sub> and emitting pairs of opposite twin photons in an isotropic way and a pair of non adjacent detectors (i, j) located on the detector ring, our objective is to determine the proportion of the flux emitted at point M<sub>n</sub> which jointly hits the detector pair (i, j).

In this paper, a new method for shape design optimization, using sensitivity analysis on the finite element (FE) model of an interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motor, based on torque waveform, is proposed. Torque pulsations are our objective function for minimization. The optimized motor has lower torque ripple and more average torque in comparison with the previous motor.

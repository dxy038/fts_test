We propose a robust de-interlacing algorithm which combines edge dependent interpolation (EDI) and global motion compensation (GMC). Generally, the EDI algorithm shows a visually better performance than any other de-interlacing algorithm using one field. However, due to the restricted information in one field, a high quality progressive image from interlaced sources cannot be acquired by intrafield methods. Hence, the proposed algorithm makes use of a process of mixing EDI and GMC. In order to obtain the best result, an adaptive thresholding algorithm for detecting the failure of GMC is proposed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional approaches with respect to both objective and subjective criteria.

In this paper, we propose a novel active queue management (AQM) algorithm based on data-driven predictive control for Internet system with large delay, complex change and bad disturbance, called Data-AQM. The data-driven predictive control algorithm elegantly combines data-driven subspace identification and predictive control. For its inherent characteristics, data-driven predictive controller can be obtained directly based on the input-output data alone and does not require any explicit model of the system. According to the input-output data, the future queue length in data buffer, which is the basis of optimizing drop probability, is predicted. Furthermore, considering system constraints, the control requirement is converted to the optimal control objective, then the drop probability is obtained by solving the optimal problem online. Finally, the performances of Data-AQM are evaluated through a series of simulations. The simulation results show that Data-AQM algorithm is superior to random early detection (RED) algorithm in terms of stability and robustness.

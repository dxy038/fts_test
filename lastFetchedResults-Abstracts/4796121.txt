We focus on the use of the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique in the signature verification area. The DTW algorithm originates from the field of speech recognition, where it is a highly appreciated component of speaker specific isolated word recognisers. A few years ago the DTW algorithm was successfully introduced in the area of online signature verification. The characteristics of speech recognition and signature verification are however rather different. Starting from these dissimilarities, our objective is to extract an alternative DTW approach that is better suited to the signature verification problem

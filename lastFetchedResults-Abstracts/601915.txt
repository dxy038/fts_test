Background and Objective: Daucus carota has antioxidant effect and a high content of beta carotene. It has been reported that Daucus carota has estrogenic and hormonal effects on female reproductive system. Since there was no experimental research about the effect of this plant on uterus contraction, we therefore decided to study the effect of aqueous extract of Daucus carota on uterus contractions.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 32 virgin Wistar rats (200-300 g) were divided into 4 groups. After inducing contraction with KCL, oxytocin and incubation with propranolol and naloxane, the effect of various doses of the extract was assessed. After laparatomy, a piece of uterus (1.5 cm) was excised and mounted in an organ bath (10 ml) containing De Jalon (29 °C). Then, pieces of uterus were contracted with KCL and oxytocin and aqueous extract of Daucus carota at doses of 0.1-0.8 mg/ml was added to organ bath in the presence of KCL and oxytocin. In this study, the uterus was separately incubated with propranolol (1 µM), naloxone (1 µM) and the role of B-adrenoceptors and opioid receptors were also evaluated.

Results: Cumulative concentrations of the extract dose-dependently decreased uterine contractions induced by KCl (p < 0.05) and oxytocin (p < 0.001). Also, incubation of tissues with propranolol and naloxone did not have any role in the effect of this extract.

Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that antispasmodic effect of aqueous extract of Daucus carota probably accomplished via voltage dependent calcium channels blockade and B-adrenoceptors and opioid receptors did not have any role in this effect.

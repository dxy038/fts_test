The objective of this paper is to present an efficient computational methodology to obtain the optimal system structure of electronic devices by using either a single or a multiobjective optimization approach, while considering the constraints on reliability and cost. The component failure rate uncertainty is taken under consideration and it is modeled with two alternative probability distribution functions. The Latin hypercube sampling method is used to simulate the probability distributions. An optimization approach was developed using the simulated annealing algorithm because of its flexibility to be applied in various system types with several constraints and its efficiency in computational time. This optimization approach can handle efficiently either the single or the multiobjective optimization modeling of the system design. The developed methodology was applied to a power electronic device and the results were compared with the results of the complete enumeration of the solution space. The stochastic nature of the best solutions for the single objective optimization modeling of the system design was sampled extensively and the robustness of the developed optimization approach was demonstrated.

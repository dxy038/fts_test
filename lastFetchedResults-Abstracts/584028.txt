The politics is from natural elements of managers' strategic decisions. Strategic decision making is defined to be involved in financial benefits. This persuades managers to support each other and leads them to control information and construct consortium. The politics leads to a weak strategic decision making process. This political behavior is stronger where managers face to financial issues. The involvement of manufacturing organizations in political behavior of financial managers could affect financial reports prepared by them.
Hence, the objective of this research is to prepare a discriminator and prediction model to differentiate political from nonpolitical managers. From 450 companies 190 did not have research conditions and finally we selected 70 from 260 companies as research sample, in error level of 0.1 by systematic sampling. By SPSS statistical software version 15 data was analyzed and we presented the discrimination model based on two groups of financial and managerial variables. The results indicate the age of manager is the strongest discrimination variable, after that ROS and again two managerial variables namely experience and genders are the strongest. Therefore, financial performance variables are weaker than managerial variables. The total success of the model to prediction of depend variable (to be political or not) is 91.4 in this research that indicates the model is successful to prediction.

Microgrids (MGs) are known as local distribution systems including Distributed Generators (DGs) and energy storage systems. Most of the generation units are connected to the MG through inverters controlled by droop controller. These inverters called voltage source inverters (VSIs). The VSIs should share active and reactive power between the DGs fairly. A precise reactive power sharing may increase voltage drop. In this paper, a trade-off is obtained between reactive power sharing and voltage behavior. An objective function is defined including the aforementioned parameters. The objective function is optimized based on the variation of droop coefficient. The obtained parameter leads to the best performance of VSI controllers considering the voltage behavior and the reactive power sharing.

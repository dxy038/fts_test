This paper builds an optimal sizing combination model on the economic view when a microgrid is connected to the power grid. Considering both the benefits of power grid companies and users, three parts including the inner cost, the environment cost and the compensation cost are served as the objective function. In order to guarantee the reliability of the users when sudden incidents occur to the microgrid, the index &#951;<sub>LPSP</sub> (Loss of Power Supply Probability) is especially stipulated as one of constrains, which is calculated in the islanded mode of the microgrid. The major parts of the investment are variable ones, which are closely related to the generation scheduling. So the models of the micro-sources are built and the total generated energy of each year is calculated under the economic power strategy. Finally a numerical example is researched with the heuristic algorithm. So the optimum solution for sizing combination of the micro-sources is got.

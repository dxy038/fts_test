Animal bites are major public health issues, not only for the risk of acquiring secondary
infections but also for the possibility of contracting rabies. The objective of this study was to
determine the epidemiology of animal bites in Tehran, Iran. During a three- year period, through a
questionnaire- based study, 8806 bitten persons were enrolled into our study. Of these, 79.16%
were males and 20.84% were females. Bites were most frequent among the age group of 20-29
years. Most cases were self employed. Upper extremities were the most frequent bite site (53.8%).
The offending animals, in order of frequency were dogs, cats, squirrels, monkeys, hamsters, and
other animals, responsible in 5804 (65.9%), 2241 (25.44%), 343 (3.89%), 134 (1.52%), 125 (1.41%),
and 159 (1.84%) cases, respectively. We found that animal bites are still prevalent in Iran and thus
preventive measures and health education are required for the public.

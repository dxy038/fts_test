Most of   influential and industrial countries owe their prosperity and welfare on transit industry. The time duration of clearance containers is the global criterion of measuring terminal efficiency. In addition, this criterion is considered to assess organizational structures and managerial performances so, managers have been constantly searching for remedies to decline clearance time. In this paper, a multi-objective fuzzy non-linear mathematical model under uncertainty condition of input parameters is presented, which attempts to reduce clearance time through proper allocation space to containers. After solving the model, based on the proposed three-step procedure, a numerical example is examined using exact and Lagrange relaxation methods. Our finding demonstrates that if Decision-makers want to meet uncertainty with lowered risk, they have to choose a high minimum constraint feasibility degree even though the objective function will be worse.

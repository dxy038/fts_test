The objective of this study is to evaluate influence of adhesive types on some physical and mechanical properties of laminated window profiles manufactured from Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and Kosipo (Entandrophragma candollei Harms.). Commercially produced polyurethane based Macroplast UR 7221 and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive were used for experiments. Shrinkage, modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, compression strength, and shear strength of the laminated samples were determined based on ISO and ASTM standards, respectively. Overall test results were found to be comparable to those determined in previous studies. Samples made from Kosipo had higher strength values than that of Maritime pine. Both types of adhesive resulted in significant difference in their strength characteristics at 95% confidence level. Adhesive type UR 7221 enhanced overall properties of the samples in contrast to those of made using PVAc.

Background: The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Holy Mecca, brings over two million people together in a small confined area through the world. Respiratory illnesses are the most common afflictions during this ceremony presenting as various clinical syndromes. Several microbiologic, Sero-epidemiologic and Immunologic studies have revealed that most of these syndromes are caused by viral infections. Assessment of Gamma Interferon level and neutrophilic function with Nitrobluetetrazolium Reduction Test can confirm or exclude the role of the infections indirectly. The main objective of this study is the assessment of Neutrophilic phagocytosis and also the measurement of the Gamma INF, (A potent phagocytic activator cytokine) among the pilgrims. Methods: In an Observational & Longitudinal study, blood samples of 130 pilgrims were taken before and 3 weeks after return from the pilgrimage and tested for NBT and Gamma INF levels. For the Nitroblue Tetrazolium Reduction Test (NBT), changes were assayed with Chemiluminescence, and Gamma IFN with ELISA. All volunteers were followed during the trip and the particulars of pilgrims who developed respiratory complaints recorded. For data analysis, we used the SPSS software.
Results: Results showed, that serum Gamma IFN levels were 4.8±6 before starting on the journey and rose to 5.2±5.8 pg/ml. after the pilgrimage, (non-significant); NBT percentage before and after the pilgrimage were 90.4±4.3 and 87.7±4.3 respectively, (p=0.001). Conclusion: Significant changes in NBT, and increased serum Gamma IFN level indicate the occurrence of an infectious process during the pilgrimage.

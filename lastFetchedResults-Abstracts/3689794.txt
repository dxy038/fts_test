In the past a great deal of work has been reported on optimal load flow (OLF). However, in most of the works only one aspect of the power system has been optimised. The OLF problem (optimal real and reactive power dispatch) has been attempted sequentially, rather than simultaneously. A new formulation of the OLF problem has been attempted to minimise both the cost of generation and transmission loss simultaneously through a multiple objective programming technique (priority goal programming technique)

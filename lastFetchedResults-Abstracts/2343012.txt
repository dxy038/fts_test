The present work develops the processing and abrasive tests of composites based on the system epoxy–quartz. The objective was to evaluate its technological application as abrasive crowns for the polishing of ornamental rocks, usually made based on the magnesia cement composite SOREL-SiC. Composites were produced with composition epoxy–(70, 75, 80, 85 and 90) % weight of quartz. The compounds were mixed and cured with a catalyst. The composites were submitted to abrasive wearing tests and compressive tests, simulating the polishing operation of ornamental rocks. Surface finishing produced in an ornamental rock and the weight loss of the crowns were evaluated and compared to those obtained for commercial magnesia cement SOREL-SiC. The work concludes for the positive technical viability of this new composite epoxy-silica for use in the ornamental rock industry.

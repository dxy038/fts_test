This paper presents bio-inspired new krill herd (KH) algorithm for solving combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) optimization task. This algorithm is based on the herding behavior of krill individuals and is very efficient in finding the global optima in shortest possible time. The objective function is defined as the distance of each krill individual from food and the highest density of herd. At any instant, position of a krill individual is dependent on 1) motion induced by surrounding krill, 2) foraging motion of it and 3) its diffusion motion. The algorithm has been illustrated simulating on a test system and the result has been compared with those obtained from particle swarm optimization (PSO), evolutionary programming (EP) and differential evolution (DE). The comparison shows that the solution obtained by this KH method is of better quality than other methods.

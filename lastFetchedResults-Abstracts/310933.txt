Objective. Comparison of the clinical mobility test of the first tarsometatarsal joint with Doppler Imaging of Vibrations measurement of the stiffness of this joint in hallux valgus patients.

Design. Clinical testing of first tarsometatarsal joint mobility was related to independent Doppler Imaging of Vibrations measurement of first tarsometatarsal joint stiffness.

Background. Hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint has consequences for the surgical treatment of hallux valgus deformity. However, the clinical test is subjective. Doppler Imaging of Vibrations could be helpful in quantification of the stiffness of this joint.

Methods. Clinical examination of the mobility of 32 first tarsometatarsal joints in 20 hallux valgus patients was compared with Doppler Imaging of Vibrations stiffness measurements performed by an independent observer.

Results. There was a statistically significant relation between the clinical test and the stiffness measurement by Doppler Imaging of Vibrations.

Conclusion. Doppler Imaging of Vibrations proves to be a method to quantify first tarsometatarsal joint stiffness and could contribute to a rational policy for the surgical treatment of hallux valgus deformity.

In this paper, we discuss the coordination of a group of autonomous agents with input saturation and time-varying interconnection. The state agreement of the whole agent group is discussed with bang-bang control protocols and switching interaction topologies described by joint connectivity on the time interval (t;&#194;&#191;) for any time t. The convergence analysis for the considered system is carried out under the distributed neighbor-based control in a discontinuous bang-bang form. Two well-known cases (that is, bidirectional graph and uniform joint-connection graph) are discussed, respectively, with proposing a sufficient condition and a counterexample. Moreover, a case for finite-time state agreement by the proposed non-smooth local rules is also presented.

Background Despite improvements in the nutritional
status of Brazilian children, child malnutrition remains a
public health issue. The objective of the present study was
to analyse the effect of maternal common mental disorders
(MCMD) on child malnutrition in a large Brazilian urban
centre with low rates of child malnutrition. Furthermore,
we explored the hypothesis that a reduction in the quality
of maternal caregiving mediates the relationship between
maternal mental health problems and child nutrition.
Methods A case–control study including 294 children
aged between 0 and 5 years, with 147 cases and 147 ageand
sex-matched controls, was conducted in the city of
Salvador, northeastern Brazil. Mothers completed the Self-
Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), the family’s socio-economic
status was evaluated and the Home Observation
for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory
was applied. Children were diagnosed as moderately or
severely malnourished when the weight-for-height z-score
was below –2 SD. Conditional logistic regression was used
in the analysis, and the final model was created using the
backward technique.
Results MCMD doubled the risk of moderate or severe
malnutrition in children (OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.10–3.78).
Maternal caregiving can be an important factor mediating
the relationship between maternal mental health and child
malnutrition.
Conclusion MCMD must be taken into account in programmes
for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition,
especially in areas of low malnutrition prevalence

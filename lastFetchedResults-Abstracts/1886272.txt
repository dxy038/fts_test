The objective of this study was to determine the effect of implant thickness and glenohumeral conformity on fixation of an all-metal glenoid component. A stainless steel glenoid component was designed and implanted in 10 cadaveric scapulae. A testing apparatus capable of producing a loading vector at various angles, magnitudes, and directions was used. The independent variables included 6 directions and 3 angles of joint load, 3 implant thicknesses, and 4 glenohumeral conformities. Implant micromotion relative to bone was measured by use of 4 displacement transducers at the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior sites. The components displayed a consistent response to loading of ipsilateral compression and contralateral distraction. Stability decreased as the load application angle increased (P &lt; .05). A decrease in the implant thickness and glenohumeral conformity resulted in increased implant stability (P &lt; .05). Decreasing implant thickness and glenohumeral conformity reduce the eccentric component of loading and may improve the durability of glenoid implants.

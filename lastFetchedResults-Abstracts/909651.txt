The biosphere is filled with complex living patterns and important questions about biodiversity and community and ecosystem
ecology are concerned with structure and function of multispecies systems that are responsible for those patterns. Cluster analysis
identifies discrete groups within multivariate data and is an effective method of coping with these complexities, but often suffers
from subjective identification of groups. The bootstrap testing method greatly improves objective significance determination for
cluster analysis. The BOOTCLUS program makes cluster analysis that reliably identifies real patterns within a data set more
accessible and easier to use than previously available programs. A variety of analysis options and rapid re-analysis provide a means
to quickly evaluate several aspects of a data set. Interpretation is influenced by sampling design and a priori designation of samples
into replicate groups, and ultimately relies on the researcherâ€™s knowledge of the organisms and their environment. However, the
BOOTCLUS program provides reliable, objectively determined groupings of multivariate data.

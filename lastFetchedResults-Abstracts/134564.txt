Introduction & Objective: The hippocampai formation is a part of I imbic system that piays an important role in memory and learning. The hippocampus is divided into three subfieids: CA1, CA2 and CA3. In addition to pyramidal neurons and snterneurons, the  astrocytes play important roles in hippocampus, probably in  memory and learning. In fact, learning needs some instruments for  information storage and information maintenance mechanisms like  memory. On the other hand, memory is always accompanied with  learning. This study was conducted to evaluate the changes in  number of astrocytes in CA2 subfieid of hippocampus in rats due to  spatial learning.
Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, with the use of  Morris Water Maze and two other techniques (Reference and  Working memory methods) in the behavioral laboratory of physiology department of Pasteur institute, 15 male Wistar rats were used. Five rats were included in control group and 10 rats in the other two groups (each 5 rat). After performing the educational experiments, animal brain was removed and after histological  processing, the slides were stained with PTAH to show the astrocytes. The obtained data were analyzed by SPSS, using T test and variance analysis.
Results: The results showed a significant difference in astrocytes  number of CA2 area between control and reference memory group. Also the difference between control and working memory  groups was significant. Comparing the two educated groups, a significant difference was found in the number of astrocytes in those groups.
Conclusion: The number of astrocytes in CA2 area of  hippocampus of rats increased due to spatial learning.

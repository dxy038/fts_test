Bidirectional battery chargers (BBC) for plug-in electric vehicles have the capabilities of high power factors and V2G operation. In this paper, the control system of a BBC is designed, implemented in a DSP and experimented. The design is carried out for the BBC input currents to be either in-phase with or out-of-phase from the grid voltages depending on the BBC operating mode: battery charging or energy generation. Simulation of the control system and automatic generation of the DSP code are illustrated. Experimental results obtained with a prototypal BBC set-up demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control system.

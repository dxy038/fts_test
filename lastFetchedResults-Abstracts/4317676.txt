The unfalsified control is one type of model-free adaptive control. The control strategy enables one to design a controller that is consist with a performance objective and measured past input-output online data without plant models or assumptions on the plant. The theory works by eliminating candidate controllers that do not satisfy performance specification by evolving experimental data. The controller which remained to the last is a controller which satisfies a performance specification. Based on unfalsified control theory, the trajectory tracking control of nonholonomic mobile robot is analyzed. By adopted adaptive PID control algorithm of unfalsified control strategy to feedback linearization system, the mobile robot can track the desired trajectory rapidly.

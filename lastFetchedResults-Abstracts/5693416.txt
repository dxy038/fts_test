The location problem of new high-speed railway station has been paid attention to by decision-makers, because this is associated with urban development planning. Based on the concept of accessibility, the interaction between high-speed railway passenger transport system and urban traffic system is analyzed in this paper. Due to the inverse law between accessibility and mobility, accessibility can be chosen as the key factor of high-speed railway station location. According to the characteristics of multi-objective decision-making, a bi-level optimization model is built to determine the position of high-speed railway station and travel choice of passenger. This model can be solved by simulated annealing algorithm, and the calculation process meets the need of Pareto optimization principle. Ultimately the results can reflect tradeoff relationship between multi-objective functions.

Programming of EEPROM devices fabricated in standard processes often requires voltages that exceed the bulk-drain breakdown voltages of integrated circuits, making the full integration of the programming circuitry difficult. This paper presents a modified EEPROM device with two tunneling injectors that allows bidirectional, accurately controlled programming with voltages in the range of normal supply voltages. Additionally, two static voltages are required. This scheme allows full integration of the programming circuitry on chip. Applications in the areas of offset reduction for OPAMPs in clocked and continuous time systems as well as in neural network learning are presented

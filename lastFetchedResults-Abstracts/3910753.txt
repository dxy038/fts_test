We present two algorithms for estimating the velocity of a visual stimulus and their implementations with analog circuits using CMOS VLSI technology. Both are instances of so-called token methods, where velocity is computed by identifying particular features in the image at different locations; in our algorithms, these features are abrupt temporal changes in image irradiance. Our circuits integrate photoreceptors and associated electronics for computing motion onto a single chip and unambiguously extract bidirectional velocity for stimuli of high and intermediate contrasts over considerable irradiance and velocity ranges. At low contrasts, the output signal for a given velocity tends to decrease gracefully with contrast, while direction-selectivity is maintained. The individual motion-sensing cells are compact and highly suitable for use in dense 1-D or 2-D imaging arrays

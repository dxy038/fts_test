Statistical estimates of the ten-minute wind velocity mean values and estimates of the gust wind maxima throughout the Czech Republic are listed in this paper. Some of the gust estimates are significantly higher than equivalent gusts determined by means of the peak velocity pressure model in ENV 1991-2-4 (or in EN 1991-1-4) from the ten-minute mean velocity estimates. The objective was to inquire into the causes behind this difference and to propose the way to be taken to settle the contradiction.

The analysis and design of a single-stage three-phase AC to DC converter using single-phase CUK rectifier modules is discussed based on power balance control technique. The proposed system is formed by an input-side star-connected of three single-phase CUK rectifier modules with parallel connected at DC outputs. The control strategy consists of single voltage loop control and three-inductor current calculator. The main objective of the proposed system is to reduce the number of stages and improve dynamic response of DC bus voltage for distributed power system. The proposed schemes offer simple control strategy, flexibility in either 3-phase delta or star connected and simpler design. The proposed system is discussed and compared to a parallel CUK PFC circuit based on power balance control technique. A power balance control technique for controlling the three-phase AC to DC converter is proposed which guarantees a step load changes of the phase modules and allows to continue the system operation also in case of loss module conditions including one and/or two-module operation. The simulation results indicate that proposed system are offer the fast transient response and power factor closed to unity

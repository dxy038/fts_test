This paper presents a new control method based on fuzzy logic technique to control a unified power flow controller (UPFC) installed in a single-machine infinite-bus power system. The objective of the fuzzy logic based UPFC controller is to damp power system oscillations. Phillips-Herffron model of a single-machine power system equipped with a UPFC is used to model the system. The fuzzy logic based UPFC controller is designed by selecting appropriate controller parameters based on the knowledge of the power system performance. Simple fuzzy logic controller using mamdani-type inference system is used. The effectiveness of the new controller is demonstrated through time-domain simulation studies. The results of these studies show that the designed controller has an excellent capability in damping power system oscillations

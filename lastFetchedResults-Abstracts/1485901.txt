Our objective was to determine the effects of vitamin A restriction during finishing on color display life, lipid oxidation, and sensory traits of longissimus lumborum (LL) and triceps brachii (TB) steaks from early and traditionally weaned steers. Forty-eight steers weaned at either 137 ± 26 days (EW) or 199 ± 26 days (TW) were supplemented with either 15,400 IU/kg dry matter of vitamin A (HA) or restricted to no supplemental vitamin A (LA) during finishing for 210 and 150 days, respectively. Both LL and TB steaks from the HA steers had the darkest (P &lt; 0.05) color scores after 3 days of retail display in PVC packaging at 2 °C, and the highest (P &lt; 0.05) thiobarbaturic acid reactive substances (TBARS) values. Instrumental a∗, b∗, and saturation index values were lowest (P &lt; 0.05) in LL steaks from the HA steers. Instrumental L∗ values were lower (P &lt; 0.05) on days 4–6 in TB steaks from TW steers fed LA than those from EW steers fed HA. No differences were found in Warner–Bratzler shear force values or sensory traits in either muscle. No supplemental vitamin A versus high levels of vitamin A inclusion in finishing diets has potential to increase color display life and reduce lipid oxidation, with no effects on meat palatability.

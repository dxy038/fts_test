     The main issue in design of forest roads, are proper planning, and passed the more positive and less negative. Trace the path with topographic maps and off the field as major infrastructure projects through the forest which is the most important and difficult part. The main objective of this study was prepared the map capabilities through appropriate road forest, mountain and forest stands in Series 7 of 38 sardabroud regard to technical road forest after harvesting, and also the maps needed to identify factors that influence the cross roads in the study area.These factors includes dip in the GIS maps, directions, soil, geology, type size, distance from waterways and the landscape of the region were provided with a raster format. Then, the floor plans prepared by the relative importance of classes in the range of 1 to 9 were rated.Then according to hierarchical analysis (AHP) the weight value of maps was obtained. Map data combined with weight factors in environment, GIS, maps were capable for crossing the road. The results showed that using this method, which can be potential areas for the road through the forest roads in the mountainous north and identify. Also, according to the data, including maps used in this study method can be introduced as a method for predicting the primaries of forest roads and mountain.

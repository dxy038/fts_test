Introduction & Objective: Congenital pseudoartrosis of tibia is one of the most refractive skeletal disorders in treatment, so there is various treatment methods with various results. Ilizarov with segment transfer with complete excision of hamartoma and low injury to other tissues seems to be a good choice.
Material & Methods: We have 2 cases, one 14 years old girl with previous fibular graft surgery which has recurrence of her disease and the other is 7 years old boy without surgery but with multiple periods of casting.
In both cases, at first we excise completely the hamartomas and then insert Ilizarov and begin segment transfer. After transferring proximal segment and filling bone defect, we preserve device until complete union. Then we extract ilizarov give them patellar tendon bearing brace (PTB).
Results: In 14 years girl we had 4 centimeters bony defect and union time was 8 months. After that, she had ankle stiffness but it wasn't disabling. In the other case, 7 years old boy, we had 2 centimeters bone defect and union time was 5 months. After device removal, there were mild knee flexion contracture and ankle stiffness but both had been resolved with physiotherapy.
Conclusions: As mentioned in literature and texts, ilizarov with segment transfer has very good success rates (90 - 100 %) and it has ability to correct leg length discrepancy (LLD) and angular deformities with complete excision of diseased part of tibia without complications of graft harvesting from other parts.

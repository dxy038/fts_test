The strip shape in the stainless steel process has made an issue of the strip quality. The objective of the shape control is to minimize the shape deviation and to maintain symmetrical shape patterns in the lateral direction. The method of the shape recognition employs the least square method. The shape deviation is controlled by the fuzzy shape controller (FSC). The experiments have been performed online for various stainless materials, thicknesses, and strip widths. The test results show very efficient performances in respect of stable target tracking and symmetrical and minimal fluctuation of the strip shape.

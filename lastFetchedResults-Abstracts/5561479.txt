The objective of this paper is to design linear and nonlinear H<sub>infin</sub> controllers, and compare them. For linear systems, the H<sub>infin</sub> controller is obtained either by solving Riccati equations using iterative procedures or by linear matrix inequalities. However, for nonlinear systems, the task is more complicated. In the particular case of nonlinear affine-input systems, the solution of the H<sub>infin</sub> control problem is derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi Equations (HJE). The exact explicit solutions of this type of equations are, in general, unknown or hard to compute. Approximate solutions are obtained from an iterative procedure. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear matrix inequalities approach to design a nonlinear H<sub>infin</sub> controller. Simulations of the closed-loop synchronous motors responses for both nonlinear and linear H<sub>infin</sub> controllers will be performed and compared. It is found that the nonlinear H<sub>infin</sub> controller has better performances and robustness than the linear controller.

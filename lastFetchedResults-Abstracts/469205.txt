Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of multiple primary malignancies in patients with uterine corpus malignancy.
Study design
We conducted a tumor registry search and a medical record review.
Results
Uterine corpus malignancy was reported in 1505 of 25,605 women (6%) in the registries, of which 131 of 1505 women (9%) had multiple primary malignancies. Patients with uterine corpus malignancy with multiple primary malignancies were more likely to have had primary malignancies of the ovary (relative risk, 10; 95% CI, 6.2-17) and colon (relative risk, 2; 95% CI, 1.0-4.3) and less likely to have had primary malignancies of the cervix (relative risk, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.17-0.97) compared with women who had only one primary malignancy. A family history of malignancy was reported in only 44% of the patients with uterine corpus malignancy with multiple primary malignancies and 32% of those patients whose multiple primary malignancies were from the ovary or colon.
Conclusion
The development of multiple primary malignancies in patients with uterine corpus malignancy may indicate an inherited predisposition, especially in those patients whose multiple primary malignancies include the ovary or colon. That predisposition may not be detected by routine family history.

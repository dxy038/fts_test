A lumped kinetic model is proposed for i-butane cracking over an HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (SiO2/Al2O3=484) and the experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor in the broad range of temperature of 470-530 Â°C and at a partial pressure of 20 kPa for i-butane and a total pressure of 104 kPa. Nitrogen was utilized in the experiments for adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbon feed and desired feed contact time. Due to the simple product distribution of i-butane cracking reaction, the proposed lumped kinetic model only consisted of 6 reaction steps and 5 lumped compounds including methane, i-butane, paraffins, olefins, and heavy components. The kinetic parameters of rate equations were obtained through the minimization of error objective function and the results indicated that the proposed model could predict the experimental data quite well. Finally, the statistical analysis of the kinetic model confirmed the validity of the model and the significance of the optimized values of the kinetic constants.

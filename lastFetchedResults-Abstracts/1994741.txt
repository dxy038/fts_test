Social exclusion of different social groups is one of the main study topics. The social exclusion of elderly makes no exception and many research have been done on this matter alone. This research conceptualizes the social exclusion in five different dimensions, categorized as exclusion of financial resources, social services, social relations, neighborhood, and social activities, in both objective and subjective levels. Using survey method, this research has studied 123 elderly aged 60 and above who were randomly chosen from districts of 1,3,8,12,17 and 18 of Tehran. The results show that among the five different dimensions of social exclusion, experience of exclusion from civil engagement and subjective exclusion of social services exclusion have the highest levels of responses. Findings also indicate that the type of exclusion that an old person experiences in life has significant effect on his/her subjective exclusion and marginalization.

Recently, there are increasing interests of integration between robot technologies and Internet services, and various cloud-based service platforms for robots are proposed. From these backgrounds, in this paper, we propose a virtual campus tour service which enables remote users to control robots in school campuses via the Internet. In implementing the service, we use Robot Service Network Protocol (RSNP), which is a common protocol specification for robot services. Therefore, users can operate various remote robots in various campuses via the proposed service. Furthermore, we conduct subjective and objective assessments on camera functions for the service, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed one.

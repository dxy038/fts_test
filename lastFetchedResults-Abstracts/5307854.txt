This paper has as objective to determine the flashover rate by lightning in overhead distribution lines of 24 kV and the analysis of the protections alternatives. The shield wire or the surge arrester located in distributed form can be used for the protection of the overhead distribution lines. The flashover rate calculated for the lines without protection is gotten of two (2) ways: through the analysis of the fault statistic for an 11 year-old period and through the software SISDEA V1.0. For the calculations of the flashover rate of these lines protected with shield wire and surge arrester located in distributed form only is used the software SISDEA V1.0. The results show the calculations of the flashover rate for lines protected and not protected shield wire and surge arrester located in distributed form. The conclusion shows the importance to carry out studies like these for improvement the quality of the electrical service for the clients.

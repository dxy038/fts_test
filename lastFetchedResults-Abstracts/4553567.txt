The method simultaneously considers the order difference and the data difference of the alternatives in the decision results between each expert and group, and takes them as the similarity index of measuring the individual and group. At the same time, a new similarity measuring function is defined to determine the objective weight of the experts, in this method, the order difference´s existence or not is prior to determine whether the data difference takes part in the calculation. Finally an example shows the feasibility of the proposed method.

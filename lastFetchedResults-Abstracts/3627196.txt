The comparative direction-finding (DF) performance of multiple signal classification (MUSIC), ROOT-MUSIC, and estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) is considered. Data were collected from two target transmitters operating simultaneously. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate multipath resolution capability using measurement precision equivalent to that found in modern radio direction-finding systems

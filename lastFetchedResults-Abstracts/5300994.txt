Mobility is one of the major issue on Mobile Ad hoc networks. Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) is hybrid routing protocol. In this paper, the impact of mobility and scalability by varying mobility rate along with zone radius on QoS based performance metrics has been analyzed. The environment has been simulated by NS2.33 simulator. The objective of our work has to analyze that at what speed and by taking how much zone radius ZRP will be able to perform efficiently and effectively for Mobile Ad hoc Networks.

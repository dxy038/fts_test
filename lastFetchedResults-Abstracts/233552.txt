From 1998 to 2000, a European project named AIRLESS was conducted by 12 institutes, universities and companies from seven European countries. The objective was to develop strategies, principles and protocols to improve and control the performance of HVAC-systems and its components for incorporation in codes and guidelines. The first step was to define air pollution caused by and/or originating from HVAC-systems, to investigate ways to prevent this pollution and to define strategies to keep this pollution away. A summary of this first phase of the AIRLESS project is presented.

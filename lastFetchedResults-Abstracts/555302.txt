Background and Objective: Hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio (H/Q) is one of the most important knee injury risk factors. The aim of this research was to compare H/Q in female athletes and nonathletes.
Materials and Methods: The subjects of this research were 28 female athletes with mean age, height and weight of 20.21±3.05 y, 163.48±5.73 cm and 57.74±7.01 kg, as well as 12 female nonathletes with mean age, height and weight of 21.5±1.9 y, 160±4.19 cm and 52.8±6.64 kg. After specification of data normality (with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) independent sample T test was used to show differences between groups.

Results: Statistical analysis of data revealed that there was no significant difference in peak torque of H/Q between the athletes and non-athletes.
Conclusion: Regular exercise is not main factor for knee balance and trainings should designed to establishing functional balance of hamstring and quadriceps for prevention of knee injuries.

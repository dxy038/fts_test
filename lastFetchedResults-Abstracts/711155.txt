Study Objective
Recent data show US adolescents are engaging in sexual activity at earlier ages; however, little is known about young teens' sexual attitudes and behaviors. Examining teens' questions in sex education classes may provide insight into these attitudes and behaviors.
Design
Quasi cohort study
Setting
Parochial middle school sex education classes
Participants
5th through 8th graders
Interventions
Students' anonymous written questions submitted at the outset of sex education classes between 2003 and 2005.
Main Outcome Measures
Questions were classified into topic categories. Three additional variables were then coded for each question. Ethics/guidance questions included requests for advice or value judgments. Prohibited questions included the topics homosexuality, abortion, masturbation, and contraception. “Red flag” questions were those that suggested consideration of or engagement in sexual behavior.
Results
Among 473 questions submitted by 410 students, the most popular topics for 5th/6th graders were pregnancy and puberty, and for 7th/8th graders puberty and menstruation. 41 questions (8.6%) were prohibited. 29 questions (6.2%) asked about ethics/guidance. 18 questions (3.81%) were coded as red flag questions. A chi-square analysis showed that 5th/6th graders asked more questions in the ethics/guidance (8.3% versus 3.64%) and red flag question categories (5.53% versus 1.82%) (P< 0.05) than 7th/8th graders.
Conclusions
Although provocative questions represent a minority of these middle students' queries, these requests suggest the urgency of providing appropriate guidance to young teens, given the risks of early sexual activity. The role of school education programs, physicians and parents in addressing questions of this sort should be considered.

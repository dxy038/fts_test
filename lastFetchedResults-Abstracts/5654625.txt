Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) was developed as a proposal for Interplanetary Network (IPN) communication at first. Its primary objective is to support the interconnection and intercommunication in highly stressed network environments including intermittent connectivity, large and/or variable delays, heterogeneous transmission rate, and high bit error rates. DTN researchers have relied heavily on simulation for research. The research object of this paper is to construct a DTN testbed, offer a real experiment environment for research like routing algorithm and DTN application development. This research construct a multiple nodes DTN experiment environment among Linux machines by using the DTN2 implement public released by DTNRG (DTN Research Group), and successfully accomplish different transmission experiments. The experiment simulates intermittent connective network of three-endpoint, we successfully accomplish one transmission experiment base on this DTN testbed. In addition, we selected HBSD as an external routing protocol, and added it to the experimental platform. Using the external routing protocol we successfully accomplish another transmission experiment. The DTN constructed using DTN2 implement is basically finish all BP functions.

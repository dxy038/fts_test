In this work we apply the signal peptide prediction Sigfind on DNA sequences. A combination with the DIANA-TIS method for translation initiation start site (TIS) prediction can identify half of the ambiguous cases with alternative start sites correctly. Sigfind is based on the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) architecture. DIANA-TIS makes use of two modules, one sensitive to the conserved motif and one sensitive to the coding/non-coding potential around the start codon. Both modules are based on hierarchical artificial neural networks.

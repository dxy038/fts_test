With growing wind penetration, integration of storage units with wind power is being considered critical to improving the reliability of wind farms in meeting committed generation schedules. However, operational constraints such as limited energy of storage units, in addition to the inherent variability of wind power, limit the maximum generation commitment that can be met reliably by a wind farm operating in combination with a storage plant. This paper presents a Dynamic Programming (DP) based method for computing an optimal storage dispatch for a storage unit coupled with a wind farm over the period of one hour with the objective of minimizing generation schedule deviations. Tests on a simplified model of a wind-storage plant connected to a load verify the desired objectives. A simple rule based computation method has also been presented as an alternative methodology to compare the results of the DP based method. Results provide insights about the maximum generation commitment the combined wind-storage unit can meet without deviations over the scheduling horizon.

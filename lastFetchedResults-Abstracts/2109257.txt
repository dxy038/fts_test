The purpose of this study was preparation and evaluation of PLGA nanospheres containing the influenza virus and different adjuvants, Quillaja saponin (QS) and CpG-ODN. 
 
Materials and Methods:
Nanospheres were prepared using the double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The morphological and physicochemical properties were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), determination of zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and release profile. 
Results:
The particle size of formulations was less than 1000 nm, except for formulations containing antigen. The results were confirmed with SEM images. Encapsulation efficiency of antigen, QS and CpG ODN were 80%, 62% and 31%, respectively. The zeta potential of nanospheres was about -30 mV. The burst release was observed for all encapsulates and reached to about 48%, 44% and 35% within 90 min for antigen, CpG-ODN and Qs content, respectively. 
Conclusion:
The formulations showed proper physicochemical properties. These nanospheres have good potential to be used as delivery systems/adjuvants for immunization against influenza.

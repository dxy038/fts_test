<div style="display:none">fiogf49gjkf0d</div>Circulation regions always exist in settling tanks. These regions would result in short-circuiting enlargement of the dead 
zone and high flow mixing problems and avoid optimal particle sedimentation. Therefore, the main objective of the tank 
design process is to avoid formation of the circulation zone, which is known as dead zone. Experiments show that the tank 
performance can be improved by altering the geometry of the tank which leads to a different velocity distributions and flow 
patterns. In this paper, the presence of a baffle and its effect on the hydrodynamics of the flow field has been investigated in 
a primary settling tank. Hydrodynamics of the flow field in these basins is sophisticated. Therefore a numerical simulation 
has  been  provided  to  discover  such  flow  field.  Then,  the  flow  structure  was  simulated  by  an  unsteady  two-phase  finite 
volume  method,  with  VOF  (Volume  of  Fluid)  model.  Besides,  the  RNG  turbulence  model  was  used  in  the  numerical 
calculations. Successively, in order to validate the mentioned method and for a better understanding of the phenomenon, 
experimental tests have been carried out using ADV (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter) and a 0.2 m breadth rectangular model 
tank. Results  depict the  ability  of this  model  in predicting  the  velocity profiles  and  circulation districts.  Eventually,  the 
optimum position of the baffle for enhancing the performance of the primary settling tank was determined by applying the 
above mentioned numerical scheme.

Micro CHP is a micro combined heat and power system that consume natural gas or other types of fuel and produce heat and power. The growing worldwide demand for less polluting shapes of energy have led to a renewed interest in the use of Micro Combined Heat and Power technologies in the residential sector.During the process of increasing acceptance of Micro CHP systems manufacturers and customers interested to know what is the optimum capacity of power generators for these devices and if these systems were installed in the building whatstrategies should be used to minimize the costs of supplying electricity and heat for households. In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model has been developed. The objective is to minimize annual cost of the energy system for a given residential customer equipped with the CHP plant, combining with a storage tank and a back-up boiler. The model reports the optimal CHP system capacities that customers could employ given their electricity and thermal requirements and minimize a customerâ€™s cost of meeting its electricity and heat requirements. Then, a sensitive analysis was elaborated which indicated that optimal value of CHP capacity is sensitive to capital cost, energy prices, as well as the electricity buyback. An optimal storage tank can extent the operating time of the CHP plant, in addition a Time Of Use (TOU) tariff structure will almost always result in a larger cost saving ratio.

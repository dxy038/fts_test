This paper presents an automatic pre-screening algorithm of SAR images of huge size (more than 20;000&#215;20;000 pixels), which is capable to identifying extended infrastructures in an effective and computationally efficient way. The algorithm is tested on true one-look Cosmo-SkyMed SAR image data for target detection purposes on an airport scenario. Both visual and objective results are presented to show the potentials of the proposed method.

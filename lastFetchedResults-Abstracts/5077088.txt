In this paper, we discuss the technical issues related to defining a coordinated view of integrated diagnostic information. Our objective is to define a process and modeling framework for solving the information integration problem. The process discussed is based on formal modeling methods that have been used for years in various contexts but rarely combined. Specifically, the approach applies a "component" orientation to the problem and draws heavily from the discipline of information modeling.

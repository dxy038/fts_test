In order to promote the branches to bring down the human error rate with effectual measures, encouragement and punishing impartially are needed for power companies. Aiming at the problem of how to impartially evaluate the human error rate of power companies and the branches, the concept of contribution rate is given in this paper in order to embody the effect of branches under the particular condition including the surrounding and their task according to the theory of management by objective. The mathematical programming model is founded to get the due human error rate of power companies and to evaluate the branches´ contribution to the company. At last the algorithm of the model is given based on the bisection method.

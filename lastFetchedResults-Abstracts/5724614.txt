In this paper a repetitive-based control strategy is presented for a boost-based power factor precompensator which guarantees fast regulation of the output voltage towards a desired constant value with a power factor close to unity. This twofold control objective is fulfilled even in the presence of harmonic distortion on the voltage source and uncertainties on the system parameters. A key point in the proposed solution is the expression of the model in terms of the input current instead of the inductor current as usually done. The resulting controller is preserved as close as possible to the conventional one, which is composed by the cascade interconnection of two controllers namely: inner and outer control loops. It is shown that while the latter turns out to be a simple low pass filter plus and integration term, the former is composed by a proportional gain plus a repetitive strategy actuating as a refinement term. It is shown that the repetitive strategy can be built using a single analog delay integrated circuit. This strategy is able to compensate for the harmonic components in the voltage source. Experimental results are provided to assess the performance of the proposed controller

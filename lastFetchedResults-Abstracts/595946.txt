Objectives: The objective of the study is comparing pathohisto-logical picture and test results of the activity of the enzymes of the anti-oxidative protection -cytoplasmic super-oxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) from the blood and endometrium in the promotion of the progression or regression of the hyperplasia and endometrium carcinoma. Materials and Methods: The study has been carried out on 70 patients. We have analysed:The age patients, the supersonic test - transvaginal probe, pathohistological diagnosis (PHD) analysis of the curet of the patient-we have gathered the tissue of the normal and the pathologicaly changed endo-metrium from the exploratory curretage, determining the CuZnSOD in the blood and in the tissue of the normal and pathological endometrium of the uterus. The Group A has been made out of 30 of them who did not have the irregular bleeding from the uterus, and 40 of them represented the Group B with the irregular bleeding, who also had PHD confirmed hyperplasia or malign changes of the endometrium. We have tested if there has been the pathalogical changes in the small pelvis(the ovary tumor, myoma etc.) in both groups. Results: Dominant age in the Group B is 41 - 50 (55%), in Group A, age difference is not that apparent (p>0.05).The results of the arithmetic mean of the CuZnSOD in the blood (19.90%) and (29.05%) in the endometrium which is lower than the Group A (blood-29.95%, endometrium-32.56%). Lower values CuZnSOD in the blood(18,9%) and endometrium (30,09%) we have in the experimental group patients who have had bleeding as well as those beside bleeding had some other gynecological - patological proces (myoma, cyst on the ovary etc.) Conclusions: According to the facts we can see the significance of the activity of the enzymes of the anti - oxidative system in the diagnostic of the hyperplasia and endometrium carcinoma as well as the possibility of their application in the clinical practice.

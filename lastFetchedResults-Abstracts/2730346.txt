Ethernet Ring Protection (ERP) has recently emerged to provide protection switching for Ethernet ring topologies with sub-50 ms failover capabilities. In addition to Ethernet´s cost-effectiveness and simplicity, ERP´s promise to also provide protection in mesh packet transport networks positions Ethernet as a prominent competitor to conventional SONET/SDH and the technology of choice for carrier networks. Higher service availability, however, in ERP mesh networks has been challenged by the issue of network partitioning and the contention for protection resources which may be caused by concurrent failures. In this paper, we show that in a mesh network designed to withstand only single failure situations, network services usually suffer from two outage categories subject to concurrent dual-link failures. We address the problem of minimal capacity network design to provide high service availability against concurrent dual-link failures. We cast this combinatorially complex design problem as an optimization one and show that higher service availability can be achieved by proper RPL (Ring Protection Link) placement and ring hierarchy selection. The objective is to maximize the network flow under any dual-link failure scenario. Our design achieves minimal capacity allocation that minimizes the number of service outages (up to 37%) therefore achieving higher service availability. Numerical evaluation and comparative study show that the joint desgin approach of the ILP model provisions 8% less capacity than the sequential two-step approach to achieve similar service availability.

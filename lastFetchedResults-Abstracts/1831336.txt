Epidemiological evidence suggests that a high meat consumption and/or animal fat intake may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. The objective of this study is to examine the role of dietary factors, in particular meat preparation and consumption, in relation to colorectal adenomas, the pattern of DNA-mutations (e.g. K-ras and p53), and genetic susceptibility (NAT2, HNPCC). In a case control study on diet and colorectal adenomas (sporadic and HNPCC), acetylator status (NAT2) of cases and controls as well as K-ras and p53 mutations in adenomas will be assessed. Consumption and preparation of meat, the primary interest of this study, will be assessed by a food frequency questionnaire designed especially for this purpose.

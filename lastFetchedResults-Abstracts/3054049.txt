In this paper, a new implementation of an adaptive noise canceller based upon a parallel block structure is proposed. The objective is to increase the processing and convergence rates and to improve the steady-state performance. First, an IIR bandpass filter with a variable center angular frequency using adaptive Q-factor control and two adaptive control signal generators are realized by the parallel block structure. Secondly, an algorithm for adaptive Q-factor control with parallel block structure is proposed to improve the convergence characteristic. Furthermore, by using the normalized transfer function and the continuously variable step-size parameter for adaptive control of the center frequency to stabilize the steady-state performance of the filter. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the convergence performance.

This paper presents a resource management strategy for control tasks that maximizes control performance within the available resources by readjusting the task periods at runtime. A feedback scheduler is used to determine on-line the optimal task periods considering the response over a finite time horizon of the plants controlled by arbitrary linear control laws. We show how this problem can be expressed as an optimization problem, where the objective function relates the sampling periods to the transient responses of the controlled plants, and where restrictions are based on EDF schedulability constraints. For the general case, the solution of the optimization problem is computationally expensive, and thus, an approximate procedure to be executed on-line has been developed. We present simulation results that validate the presented approach

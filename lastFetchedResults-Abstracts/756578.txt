Objective
To assess the value of colour M-mode Doppler of the mitral valve in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema.
Design

Case-control, clinical.
Setting

Coronary care unit in a university hospital.
Patients/Subjects

28 patients admitted because of acute myocardial infarction, and who developed pulmonary edema (group P, cases); 39 patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction (group C, controls).
Results

Patients in group P showed higher E wave (77±20 vs. 64±16 cm/s, p=0.007), E/A ratio (1.5±1.0 vs. 1.0±0.4, p=0.014), lower time of deceleration of the E wave (153±40 vs. 196±53 ms, p=0.001) and lower Ejection Fraction (35±10 vs. 49±11, p<0.001). There were no differences in the velocity of the colour M-mode Doppler of the mitral valve (Vp: 36.2±11 vs. 34.0±12 cm/s). Excluding patients with abnormal relaxation or restrictive pattern of the pulsed Doppler, Vp was identical (group P 34±10, group C 34±12).
Conclusions

M-mode colour Doppler of the mitral valve was not useful to differentiate patients with acute pulmonary edema complicating myocardial infarction. Measurement of Vp is not warranted as a routine in these patients.

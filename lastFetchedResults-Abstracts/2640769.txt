Regarding the importance of energy storage in distribution networks and different battery technologies, in this paper the optimal battery planning is presented to compare different technologies without renewable energies in the grid. In long-term planning, the decision variables are the battery type, location, capacity and power rating which should be determined optimally. The objective function includes investment cost and O & M cost of battery as well as the grid operation and reliability cost. The technical constraints should be satisfied in project period as well. On the other hand, every technology has its own technical and economic parameters which change in different conditions. As a result, different parameters of the batteries as well as the behavior of the system are taken into account in a comprehensive study. The simulated annealing algorithm is used for optimization. This study show the Zn-Br and Na-S are the most suitable technologies. The results are generalized to different distribution networks using several sensitivity analyses. Finally, it is specified that employing the batteries is economical in those distribution grids which are connected to the global network and have not renewable distributed energy resources.

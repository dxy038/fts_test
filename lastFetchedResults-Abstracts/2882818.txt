In this paper, a system for leg lengthening or shortening method using wireless power transfer is examined. The first of three modules in the system is presented here. In this module, the transmitter and receiver circuits, and antennas are the focus for optimal wireless power transfer and eventual usability. The primary aim of the transmitter of having a portable, handheld and operating on batteries is fulfilled. A modified Royer circuit is chosen based on its simplicity and low components count. The objective of receiver coil being less than 20 mm in diameter is also satisfied. Simulations and experimental data of the transmitting and receiving coils are in agreement. Finally, a working handheld portable prototype is developed. Although having a maximum efficiency of only 8.4%, the received power of 2.5 W is sufficient to drive a DC motor.

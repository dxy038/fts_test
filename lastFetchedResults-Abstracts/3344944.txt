Due to the inherent intermittency and uncertain variability, increasing integration of wind power brings challenges to unit commitment (UC) under uncertainty. Robust optimization (RO) approach is regarded as one of the most effective uncertain UC methods. But the major limit is its conservativeness in the objective function. Moreover, the coupling characteristic of so-called feasibility robustness and objective robustness of RO makes a dilemma to obtain robust but economically efficient UC solutions. In this paper, we dig out the core superiority of RO compared with deterministic UC in feasibility robustness and present the availability of spinning reserve issue. Then we establish feasibility robustness evaluation model, evaluating whether a UC state is robust in feasibility under uncertain wind power. The formulation decouples the feasibility robustness of RO method from objective robustness. Compared with the robust model, it is simplified and thus reduces the solving difficulty. Numerical tests show the method is effective in reliability and computational efficiency.

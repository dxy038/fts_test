From the application of the finite element analysis in biomechanical studies, this paper studies on the biomechanical model of how to reflect the true biological model, and proposes some innovative processing: mandible model simplification, boundary conditional load and accurate assignment of mandible materials. After the finite element simulations of the layouts of implant in mandibular dental defect, the optimum program of implant distribution is obtained by contrasting the results of plans. The implants are not located in original teeth sockets in the new layout. The objective of this study is to present a novel method to make a preoperative effect of implant distribution program based on biomechanics. It is helpful to the dentists make the surgical implant programs, and help the implant abutment and supporting systems to innovate, so the method has a certain practical application value.

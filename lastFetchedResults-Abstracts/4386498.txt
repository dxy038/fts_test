Silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors are becoming the preferable choice over silicon (Si) semiconductors for power converter applications within the 200 V to 1.2 kV range due to their superior performances. Indirect matrix converters (IMCs) have more potential than traditional back-to-back power converters (BBCs) for achieving higher power densities and longer equipment lifetimes. This paper combines normally off SiC JFETs and the IMC topology to develop a module-based IMC system whose power stage consists of a bidirectional rectifier power module (BPM) and an inverter power module. This combination achieves a power density of approximately 72 kVA/L at the module level. A 5-kVA IMC prototype operating at a switching frequency of 30 kHz and connected to an RL load demonstrates the functionality of the proposed modular IMC system.

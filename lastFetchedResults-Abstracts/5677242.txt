This paper presents a performance comparison between the proposed segmentation method with the existing methods. Generally, the heuristic segmentation of proposed approach namely contour-based segmentation (CBS) is working on contour analysis and using two global features, which are estimation of stroke width and average character width. Meanwhile, enhanced heuristic segmentation (EHS) is based on boundary and connected component analysis along with several estimation of global feature includes average character width, average stroke width, and word height. Besides that, CBS assigns prospective segmentation according to ligature types. In contrast, EHS has dissimilar scheme that assign the prospective segmentation at minima on the lower contour using modified vertical histogram analysis. The last difference is; CBS is using reduction scheme to reduce over-segmentation, whereas EHS removes over-segmentation that sliced at a character holes. Regarding to those differences, a performance comparison is conducted. The objective is to highlight the success of CBS as compared to EHS.

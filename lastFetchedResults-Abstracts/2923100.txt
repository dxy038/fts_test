Detection of calcification in mammograms is analyzed based on mathematical morphology. A method of adaptively thresholding gray-level mammogram images is discussed. The threshold set is controlled by the index numbers in the skeleton of shapes which represent calcifications in mammograms. The parameters of the adaptive threshold sets are obtained from interpreting umbra shadows from an image function. The objective is to extract the suspicious areas from a mammogram and provide location information on certain predefined shapes and sizes of calcifications to radiologists for further examination

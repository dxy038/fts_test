Background: There is little information regarding the food consumption pattern and nutrient intake in pregnant women, especially those residing in deprived cities.
Objective: to determine the food consumption pattern and nutrient intake in pregnant women with further comparison of data in rural and urban areas of Maku-the west north of Iran.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study 284 pregnant women (142 from urban areas and 142 from rural areas) were chosen randomly and privately interviewed using a face-to-face technique. Socio-demographic information such as age, educational level, family size, husband's occupation and pregnancy medical history were obtained by questionnaire. The data on dietary intake was collected using two 24-hour recalls and a food frequency questionnaire for 3 months.
Findings: Mean consumption of grains and dairies was higher in rural women compared to those .in urban areas. Fruit consumption by pregnant women in urban and rural areas was 140 g and 248 g, respectively. There was no significant difference regarding consumption of vegetables, pulses, fats and oils between two groups. All women consumed adequate amount of energy, protein, thiamin and niacin (>75% RDA). Nutrients intakes including folate, B6, A, D vitamins, iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and zinc were found to be insufficient in both groups (<75%RDA).
Conclusion: Our data indicated that the rural women had a better nutritional status than urban women. Further studies are needed to determine factors associated with food consumption pattern in these women.

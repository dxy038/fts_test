Listener preference rankings of selected samples of programs containing many types of flutter will be compared to measurements of the same flutter using a meter weighted with respect to flutter rate in accordance with the threshold of perceptibility. It will be shown that the correct weighting curve varies with the level of flutter, and modification should be made to the flutter meter in order to obtain objective rankings of program containing the same type of flutter.

The command and control structure and the perception system of ARTES (autonomous robotic test and experimental system) are described. ARTES is the demonstrator system of the German Ministry of Defense experimental program `Robotics on the Battlefield.Â´ It consists of a command center and the robot vehicle. The operating area for the robot will be approximately 5&#215;5 km<sup>2</sup>. The vehicle will not be teleoperated. One major objective of the program is to solve the problem of the commandability under battlefield conditions without line of sight. The perception system of the robot consists of several TV-cameras, an acoustic direction finder, a laser range finder, and dedicated hardware and software for sensor data processing

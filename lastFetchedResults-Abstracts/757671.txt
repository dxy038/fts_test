Objective
To study the evolution of procedural variations in vascular brachytherapy (VBT) and their relationship to medium-term outcome.
Methods and Results

The RENO (European Surveillance Registry with Novoste Beta-Cath™) prospectively collected procedural and clinical outcome data on 1098 patients treated with VBT. Patients were divided for this analysis into Group-I, the first 50% registered, and Group-II, the last 50% registered.

Shorter 30-mm source trains were more commonly used in Group-I (p<0.001) while longer 40-mm (p=NS) and 60-mm (p<0.001) source trains were more commonly used in Group-II. Mean dwell time for radiation seeds was longer in Group-II compared to Group-I (4.20±1.48 min vs. 4.14±1.44 min; p<0.05). Mean radiation dose was higher in Group-II (19.73±3.33 Gy vs. 17.92±2.68 Gy; p<0.001). Cutting balloons were more frequently used in Group-II (p<0.001).

There was significant drop in the incidence of geographic miss in Group-II (3.2% vs. 9%; p<0.00005). There were nonsignificant trends towards reduction in angiographic restenosis, target vessel (TV) revascularisation, death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).
Conclusion

There has been a learning curve and evolution of VBT techniques over time. In general, there has been an increase in radiation source length, use of cutting balloons, dwell time and radiation dose. This has resulted in significant reduction of geographic miss and a trend towards improve clinical outcomes. Continued development may result in further improvement in the treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR).

The Workshop, organised by ILSI-Europe, provided for the first time an opportunity for government, industry and academia to consider the implications of the evolving concept of the Food Safety Objective (FSO) in microbiological food safety management. The historic development of the concept and its relationship to other established food safety tools was discussed at length. An example application of an FSO was described for Listeria monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon. The Workshop identified a number of conclusions and requirements for future consideration.

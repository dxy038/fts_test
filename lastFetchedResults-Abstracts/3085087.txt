This paper introduces a new kind of slot type axial magnetic field (AMF) contact with iron plates. The objective of this paper is to analyze AMF characteristics of the new contact. The analysis was done by finite element method. Influence of iron plate parameters on AMF characteristics, such as axial magnetic flux density at current peak and current zero and phase shift time distribution, are shown. AMF characteristics of same contact without iron were analyzed for a comparison. It is found that a case gave the highest AMF 1.067T at current peak and its maximum AMF at current zero is 0.229T that is very close to the situation without iron 0.228T, while its phase shift time is as low as 0.6ms ~ l,6ms on the intermediate plane in contact gap. In this case parameters of iron plates are quantities of iron plates 12, inner diameter 16mm, outer diameter 46mm, height of iron plates 8mm and thickness of contact plates 3mm

Objective: The incidence of heart valve disease is increasing worldwide and the number
of heart valve replacements is expected to increase in the future. By mimicking the main
tissue structures and properties of heart valve, tissue engineering offers new options for
the replacements. Applying an appropriate scaffold in fabricating tissue-engineered heart
valves (TEHVs) is of importance since it affects the secretion of the main extracellular matrix
(ECM) components, collagen 1 and elastin, which are crucial in providing the proper
mechanical properties of TEHVs.
Materials and Methods: Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in this experimental
study, the relative expression levels of COLLAGEN 1 and ELASTIN were obtained
for three samples of each examined sheep mitral valvular interstitial cells (MVICs)-seeded
onto electrospun poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS)-poly (?-caprolactone) (PCL) microfibrous,
gelatin and hyaluronic acid based hydrogel-only and composite (PGS-PCL/hydrogel)
scaffolds. This composite has been shown to create a synthetic three-dimensional
(3D) microenvironment with appropriate mechanical and biological properties for MVICs.
Results: Cell viability and metabolic activity were similar among all scaffold types. Our
results showed that the level of relative expression of COLLAGEN 1 and ELASTIN genes
was higher in the encapsulated composite scaffolds compared to PGS-PCL-only and hydrogel-
only scaffolds with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The encapsulated composite scaffolds are more conducive to ECM secretion
over the PGS-PCL-only and hydrogel-only scaffolds. This composite scaffold
can serve as a model scaffold for heart valve tissue engineering.

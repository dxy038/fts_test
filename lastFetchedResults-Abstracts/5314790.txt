Despite the existence of a number of procedures for multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms, there is still the need for a systematic and unbiased comparison of different approaches on a carefully chosen set of test problems. In this paper, a hybrid approach using PCX based NSGA- II and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is applied on 19 benchmark test problems consisting of two, three and five objectives. PCX-NSGA-II is used as a population based algorithm where SQP is used as a local search procedure. A population based approach helps in finding the non-dominated set of solutions with a good spread, whereas SQP improves the obtained set of non-dominated solutions locally. The results obtained by the present approach shows mixed performance on the chosen test problems.

This paper addresses the fault tolerant estimation problem. Fault tolerance is defined with respect to a given estimation objective, namely a given functional of the system state should remain observable when sensor failures occur. Three criteria, which evaluate the system fault tolerance with respect to sensor failures when a reconfiguration strategy is used, are introduced, and it is shown that they can be used to define maintenance policies. A ship boiler example is used for illustration.

Objective
This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of secondary cytoreduction in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
Study design
Secondarily, cytoreduced patients were retrospectively analyzed with respect to the clinicopathologic variables.
Results
A total of 64 patients were evaluated in this report. Multivariable analysis revealed 3 factors to be significant: optimal cytoreduction during primary (P = .003, odds ratio [OR]: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14-0.66), secondary cytoreduction (P = .04, OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.22-0.99), and the endometrioid histologic type (P = .005, OR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02-0.48). Intrinsic factors of the tumors (grade, stage, age), size, and number of recurrent tumors were nonsignificant.
Conclusion
Secondary cytoreductive surgery should be offered in selected recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Further prospective randomized series are needed to determine specific recommendations.

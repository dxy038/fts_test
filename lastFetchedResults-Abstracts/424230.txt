The objective of this study was to ascertain the clinical and epidemiological pattern of long-term care inpatients in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional survey of all long-term care inpatients facilities in the Ministry of Health was conducted during the period Januaryâ€“June 1994. Trained research teams consisting of physicians, social workers, nurses and medical record officers completed a pre-designed data form. They interviewed the treating teams, patients and their relatives. The data form consisted of socio-demographic data of patients, the duration of their stay in hospital and their clinical, social and psychological characteristics. In addition, the perceptions and preferences of doctors, patients, and their relatives about patient management in hospital vs home care were sought. Out of all patients, 61.3% were males, while 52.7% were elderly patients (greater-or-equal, slanted60 years of age). Forty-three percent did not need any nursing care or required only routine nursing care. The treating doctors believed that 44.9% of patients could be cared for at home. However, 45.2% of the patients preferred to stay in hospital, while 67.5% of their relatives preferred institutional care. It is concluded that there is a need to plan for more cost-effective facilities for these patients. The proposed health services have to be culturally acceptable in order to encourage patients and their relatives to utilize them.

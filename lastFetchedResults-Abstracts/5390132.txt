There are extra equipments such as sonar arrays, electronic devises, antennas and video cameras which are mounted of the surface of the submarinesÂ´ hull. These equipments create drag and interfering turbulent noises. Created noises and also vibrations cause failure for operating and monitoring these devices. The process of design and optimization the Case for such these devises is presented in order to reduce the drag and noise. Automatic multi-objective optimization based design method is applied in two different setups and techniques in order to find the best approach for hydrodynamic design.

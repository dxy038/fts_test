Infinite-dimensional parameter-dependent optimization problems of the form ‘minJ(u;p) subject to
g(u)   0’ are studied, where u is sought in an L∞ function space, J is a quadratic objective functional,
and g represents pointwise linear constraints. This setting covers in particular control constrained optimal
control problems. Sensitivities with respect to the parameter p of both, optimal solutions of the original
problem, and of its approximation by the classical primal-dual interior point approach are considered. The
convergence of the latter to the former is shown as the homotopy parameter μ goes to zero, and error bounds
in various Lq norms are derived. Several numerical examples illustrate the results.

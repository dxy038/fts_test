Objective: To determine the frequency of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in infants presenting with jaundice.Material and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Fazal Rahim Clinical Laboratory Timergara District Dir North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2004 on 120 neonates. Data regarding sex and age, serum bilirubin total, serum bilirubin direct and G6PD status was extracted using database software designed by the principal author. The inclusion criterion was neonates with high serum bilirubin and G6PD test performed simultaneously. The exclusion criterion was premature babies and incomplete request forms. Microsoft Excel 2000 was used for data analysis Results: Out of 120 patients, 97 (80.8%) were male and 23 (19.2%) were female ranging in age from 3 -10 days with mean 6.5 days and median 5 days. Thirty two (26.6%) neonates were found G6PD deficient. Among patients with normal G6PD level male to female ratio was 3.63:1. In G6PD deficient patients male to female ratio was 7:1. The serum bilirubin of the G6PD normal patients was 12.8 + 5.0 mg/dl and that of G6PD deficient patients was 13.5 + 6.8 mg/dl. Conclusion: G6PD deficiency is quite high in neonates presenting with jaundice. The diagnosis is simple and if left undetected may cause serious consequences in situations of oxidant stress.

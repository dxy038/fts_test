Traditional microbiological diagnostics identify bacteria through a process of ex vivo culture in growth media followed by biochemical tests. Here we describe conducting polymer sensor arrays that have been incorporated with suitable sampling systems to enable clinical measurements to be carried out for the rapid and objective detection of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). This technology has led to new ‘aid to diagnosis’ devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in the USA.

In the transient short-circuit analysis of saturated synchronous machines, the accurate calculation of the stator and rotor currents depends, particularly during the first few cycles of the transient process (the subtransient period), on the saturation conditions of their main and leakage flux paths. In this paper, a computer model for saturated synchronous machines has been developed using the synchronous machine voltage and flux linkage differential equations considering the machine main flux saturation. The effect of the main flux saturation both in the direct and quadrature axes and of the cross-magnetizing phenomenon (the magnetic coupling between the direct and quadrature axes) on the determination of the transient short-circuit performance of synchronous machines is the main objective of this paper

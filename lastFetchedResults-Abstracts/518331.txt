In this paper, one of the evolutionary algorithm based method, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) has been presented for the Volt / Var control in power distribution systems with dispersed generation (DG). The proposed method is better suited for volt/var control problems. Genetic algorithm approach is used due to its broad applicability, ease of use and high accuracy. A multi-objective optimization problem has been formulated for the volt/var control of the distribution system. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based method proposed in this paper, alleviates the problem of tuning the weighting factors required in solving the multi-objective volt/var control optimization problems. Based on the simulation studies carried out on the distribution system, the proposed scheme has been found to be simple, accurate and easy to apply to solve the multi-objective volt/var control optimization problem of the distribution system with dispersed generation.

Abstract
Introduction: olfactory disorders usually occur in rhinological disease. Different subjective and objective test methods are available to assess the sense of smell Among the subjective methods, screening tests and threshold measurements are commonly used to quantify hyposmia or anosmia. Qualitative methods are available using discrimination and identification tests.
Objective methods are used in research and in some situatisus. they include FMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging), FPET(functional positron emission tomography), olfactory evoked potentials and brain SPECT(single photon emission computed tomography), the measurement of the sense of smell helps to assess the whole spectrum of the effects of nasal diseases. Conclusion: This is especially important before rhinological surgery, because a non-detected smell disorder in patients with rhinological disease is common. the assessment of a pre-existing hyposmia or anosmia helps to post-Aperative claims relating it to surgery. A variety of validated screening tests for olfaction are available pervent and they are useful tools to document whether a patient is able to smell.

There are several settlements of " Eight-trigram" forms in Gaoyao area. Among them, Yangang and Licha Villages are most identical with the Eight-trigram form. For a long time, official publicity and some scholars have considered that the concepts of such form came from idea of Taiji and Eight-trigram. But after the fieldwork and graphical analysis of these settlements, especially of Yangang and Licha villages, we found that "Eight-trigram" form is only their external appearance, and there were more important objective reasons for their formation. The adaptability of the natural factors (climatic factors and geographical environment) is the first reason. The second one is the defensive consideration. Third is forms of social organization. The obvious reasons of these settlements\Â´ forms are to precaution against natural disasters, defense enemies and adapting to forms of social organizations. And the settlements were also influenced by Taiji, Eight-trigram and Feng-shui in the process of their development, then this " Eight-trigram " form was formed. The hypostatic pursuit of them is to build suitable living environments.

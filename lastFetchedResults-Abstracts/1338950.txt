The objective of this study was to determine the influence of transportation on the serum concentrations of the cardiac biomarkers troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and on cortisol and lactate in horses. For this purpose, 10 horses were transported for 300 km. Blood samples were collected 24 hours before transport (T0), just before transport (T1), during transport at 50 km (T2), 100 km (T3), 200 km (T4), and 300 km (T5). An additional blood sample (T6) was collected 24 hours after transport. The median resting basal cTnI values in the horses were at T0, 0.000 ± 0.007 ng/mL and at T1, 0.01 ± 0.007 ng/mL. The median resting basal CK-MB values in the horses were at T0, 0.19 ± 0.05 ng/mL and at T1, 0.16 ± 0.05 ng/mL. Statistical analyses showed no significant differences of cTnI and CK-MB among the measured values (T0–T6). On the other side, the cortisol and lactate concentrations increased significantly (P < .01) at T2, T3, T3, and T4 compared with the resting values at T0. At T6, cortisol and lactate concentrations had returned to pretransport values, with no statistically significant differences compared with pretransport concentrations. In conclusion, the 300-km transportation of the horses did not influence the levels of the cardiac biomarkers, cTnI and CK-MB. The serum concentrations of cortisol and lactate, on the other side, increased significantly. The possible influence of transportation for longer distances or under more stressful conditions (higher temperature or in horses not used for transportation) on cTnI and CK-MB concentrations needs to be further investigated.

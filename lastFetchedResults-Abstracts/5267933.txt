Timber Harvest Planning (THP) model is used to determine which forest areas to be harvested in different time periods with objective to maximize profit subject to harvesting regulations. Various THP models have been developed in the Western countries based on optimisation approach to generate an optimal or feasible harvest plan. However similar studies have gained less attention in Tropical countries. Thus, this study proposes an optimisation model of THP that reflects selective cutting in Peninsular Malaysia. The model was tested on seven blocks that consists a total of 636 trees with different size and species. We found that, optimisation approach generates selectively timber harvest plan with higher volume and less damage.

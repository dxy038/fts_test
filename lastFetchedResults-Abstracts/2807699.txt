Nowadays, the mode of expert decision is widely utilized in the investment allocation of the distribution system domestically in China. One of the advantages of such mode is that synthetic elements can be considered, however, the human factors are also valid. Thus the unreasonable investment actions are unavoidable. Therefore, a new method for investment allocation is developed. Based on the actual data of one of the most developed provinces in China, a single-objective model and a multi-objective model are constructed. An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) combining with the conjugate gradient method is adopted as the searching algorithm. The results provide the concrete investment value recommended for each city in the province and demonstrate the effectiveness of the allocation method. With the flexibility brought by the multiple options of the objectives, the outcome could have some instructive significance for the real planning work.

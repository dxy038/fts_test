Objective
Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome frequently suffer from hyperinsulinemia and adverse lipid profile. This study evaluated effects of metformin on lipid profile.
Study design
Lipid profiles in hyperinsulinemic (n = 43) and normoinsulinemic (n = 45) subjects were compared. Hyperinsulinemic subjects were treated with metformin (500 mg po tid) and lipid profiles were reevaluated at 3 and 6 months of treatment.
Results
The hyperinsulinemic group had significantly lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (by 11%), higher total cholesterol to HDL ratio (by 23%), and greater triglycerides (by 57%) than the normoinsulinemic group. Six-month metformin therapy in hyperinsulinemic women was associated with a significant decrease of insulin level (by 35%), total cholesterol (by 11%), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (by 12%), and triglycerides (by 33%). Levels of lipids in hyperinsulinemic women after metformin therapy were comparable to levels observed in normoinsulinemic subjects.
Conclusion
The present study supports the notion that metformin may be considered as a prophylactic therapy lowering cardiovascular risk factors in hyperinsulinemic women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

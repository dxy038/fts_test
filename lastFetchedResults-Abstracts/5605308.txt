Pilot-vehicle interface designs must be driven by the gaol of establishing and maintaining high pilot situation awareness. The situation-awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT), developed to assist in this process by providing an objective measure of pilotÂ´s situation awareness with any given aircraft design, is described. SAGAT is considered to represent a substantial improvement in the evaluation of pilot-vehicle interface designs, facilitating the development of cockpits which assist the pilot in surviving combat. A formal definition of situation awareness is presented a description of the SAGAT methology and a discussion of its validation

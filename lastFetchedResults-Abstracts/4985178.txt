In this article, a structure of foveal artificial retina to use bipolar phototransistors in configuration Darlington within the central zone and bipolar phototransistors in the periphery is proposed. These last ones are forming groups of four elements with a size that is growing towards the periphery, this causes an increase of the area of incidence without modifying to a great extent the size of the phototransistors and thus to take advantage of better the area silicon, in addition it occurs to know a new structure in where the analysis of the foveal model with rectangular phototransistors is possible. This new structure is not necessary that the photodetectors have a specific and complex design, as can be the circular form that has been used in diverse models. An analysis is made on the voltage of operation the two configurations of phototransistors with the objective to present the idea raised in relation cones and canes a biological retina. With the previous, is a simulation in which an image with the proposed model can be observed. The results in Mat Lab appear with which the degree of resolution in the center of the foveal model is observed.

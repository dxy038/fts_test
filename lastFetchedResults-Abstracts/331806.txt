Objective: The aim of this study was to determine, in vitro, the relative short- and long-term fluoride release from four resin-modified glass ionomers (Fuji II LC, Vitremer, Enforce & Advance), a polyacid-modified composite resin (Dyract compomer) and a bonding agent (OptiBond).

Methods: All the materials were prepared as outlined by the manufacturers. Circular discs of the materials mentioned were suspended in water for up to 300 days and the non-cumulative 24-h fluoride release was determined potentiometrically at chosen times.

Results: The amounts of fluoride released during the first day were Vitremer (1.46 μg mm−2), Advance (1.18 μg mm−2), Fuji (1.08 μg mm−2), Optibond (0.33 μg mm−2), Dyract (0.31 μg mm−2) and Enforce (0.15 μg mm−2). After the second day the sequence changed slightly and remained approximately the same for the rest of the 300-day period. There was also an increase in the fluoride release during the 60–200-day period relative to the previous period.

Conclusion: In general the most fluoride was released by Advance and not by Fuji II LC or Vitremer. For most materials, fluoride is still released after 300 days. Furthermore, even a thin layer of bonding agent released a relatively high amount of fluoride (volume-wise the most) at the beginning. It is deduced that even the release of relatively low amounts of fluoride may result in significant concentrations of fluoride in a microleakage gap.

In this paper we propose an approach for monitoring human activities in an indoor environment using detected and tracked face and selective encryption. The objective is to encrypt partially the human face in a video sequence. This approach is based on ALS stream ciphering using VLC (variable length coding) of the HuffmanÂ´s vector. The proposed scheme allows scalable decryption of a specific region of image and result in a significant reduction in encrypting and decrypting processing time. It also provides a constant bit rate and keep the JPEG and MPEG bitstream compliance.

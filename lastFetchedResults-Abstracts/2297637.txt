In this paper, an efficient multi-objective optimization method for the optimization of astronaut landing position is presented. The finite element model is employed to simulate the airdrop process and the design variables are determined by Sobol sensitivity method. The approximation models of landing impact are constructed by the Radial Basis Functions with the samples which are obtained from the design of experiments. The micro multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to search for the Pareto optimal solutions of the problem. According to the optimal astronaut landing position, the engineers could design airdrop protection devices to ensure the safety of astronauts.

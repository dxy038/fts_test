Objective
The objective of the study was to identify factors associated with satisfaction in the Indiana University School of Medicine Obstetrics-Gynecology residency program and the residents' and faculty's perception of whether these factors were extant in our program.
Study design
Residents and faculty at the Indiana University School of Medicine Obstetrics-Gynecology program were surveyed using an instrument based on prior primary care specialty investigations. Multivariate regression evaluated the impact of various factors on resident satisfaction.
Results
Seventy-seven percent (44 of 57) and 100% (35 of 35) of faculty and residents, respectively, completed the survey. Relevant training, collegiality, adequate resources, workload, care continuity, supportive coworkers, learning environment, autonomy, role ambiguity, and supportive faculty were significantly associated with resident satisfaction. Care continuity, role ambiguity, and learning environment were the areas of largest faculty/resident disagreement.
Conclusion
Relevant training and collegiality were most strongly linked to resident satisfaction. Three areas of dissatisfaction were identified, and we will seek to remedy these areas.

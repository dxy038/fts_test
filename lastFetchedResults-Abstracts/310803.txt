Objective. To assess the biomechanical impact of commercially available alternate keyboard designs.

Design. A repeated measures study was conducted in a laboratory setting, with planned comparisons of Pitch, Roll and Yaw angles of the keyboards. Ten keyboard conditions were tested. Dependent measures included tendon travel, wrist deviations, and wrist and finger kinematics.

Background. Various alternate keyboard designs have recently been introduced, which vary Pitch, Roll and Yaw angles, separation distance between keyboard halves, and include other novel features such as cup-shaped depressions for the keys. Yet little objective research has been conducted regarding the biomechanical implications of these various design features. This study attempts to quantify the keyboard designs in terms of several recognized risk factors associated with cumulative trauma disorders that arise with repetitive typing.

Methods. Wrist and finger goniometers were used to measure joint motions during a standardized typing task. 15 experienced typists (8 women, 7 men) served as subjects. Regression equations were used to generate estimates of tendon travel.

Results. Tendon travel was affected primarily by Pitch but not Roll or Yaw angles while wrist deviations responded to changes in all three angles. Males had significantly greater amount of tendon travel than female subjects; this difference was only partially accounted for by anthropometry. Differences in joint motion may have a greater impact on the amount of tendon travel.

Conclusions. Alternate keyboard designs can affect tendon travel by as much as 11%.

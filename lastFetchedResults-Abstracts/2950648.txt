The Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) has been put into service in Japan. In this system, rod antennas are commonly used as the base station antennas because of their easy installation and low cost. This paper proposes a new base station antenna for base stations located on a slope or beside a cliff. The proposed antenna is a rod antenna that has axis-asymmetrical radiation patterns. To realize such radiation patterns, pattern syntheses of a linear array antenna are introduced that consider the influence of the metal plate (one part of the antenna), as determined by the moment method analysis. Two types of antennas are considered. One has a bidirectional radiation pattern in the slant direction, and the other has beams in the horizontal and slant directions. The results of the moment method analysis verify that the proposed antenna has the desired radiation patterns

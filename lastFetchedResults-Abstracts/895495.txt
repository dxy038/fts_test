Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of mortality affecting millions
of people in third world countries. In DOTS monitoring of patients is facilitybased
and treatment supporter-based; by these two ways patients’ compliance
to treatment is monitored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of
treatment supporters and their impact on patients’ treatment outcomes.
Materials and Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey in the routine
TB control program operational context. All sputum smear positive TB patients
that were diagnosed and registered by the public sector in the urban and rural
diagnostic centers in 2008 with available outcomes were included in the study.
Data of 451 patients were collected during August-October 2010 from 15 health
facilities.
Results: The majority of patients (89.6%) were provided with treatment
supporters. Of 404 (89.6%) cases with treatment supporters, in 203 (50.2%) the
supporters were lady health workers, in 46 (11.4%) were community health
workers and health facility workers, and in 155 (38.4%) were family members
and community volunteers. A total of 384 (85.1%) were categorized as
“treatment success”, 31 (6.9%), as “transferred out”, 17 (3.8%), as “expired”, 16
(3.5%) as “defaulted” and three (0.7%) as “treatment failure”. The treatment
success rates in patients supervised by Lady health workers, community health
workers and health facility workers, and family members and community
volunteers were 93.1%, 89.1% and 73.5%, respectively.
Conclusion: We found a significantly higher treatment success rate (93.1%) in
patients supervised by lady health workers compared to others. The overall
treatment success rate was 85.1%.

Describes an object-oriented approach that is being used to design Ada application software for an airborne radar warning receiver program. The objective is software that can be rapidly reprogrammed by merely changing the database that contains emitter descriptions, instead of changing any code. In addition, the hardware/software interfaces are encapsulated to make it possible to deploy the system on several types of aircraft with differing subsystem configurations without changing the software. Interface encapsulation also facilitates concurrent engineering, of the hardware and software. Tradeoffs and lessons learned in applying object-oriented design to achieve these objectives in a real-time application with low latency requirements are discussed

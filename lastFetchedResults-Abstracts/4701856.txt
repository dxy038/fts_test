The main objective of this study is to evaluate high temperature performance of asphalt mastic made with hydrated lime or ordinary Portland cement. Softening point, Dynamic Shear Rheological and Viscosity Tests were conducted. The results demonstrated that asphalt mastic with hydrated lime showed significant improvement at the low replacement level, however, higher hydrated lime may lead to lower construction workability. It is recommended that to control the replacement level of hydrated lime not exceed 30% in practical application. The performance of cement asphalt mastic increase with addition of ordinary Portland cement. It is found that workability performance of cement asphalt mastic is markedly improvement with the increase of Filler/Asphalt Ratio.

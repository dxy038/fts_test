The optimization of thermal systems and processes has received much less attention than their simulation and often lags behind optimization in other engineering areas. This paper considers the optimization of the important thermal manufacturing process involved in the drawing of optical fibers. Despite the importance of optical fibers and the need to enhance product quality and reduce costs, very little work has been done on the optimization of the process. The main aspects that arise in the optimization of such thermal processes are considered in detail in order to formulate an appropriate objective function and to determine the existence of optimal conditions. Using validated numerical models to simulate the thermal transport processes that govern the characteristics of the fiber and the production rate, the study investigates the relevant parametric space and obtains the domain in which the process is physically feasible. This is followed by an attempt to narrow the feasible region and focus on the domain that could lead to optimization. Employing standard optimization techniques, optimal conditions are determined for typical operating parameters. The study thus provides a basis for choosing optimal design conditions and for more detailed investigations on the feasibility and optimization of this complicated and important process.

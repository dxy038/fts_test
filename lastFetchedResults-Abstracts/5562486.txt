The parameter optimization of the multiple tuned mass damper system are studied in this paper by establishing the dynamic model of the multi-mode control of the multi-degree-of-freedom structure and vibration control system. The transfer functions and dynamic magnification factors of the multi-mode control of the multi-degrees-of-freedom structure and vibration control system are derived first. The parameter optimization study of the vibration control system is then performed, where the minimum of the dynamic magnification factor is used as the optimal objective. Furthermore, the optimal vibration control effects of single mode control and multi-mode control are studied. The application examples are finally given and indicated that this method has the characteristics of better suitability and high accurate.

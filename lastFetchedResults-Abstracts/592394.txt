Background: Determination of prevalence of celiac disease among patients with gastrointestinal symptoms was the main objective of this study. Other factors which cause digestive disorders in such patients were also studied. 
Materials and Methods: This cross sectional-descriptive study was conducted in Tehran province in 2006-2007; to conduct the study 5176 people were selected randomly. Out of them 670 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were tested to determine the amount of IgA and tissue Transeglutaminase (tTg). The amount of IgA tTG was measured in individuals with IgA deficiency. 
Results: Out of 670 patients, 427 (63.37%) and 243 (36.37%) patients were women and men, respectively; their average age was 42.5. Anti-tTG test was diagnosed positive in 22 patients (17 women and 5 men) (3.3%). Eight patients showed IgA deficiency. The result of IgG tTG test was found positive in three patients out of the abovementioned 8 patients. 
Conclusion: This study shows a high dispersion of celiac among Iranian patients with the gastrointestinal symptoms (3%). Routine serologic tests are recommended for diagnosing the unknown cases of sensitivity to gluten.

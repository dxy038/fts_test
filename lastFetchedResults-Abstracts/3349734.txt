The objective of this paper is to propose a new control strategy in the context of higher order sliding mode. In fact, the main result concerns a third order sliding mode controller which requires only the sliding variable and its first time derivative (whereas standard third order sliding mode controllers are using also the second order time derivative of the sliding variable). This reduction of the use of time derivatives is very important because it strongly reduces the noise introduced in the controller, and simplifies the controller application to real systems. The control strategy is experimentally applied to an electropneumatic system.

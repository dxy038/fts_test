This work is only a small part of the research carried out in the project: &#8220;Prediction, measurement and analysis of composite electromagnetic (EM) field of artificial radiation sources&#8221;, funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Srpska. The main objective of the project is to locate the representative measuring points for future monitoring network for continuous measurements and recordings of maximum levels of EM non-ionizing radiation, in the spreading center of Banja Luka area of about 10km<sup>2</sup>. Regarding that, previously was conducted verification with a software package used for a smaller area, by comparing the predicted and measured values of electromagnetic fields strength. For this purpose the pedestrian zones were treated, which are the surfaces and routes with the largest population flow. This paper gives a brief description of the research of EM radiation levels on the surface of 0.008km<sup>2</sup> in the frequency range from 50MHz to 3GHz.

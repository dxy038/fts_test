Cardiosmart project is based on a portable terminal for the acquisition, pre-processing and transmission of cardiac signals and the GPRS network (PAC) used to send the ECG signal to a host computer in the medical services provider centre or a specialist consulting room. The PAC terminal includes a GPRS modem for data transmission, a GPS device to provide an accurate location of the patient, and an intelligent heart pathology detection system. The objective of this project consists of the development of a European Cardiology On-line Monitoring System using GPRS/GSM wireless communication technology. The utilisation of electrocardiogram transmission will improve efficiency of medical care and service for patients if they could be monitored constantly by health care providers. A direct and almost instant medical support is provided, specially to those patients that vanish during a heart attack.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influential parameters for habitat suitability of PhrynocephalusPersicus in the region of Meighan wetland. This research was conducted for a period of one year from March 2010 to March 2011. During this period, geographic presence and absence points were registered with global positioning system (GPS) and then analyzed with ArcGis software. Moreover, the most important environmental and habitat parameters including temperature, humidity, and height from sea level, type of soil, type of vegetation, composition and density of vegetation at any location were documented. With respect to habitat parameters of this species, suitable habitats were recognized. Statistical data analysis by logistic regression led to the conclusion that habitat suitability has direct relation with temperature and a negative relation with height from sea level. In addition, bush and shrubs coverage and clay-Sandy with firm and stony soils have the highest effect on habitat suitability for this species. Finally, the validity of this model was approved by Area under Curve (AUC), Overall Accuracy and Hosmer & Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test

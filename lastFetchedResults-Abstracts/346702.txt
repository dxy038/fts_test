Objective: The present study was aimed to further address the general empirical question regarding the sensitivity of EEG correlates toward specific kinematic and/or kinetic movement parameters. In particular, we examined whether adding different inertial loads to the index finger, while a subject produced various amplitudes of discrete finger movements, influenced the movement-related potentials (MRP).
Methods: Our experimental design systematically controlled the angular displacement, velocity and acceleration (kinematic) profiles of finger movement while torque (kinetics) was varied by adding different external loads opposing finger flexion movement. We applied time-domain averaging of EEG single trials in order to extract three movement-related potentials (BP−600 to −500 BP−100 to 0 and N0 to 100) preceding and accompanying 25, 50 and 75° unilateral finger movements with no inertial load, small (100 g) and large (200 g) loading.
Results: It was shown that both inertial load and the degree of angular displacement of index finger flexion increased the amplitude of late components of MRP (BP−100 to 0 and N0 to 100) over frontal and precentral areas. In contrast, the external load and movement amplitude manipulations did not influence the earlier component of the MRP (BP−600 to −500).
Conclusions: Overall, the data demonstrate that adding inertial load to the finger with larger angular displacements involves systematic increase in activation across frontal and precentral areas that are related to movement initiation as reflected in BP−100 to 0 and N0 to 100.

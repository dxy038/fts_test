In the past decade, energy-efficiency has been an important system design issue in both hardware and software managements. For mobile applications with critical missions, both energy consumption reduction and timing guarantee have to be provided by system engineers to extend operation duration and maintain system stability. This research explores real-time systems composed of homogeneous multiple processors with the capability of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), in which a given task can be rejected with a specified value of rejection penalty. The objective is to minimize the summation of the total rejection penalty for the tasks that are not completed in time and the energy consumption of the system. This study provides analysis to show that there does not exist any polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the studied problem, unless P = NP. Moreover, we propose algorithms for systems with ideal and non-ideal DVS processors. The capability of the proposed algorithms is provided with extensive evaluations. The evaluation results reveal that our proposed algorithms could derive effective solutions of the energy-efficient scheduling problem with task rejection considerations

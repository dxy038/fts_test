If ubiquitous learning is to be effectively developed and feasibly applied to education, it is necessary to evaluate its effectiveness. Using fuzzy theory, the ubiquitous learning evaluation model is established in the paper. Evaluation index system is formulated which accords with ubiquitous learning and learners characteristics. Put forward subjective and objective weighting method to determine index weight and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method to get the final evaluation results. And on the basis of this model, the ubiquitous learning evaluation system is designed.

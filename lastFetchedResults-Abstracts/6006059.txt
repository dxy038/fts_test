This paper presents an optimized scheduling method, a planning strategy, and a frequency control method for a hybrid system supplying an isolated network. The hybrid system consists of a wind energy conversion system, a diesel engine generator, and a battery energy storage system. Minimization of the operation cost is the objective of the optimized operation. Consequently, emission of the system is minimized. The presented operation strategy is formulated and implemented in MATLAB using sequential quadratic programming. A planning strategy based on the optimized operation method is developed to choose between limited installed capacities of battery energy storage systems and wind energy conversion systems to minimize cost of electrification of the isolated network. In the last step, a frequency control strategy is developed and implemented in MATLAB Simulink. In addition to transient response of the system, the strategy is taking into account emission reduction of the system. The developed methods are validated by a set of simulations.

Inductive power transfer (IPT) systems significantly depend on magnetic coupling and coil characteristics. To achieve maximum coupling in case of an air gap and misalignments, different coil shapes were investigated. Based on this research a special orthogonal coil system and arrangement was designed. The magnetic design is presented along with FEM-simulations and measurements. With its mechanical structure the presented IPT system is positioning tolerant and interoperable with a huge variaty of car models. It requires a minimum of space while maintaining high flexibility and efficiency. Corresponding illustrations and analysis are provided to clearly show the design of a bidirectional resonant converter. Measurements of the entire system at full load (3kW) are made.

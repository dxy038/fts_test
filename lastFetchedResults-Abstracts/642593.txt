Objective
Total gastrectomy produces iron malabsorption and anemia, and several non-digestible carbohydrates promote mineral absorption. In this study, we examined the effects of feeding difructose anhydride III (DFAIII), a non-digestible disaccharide, on gastrectomy-induced iron malabsorption and anemia in rats in comparison with those of feeding fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS).
Methods

Sham-operated and totally gastrectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed the control, DFAIII (30 g/kg), or FOS (30 g/kg) diet for 4 wk. Feces and tail blood were collected at 2 and 4 wk to evaluate body iron status and iron absorption.
Results

Gastrectomy severely decreased net iron absorption, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit in the control dietary group. The decreased absorption in gastrectomized rats was restored to the sham control level by feeding the DFAIII or FOS diet. Iron absorption in sham rats was higher in the FOS and DFAIII groups than in the control group. Hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit in gastrectomized rats fed the DFAIII diet, but not the FOS diet, returned to levels comparable to the effects in sham rats fed the control diet. Feeding DFAIII increased short-chain fatty acid pools and decreased pH of cecal contents. These parameters for cecal fermentation correlated with iron absorption.
Conclusions

DFAIII feeding restores gastrectomy-induced iron malabsorption, resulting in complete prevention of iron-deficiency anemia in rats. Cecal fermentation of DFAIII may contribute to the improvement in these gastrectomy-induced defects. Feeding with low level of FOS did not fully improve postgastrectomy anemia.

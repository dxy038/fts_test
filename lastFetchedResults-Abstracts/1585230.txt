In this paper we study job scheduling performance in a partitionable parallel system. Jobs consist of parallel tasks scheduled to execute concurrently on processor partitions, where each task starts at the same time and computes at the same pace. The performance of different scheduling schemes is compared over various workloads. The impact of the variability of tasks service time is also studied. Various performance metrics are examined. The objective is to achieve good overall performance and also small scheduling overhead. Simulated results reveal that periodic job scheduling and also scheduling which depends on the number of job insertions in the queue can succeed these goals.

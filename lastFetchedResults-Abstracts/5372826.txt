The objective of this research work is to design and construct RFID tag for fish identification using RFID antennas. By logging on the identified data in PIC, it is more secure than other RFID devices. And also it is easily programmable and reliable method. In this work, tag´s data for fish identification are created in MS access database engine. ActiveX Comport is built on top of serial interface driver with Visual Basic programming language for communication from EEPROM of tag circuit to PC. PIC16F628 is used for commissioning identified tag´s data into EEPROM and modulating the tag´s data in EEPROM with 135 kHz carrier from the reader. PIC program is written in Assembly language. The best reading angle of fish identification data between the antennas of RFID tag and reader is measured by spectra analyzer. The experimental result shows that the minimum attenuation can be obtained at the reading angle of (0deg) and(90deg) than any other reading angles at the maximum readable distance of 30 cm.

Fusarium wilt is an economicallyimpor tant fungal disease
of common bean and sugar beet in the Central
High Plains (CHP) region of the USA, with yield losses
approaching 30% under appropriate environmental
conditions. The objective of this studywas to characterize
genetic diversityan d pathogenicityof isolates of
Fusarium oxysporum obtained from common bean and
sugar beet plants in the CHP that exhibited Fusarium
wilt symptoms. A total of 166 isolates of F. oxysporum
isolated from diseased common bean plants were
screened for pathogenicityon the universal susceptible
common bean cultivar  UI 114 . Onlyfour of 166 isolates
were pathogenic and were designated F. oxysporum
f.sp. phaseoli (Fop). A set of 34 isolates, including
pathogenic Fop, F. oxysporum f.sp. betae (Fob) isolates
pathogenic on sugar beet, and non-pathogenic
(Fo) isolates, were selected for random-amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) analysis. A total of 12 RAPD
primers, which generated 105 polymorphic bands, were
used to construct an unweighted paired group method
with arithmetic averages dendrogram based on Jaccardâ€™s
coefficient of similarity. All CHP Fop isolates
had identical RAPD banding patterns, suggesting low
genetic diversityfor Fop in this region. CHP Fob isolates
showed a greater degree of diversity, but in general
clustered together in a grouping distinct from Fop
isolates. As RAPD markers revealed such a high level
of genetic diversityacross all isolates examined, we
conclude that RAPD markers had onlylim ited usefulness
in correlating pathogenicityamong the isolates
and races in this study

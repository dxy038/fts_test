In this paper, the focus is on additive models with interval data.An additive model
can be converted to a multi-objective linear problem if information about preferences of
the consumption of inputs and the production of outputs are taken into account. Here
in this study, data are not exact and are of interval kind. Moreover, the most preferred
solutions with available information by interval additive models are sought. It has also
been shown that if additional information is available, an axial solution can be applied.
Also, the most preferred target settings will be computed too. In this study twenty bank
branches in Iran are evaluated, and target settings and efficiency are compared with the
original case and significant decisions are made.

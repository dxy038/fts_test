The objective of this paper is to design and implement an efficient and economical dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) to compensate for voltage sag conditions in oil and gas industry. In a power distribution system or plant facility, faults occurring can cause voltage sag that can affect critical loads connected in the power network. Due to the complexity and sensitivity of loads, a short voltage sag duration can still cause severe power quality problems to the entire system. The proposed DVR scheme is an inverter-based voltage controlled scheme, operating for low power application, which has excellent dynamic capabilities when connected in power distribution networks to mitigate voltage sag conditions. Installing the DVR between the supply and critical load will restore the voltage to its nominal value within few milliseconds, hence, delivering the compensated voltage to the load avoiding any power disruption. Modeling and simulation of the DVR has been conducted using Matlab/Simulink platform with the RMS detection technique and the Energy optimization DVR compensation methods for single-phase applications of low voltage for oil and gas industry. The presented concept has been validated through practical implementation of DVR using SiC MOSFET-based inverter.

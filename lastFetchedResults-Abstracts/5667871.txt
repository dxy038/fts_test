In the Repetitive High Energy Pulsed Power (RHEPP) module, pulse compression is done exclusively with magnetic switches (saturable reactors). Such switches have the potential of performing efficiently and reliably for &gt;10<sup>10</sup> shots. The objective of the RHEPP project is to explore the feasibility of using magnetic pulse compression technology in continuous high average power applications. The RHEPP system consists of a compressor driving a linear induction voltage added with a diode load. Construction and initial testing in a bipolar mode of the first two stages of the compressor have been completed. This system has operated for a total of 332 min (4.8&#215;10 <sup>6</sup> pulses) at full power (600 kW) with an efficiency of 94+/-3%. The first stage magnetic switch has a pulse compression factor of 8.4 (4.2 ms to 500 &#956;s time to peak). It has two parallel-connected, 67 n turns copper coils and a 760 kg core of 2 mil silicon steel with a magnetic cross sectional area of 0.065 m<sup>2</sup>. The second stage magnetic switch has a pulse compression factor of three (500 &#956;s to 170 &#956;s). It has two parallel-connected, 36 turn copper coils and a 361 kg core of field annealed 2605 CO Metglas with a magnetic area of 0.019 m<sup>2</sup>

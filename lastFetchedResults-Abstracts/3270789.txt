In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-efficient stereoscopic 3D broadcasting system named Service Compatible 3D-TV using Main and Mobile Hybrid Delivery (SC-MMH), which incor-porates fixed and mobile broadcasting services to provide 3D service without allocating additional bandwidth. By combining two existing broadcast networks, the proposed system provides high quality 3D services, fully guarantees backward-compatibility with the legacy fixed/mobile 2D receivers, and maximizes the channel efficiency. System structure of the proposed system and the objective evaluation that we conducted to find the optimum bitrate distribution are presented in this paper.

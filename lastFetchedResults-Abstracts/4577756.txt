Corrective maintenance (CM) is a big concern for both doctors and medical engineers; it has a direct influence on rising the unplanned downtime for the medical instruments. Our objective is to prove that by implementing a good scheduled maintenance program including Proactive, Predictive and Preventive maintenance will decrease the high cost in time and money contributed to Corrective maintenance and will lower unexpected machine faults dramatically. A comparison study between two groups of machines has been done. The 1<sup>st</sup> group is subjected to scheduled maintenance program and the second is left without a program, the result showed that the first group had a very low unplanned downtime, the second group had a high number of faults, thus a high unplanned down time.

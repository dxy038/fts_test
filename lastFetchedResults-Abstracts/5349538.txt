This work studies the symbol synchronizer based on a filter followed of a carrier PLL (phase lock loop). The filter is a bandpass filter, centered in an equal frequency to the data transmission rate. We will present four symbol synchronizers, the filter is equal for all them, but the PLL can be one of four types, namely the analog, the hybrid, the combinational and the sequential. The main objective is to study the four symbol synchronizers and to obtain their jitter noise curves.

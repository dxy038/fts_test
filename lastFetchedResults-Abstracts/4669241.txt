When asymptotically stabilizing a system under constraints, the objective is to find the maximal domain of attraction contained in the constraint set. In this paper, we show that if S is a domain of attraction for the exponential discretization of a continous-time system, S scaled by an appropriately defined factor is a domain of attraction for the continuous-time system and arbitrarily well approximates the maximal domain of attraction contained in the constraining set.

In this paper, a fuzzy production inventory model with resalable
returns has been analysed in an imprecise and uncertain environment
by considering the cost and revenue parameters as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.
The main objective is to determine the optimal fuzzy production
lotsize which maximizes the expected profit where the products leftout at
the end of the period are salvaged and demands which are not met directly
are lost. The modified graded mean integration representation method
is used for defuzzification of fuzzy parameters of production lotsize and
expected profit. An example is presented to illustrate the method applied
in the model.

<strong>Objective:</strong> we report a case of intraperitoneal urinary bladder rupture I week following normal delivery in a primigravida, who presented with huge urinary ascites, anuria and renal failure. Abdominal paracentesis and exploratory laparotomy was done and a diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture was made. The rent was repaired in layers. This may be preventable if adequate precaution in the form of evacuating the bladder before the patient goes into second stage of labor is undertaken.

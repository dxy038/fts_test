In distribution system, the subject of fault location has been of considerable interest for a long time. The objective of this paper is to develop Cumulative approach for fault location based on statuses of Fault Indicators (FI), Circuit Breakers (CB), Fuses and Fault Impedances from distance protection devices. This approach is using mainly graph theory algorithms and Area Marking Strategy to resolve fault diagnosis problem in electric power networks. Unlike neighborhood approach where one link only affects the marking of neighbor areas, cumulative approach marks all areas down the link. In many situations, cumulative approach may outperform neighbor approach.

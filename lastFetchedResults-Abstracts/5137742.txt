Sir J. Lighthill mathematical slender body swimming model formulates the biological fish propulsion mechanism (undulation) in fluid environment. The present research has focused on the relevance of Lighthill (LH) based biomimetic robotic propulsion. The objective of this paper is to mimic the propulsion mechanism of the BCF mode carangiform swimming style to show the fish behavior navigating efficiently over large distances at impressive speeds and its exceptional characteristics. The robotic fish model (kinematics and dynamics) is integrated with the Lighthill (LH) mathematical model framework. Comparative studies are undertaken between a LH model based and a non-LH based model. A comprehensive propulsion mechanism study of the different parameters namely the tail-beat frequency (TBF), the propulsive wavelength, and the caudal amplitude are studied under this framework. Yaw angle study for the underwater robotic fish vehicle is also carried out as it describes the course of the robotic fish vehicle. Inverse kinematics based approach is incorporated for trajectory generation of the robotic fish vehicle motion. Analysis of these critical parameters affecting the kinematics study of the vehicle vis a vis the real fish kinematic study [8] is carried out for a given trajectory. TBF is found to be the effective controlling parameter for the forward speed of the vehicle over a wide operating conditions. Performances and comparative results of propulsive wavelength and amplitude variations are also shown and discussed.

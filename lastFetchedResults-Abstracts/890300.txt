A consideration to how social security is achieved in a country, and subsequently
the way transformation is conceived in the area of security concepts
related to social security makes it necessary to redefine the concept
of security in a more precise manner. With new studies having been developed
in the area of social security, this article tries to answer this question
of what the ways are for realizing social security, and of what role the
hardware and software mechanisms will play in realizing the above objective.
To answer these two questions, the research hypothesis considers the
realization of social security as subject to optimization of both internal
and external control mechanisms. The present article addresses this issue
by beginning with the autopsy of concepts related to social security, continuing
it by explaining its factors in theoretical framework. It categorizes
the factors into macro and micro factors within two approaches, namely
opportunity building and threat building. Finally, it addresses the ways of
providing social security by studying the internal control mechanisms (in
both hardware and software form), and external control mechanisms (in
software form).

Background
erm survivors of testicular cancer (TC) who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A cross-sectional study was performed to objectively assess cardiovascular risk, subclinical atherosclerosis, and endothelial function in long-term survivors of TC.
s
erm survivors of TC underwent evaluation including determination of body mass index (BMI), Framingham relative risk (RR), brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood for levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs). TC survivors who received chemotherapy were compared with a chemotherapy naive cohort.
s
-four patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT) and 15 were chemotherapy-naive (CN). The CBCT cohort demonstrated more impairment of brachial artery FMD than the CN group (5.6% vs. 8.8%; P = 0.05). The mean sICAM was also found to be higher in the CBCT cohort compared with the CN group (P = 0.04). No significant differences between the groups were noted with regard to BMI, Framingham RR, carotid IMT, or hs-CRP. In a subset of patients, TC survivors who received chemotherapy had a significantly increased level of CECs compared with CN patients (P = 0.04). No significant difference in EPC levels was detected.
sions
erm survivors of TC who received chemotherapy demonstrate objective evidence of endothelial injury and dysfunction, a potential mechanism for increased cardiovascular risk.

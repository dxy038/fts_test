Citric acid has been reported to increase utilization efficiency of dietary phytate-bound phosphorus and protein. Objective of this study was to determine the effects of citric acid on growth performance and nutri-ent retention of broiler chickens fed diets having two levels of non-phytate phosphorus and rice bran. Giv-ing a completely randomize design in 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 144 broiler chicks in 48 pens re-ceived one of the eight experimental diets containing two levels of dietary rice bran (20% or 30%), citric acid (0% or 2%) and non-phytate phosphorus (0.25% or 0.35%) ad libitum from day 21 to 42. Retention of nitrogen, phosphorus, mineral and dry matter was determined using a total collection trial. Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio and weights of feather, liver, gizzard and pancreas were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by the levels of dietary rice bran, citric acid, or non-phytate phosphorus levels. Retention of nitrogen, phosphorus or dry matter were not significantly affected (P > 0.05) by the levels of dietary rice bran, citric acid, non-phytate phosphorus or their interactions. 2% citric acid improved the retention of min-eral with 30% rice bran compared to diets with 20% of rice bran. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in tibia ash when diet contained 20% or 30% rice bran. A significantly (P < 0.05) higher tibia ash content was observed when diets had 2% of citric acid with 0.35% of non-phytate phosphorus. It is con-cluded that 30% rice bran had no adverse effects on growth performance of broiler chicken from day 21 to 42. 2% citric acid produces no beneficial effects at dietary rice bran levels of 20 or 30% or non-phytate phosphorus levels of 0.25 or 0.35%.

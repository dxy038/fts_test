Forging of gas turbine blades needs a close control of the process parameters. These parameters require a suitable optimization method to achieve the best process conditions. This paper presents a hybrid method for the optimization of the forging process of an aerofoil blade. Forging process of the aerofoil blade was simulated using 3-dimentional finite element method. Preform shape and die parting-line angle are optimized in order to minimize the volume of the unfilled die cavity, material waste, and forging forces. The overall optimization scheme used in this research work includes a multi-objective approach that is a combination of response surface and finite element methods. The results show that the proposed optimization approach accrued to decrease the flash volume and the forging force of the aerofoil forging process. Therefore the proposed algorithm is a suitable method for the optimization of the gas turbine blade forging processes.

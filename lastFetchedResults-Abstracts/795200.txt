The comprehensive Islamic Epistemological system pays particular  attention to both individual and social issue with special reference to family affairs as well AS MATTERS WHICH HELP CONSOLIDATION OF FAMILY RELATION .It also challenges  issues  which destabilize family foundation. The  authors  tries  to make an effort  to remove partial attitude and by using  systematic approach  tries to analyze  its detailed objective  and introduce  the familial subsystem as a coordinated pillar of Islamic system also expressing  principle  governing  moral value of  family legal system, its applicability  and possibility  of its ignorance  in case of conflict  with other rules within the domain of family. It has to be noted that considering  merely  the legal perspective in family issue and ignoring its sublime nature  may break the family foundation apart. Therefore no power could govern  family  and  restore peace and tranquility ,but morale an d faith. Reinforcing morale value not only help strengthening family foundation, but may lead to social health and  prosperity. Without a doubt  reinforcing morale value does not mean ignoring legal aspect of family  issue.

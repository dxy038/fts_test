Nowadays network control systems present a common approximation when connectivity is the issue to be solved based on time delays coupling from external factors. However, this approach tends to be complex in terms of time delays and the inherent local phase missing. Therefore, it is necessary to study the behavior of the delays as well as the integration onto differential equations of these bounded delays. The related time delays needs to be known a priory but from a dynamic real time behavior in order to understand dynamic phase behavior. The objective of this paper is to show a way to include data frequency transmission and time delays that are bounded as parameters of the dynamic response from real-time scheduling approximation considering local phase situation. The related control law is designed considering fuzzy logic approximation for nonlinear time delays coupling. The main advantage is the integration of this behavior through extended state space representation keeping certain linear and bounded behavior leading to a stable situation during events presentation based on accurate data transmission rate. What is expected is to conform the basics local phase missing as result of local bounded time delays from the lack of tide synchronization as modeling approximation.

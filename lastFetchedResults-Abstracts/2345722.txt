The objective of the paper is to define a new method for the experimental determination of the Forming Limit Curves (FLCs). The procedure is based on the hydraulic bulging of two specimens. The most important advantages of the method are the capability of investigating the whole strain range specific to the sheet metal forming processes, simplicity of the equipment, and reduction of the parasitic effects induced by the friction, as well as the occurrence of the necking in the polar region. The comparison between the FLCs determined using the new procedure and the Nakazima test shows minor differences.

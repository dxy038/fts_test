Objective
lastoma is a common benign odontogenic tumour with inherently aggressive behaviour. Genetic susceptibility of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can likely predict ameloblastoma at risk patients but this data remains limited. Here, we studied XRCC1 polymorphism as a risk factor for ameloblastoma.

-two ameloblastoma samples and blood from 140 healthy controls were used to perform polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) for XRCC1 at codons 194, 280 and 399, and confirmed by sequence analysis.
s
e to healthy control, a significant increase was noted in the occurrence of polymorphism at codon 194 and 399 in ameloblastoma patients. At codon 194, tryptophan encoded by T, was the susceptibility allele showed an ODD ratio of (95% CI) = 1.62 (1.05–2.48), p = 0.027. At codon 399, glycine encoded by A was the susceptibility allele showing ODD ratio of (95% CI) = 1.83 (1.19–2.84), p = 0.005. Moreover at codon 399, we found AG as the susceptibility genotype (2.06 (1.14–3.72), p = 0.015). However, we did not find any significant increase in polymorphic occurrence in ameloblastoma patients at codon 280. For haplotype analysis of 3 codons, we found GGC as protective haplotype, and AGT as the risk haplotype.
sion
ta suggest that polymorphism at codons 194 and 399, likely contributes to the risk of developing ameloblastoma.

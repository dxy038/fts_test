The objective of the present study was to describe the characteristics of pediatric burns in order to prepare a program for the prevention of severe burn injuries in children. We conducted a retrospective study of burn victims aged 15 years or younger who were hospitalized in our Critical Care Medical Center between 1982 and 1997. There were 73 children with burn injuries hospitalized in our center during the study period. The greatest number were children 1 year old. The average % body surface area burned was 21.5Â±20.5%. The most important causes of pediatric burns were found to be hot bath water and other hot liquids. Hot bath scalds accounted for about half of the pediatric burns occurring in all age groups, and they were often extensive. Non-bath scalds accounted for about one-third of the pediatric burns and were most frequent in children 2 years and younger. All the injuries sustained at home occurred when a family member was in the house.
Similar to many reports from overseas, non-bath scalds were one of the most common causes of burns in this study; however, hot bath scalds were the most important cause.
These data are being used to develop a prevention program. We also consider it necessary to educate children and their family members about the dangers of burn injuries

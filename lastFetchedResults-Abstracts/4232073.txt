Objective world is a three-dimensional space world in which we are living. With a variety of observing systems in different forms and means of observation, what come from the objective world is a 2D image plane, although containing 3D object space information. Main research on stereo vision (more images) is to use imaging technology from the (multiple) images of objects in the scene to get the distance (depth) information. The paper is focused on the research, applications and summary of 3D Reconstruction based on stereo vision, we start with an review of stereo vision, and then we give an analysis of the application and direction of stereo vision. The paper is concluded lastly.

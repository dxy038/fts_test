This paper provides details about the lab and field experiments done for facilitating videoconferencing over cdma2000<sup>TM</sup>. We provide details about the lab setup, the experimental results obtained, and the different system parameters that can be tuned to provide a good videoconferencing experience over cdma2000. Objective results such as power expended and fraction of time the channel is utilized, as well as subjective results, like the quality of the videoconferencing sessions are reported. The experiments enable us to study key tradeoffs like the power and data rate used, and the experienced quality of the video session, for different channel conditions, FER targets, and RLP schemes. Results from these experiments indicate that a user can a have a good videoconferencing experience over cdma2000 with proper system settings.

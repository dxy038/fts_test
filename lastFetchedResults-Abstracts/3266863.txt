With the increasing rate of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) installed and the different Microgrids schemes implemented around the world, it has done necessary to develop intelligent and autonomous control strategies to deal with the power flow and load sharing requirements. In this document, a hierarchical controller based on a Multi-agents Systems (MAS) methodology applied to low voltage Microgrids is proposed. The control strategy designed regulates the active and reactive power flow in both operation modes: grid connected and standalone, where is located some local controllers designed with fuzzy logic. Global multi-agent strategy can reconfigure and synchronize the system under new load states, supervising the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) units providing bidirectional energy flow by managing the modulation signals. Different cases are studied in simulation demonstrating the methodology adaptability and flexibility control. Conclusions and future work are given.

We have addressed the problem of observability of power systems from the point of view of topological observability and using genetic algorithms for its determination. The objective is to find a way to determine if a system is observable by establishing if a spanning tree of the system that verifies certain properties with regards to the use of available measurements can be obtained. To this end we have developed a genotype-phenotype transformation scheme for genetic algorithms that permits using very simple genetic operators over integer based chromosomes which after a building process can become very complex trees. The procedure was successfully applied to standard benchmark systems and we present some results for one of them

A new algorithm for multi-sensor image fusion is presented. Based on lifting wavelet transform, the non-sampled lifting wavelet transform with the trait of shift invariance can be obtained by equivalently shifting to the pumping values and interpolation of the lifting wavelet transform. The adaptive weighted average method based on neighborhood gradient is applied to fuse the low-frequency coefficients and the weighted method based on edge information is chosen in the course of fusing the high-frequency coefficients. Then the fusion image can be obtained through inverse non-sampled lifting wavelet transform. Applying the proposed method to multi-sensor image fusion, the experimental results show that the novel algorithm is better than previous ones, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.

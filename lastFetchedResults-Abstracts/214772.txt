Objective-comparative evaluation of different surgical methods of vesicoureteral reflux induction in rabbits.
Design- Elective experimental study.
Animals- sixteen healthy male rabbits.
Procedures- sixteen healthy NewZiland White male rabbits were randomly divided in four equal groups. All rabbits were preoperatively evaluated with retrograde cystography for the presence or absence of congenital or acquired vesicoureteral reflux. Rabbits of group1 (control) without any manipulation were kept for comparing with other three experimental groups. Rabbits of group 2, 3 and 4 undergone open surgeries with unroofing the ureter with surgical blade incision of 3-5mm in length. In group two incised ureter left without suturing ureteral mucosa, in group three incised ureter sutured with nylon material 5-0 and
in group four ureter was incised with electrosurgical cutting blade without suturing mucosal layer to the bladder roof. Postoperatively on days 7th, 15th and 30th all animals in different groups undergone cystography for presence or abscence of vesicoureteral reflux.
Results- All the animals of group 1, 2 and 4 didn't show any reflux in double contrast cystography but in group 3 reflux in the form of bilateral and unilateral were observed clearly.
Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- Unroofing the ureter with surgical blade incision and suturing the incised margins can induce the successful vesicoureteral reflux for undergoing an experimental study of vesicoureteral reflux treatment.

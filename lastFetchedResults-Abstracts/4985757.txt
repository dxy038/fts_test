A central objective in designing Long Term Evolution networks (LTE) is to provide a better quality of experience for the end user. One of the implemented enhancements is a direct connection between neighbouring base stations through X<sub>2</sub> interface. This interface enables mobility management and the transfer of the userÂ´s data in case of a handover. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of user mobility on capacity planning and to provide an analytical model to dimension the X<sub>2</sub> bandwidth under certain performance objectives.

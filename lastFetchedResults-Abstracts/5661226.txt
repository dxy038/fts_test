A procedure that improves utilization of the knowledge of an expert in setting the operating parameters of an electrochemical machining (ECM) process. The procedure requires specifying and using a membership function for every input parameter of an ECM process. Failure to capture and use these membership functions explicitly may lead to improper selection of operating conditions, and thus to poorer workpiece quality and higher operating costs. The use of a membership function for every input parameter allows a process planner to become aware of the collective impact of input parameters on the support of an objective function, and to select a feasible and highly achievable goal for each of the objective functions. This additional information increases the ability of a process planner to analyze the process variations and to arrive at optimum value of machining parameters

At the present time 3D video technique has been attracting the attention of both academic and industrial world. Multiview video technique is a new 3D video formation technique which can be used in application like 3D televisions and also for entertainment purpose. Large numbers of views are required for such a display which results in increase of bandwidth. Thus multiview video compression scheme is introduced to reduce the amount of data that need to be transmitted. Multiview video is the video which is captured at same instant with some angular difference. Here the main objective is to efficiently compress video information required for such a display and also to improve its coding efficiency. 3D visualization created from multiview video contains lot of correlation, as same video is captured with some angular difference at same instant. Thus compression can be obtained by removing temporal redundancy present between successive frames within a video and also by removing redundancy present in neighboring video using interview prediction. In single view, redundancy is reduced by motion compensation and in multiview compression correlation is reduced by disparity compensation.

Two punch through injection structures are proposed, the first one for low voltage oscillation, the second one for low noise amplification to achieve the first objective N+ P II N+ structures have been realized which gave interesting results. The second objective has been achieved with a P+ N- N P+ structure which can give a theoretical minimum noise figure of about 5 db. Because of technological difficulties this structure has not been realized yet.

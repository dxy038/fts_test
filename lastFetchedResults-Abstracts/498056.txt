Background and objective: Rotaviruses are the most common factor of acute Gastroenteritis in children. Considering the high rate of mortality in developing countries, WHO proposed hospital-based Surveillance in order to identify the prevalent Genotype profile, witch is important for finding appropriate vaccine and performance of effective vaccinations program. This study conducted to determine VP7 Genotypes by RT-PCR method in hospitalized children in Tehran during 2005-2006 years.

Material and methods: In this study 260 stool samples of under 5 years old hospitalized children with sever diarrhea were collected. At first Group A of Rotaviruses were distinguished by Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) test and then the Genotypes of positive samples by using of 9 specific primers by Nested RT-PCR method were determined.

Results: Out of 260 collected samples, 91 were positive by ELISA. The frequency of Gi, G2 ,G3, G4 , Gg and G9 were %28.57, %18.68 ,% 3.30 ,%6.59, %2.18 and %7.69 respectively. Also, in this study frequency of mixed Genotypes and Non-typable samples %10.98 and %21.97 were determined respectively.

Conclusion: The frequency of Non- typable Genotypes indicates the necessity of using other primers and also determines uncommon Genotypes by means of other specific primers.

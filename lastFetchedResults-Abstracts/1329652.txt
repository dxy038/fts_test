Background & Objectives: Tuberculosis is one of the greatest health problems in Iran. The
distribution of the disease is not equal in all parts of the country. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the frequency of positive results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in samples referred to an
academic hospital in an 8 year period.
Materials and Methods: The samples from different wards of Qaem Hospital, Mashhad and
samples referred to Outpatient Clinic during the years 2001-2008 and 75 samples from the prison
in the same period were analyzed with direct microscopy of smear and culture methods for M.
tuberculosis. Basic descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS 11.5 software.
Results: A total 26817 samples were analyzed and the results showed that the frequency of
Mycobacterium positive samples in hospitalized patientsâ€™ samples was 2412 (9%) with microscopy
and 1573 (6%) with culture method. In the outpatients, it was 897 (10.2%) and 417 (4.7%) with
microscopy and culture methods, respectively. Form 75 samples from the prison, 9 (12%) were
positive with microscopy method. Culture method yielded only one (1.3%) positive result in these
samples.
Conclusion: The frequency of M. tuberculosis was relatively high in the study groups. Therefore it
seems continues surveillance is essential to monitor the M. tuberculosis in hospitals and community.

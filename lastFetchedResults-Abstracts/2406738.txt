Objective
Hypoxic insults are implicated in the spectrum of fetal disorders, including
cerebral palsy (CP). In view of the major contribution of intrapartum risk factors
and prematurity to subsequent neurological morbidity and mortality in humans,
this study aimed to clarify the pathophysiology of brain injury, especially
periventricular white matter damage (WMD), that occur in utero to the immature
and near-term fetal CNS.
Materials & Methods
An evaluation of the resulting neurological and behavioural phenotype in
the newborn was performed by utilising a battery of neurobehavioural tests,
including the Morris water-maze and the open-field test, followed by cerebral
MRI and histopathology.
Results
This study used a murine model to examine the deleterious effects of WMD
brought about by cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and the characteristic features
of CP in mice. Murine models have proven themselves valuable in the area of
experimental neuroscience.
Conclusion
Hypoxia-treated mice were observed to demonstrate a significant neurofunctional
deficit compared with sham mice on two behavioral measures. Indeed, different
brain regions, including the sensorimotor cortex, the striatum, and the
hippocampus were noticeably damaged after HI insult, as determined by both
MRI and histopathology. These results, albeit qualitative in nature, appear to
support the pre-existing finding that the long-term neurofunctional outcome in
animal subjects with CP is strongly associated with the anatomical extent and
pattern of cerebral damage as determined by both delayed neuroimaging and
histopathology.

This paper presents the work carried out on the modelling of vocal folds and the extraction of objective parameters which help the specialist to express a diagnosis based on something more robust than the observation of medical images. This study is specifically focused on measuring the glottal closure and opening angles in diverse pathologies. Therefore, different image signal processing techniques are used which provide the necessary tools for the implementation of an automated diagnosis software.

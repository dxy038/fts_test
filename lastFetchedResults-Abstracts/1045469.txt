The objective of this work is to utilize the commercial package CFD-ACE+ to build a three-dimensional computational model for piezoelectric fans, then apply the technique of Levenbergâ€“Marquardt Method (LMM) to estimate the optimal location of the piezoelectric fan to minimize the maximum fin temperature. The piezoelectric fan is originally placed in four different positions, namely, cases A, B, C and D, respectively; the LMM is then utilized to estimate the optimal location of the piezoelectric fan to increase its thermal performance. The simulations of numerical experiments show that for all of these four different original fan positions, the optimal fan position occurs at one position, at about 3.5 mm below the center point of the fin. Finally, temperature distributions of the fin with the original and optimal fan positions are measured using a thermal camera and are compared with the numerical solutions to justify the validity of the present estimation of the optimal fan position problem.

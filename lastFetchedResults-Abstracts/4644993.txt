Optimization model of nuclear emergency decision-making proposal is discussed in nuclear accident. Optimizing alternative nuclear emergency proposals is a multi-objective decision-making system. On the basis of establishing a hierarchic structure, an optimization model is developed by introducing fuzzy entropy weight and TOPSIS. The indexesÂ´ combined weights are calculated by both the entropy method and the experts grading method, which could not only make full use of the inherent information of indexes adequately, but avoid subjectivity by experts effectively. The alternative proposals are ranked according to the closeness between every proposal and the ideal proposal, which solves the decision problem of uncertain and fuzzy indexes in the optimization index system and could provide the decision-making basis for commanders in the process of nuclear accident rescue. The applied case study shows that the optimization result is reasonable and scientific.

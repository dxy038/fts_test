Background & Objective: Refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism) could lead to an impaired quality of life affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, irrespective of age, sex and ethnic group. Such refractive errors can be easily diagnosed, measured and corrected with spectacles or other refractive corrections to attain normal vision. Since there is paucity of information in school children in Iran we aimed to investigate the distribution pattern of refractive status and prevalence of refractive errors in school-age children in Shiraz
Methods: A random sampling strategy in geographically defined clusters was used to identify children aged 6- 15 years in Shiraz between 2008-2209. We carried out a school survey and actual eye examinations, including visual acuity measurements, stereopsis examination, anterior segment and eyeball movements, fundus examinations, and cycloplegic retinoscopy with 1 % cyclopentolate.
Results: Of 3065 selected individuals, 2683 were participated in the study (response rate 86.6%). According to cycloplegic refraction, 4.85% (95% (CI), 3.52 to 6.16) of the primary and middle school students were myopic and 4.64% (95% CI, 3.52 to 6.1 9) were hyperopic. For high school students, these rates were 22.1 9 and 1 1.4% respectively. Myopia and hyperopia were shown to be correlated with age. Prevalence of anisometropia, amblyopia and strabismus were 2.51%, 2.31 (95%CI 1.51-3.1 1) and 1.83% (95%CI 1.15-2.50).
Conclusion: Compared to other published reports, the rate of myopia in the school children of Shiraz seems relatively high.

The objective of this study is to provide an insight into the techniques for measuring the lability of heavy metals in solid-phase pool of soils in order to assess the environmental risk arising from pollution. The technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and a sequential extraction procedure were used to quantify the labile pools of Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni. These results were compared to metal concentrations in groundwater, measured directly using the in situ piezometers, and to the total concentration of metal in the soils. High concentrations of metal in the directly analysed soil solution compared to DGT measurement were attributed to the presence of colloidal metal. The use of DGT allowed only to calculate leaching parameters of the free ions and labile fractions of the metals. For this reason DGT technique needs preliminary investigation on metal speciation in soil solution before its application as a good tool in the characterization procedure of contaminated sites.

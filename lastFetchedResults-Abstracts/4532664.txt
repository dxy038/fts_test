In the recent years many applications were moved to Cloud and the Cloud computing became more popular. For being able to satisfy all the clients resource demands, the Cloud service providers are continuously increasing their data centers. The recent studies has shown that a data center can be very costly due to the energy power consumption so the cloud service providers may have issues in cost recovering. In this paper we propose a framework that aims to reduce the energy consumption of a data center. There are many resources that are not used at their maximum capacity or even worst, there are many resources that are not used at all. This research objective is to migrate some resources between different data centers in order to turn off some hosts that are not used. The cost can be reduced significantly if some hosts are turned off.

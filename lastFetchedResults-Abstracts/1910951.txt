Objective
te cancer (PCa) is the most frequent tumor in males in Brazil. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been demonstrated in the promoter region of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) genes and have been associated with development and progression of some cancers. In this study, our aim was to investigate a possible relation between polymorphism of the promoter region of the MMP2 gene and classical prognostic parameters in prostate cancer.
als and methods
c DNA was extracted using conventional protocols. The DNA sequence containing the polymorphic site was amplified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescent probes (TaqMan).
s
ients with tumors of a higher stage (pT3), a polymorphic allele in the MMP2 gene was more frequent (P = 0.026) than in patients with lower tumor stage. A polymorphic allele in the MMP2 gene was more frequent in Gleason ≥ 7 than in Gleason ≤ 6 (P = 0.042).
sions
clude that MMP2 polymorphism can be used together with pathological stage and Gleason score to identify patients with worse prognosis. Our results illustrate the potential use of MMP2 SNP as a molecular marker for prostate cancer.

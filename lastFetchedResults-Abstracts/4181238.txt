This article describes a multi-objective techniques, of identifying the best options among a suite of factors that influence the successful outcome of flexor-tendon repair. Our article begins with fuzzy-set development and relevant fuzzy-logic operations. Next, we consider multi-objective decision making with fuzzy logic, followed by the inclusion of core suture technique complexity and preference variations as decision considerations. Results are presented followed by a comparison and contrast of the soft-computing-based multi-objective decision making and Taguchi methods.

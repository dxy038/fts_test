This paper presents a new fault location technique based on synchronized phasor measurement. The main objective of presented technique is to rewrite the system equations in order to eliminate the current transformer CT requirements and achieve current independent equations. Theoretical analysis and simulation result indicate that accuracy of fault estimation is fault type independent and the difference between actual and estimated fault point distance is less than 0.6 percent of transmission line length in all case which is more accurate than other fault location techniques that presented in literature. EMTP and MATLAB simulation results have been performed to describe and validate proposed technique.

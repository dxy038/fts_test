To support the emergence of a solid knowledge base for analyzing Web activity, we have developed a framework to analyze and categorize the capabilities of Web sites. This distinguishes content from design. Content refers to the information, features, or services that are offered in the Web site, design to the way the content is made available for Web visitors. Both concepts have been operationalized by means of objective and subjective measures to capture features as well as perceptions.

This framework has been applied to study how different groups of companies are using the Web for commercial purposes. We have compared Web sites based on their source, industry, and size. On average, larger Web sites seem to be ‘richer’ and more advanced.

In this paper, a non-isolated three-port zero voltage switching bidirectional dc-dc converter without input current ripple. Some advantages of proposed converter are zero voltage switching of main switches, zero current switching of auxiliary switches. By using two active snubbers, it is possible to reduce circulating current and conduction losses. Free ripple condition of input currents is obtained by using coupled inductors in any stages that it reduces size of converter. The proposed converter can be used in boost, buck and buck-boost operation mods. If all of low voltage sources are equal or less than high voltage source, it is possible to increase the number of input sources to  as a kind of  -port converter. Finally, the zero voltage and zero current switching of switches and ripple free input currents of the proposed dc-dc converter is verified thruogh the simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC software.

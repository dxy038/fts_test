To support adaptivity of data parallel applications on multi-core platforms, we propose a framework based on the combination of OpenCL application auto-tuning and run-time resource management. The framework addresses computationally intensive multimedia OpenCL applications. For these target applications, we show that application auto-tuning, based on design-time analysis, can become synergistic with run-time resource management. In the proposed framework, run-time decisions are taken by each application, autonomously, to achieve system adaptivity. This paper describes the methodology and related toolchain, defined during the 2PARMA European project, based on the integration of independent tools to provide effective compilation of OpenCL code, multi-objective design space exploration, application monitoring and tuning and system-wide run-time resource management. Experimental results are reported for design optimization of an OpenCL stereo-matching application and then for a resource contention scenario where multiple stereo-matching applications are executed on the same platform with different run-time requirements.

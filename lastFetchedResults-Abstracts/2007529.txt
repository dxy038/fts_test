The main objective of this study was the determination of the mineral profile of 167 kaki fruit (Diospyros kaki L.) samples produced from different regions of Spain, including samples with the protected designation of origin (PDO) ‘Kaki Ribera del Xúquer’ Valencia (Spain). Samples were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Consumption of one piece of kaki fruit (200–400 g) would give a mineral intake providing 1–10% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium, 1–30% for copper and potassium, 1–15% from iron and magnesium, up to 1% of sodium, and up to 4% of zinc. ANOVA analysis indicates differences between samples from different Spanish region, thus offering a way for authentication of PDO sample origin.

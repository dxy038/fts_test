Revolution in IT industry has enormously increased the number of communication gadgets and now it can easily be done via wireless mediums, even while roaming into different places. Wireless communication infrastructures have adapted 3rd Generation Techniques to facilitate its users which include transmission security, voice and video services, user location identification etc. Massively advanced researches have been conducted for location tracking for wireless users that are helpful to provide user, information about different locations around them i.e. restaurants, hotels, sport club, bar, holy places, market. However there are cases when location privacy becomes the prime objective for example, preventing users from being used for some criminal activity. Various techniques have been adapted to prevent user location i.e. dynamically changing the interface identifiers, manipulating the received signal and time values, so as to obfuscate the attacker in long term movements. This paper possesses and idea to obfuscate the user´s location information by altering the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Identifier) value so the attacker (upon request) would receive the manipulated value and thus the user´s privacy could be preserved up to some extent.

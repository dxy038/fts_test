We consider a single-machine scheduling problem with periodic maintenance activities. Although the scheduling problem with maintenance has attracted researchersâ€™ attention, most of past studies considered only one maintenance period. In this research several maintenance periods are considered where each maintenance activity is scheduled after a periodic time interval. The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan, subject to periodic maintenance and nonresumable jobs. We first prove that the worst-case ratio of the classical LPT algorithm is 2. Then we show that there is no polynomial time approximation algorithm with a worst-case ratio less than 2 unless P=NP, which implies that the LPT algorithm is the best possible.

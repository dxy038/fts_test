Context and objective: Human trafficking, a crime which undermines the human rights and dignity, is growing rapidly and no country is safe in the path of this juggernaut. Abundant proceeds of this crime has been tantalizing for transnational criminal groups to enter this field. This paper is seeking to study the backgrounds to sanction of this law, and Iran's penal policy towards human trafficking.
Methodology: The objective of this paper is practical. The literature review has been piled up by library-based methods from original text-books, domestic papers, internet websites, and internal and international laws.
Findings: Before the Islamic Revolution, Iran's penal policy on this crime was bounded only to approbation of some international conventions and sanctions of a few laws. While after the revolution, there were many developments in this field; the most important of which has been the endorsement of the new law against human trafficking in 2004, which is originated from international acts, media and public pressures. Human trafficking is where human rights, penal laws, migration laws, and work-force laws become interconnected; and this makes it difficult to thoroughly study this crime and put policies to tackle them.
Results: Human trafficking is a great threat to human rights and dignity. The punishments which have been defined in the law approved in 2004 are not compatible with crimes. And not enough supports have been included in the law for the victims.

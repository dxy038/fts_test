In this paper, we demonstrate an approach that employs broadband optical sources, coherence multiplexing (CM) and coarse (1.3/1.55 &#956;m) wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Coherence multiplexing uses selective interference to discriminate between desired and undesired signals, and permits asynchronous multichannel transmission over a common optical bandwidth using broadband sources. Coarse WDM provides bidirectional transmission. The approach avoids the needs for wavelength stabilization and multichannel timing synchronization

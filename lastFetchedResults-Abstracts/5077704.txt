This work addresses the robust fuzzy control problem for discrete-time nonlinear systems in the presence of sampling time uncertainties in a visual-servoing control scheme. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is adopted for the nonlinear geometric model of a pin-hole camera, which presents second-order nonlinearities. The case of the discrete T-S fuzzy system with sampling-time uncertainty is considered and a multi-objective robust fuzzy controller design is proposed for the uncertain fuzzy system. The sufficient conditions are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The effectiveness of the proposed controller design methodology is demonstrated through numerical simulation, and then tested on an EVI-D31 SONY camera.

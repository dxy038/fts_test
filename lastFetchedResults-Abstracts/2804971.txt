A finite-element bidirectional beam propagation method based on Blocked Schur (BS-FE-BiBPM) is presented for the solution of quantum waveguides discontinuities. By using BSFE-BiBPM, scattering properties of electron waveguide discontinuities could be accurately calculated based on the 1-D time-independent Schro&#776;dinger equation avoiding the use of modal solution stage without affecting the accuracy of the results. As will be shown through the analysis of a quantum resonant cavity, a quantum directional coupler, and a quantum waveguide transistor, the suggested BS-FE-BiBPM is very accurate, versatile, efficient, fast and stable.

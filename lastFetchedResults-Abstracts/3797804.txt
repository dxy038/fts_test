Multiobjective optimization of shielding devices for eddy-currents is studied using several fundamentally different optimization methods. To solve the binary optimization problem of finding an optimal topology of the magnetic shunts a micro-genetic algorithm is used. In order to perform a parameter optimization of a given topology in terms of its placement, evolutionary strategies are applied. Finally, the multiobjective mixed binary-real optimization problem, with respect to both the topology and position of the magnetic shunts, is defined and solved using the micro-genetic algorithm. The conflicting objectives of minimizing Ohmic losses in the shielded body along with minimizing the volume of the shuntsÂ´ magnetic material are taken into account in two different approaches. On the one hand all objectives are transformed into a single scalar value using the method of weighted functions; on the other hand Pareto optimal solutions are evaluated and assessed. To ensure the reliability of the obtained solutions, the evaluation of the objective functions is based on the 2-D finite-element method eddy-current analysis using both self developed and commercial field solvers.

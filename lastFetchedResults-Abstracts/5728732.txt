This paper introduces the reader to "Snapper", a novel wave energy converter designed to increase relative velocities within the generator, thus creating the potential to reduce the size, weight and cost of the energy conversion system. "Snapper" is being developed under a &#8364;1.3million development grant awarded by the European Union\Â´s Framework 7 Programme (FP7). The objective of the project is to develop and validate a prototype "Snapper" system. This paper shares with the readers the "Snapper" concept with a focus on the development and validation of the "Snapper" machine and its corresponding grid interface system.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of a new platelet function analyzer in the detection of von Willebrand disease and platelet dysfunction in women with menorrhagia.
Study design
Women with menorrhagia and control subjects were tested with a platelet function analyzer. If the results were abnormal, further testing was performed for possible von Willebrand disease or platelet dysfunction. Results were compared.
Results
Of the 108 women with menorrhagia, 28 had an abnormal platelet function analysis results: 7 results were suggestive of von Willebrand disease; 17 results were suggestive of platelet dysfunction, and 4 results were inconclusive. Of the 100 control subjects, 18 subjects had an abnormal platelet function analysis result: 2 results were suggestive of von Willebrand disease; 12 results were suggestive of platelet dysfunction, and 4 results were inconclusive. The prevalence of suspected von Willebrand disease was 6% among women with menorrhagia and 2% among control subjects. Among white women, the prevalence was 10% compared with 1% among control subjects.
Conclusion
We demonstrated that the platelet function analyzer could be used to detect von Willebrand disease in women with menorrhagia

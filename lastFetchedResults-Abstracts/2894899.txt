This paper presents the system architecture of bidirectional communication for remote control of home devices. The system architecture is designed in view of the requirements such as feasibility for typical home users, scalability, and responsiveness of interactive operations. The proposed architecture, named Mediation architecture, features use of WebSocket and the hosting of connections from a home device and a user application at the same server to achieve low-latency communication. The experimental results obtained in a testbed environment indicate that the proposed system provides low latency that is practical for an actual service.

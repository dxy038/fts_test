ELViRA, the University e-learning network of Verona, has been growing, but its context also needs to be welldesigned. Thus, after the starting-up phase, intended to define the strategic planning and service models for the project, follow-up efforts will focus on service analysis. In this account we will describe the planning of these. To do this, we will identify a development structure and the required skills, and assign typical roles to them structuring the different activities of an elearning roadmap for an organization. The service analysis reported in this paper also addresses the costs involved, whereby cost drivers are identified and ranked according to their growth behaviour. The launching of a University e-learning centre is expected to provide a definite start to the implementation of the University e-learning policy. The first objective of the centre will be to support and to promote the activation of a series of pilot courses, thus focusing on content production and experimentation. Their online availability will be possible also thanks to the ELViRA network architecture, designed and structured according to security and stability requirements that prove fundamental in guaranteeing the continuity of the target e-learning services.

This paper is concerned with the mixed H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf> control problem. The purpose of this paper is to give an iterative algorithm for finding a sub-optimal static state feedback controller for the mixed H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf> control problem. The key idea of our algorithm is to construct two &#8220;controller sets&#8221;: one is a set of controllers that improve the H<inf>2</inf> norm of the closed loop map for a given controller and the other is a set of controllers whose elements satisfy the H<inf>&#8734;</inf> norm constraint. Using two controller sets, we propose an iterative algorithm. The obtained controller is either the global optimal solution if the H<inf>&#8734;</inf> norm constraint is satisfied until the H<inf>2</inf> norm of the objective closed loop map converges to the H<inf>2</inf> optimal value or a sub-optimal solution on the boundary of the H<inf>&#8734;</inf> norm constraint.

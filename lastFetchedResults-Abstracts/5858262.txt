Partitioning has been shown to be an effective method for synthesis of low power finite state machines. In this approach, an FSM is partitioned into two or more coupled sub-machines such that most of the time only one of the sub-machines is active. In this paper, we present a GA based approach for simultaneous partitioning and state assignment of finite state machines with power reduction as the objective. Experimental results obtained compare favorably with previous works on FSM partitioning, low power state assignment as well as using GA for partitioning alone.

Clinical pathways are widely adopted by many large hospitals around the world in order to provide high-quality patient treatment and reduce the length and cost of hospital stay. However, nowadays most of them are static and non-personalized. Our objective is to capture and represent clinical pathway using organizational semiotics method including Semantic Analysis which determines semantic units in clinical pathway, their relationship and their patterns of behavior, and Norm Analysis which extracts and specifies the norms that establish how and when these medical behaviors will occur. Finally, we propose a method to develop clinical pathway ontology based on the results of Semantic Analysis and Norm analysis. This approach will give a contribution to design personalized clinical pathway by defining a set of possible patterns of behavior and the norms that govern the behavior based on patient&#194;&#191;s condition.

Investigations into the role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in immune response have progressed well into a third decade, and indications of their use for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the adjuvant setting will be revealed in the near future when a randomized phase III clinical trial is completed. Additional ongoing and planned randomized clinical trials will test the efficacy of HSP-based vaccines in more advanced stages of RCC. This review describes the compelling scientific rationale behind testing HSPs in RCC against the backdrop of other immunotherapeutic approaches in this indication.

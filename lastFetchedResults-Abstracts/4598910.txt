An online web application called Student-Trade has been developed. It is a state-of-the-art platform for direct consumer-to-consumer trading in the Internet. The platform is targeted for direct consumer-to-consumer trading among university students. The items for trading include books, household items, electronics, housing rental, sports equipment and tutoring services. This paper is on the design intelligence of the Student-Trade web application. One objective is to help the user to decide on the selling price of his item when the item is being posted in the web application. The system integrates a hybrid neighborhood search algorithm for determining the price of sale item when it is placed for trading in the Internet. Data mining techniques are explored for efficient processing of a vast amount of information in the database tables. In addition, the trading system would also have the intelligence of recommending items or products to a potential buyer given the previous purchase patterns. The aim is to provide a pleasant trading experience for the user.

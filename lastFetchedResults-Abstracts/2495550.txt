Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antiinfl ammatory, antiinfective and
clinical properties of amniotic membrane (AM) when used for guided tissue regeneration (GTR)
in contained interdental defects.
Materials and Methods: A total of 30 subjects participated in this study. Two sites in each subject
were randomly assigned into each of the following experimental groups; test group: AM with
bone graft and control group: Bone graft only. Clinical parameters included recording site-specifi c
measures of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). The
levels of interleukin-1B (IL-1B) and human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) levels in gingival crevicular fl uid
(GCF) from the test and control sites were measured by using commercially available enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay kits. The evaluation of bone fi ll was performed by using digital subtraction
technique and morphometric area analysis. One-way analysis of variance followed by the post-hoc
test was used for intragroup and intergroup comparison. A P  <  0.05 was considered as statistically
signifi cant.
Results: Combination therapy using an AM increased bone fi ll and reduced PPD and CAL when
compared to controls. AM also resulted in a signifi cant reduction of GCF IL-1B levels and insignifi cant
increase in the hBD-2 levels.
Conclusion: From this trial conducted over a period of 24 weeks, AM demonstrated a marked
antiinfl ammatory effect and its use resulted in an improvement in periodontal parameters. AM
has the potential to function as a barrier for GTR and the unique properties associated with this
material can augment its potential as a matrix for periodontal regeneration.

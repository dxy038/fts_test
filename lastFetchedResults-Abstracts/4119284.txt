A two-user interference channel is considered where each transmitter has access to a part of the information intended to the other destination. A primary objective is to maximize the information rates, by exploring the cooperation between the transmitters for interference mitigation, based on the partial side information. It is clear that full cooperation between the transmitters is not possible since each transmitter has only a part of the side information. With this insight, several &#8220;layered coding&#8221; schemes, consisting of binning and superposition at different stages, are developed. These schemes are are carefully built on coding strategies for the classical interference channel and node cooperation mechanisms. In particular, two layered coding schemes, which are based on a combination of MIMO broadcast coding and the Han-Kobayashi (HK) coding, are thoroughly studied : The first one, namely layered coding with binning, makes heavy use of the Gelfand-Pinsker binning and the HK coding and the second one, namely layered superposition coding, involves superposition coding over different tiers. Rate regions corresponding to the proposed schemes are derived. Then the application of these coding schemes are illustrated for the Gaussian case and numerical results corroborate that the proposed layered coding schemes yield substantial gains at high SNR.

Focusing on combined cooling-heating-power cogeneration dispatching problem for microgrid with windphoto voltaic-gas mixed generation and exchange with the grid, this paper firstly presented an optimal energy dispatching model. Forecast errors of load, wind power and PV are modeled in probabilistic ways, the integrated forecast error is then transformed to the up/down constraints and ramping rates limits to controllable micro resources. All constraints are integrated into a new objective, and then the proposed optimal energy dispatching model is turned to the bi-objective optimization one. The particle swarm optimization is modified with simplex crossover operator perturbed in the solution process in order to avoid premature convergence of the algorithm and escape from the local optimum, to reach the global optimization solution. The numerical examples are used to testify the proposed model and algorithm and compare with the conventional approach. The results show the proposed approach has merits in reliability and economy.

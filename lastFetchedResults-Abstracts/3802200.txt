In order to improve the dielectric strength of gaps of nonuniform field, a field-optimization procedure has been devised with a view to relieving the stress on the most stressed regions of the gap. Up to a certain point, this objective may be obtained by simply improving the shape of the electrodes. An advanced degree of optimization is, obtained by introducing in the gap one or more conductive barriers of a given shape. When conductive barriers are used, the optimum positions and the optimum voltages to be attributed to each barrier are determined in such a way that maximum strength is obtained.

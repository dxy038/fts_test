The systematic investigation of the wave propagation characteristics of underground multiconductor power cable arrangements with special emphasis on the influence of the imperfect earth is the objective of this work. The propagation characteristics are derived through proper modal transformations from the per-unit-length parameters of cable arrangements, using novel, accurate formulas for the series impedance and shunt admittance earth correction terms. Different single-core cable arrangements are examined. The differences in the results between the novel method and existing methodologies are presented, showing the need to include the shunt admittance earth correction terms in the analysis of fast transient phenomena.

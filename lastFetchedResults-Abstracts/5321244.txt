The objective of this paper is to compare three well-known WDM network architectures (first-generation, single-hop, and multi-hop) when they are deployed to accommodate dynamic end-to-end connections with sub-wavelength transmission rates. The comparison is based on a performance figure that is uniquely defined to take into account the various architecture costs determined by the cost of the deployed network elements. The defined performance figure permits also to compare the three architectures for all possible line-to-node cost ratio values

A method of lightweight design based on material selection and structural optimization is developed for engine hood inner panel. Introduced the decision-making mechanism of multi-objective satisfaction degree to lightweight material selection, built the model of finite element analysis and computer experiment analysis of the strength, stiffness and modal properties respectively to the different lightweight material for selected, Programmed with MatLAB and realized the lightweight material optimal selection. Then performed topology structural optimization to the inner panel with the selected lightweight material properties, which realized the integrated performance improved to different level and the weight of the inner panel reduced by 30.4%. The case study of lightweight design based on lightweight material selection and structural optimization shows the feasibility and potential of the method, and it provide an reference for the lightweight design of car body.

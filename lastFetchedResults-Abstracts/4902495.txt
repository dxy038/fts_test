This paper introduces a new hybrid DC power supply equipment with the function of braking energy feedback, Which can be used to provide stable power for various kinds of motor drives. The parallel topology composed of diode rectifier and PWM converter are adopted. So the simplify and reliability of the diode rectifier, as well as the excellent controllability, high power factor and bidirectional energy flow of PWM converter, can both be utilized. The braking resistor used in conventional motor drive may be saved in this case. Furthermore, the output characteristic of diode rectifier is studied. A novel method is proposed to make the PWM converter acquire similar output characteristics like diode rectifier, by means of which the diode rectifier and the PWM converter can work well in parallel. The simulation and experiment results verified the main circuit and control scheme proposed in this paper.

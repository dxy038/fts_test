Economic and reliability issues are very important for consumers and effect consumer's decision making for electric power supplying. Also micro grid is new configuration of network for supplying consumer's energy demands. In this paper, four scenarios are compared to each other in case of economic issues and reliability. The four scenarios are providing energy by main grid, main grid and distributed generation resources, isolated micro grid and a micro grid connected to an upstream network.
The proposed objective function has two dimensions. Economical dimension consists of the initial costs and operational costs. Reliability dimension includes non-delivered energy (NDE) for the consumers. The two dimensional objective function is optimized for four scenarios by using weighting method. Each scenario is considered in two cases for evaluating reliability. First, the loads on one feeder and second is the loads on separated feeders. The proposed method is compared with a similar method and the comparison results show that it is more efficient and applicable

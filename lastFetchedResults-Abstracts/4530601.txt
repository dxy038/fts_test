Today millions of mobile apps are downloaded and used all over the world. Mobile apps are distributed via different app stores, such as the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store, the Windows Phone Store. One of the most intriguing challenges in mobile apps development is its fragmentation with respect to mobile platforms (e.g., Android, Apple iOS, Windows Phone). Recently, companies like IBM and Adobe and a growing community of developers advocate hybrid mobile apps development as a possible solution to mobile platforms fragmentation. Hybrid mobile apps are consistent across platforms and built on Web standards. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation into mobile hybrid apps. Our goal is to identify and analyse the traits and distinctions of publicly available hybrid mobile apps from end users\´ perspective. The study has been conducted by mining 11,917 free apps and 3,041,315 reviews from the Google Play Store, and analyzing them from the end users\´ perception perspective. The results of this study build an objective and reproducible snapshot about how hybrid mobile development is performing "in the wild" in real projects, thus establishing a base for future methods and techniques for developing hybrid mobile apps.

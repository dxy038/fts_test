In recent years, FACTS devices are recognized
as one of the most effective ways to improve power
system operation controllability and increase power
transfer limits. Gate-Controlled Series Capacitor (GCSC)
is one of these FACTS devices which is installed in series
with the transmission line. In turn, the supplementary
controllers are applied to FACTS technology to boost the
produced damping torque. Recently, evolutionary and
meta-heuristic algorithms have been extensively used to
optimize the parameters of damping controllers. In this
paper, on the basis of the linearized Heffron-Phillips
model of a single machine power system with GCSC, the
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to
design a lead-lag damping controller for the GCSC. A
time domain and an undamped eigenvalue based
objective functions are employed as two different fitness.
To verify the robustness of the proposed controllers,
various operating conditions are simulated due to a severe
disturbance. Observing and analyzing the results reveals
appropriate performance of this controller in damping the
power system oscillations and enhancing the dynamic
stability. Moreover, the undamped eigenvalue based
fitness is superior to time domain based one.

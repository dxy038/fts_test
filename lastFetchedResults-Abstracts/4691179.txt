This paper discusses the network reconfiguration at the power distribution systems with dispersed generations (DG) for loss reduction. The power distribution systems have a radial network and unidirectional power flows. With the advent of dispersed generations, the power distribution systems have a locally looped network and bidirectional power flows. Therefore, DG into the power distribution system can cause operational problems and impact on existing operational schemes. There are several operational schemes in power distribution systems. One of these operational schemes is network reconfiguration, which is defined as altering the topological structures of distribution feeders by changing the open/closed states of the sectionalization and the switches. However, with the introduction of DG in power distribution systems, this increases the complexity of this problem. In this paper, an operational scheme is presented which uses network reconfiguration at the power distribution systems with DG as real-time operation tool for loss reduction. The solution procedure is illustrated on simple examples

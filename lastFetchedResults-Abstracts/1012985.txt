Abstract
Introduction: Previous investigation of microprocessor-Controlled knee joints have reported mixed results, ranging from data showing when using a microprocessor-controlled  knee  joint  during level walking,  improved gait symmetry, a reduction of the amputeeâ€™s metabolic  energy consumption and load pattern on prosthetic and sound limbs. In contrast, some investigators suggest there is no difference at all when compared to conventional knee mechanism. It is controversial weather using these joints improves the performance of amputees or not. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to review the literature about microprocessor knee joints and evaluation of stability, energy consumption and gait performance in transfemoral amputees.
Materials and Methods: Medline, ISI web of knowledge and PubMed data bases were searched to identify relevant studies within 1999-2012 time range. After screening and categorizing, papers were assessed for methodological quality and sorting based on these terms: stability, energy consumption and gait performance.
Results: A total of 22 articles were determined to be pertinent: energy consumption 6, Gait 8, Stability 7 and 1 review article.
Conclusion: The reported results are not sufficient to objectively determine the benefits of the microprocessor-controlled knee as most of the reported studies are related to the Intelligent Prosthesis (IP) by Blatchford. Objective evidence is needed to determine if there is significant benefit when prescribing expensive microprocessor-controlled knee mechanisms over high-performance passive knee units that cost significantly less.
Keywords: Above knee amputees, prostheses, knee prosthetic mechanism, energy consumption stability, gait, C-leg.

Pilot studies are presented whose objective is to explore the decision processes of groups using a distributed group support system. Some of the difficulties inherent in attempting to replicate an experiment are discussed. Using a different collaborative system as the technological platform, differences in system design, population characteristics and other environmental factors affect perceptions of the groupÂ´s members and can yield different research findings

This paper considers the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem (RCMPSP) and makespan minimization as objective. We present a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to solve this problem. The particle representation is based on precedence feasible of activities list. Based on the particle representation, a new update method based on one-point crossover is proposed. The framework of PSO for the RCMPSP according to the representation and the update method is developed. We test the algorithm, and the experimental results show that our PSO outperforms other heuristic methods.

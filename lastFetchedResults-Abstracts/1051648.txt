Background:Students experience different emotions in academic settings and these emotions highly affect their learning motivation, performance, andalso health. However, the process of research on these areas is slow, probably because of the lack of appropriate instruments.In response to this deficit, Pekrun et al (2011) developed a self-report instrument to measure various achievement emotions that students commonly experience in academic settings (Achievement Emotions Questionnaire, AEQ). The instrument contains scales for measuring enjoyment, hope, pride, anger,relief, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom in class, learning and test contexts. Objective: The purpose of the present research was to investigate the psychometric propertiesof the Persian version of the AEQ among Iranian universitystudents. Method:First, the AEQwas translated into Farsi. After the pilot study was done and the errors were resolved, the questionnairewas conducted in a sample group consisting of 423 students in humanities atthe Payame Noor University of Tabriz. In this study, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and the Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Test were used to analyze the collected data. Results:The results showed that the AEQ scales have acceptable reliability. Moreover, the results of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that most of the questionnaire scales acceptably fit the data. Conclusion: The results of the study indicated that the Persian version of the AEQ is a reliable and valid measuring instrument that can be used for the purposes of research and counseling.

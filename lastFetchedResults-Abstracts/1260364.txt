 There are various methods to evaluate voice parameters. Original software was used to assess the voice quality by the staff of AUDIO-Fon centr Brno, Czech Republic. A group of hereditary deaf persons was examined. Deaf persons have all of the biological conditions to make voice except for the possibility of acoustic feedback. We examined the voices of 35 persons (20 men and 15 women) with hereditary profound hearing impairments, and we compared voice parameters with the voice of intact persons. To measure we used special software called voice field measurements (VFMs). The program graphically records voice frequency and intensity. VFM is an objective method that enables the assessment of basic physical voice characteristics. It is suitable for the examination of both intact and disturbed voice. The voice of the deaf has a higher basic voice frequency in men as well as in women. This type of voice production, ie, childlike voice, which is fixed only by a motor stereotype, is much more demanding for a mature larynx. Hearing influences both the voice development and speech production. The voice of persons with hearing impairments has a higher basic voice frequency regardless of their sex. This type of voice production, which is fixed only by a motor stereotype, ie, child voice, is much more demanding for a larynx of an adult. Thus, phonation of deaf people is more demanding and their voice production needs greater effort. Deaf people, despite an intact phonic apparatus, cannot produce more than one type of voice. They cannot modulate their voices concerning the frequency and dynamics. They cannot change their voices continually. The voice is limited in both of these parameters (frequency and dynamics). If a deaf person wants to change a voice characteristic, it is possible only by discontinuous changesâ€”â€œskipping.â€‌

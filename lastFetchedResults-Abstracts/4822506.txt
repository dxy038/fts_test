A study on the reverse current phenomenon in synchronous rectifiers is presented in this paper. For loss reduction, the synchronous rectifiers composed of MOSFETs have recently been employed to replace the conventional rectifiers with diodes in low voltage and high current applications. Because the MOSFETs in the synchronous rectifiers are used as bidirectional switches, reverse current flow will probably occur. The reverse current phenomenon will cause undesired loss. To clarify the effects of reverse current on the forward converter with synchronous rectifier, both the experiment and the analysis are performed in this research

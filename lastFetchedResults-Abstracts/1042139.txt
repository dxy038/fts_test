The turbulent natural convection of air flow in a confined cavity with two differentially heated side walls is investigated numerically up to Rayleigh number of 1012. The objective of the present work is to study the effect of the inclination angle and the amplitude of the undulation on turbulent heat transfer. The low-Reynolds-number k–ε, k–ω, k–ω–SST RANS models and a coarse DNS are used and compared to the experimental benchmark data of Ampofo and Karayiannis [F. Ampofo, T.G. Karayiannis, Experimental benchmark data for turbulent natural convection in an air filled square cavity, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 46 (2003) 3551–3572]. The k–ω–SST model is then used for the following test-cases as it gives the closest results to experimental data and coarse DNS for this case. The mean flow quantities and temperature field show good agreement with coarse DNS and measurements, but there are some slight discrepancies in the prediction of the turbulent statistics. Also, the numerical results of the heat flux at the hot wall are over predicted. The strong influence of the undulation of the cavity and its orientation is well shown. The trend of the local heat transfer is wavy with different frequencies for each undulation. The turbulence causes an increase in the convective heat transfer on the wavy wall surface compared to the square cavity for high Rayleigh numbers. A correlation of the mean Nusselt number function of the Rayleigh number is also proposed for the range of Rayleigh numbers of 109–1012.

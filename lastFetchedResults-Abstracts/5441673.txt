The conflicts between traffic entities play an important role in reducing traffic efficiency. The delays from conflicts that exist between vehicles or vehicles and pedestrians are often ignored when a time-cost function is employed into route choice models in a traditional path-based traffic assignment. A lane-based network model is developed to depict the conflicts leading to the deceleration of vehicles when they are changing lanes. The minimum of conflict delays are taken into consideration as one part of the objective function in the proposed optimum route choice model. The path-based and proposed lane-based models are comparatively used to assign traffic demand in a major-minor road system through case studies.

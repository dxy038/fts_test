Objective
is a concern about negative cognitive effects of systemic chemotherapy. We prospectively explored self-reported cognitive problems in testicular cancer patients (TCPs) treated with and without chemotherapy.
s
ndred and twenty-two TCPs were interviewed about concentration and memory problems shortly after orchidectomy but before any additional treatment (baseline), and then at a median of 1 year after end of treatment (follow-up). Symptoms of psychological distress, fatigue, and peripheral neurotoxicity were assessed by questionnaires, and patients also underwent neuropsychological testing. Self-reported cognitive problems were compared between three treatments groups: no chemotherapy, one cycle of chemotherapy, and multiple cycles of chemotherapy. Variables associated with an increase of self-reported cognitive problems from baseline to follow-up were explored.
s
icantly larger proportions of TCPs in the two chemotherapy groups had an increase of self-reported cognitive problems from baseline to follow-up compared to the no-chemotherapy group. Increase of self-reported cognitive problems was significantly associated with psychological distress, fatigue, lower level of education, and Raynaud-like symptoms, but not with a decline in neuropsychological test performance.
sion
s explorative study of TCPs, an increase of self-reported cognitive problems from baseline to 1-year follow-up was associated with chemotherapy and with symptoms of fatigue and psychological distress at follow-up, while no significant association was found with a decline in neuropsychological test performance.

This paper presents a new general mathematical programming model for the optimal retrofit of material conservation networks considering recycle, reuse and regeneration schemes (notice that most of the previously reported methods only have considered the synthesis case, and nowadays it is very important to have strategies for the retrofit of water networks because several existing water network are functioned under suboptimal conditions because these were synthesized using inefficient approaches or because the process and environmental constraints have changed). The model considers the reconfiguration of existing networks to satisfy stricter process and environmental constraints considering the repiping for the network, the reuse of the existing treatment units, the modification for the capacity and performance of the existing units and the installation of new treatment units to reduce the overall operating cost through the reduction of the use of fresh sources. The objective function accounts for the minimization of the total annual cost associated to the retrofit process. This retrofit process involves simultaneously economic (because the reduction of the fresh sources costs) and environmental (because the reduction of the waste streams discharged to the environment and with a better quality) improvements. The applicability of the proposed model is proved through a set of example problems addressed, where no numerical complications were observed. In addition, the proposed approach is general and it can be applied to any specific case with the information required.

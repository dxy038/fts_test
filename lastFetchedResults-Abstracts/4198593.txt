This paper presents an optimization method of fault indicator placement by genetic algorithms. Requirements such as the network structure with switchgear system, reliability factor, economic parameters and fault localization by switchgear can be taken into account in an objective function to minimize. The influence of dispersed generation, inserted in the distribution network, on the fault indicator placement is also carried out. The tool created provides help to select the optimal fault indicator placement in the network following different objectives.

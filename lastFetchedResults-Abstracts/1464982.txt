The objective of this study was the development of affinity adsorbent particles with the appropriate characteristics to be applied in protein purification using the affinity ultrafiltration method. To prepare affinity macroligands Cibacron Blue 3GA, as a ligand molecule, was immobilized by covalent bonding onto yeast cell walls, the support material or matrix. The maximum attachment of the ligand to the matrix was 212 Î¼mol/g (ligand dry weight/yeast dry weight). Lysozyme was selected as the protein model for the adsorption studies. Its adsorption onto the matrix without ligand and matrix with attached ligand were investigated batch-wise. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms appeared to follow a typical Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of the Cell-Cibacron macroligand for lysozyme was 110 mg/ml of wet macroligand. The adsorbent was also employed for the separation of lysozyme from hen egg white. High purity lysozyme was obtained.

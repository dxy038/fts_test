A modified CPW-fed bow-tie slot antenna is proposed; it has a wider impedance bandwidth than that of the conventional CPW-fed bow-tie slot antenna. The antenna structure remains simple and the better impedance matching is obtained through the insertion of a 180-degree delay slotline between the feeding CPW and one of the two parts of the bow-tie slot. A 47.4% impedance bandwidth, 2.3 to 5.1 dBi in-band antenna gains, and broadside bidirectional radiation patterns are measured and presented for an H-band prototype antenna.

In this study a safe and smooth path planning containing the slightest risk is considered for an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV). To do so, three smooth and continuous functions resembling the three dimensional path are introduced and then their parameters are optimized using the particle swarm optimization method to find the safest possible path. For each point in space a numeric value is considered as vulnerability and the objective function is the integral of the vulnerability over the path produced. This path forms controlling signals which, through a TSK fuzzy controller, the UUV is guided. The new arrangement of the propulsion vehicle subsurface was modeled. Since for the design of the controller the parameters of the Under Water Vehicle dynamic system is not used, the control system is robust with respect to parameter uncertainties. In the last section three environments with different complexities are considered to illustrate the creating processâ€™s performance of the path and it is concluded that this method demonstrates desired performance in the development of a safe and smooth path through a harmful environment and design of an adequate controller.

A valid questionnaire which was designed by expert cardiologists was used. The T-test and ANOVA were used for data analysis, and p<0.05 was considered as the significant level.Results: Among 165 subjects, there was 118 (71.5%) males and 102 patients (61.8%) had Anterior Ml. 61 patients (37%) reported cardiac prodromal symptoms and 43 patients (26.1%) reported systemic prodromal symptoms. The most common cardiac prodromal symptom 2 days before AMI was chest pain in the right and left hemithorax (24.2%), and the most common systemic prodromal symptom was loss of appetite (12.7%). Women reported more cardiac (p=0.04) and systemic (p=0.00) prodromal symptoms than men.

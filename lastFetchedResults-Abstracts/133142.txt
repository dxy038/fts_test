Background: Basic sciences are the most important examinations of medical students, which can assess their abilities in passing the general medicine.
Objective: This research has described some important factors, which are related to the exams.
Methods: This analytic study was done in 2001 on 206 medical students who participated in the exam, from August 1999 to February 2000. For the analysis, the total mean and the scores of 10 courses of the basic sciences together with the final score and some demographic factors were collected. To analyze the data, Chi-square and unpaired t-test where used together with relative risks (RR).
Findings: The failed students were 41 (20%). RR of failing for students with non-regional quota system, high age, married, period of more than 5 semesters and the mean of Less than total mean in the basic sciences, were 3.5, 2.9, 2.1, 3.4, 12.7 respectively. The RR for students with weak score in physiology 2, microbiology and parasitology were 10.8, 6.0, 5.5 respectively. All the RRs are significant as well.
Conclusion: The variables of age, marital status, quota system, mean and period of basic sciences together with the score of microbiology, parasitology and physiology 11 are the most effective factors in the result of the exams.

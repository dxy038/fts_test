This paper takes place in the field of passive microwave components. The requirements of mobile communication devices are today invariably associated with the miniaturization of microwave components. Aimed at this objective, DIOM laboratory (in collaboration with RADIALL Company and INL laboratory) works on the development of a miniature planar circulator. The circulator is designed with coplanar waveguides. The structure is analysed by using a three dimensional finite-element method. As a result, a 9 GHz device with insertion loss of 0.85 dB and isolation of 20.06 dB has been designed.

The dispatch of air conditioner direct load control (DLC) using multi-pass dynamic programming (MPDP) methods is presented. The objective of this work is to schedule the control of air conditioner load by MPDP methods such that the peak load reduction and production cost saving have optimum results for the whole study period. The algorithm can quickly converge to an optimal schedule. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, results of a sample study on the Taiwan Power Company power system are described in this paper

Objective(s): In the present study, we investigated the effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on c-myb immunoreactivity as well as neuronal damage/death after a subsequent lethal transient ischemia in gerbils.
Materials and Methods: IPC was subjected to a 2 min sublethal ischemia and a lethal transient ischemia was given 5 min transient ischemia. The animals in all of the groups were given recovery times of 1 day, 2 days and 5 days and we examined change in c-myb immunoreactivity as well as neuronal damage/death in the hippocampus induced by a lethal transient ischemia.
Results:A lethal transient ischemia induced a significant loss of cells in the stratum pyramidale (SP) of the hippocampal CA1 region at 5 days post-ischemia, and this insult showed that c-myb immunoreactivity in cells of the SP of the CA1 region was significantly decreased at 2 days post-ischemia and disappeared at 5 days post-ischemia. However, IPC effectively prevented the neuronal loss in the SP and showed that c-myb immunoreactivity was constitutively maintained in the SP after a lethal transient ischemia.
Conclusion: Our results show that a lethal transient ischemia significantly decreased c-myb immunoreactivity in the SP of the CA1 region and that IPC well preserved c-myb immunoreactivity in the SP of the CA1 region. We suggest that the maintenance of c-myb might be related with IPC-mediated neuroprotection after a lethal ischemic insult.

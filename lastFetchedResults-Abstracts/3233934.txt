There exist many problems encountered in Mobile Networks such as security, energy, bandwidth and routing problems. All these problems are caused by the high mobility of nodes. The objective of this paper is to propose a new way for nodesÂ´ mobility measuring based on OLSR Protocol. The parameter used in the formula of nodes mobility calculation in the Mob-OLSR protocol is automated witch introduce a new version of Mob-OLSR called Mob-2-OLSR. This version helps improving the network performance. The impact of mobility and pause time on the behavior of the three versions of OLSR protocol: standard OLSR, Mob-OLSR, and Mob-2-OLSR is also examined.

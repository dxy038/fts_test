In a system formed by hundreds of sensors deployed in a huge area it is important to know the position where every sensor is. This information can be obtained using several methods. However, if the number of sensors is high and the deployment is based on ad-hoc manner, some auto-locating techniques must be implemented. In this paper we describe a novel algorithm based on fuzzy logic with the objective of estimating the location of sensors according to the knowledge of the position of some reference nodes. This algorithm, called LIS (Localization based on Intelligent Sensors) is executed distributively along a wireless sensor network formed by hundreds of nodes, covering a huge area. The evaluation of LIS is led by simulation tests. The result obtained shows that LIS is a promising method that can easily solve the problem of knowing where the sensors are located.

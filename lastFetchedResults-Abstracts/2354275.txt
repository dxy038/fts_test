Objective: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease. Immunological
factor may act as etiological factor. The cellular immune cells such as T cells are important
in pathogenesis. Interferon gamma (IFN-?) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) are secreted by
T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th2, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation
between salivary levels of IFN-? and IL-4 with OLP.
Materials and Methods: This case control study included sixty three Iranian OLP patients
who were selected from the Department of Oral Medicine of Ahvaz Jundishapur University
of Medical Sciences from January to July 2013. An equal number of healthy volunteers
were also selected as a control group. The OLP patients were then divided into two following
sub-groups: reticular (n=30) and erythematous/ulcerative (n=33). All patients had no
systemic disease and received no medication. IFN-? and IL-4 levels in whole unstimulated
saliva (WUS) were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
test. Data analysis was done using t test, ANOVA, least significant difference (LSD) test,
and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Results: Reticular OLP patients showed higher salivary IFN-? (7.74 ± 0.09 pg/ml )
and IL-4 (3.876 ± 0.05 pg/ml) levels compared with the control group, indicating that
difference was significant. Salivary IFN-?/IL-4 ratio significantly increased compared
with control group (P=0.042). Salivary IFN-? and IL-4 levels between sub-groups (reticular
and erythematous/ulcerative) were not significantly different (2.6 ± 0.06 and 2.3
± 0.05, respectively, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Salivary IFN-? and IL-4 levels were increased in OLP patients. An increase
of salivary IFN-?/IL-4 ratio in OLP patients showed that Th1 might have a dominant role in
the OLP pathogenesis.

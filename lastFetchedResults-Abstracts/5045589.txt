The continuous improvement of social practical production demands modern motor controlling technology. PMSM has been widely applied to those occasions of high performance because of its excellent performance. However, there are large flux linkage and torque ripples and inconstant switching frequency in the conventional DTC. To solve these problems, PMSM DTC using SVPWM based on the subdivision of space voltage vectors was proposed, in which the calculation of objective space voltage vector was realized by introducing the thought of prediction. This control system was modeled and simulated in Matlab/Simulink, and experimental study was carried on the fully digital platform based on DSP TMS320F2812. Both simulation and experimental results show the validity of the proposed DTC system. Besides, the system can effectively reduce flux linkage and torque ripples with better dynamic and steady performance.

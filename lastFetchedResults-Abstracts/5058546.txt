The objective is to develop a control system that will enable the Membrane Distillation Bio-Reactor (MDBR) water recycling plant to become self sufficient and fully automatic. In order to ensure continuous operation, the control system must maintain conditions required for the micro-organisms to survive. These requirements need to be met even when solar radiation and weather conditions are not conducive for water production. Hence, maintenance of a back up reserve is necessary. A balance has to be struck between minimization of power consumed and maximization of output produced to facilitate smooth operation. Control is implemented through a hierarchical framework that keeps track of the different plant objectives. Operational set points are determined through convex steady state optimization. Current set points are based on predictions regarding variation in solar radiation within the planning horizon.

Background and Objective: Measurement of Maximum aerobic capacity (VO2-max) is important in physiologically fitting the job to the worker. This study was conducted to estimate VO2-max of industrial workers and to determine its demographic associated factors.

Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 184 randomly selected male workers of industrial sector of Sepidan/Fars province participated. A questionnaire consisted of two parts was used as data collecting tool. The first part was related to workers' demographic characteristics which was completed by interview. In the second part of the questionnaire, the value of the measured variables including height, weight, BMI and pulse rate were entered. VO2-max was measured by Tuxworth & Shahnavaz method. To investigate association between demographic variables and VO2-max, linear regression analysis was applied. T-test was used to compare mean value of VO2-max in different groups (based on the variables studied).

Results: Workers' aerobic capacity was estimated to be 2.66Â±0.35 Lit/M. The results showed that there was no association between VO2-max and age while associations were found between VO2-max and weight as well as height and BMI. Statistical analysis revealed association between VO2-max and smoking. The results also demonstrated that VO2-max was higher among those workers who exercised as compared with other workers with no exercise (p=0.019). Shift working, job satisfaction, and fatigue had no association with aerobic capacity.

Conclusion: Aerobic capacity had association with weight, height, BMI, exercise and smoking. Sci Med J 2011; 10(1): 1-12

This paper presents a new problem formulation for allocation of high-temperature superconducting fault current limiter (HTS-FCL) in power systems for security and stability enhancement. A dynamic current-dependent model for HTS-FCL is developed using PSCAD/ETMDC. The proposed formulation includes three functions related to security, voltage stability, and rotor angle stability which represent key features of deploying the HTS-FCL. The three functions were combined into a multi-objective function, and the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and optimal FCL locations are determined using particle swarm optimization. The optimal FCL locations for the New-England 39-bus system are determined, and the system transient performance is validated using MATLAB and PSCAD. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach for achieving optimal performance of HTS-FCL in power system in terms of security and system stability.

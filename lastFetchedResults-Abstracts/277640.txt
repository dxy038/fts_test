Numerical modelling can provide a thorough understanding of the mechanical influence on the spinal tissues and may offer explanations to mechanically linked pathologies. Such objective might be achieved only if the models are carefully validated. Sensitivity study must be performed in order to evaluate the influence of the approximations inherent to modelling. In this study, a new geometrically accurate L3â€“L5 lumbar spine bi-segmental finite-element model was acquired by modifying a previously existing model. The effect of changes in bone geometry, ligament fibres distribution, nucleus position and disc height was investigated in flexion and extension by comparison of the results obtained from the model before and after the geometrical update. Additional calculations were performed in axial rotation and lateral bending in order to compare the computed ranges of motion (ROM) with experimental results. It was found that the geometrical parameters affected the stress distribution and strain energy in the zygapophysial joints, the ligaments, and the intervertebral disc, changing qualitatively and quantitatively their relative role in resisting the imposed loads. The predicted ROM were generally in good agreement with the experimental results, independently of the geometrical changes. Hence, although the model update affected its internal biomechanics, no conclusions could be drawn from the experimental data about the validation of a particular geometry. Hence the validation of the lumbar spine model should be based on the relative role of its structural components and not only on its global mobility.

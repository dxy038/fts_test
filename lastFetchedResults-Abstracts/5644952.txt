Dynamic programming is a branch of operations research. It is a process of multi-stage decision which can be used to solve problems of multi-objective decision to achieve the optimal results. Take the case of optimizing the arrangement of production planning on an enterprise, it has established arrangements model of production planning by using dynamic programming methods under constraint conditions such as production capacity, production costs and inventory costs etc. of the enterprise. Meanwhile, it has solved the problems of optimization for production planning of the products through model solution and has achieved the corresponding procedures by C++ programming language.

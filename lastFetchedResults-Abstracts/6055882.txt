According to the requirements of modularization and standardization, a general LXI bus interface based on ARM is presented in this paper and can be employed for HF ground wave radar (HF GWR). The design takes AT91RM9200, DM9161, IDT7027L20PF as basic hardware, Linux as operating system, and considers about the working environment of multi-users and multi-processes. The reliability of system can be extremely kept by kernel synchronization mechanisms in driver. This LXI bus interface, which meets the requirements of HF WGR, adopts full-duplex mode and bidirectional interrupts to exchange a large amount of data in packets with host computer. And this paper discusses in detail the protocol of data transmission and the effective method to measure the whole system. The measurement results show that this LXI bus module can keep efficient and steady, and the average data transfer speed is about 45 Mb/s. The whole design meets the need of HF GWR real-time measurement.

A new framework for multiscale video coding is proposed in this research with the objective to achieve efficient video coding with spatial scalability. In this framework, multiscale motion compensation is performed to remove temporal redundancy, and both the motion field and the displacement frame difference (DFD) are compressed via wavelet transform, successive embedded quantization and entropy coding for multiscale representation and decoding. The proposed new method does not only secure the prediction loop of lower resolution video but also provides an efficient prediction from coarser to finer resolutions

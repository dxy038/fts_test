The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) poses potential issues for low voltage (LV) distribution networks, such as voltage deviations and overloading of equipment. Controlled EV charging is seen as one possibility for reducing, or even eliminating, these issues. This work presents an optimisation method which focuses on controlling the rate at which EVs charge over a 24-hour time horizon, subject to certain constraints. A sample distribution network is used and the optimisation tool is tested for multiple objective functions.

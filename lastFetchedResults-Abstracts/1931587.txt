The objective of this study was to evaluate the protein profiles of seminal plasma in buffalo bulls and to examine their correlation with semen characteristics. Semen of 10 buffalo bulls were collected by a bovine artificial vagina. Semen characteristics (motility, morphology, viability and concentration) were recorded. A part of the semen sample (1 ml) was diluted by tris-egg yolk-glycerol extender, packed in French straws and was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The straws were later thawed and semen characteristics were compared with those of the fresh semen.

l plasma was harvested by centrifugation; treated with cold ethanol and then, underwent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Twenty five protein bands were identified on the gel, of which those of &lt;35.5 kDa were prominent (72% of the bands). Of these protein fractions, 24.5 kDa was significantly correlated with sperm progressive motility in fresh and viability in frozen-thawed semen while 45 kDa bands were correlated with abnormal morphology in frozen-thawed semen; 55 kDa protein fractions were correlated with sperm viability of fresh semen.

ssive motility, viability and abnormal sperm morphology of frozen-thawed semen were highly correlated with these parameters in the fresh semen.

clusion, seminal plasma protein fractions in buffalo bulls are similar to those reported in other animal species and have some correlations with semen characteristics before and after freezing.

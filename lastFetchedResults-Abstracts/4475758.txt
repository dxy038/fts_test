A monolithic microsystem in CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is presented that provides bidirectional communication (stimulation and recording) between standard microelectronics and cultured electrogenic cells. The 128-electrode chip can be directly used as a substrate for cell culturing. It features circuitry units for stimulation and immediate cell signal treatment near each electrode. In addition, it provides on-chip A/D conversion as well as a digital interface so that a fast interaction is possible at good signal quality. Spontaneous and stimulated electrical activity recordings with neuronal and cardiac cell cultures will be presented. The system can be used to, e.g., study the behavior and development of neural networks in vitro, to reveal the effects of neuronal plasticity and to study network activity in response to pharmacological treatments.

Electric vehicles may be one of the main future transportation trends from the next decade due to their low-pollution and high efficiency. Reviewing the papers in the literature we can see that the best motive equipment is permanent magnet brushless DC (PM BLDC) motor. Many papers discuss the power supply for PM BLDC motors. This paper introduces a novel digital signal processor (DSP) controlled pulse width modulated (PWM) chopper to drive a PM BLDC motor. The main power supply unit is a chopper consisting of three power switches, which has a simple circuit and low-cost topology with less power losses. A comprehensive analysis on the principle of operation, design considerations and control algorithms implemented are described in this paper. The analysis also includes simulation and experimental results based on the prototype developed. The main objective is to achieve cost minimization and a simple structure drive system that is suitable for electric vehicle applications

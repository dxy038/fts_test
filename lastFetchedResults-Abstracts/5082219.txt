Coexistence of a cognitive radio network (CRN) with a primary user network (PUN) using spectrum underlay communication is modeled as a non-cooperative power and rate control game (NPRG). Main objective is to maximize the utility of each secondary user (SU) making them more energy efficient. Quality of Service (QoS) levels of SUs are guaranteed by max-min fair signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) concept while maintaining QoS level of the primary user (PU), thus resulting in reliable operation by reducing the sum interference. Further, the applicability of the proposed novel pricing scheme and the algorithm is discussed with respect to a heterogeneous network with proper power and rate controlling. By reducing the sum power of SUs we explore the survival of cognitive users in a lowered interference threshold imposed by the primary network. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium and its Pareto efficiency is discussed. A novel power and rate control algorithm with a new pricing scheme is introduced to reach the Nash Equilibrium (NE). By using a common platform for rates and utilities, existing algorithms are compared through numerical analysis.

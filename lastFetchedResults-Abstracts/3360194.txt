This study presents a novel image-naturalness restoration for the purpose of achieving better image quality with respect to the human visual system. Specifically, the authors suppress the artefacts around edges using image gradient components. They also appropriately enhance the image brightness using an adaptive gamma correction. In particular, they simply create a mapping curve to adjust the contrast, and then perform contrast enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of subjective and objective quality measures, and even computational speed. Therefore they believe that the proposed approach can be a useful tool to improve the visual quality of images under non-uniform illumination.

This paper presents a method on a multiobjective optimal design of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with V-shaped permanent magnet rotor for high performance. In general, a design method adopting equivalent magnetic circuit is used for basic design of IPMSM. However, its use may give us wrong design result because of air-gap flux calculation method by using lumped reluctance parameters. Moreover, it has difficulty in considering arrangement of permanent magnets and barriers, but on the other hand, there exists high degree of freedom of permanent magnet rotor design of IPMSM. Therefore, finite element method (FEM) is needed for the precise design considering arrangement of permanent magnets and barriers. In order for effective V-shaped permanent magnet rotor design, Taguchi method by adopting five multiobjective functions is proposed as an optimal design method. The different optimal design results are suggested by adjusting weighting value of each objective function. Finally, the characteristics of optimal design model with V-shaped permanent magnet rotor are verified by experiment.

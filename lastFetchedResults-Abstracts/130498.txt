The objective of this study was to investigate the serum vitamin E status and value of vitamin E / TC and vitamin E / LDL-C in women who use low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) containing 0,15 mg levonorgestrol and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and also in postmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT). One hundred - thirty nine healthy non pregnant-non lactating women with a mean age of 32 years old (70 were OCs users and 69 were non-OCs users) and sixty healthy postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 51 years old (30 were under HRT and 30 were untreated) were studied using biochemical procedures (measurement of serum vitamin E and lipids levels), anthropometric measurements(weight and height)and interview with the subjects. No significant difference was found between either OCs and non-OCs users or HRT and non-HRT groups in terms of mean body mass index (BMI), and dietary intakes of vitamin E, total fat and total fiber. There were no significant differences between serum vitamin E levels and the mean value of vitamin E/TC in either OCs-users and non-OCs users or HRT and non-HRT groups. The mean value of vitamin E/LDL-C in HRT group was significantly higher than that of non-HRT group (7.13±3.48 vs 5.32±2.10, p<0.01). There was no significant difference between mean value of vitamin E/LDL-C in OCs and non-OCs groups. As a conclusion, using low-dose OCs has not resulted in altered vitamin E metabolism in OCs-Users compared to non-OCs Users. However, in postmenopausal women, taking HRT have had positive effect on serum vitamin E/LDL-C ratio, which is suitable indicator of vitamin E status.

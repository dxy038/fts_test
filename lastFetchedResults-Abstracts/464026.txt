OBJECTIVE: We investigated the clinical utility of macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 versus CA 125 and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in endometrial carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: Serum levels of the three substances were measured in 159 patients with untreated endometrial adenocarcinoma and in 24 patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma.
RESULTS: Initial concentrations of colony-stimulating factor 1, CA 125, and the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen were above the normal range in 73%, 11%, and 27%, respectively, of the patients. Colony-stimulating factor 1 levels correlated with those of the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen (r = 0.3, P = 0.002) and CA 125 (r = 0.20, P = 0.036) in the total group and with those of the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen in stage I and II patients (r = 0.3, P = 0.0023). Colony-stimulating factor 1 levels correlated significantly with tumor grade, whereas those of CA 125 and the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen correlated more closely with clinical stage. Mean colony-stimulating factor 1 levels (9.6 vs 7.7 ng/ml, p = 0.04) and the frequency of elevated CA 125 levels (31% vs 8%, p = 0.048) were higher in patients with poor prognosis than in those with good prognosis. Colony-stimulating factor 1, the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen, and CA 125 levels were useful in monitoring clinical behavior of the disease in 88%, 79%, and 63% of the cases, respectively. Levels of all three markers rose with disease progression, whereas colony-stimulating factor 1 and the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen fell with clinical responses to therapy.
CONCLUSION: Elevated serum colony-stimulating factor 1 levels were the most accurate indicator of the presence and activity (progression, stabilization, or regression) of primary or recurrent disease. Accuracy was not further enhanced by measurement of CA 125 or the aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen levels.

Objective The present study set out to examine the
association between ethnic composition of school classes
and prevalence of internalising and externalising problem
behaviour among ethnic minority and majority students.
Methods Data were derived from the Dutch 2002 Health
Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, a
nationally representative cross-sectional study with a total
of 5,730 adolescents, aged 11â€“18 and attending secondary
school, of which 931 belong to ethnic minority groups. The
data were analysed using a multilevel regression model.
Results The study revealed that, after taking individual
characteristics like age, gender, educational level and
family affluence into account, ethnic minority students on
average report higher levels of externalising but not internalising
problems. Ethnic density on the level of school
classes modified this difference, as a negative association
between the proportion ethnic minority students in class
and externalising problem behaviour was found, but only
for ethnic minority students. No effect of ethnic composition
was found with respect to internalising problem
behaviour.
Conclusion The data revealed that ethnic minority students
report higher levels of externalising problem behaviour,
but only in classes with a minority of ethnic minority
students and not in classes with a culturally diverse
composition. This points towards a possible beneficial
effect of a more culturally diverse environment for
minority students. Majority students appeared to be
insensitive for the ethnic density effect. Future studies
should investigate the role of the ethnic composition of the
school class more in-depth.

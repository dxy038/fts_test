This paper delves into the effectiveness of a gait recognition process depending on the length of the video sequence used. To this end, a well-known gait representation, the Gait Energy Image (GEI), is incrementally computed from gait cycles in the order they occur. The main objective is to assess the problem of the minimum number of gait cycles required to obtain discriminant GEIs. An experimental study is conducted on two public databases covering both indoor and outdoor environments, and variable covariate conditions. Results show that a few gait cycles are enough to succeed in gait recognition.

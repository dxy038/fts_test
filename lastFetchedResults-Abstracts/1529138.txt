The objective of this note is to prove that the Riemann solutions of the isentropic magnetogasdynamics equations converge to the corresponding Riemann solutions of the transport equations by letting both the pressure and the magnetic field vanish. The delta shock wave can be obtained as the limit of two shock waves and the vacuum state can be obtained as the limit of two rarefaction waves. Moreover the relation between the speed of formation of singular density and those of the vanishing pressure and the vanishing magnetic field is discussed in detail.

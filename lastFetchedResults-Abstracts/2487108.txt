his note studies the theory of Shabah (image/ resemblance) in the area of the mental existence and examines three interpretations. In the first interpretation, it investigates the attitude of the famous scholars about Shabah (image/ resemblance) which they believe that the theory of Shabah (image/ resemblance) is against the theory of the essential union which besides the existential difference between dhin (mind) and ’ayn (entity), they believe the essential differences between dhin (mind) and ’ayn (entity) too. These interpretations embody four types which willingly or unwillingly it has been presented in the movement of the philosophical-theological discussions (subjects). The types are: 1. resembling Shabah (image)
2. coding Shabah (image) 3. shabah (image) with changing
4. combination between Essential union and Shabah (image). The second interpretation (some scholars have clarified) believes that the theory of Shabah (image) is the same of the theory of the Essence union between dhin (mind) and ’ayn (entity) and the third interpretation is the conceptual-Anecdotal aspect that its quiddity does not come to dhin (mind) but what come to dhin (mind) is a concept that specifying objective things after explaining and presenting in detail the interpretations, they have been judged by this paper and at last the second interpretation of Shabah (image) is accepted.

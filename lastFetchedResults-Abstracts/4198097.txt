Time synchronization is the indispensable part of the infrastructure in wireless sensor network. The efficient and precise operation of many applications in wireless sensor network requires synchronization time. In order to achieve network wide time synchronization, a synchronization protocol has been considered that is Timing-sync protocol for sensor network (TPSN) is a clock-sync protocol. The objective of this project is by increasing certain number of nodes simulating the TPSN protocol under different parameter using network simulator (NS2).From the parameter analysis, delay and drop of packets is reduced. Therefore from the simulated result of TPSN protocol, efficient energy and synchronization accuracy is achieved in the wireless sensor network.

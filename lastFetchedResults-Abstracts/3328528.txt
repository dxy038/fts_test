To provide a good contrast image while preserving the relevant details, an image enhancement method based on Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT) and fuzzy Gaussian intensification function is proposed. LWT allows for in-place implementation and fast reconstruction, decomposes the image to be enhanced into different multiresolution subimages. These sub-images, that preserve the salient features present in the image, are then enhanced using Gaussian intensification function. The resultant enhanced image is reconstructed using inverse-LWT. For evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm, the proposed method is compared both subjectively and objectively to other image enhancement methods: histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization and LWT. Both visual results and objective measures such as entropy and enhancement measure (EME) prove the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

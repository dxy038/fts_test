The objective of this work is the hardware and software conception of an electronic controller system based on PIC16F877A microcontroller. The algorithm implemented is a discrete-time sliding mode control and it is applied on a nominal second order system. The simulation of the electronic system is performed in the PROTEUS environment. The validations of the hardware and software design of the controller are realized by comparative simulations of the same closed loop structure performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.

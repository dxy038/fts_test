Elastostatic analysis of an antiplane crack in a functionally graded material (FGM) is performed by using a hypersingular boundary integral equation method (BIEM). An exponential law is applied to describe the spatial variation of the shear modulus of the FGM. A Galerkin method is applied for the numerical solution of the hypersingular traction BIE. Both unidirectional and bidirectional material gradations are investigated. Stress intensity factors for an infinite and linear elastic FGM containing a finite crack subjected to an antiplane crack-face loading are presented and discussed. The influences of the material gradients and the crack orientation on the stress intensity factors are analyzed.

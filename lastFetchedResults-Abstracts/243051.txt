In urban waste water treatment, a novel gas sparger based on flexible rubber membrane has been used for the last 10 years. The objective of this present work is to compare two flexible membranes (the new membrane and the old membrane provided by ONDEO-DEGREMONT group) used in waste water treatment. For this purpose, the different membrane properties (hole diameter, pressure drop, critical pressure, deflection at the centerline and elasticity) have been characterized. The bubble generation at the membranes with a single orifice and with four orifices have been studied and their performances have been compared in terms of interfacial area and power consumption. From the experimental and theoretical approach, the new membrane is less elastic (or more rigid) than the old membrane. The bubble diameters generated from the new membrane remain constant with the gas velocity through the orifice, whereas they increase logarithmically for the old membrane. The inverse behaviours are observed in terms of the bubble formation frequency. Moreover, the bubbles generated from the new membrane have significantly larger sizes and lower formation frequencies than those obtained with the old one. From these results, it can be noted that the new membrane has a behaviour comparable to a rigid orifice. No coalescence phenomenon at the bubble formation is observed from the new and the old membranes with four orifices. The interfacial area and the power consumption are evaluated and show slight differences between the interfacial area provided by the old and the new membranes for one value of power consumption.

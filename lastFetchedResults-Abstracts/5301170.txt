In this project we study the one of the most important performance in aggregate congestion control is fairness, i.e. the equal use of resources. The objective of Aggregate TCP congestion management is to achieve the fair sharing of the bottleneck bandwidth between the aggregate and other background TCP flows. There are many existing mechanism to prove the fairness property but none of mechanism proves fair share of the aggregated flows even where the number of flows in the aggregate is large. To solve this problem, unlike existing mechanism there are two congestion window loops, one is that loss event rate loop and other one is throughput control loop. Throughput control loop is used to adjust its window size with a weight N. Finally our simulation results prove an algorithm providing for fairly services to TCP flows that share a bottleneck link between the aggregate and other background TCP flows even where the number of flows in the aggregate is large.

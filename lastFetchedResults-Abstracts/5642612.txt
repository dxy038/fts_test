Secure group communication is a challenging task with respect to MANETÂ´s. Since its introduction as a communication medium, wireless technology found broad application on the battlefield. Robust and reliable group communication plays a major role in developing distributed mobile application in which unannounced disconnections will occur frequently due to the mobility of the nodes which take part in mobile applications. Accompanying dramatic advances in wireless technology and the capabilities associated with small computing devices, the demand for advanced mechanisms to employ wireless technology in the battlefield continues to grow. The main objective here is to achieve robust and reliable group communication in mobile ad hoc network. Performance of the group communication is compared with the given protocols through simulation in NS-2. The analysis is made with respect to the throughput, packet transmission between source and destination. We propose four Ad hoc Routing Protocols AODV, DSR, TORA and OLSR.

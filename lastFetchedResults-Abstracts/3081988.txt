In this paper, we study interference-efficient topology control for wireless ad hoc networks. A node is interfered by a communication link if it receives a transmission not intended for it. In this study, we account for the number of communication links contributing interference to each node in the generated topology, defined as the interference load of a node. Our objective is to find a connected topology with lower interference load. We prove that finding a topology with minimum interference load is NP-hard. We propose a heuristic algorithm, namely, Low Interference-load Topology (LILT) to find a feasible solution in polynomial time. In comparison to the existing Low Interference Forest Establisher (LIFE), we find that LILT can significantly reduce the interference load in the resulting topology while the total interference load and transmission range are still maintained.

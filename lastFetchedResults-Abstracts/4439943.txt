A computer-based statistical pattern recognition program from digitized spectral waveform envelopes of amniotic fluid displacement during fetal ´respiration´´ was developed to extract discriminant features of respiratory maturation. The accuracy of the model reached 98% in estimating maturity in 37 healthy controls. A subset of high-risk subjects was classified with 100% accuracy in relation to maturity and growth. The incorporation of computer algorithms to extract significant kinematic variables (p &lt; ,05) using pattern-based recognition of spectral signal features may provide a method to classify respiratory-related maturation in medical practice and obtain objective clinical indices of abnormal pulmonary states

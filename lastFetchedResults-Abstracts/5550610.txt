For electric power generation and dispatching problems, absolute minimum cost is not any more the only criterion to be met. Environmental considerations have become one of the major management concerns. The environmentally constrained economic dispatch problem can be classified as a multi-objective optimization and non-linear programming problem. This paper proposes a solution for environmental economic dispatch problem using modified GA which based on arithmetic crossover operator. The employed arithmetic crossover operation takes them real values presented by two individuals and produced new generation on the basis of the arithmetic mean. Numerical results for two case studies have been presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed method.

[Objective] To get three-dimensional (3-D) surface visualization results of the liver and tumors by Amira(MERCURY,USA) for liver hyperthermia treatment planning. [Methods] Liver CT slices obtained from Chinese PLA General Hospital were loaded into Amira, and then image preprocessing(image registration, cropping, segmentation) was accomplished by Amira. At last 3-D visualization results were acquired by AmiraÂ´s modules and editors. [Results] The 3-D reconstruction results were satisfying, and 3-D physical peculiarities of liver structures could be obtained. [Conclusion] 3-D physical parameters of the liver and tumors were obtained from reconstruction surface results, which could be applied to simulate the distribution of temperature field and helped to choose the most suitable hyperthermia parameters for liver cancer treatment. So the research can provide scientific and reliable evidences for hyperthermia treatment planning and guide the process of clinical operation.

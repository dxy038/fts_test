Inroduction & Objective: This study aimed to assess the heavy metal cadmium in muscle tissue of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchusmykiss)in Tonekabon'sDohezarRiver and its main purpose was to examine the correlation between weights cadmium.
Material and Methods: In this study,twenty two rainbow trout (from 25 to 584 g) were caught and after tissue digestion, the cadmium amount was measured using the voltammetry method. 
Results: Based on the results, the average concentration of cadmium in muscle tissue of farmed rainbow trout in Tonekabon'sDohezar River was 1.01 microgram per gram, which shows higher rate than the standard accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) (0.2 micrograms per gram). Also, byelevating in body weight of fish, cadmium levels are significantly (P < 0.05) increased.

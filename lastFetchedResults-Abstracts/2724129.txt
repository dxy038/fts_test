It is expected that electric vehicles (EVs) will soon represent a large share of the demand for electricity. Several research works have extolled the advantages of these devices as flexible demands, not only to charge their batteries when it is cheaper to do so, but also to provide services in the form of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power injections to the system. These services, however, could reduce the useful life of the battery and thus introduce a cost that needs to be taken into account when scheduling the charging of these vehicles. This study presents a scheduling algorithm for EVs under a real time pricing scheme with uncertainty. The objective function explicitly takes into account the cost of battery degradation not only when used to provide services to the system but also in terms of the EV utilisation for motion. The results show that the scheduling of the V2G services is sensitive to the electricity prices uncertainty and to the degradation costs derived from the energy arbitrage. Also, the optimal energy state of charge of the batteries is highly dependent on whether the cost of battery degradation is taken into account or not.

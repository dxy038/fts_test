The objective of the present work is to evaluate the potential of the use of the image fractal dimension as textural feature in a content-based image retrieval system. In order to compare and classify the regions of an image, we have used two distances between two partitions of the image: (1) a classic distance computed with some features (contrast, energy, entropy, homogeneity, correlation) extracted form cooccurrence matrix and (2) a distance between the fractal dimensions of the two regions. The experiments proved that the degree of confidence is increased when adding the fractal dimension to the other textural features.

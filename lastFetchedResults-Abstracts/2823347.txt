This work aims at the optimal location and sizing of distributed generation (DG) in distribution feeders. An objective function which evaluates the active power losses of the system coupled with a penalty for voltage deviation in each bus is used. In this way, the following are considered: the equality and inequality constraints concerning the power flow, total apparent power of DG, number of installed DGs, fixed or variable power factor and voltage limits. To this end, a nonlinear programming model with discontinuous derivatives, which employs binary variables to define the location of the generation through a classical optimization approach is implemented.

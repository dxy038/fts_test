This letter presents a simple reconfigurable antenna concept, which is based on the influence of reflection phase shifters on the mutual coupling to the parasitic elements. The developed antenna operates in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical band (ISM) at frequency of 2.45 GHz. The objective of this work involves the development of a generic and low-cost reconfigurable antenna, with a 1-D or 2-D layout. The parasitic elements are loaded with varactor phase shifters, and the global synthesis is performed through different radiation pattern objectives. In this letter, we have limited these objectives to two opposite directions as we considered only a 1-D layout. The design has been manufactured and measured. A comparison between the measured and the simulation results shows a very good agreement.

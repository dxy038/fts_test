Through the research of EPA and MODBUS/TCP Industrial Ethernet technology, ARM embedded system and &#956;C/OS-II real-time operating system, this paper designs and develops a communication gateway of EPA and MODBUS/TCP. The communication gateway can perform bidirectional data transceiving on EPA protocol and MODBUS/TCP protocol, which provides a secure, stable, real-time and flexible solution for process control of industrial field.

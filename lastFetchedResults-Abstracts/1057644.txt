We describe the synthesis of a series of conformationally constrained nicotine analogues from appropriate pyridine-containing enals, featuring an intramolecular azomethine ylideâ€“alkene [3+2] cycloaddition. The objective of the current project is to develop new selective nAChRs-targeting ligands. Of the nicotine analogues that we have studied, the conformation-restricting ring B unit can be either a five-membered carbocycle, or a six-membered carbocycle or heterocycle. The present work constitutes a general method for rapid assembly of other related tricyclic nicotine analogues.

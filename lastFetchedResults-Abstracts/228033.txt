A novel three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) structure suitable for phase and angular
frequency derivation from distorted ac utility voltages is presented. The proposed PLL has
a simple structure; a conventional three-phase PLL followed by a proportional-integral (PI)-controlled
moving average filter together with a phase-locking algorithm. The objective of the proposed technique
is to capture the fundamental phase angle and angular frequency of three-phase clean, distorted,
balanced or unbalanced ac utilities. The PLL gives fast, accurate angular frequency and phase
locking and is robust to utility distortion such as line notching, random noise, voltage imbalance,
phase loss, phase imbalance, harmonics, dc offsets and frequency variation. The analysis presented substantiates
the immunity of the proposed PLL to unbalanced and distorted utility conditions. The PLL
technique is simulated and digital signal processor (DSP)-implemented for a three-phase system to
verify the analytical results. The simulated and experimental results, for numerous utility conditions,
demonstrate its phase-tracking ability, whereas the conventional technique fails to lock accurately in
highly distorted, three-phase grid-connected operation.

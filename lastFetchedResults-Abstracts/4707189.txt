The problem of the fixed-spectrum frequency assignment, where the objective is to minimize the cost due to the interference arising in a solution, is studied and solved in this paper using a multi-swarms particle swarm optimization algorithm which is refined by a deterministic local search heuristic and elitist strategy. When multiple swarms explore and exploit the design space in a parallel computing environment, the solution characteristics can be further improved. Computational results prove that this approach can compute accurate frequency plans for real-world instances in an optimum way.

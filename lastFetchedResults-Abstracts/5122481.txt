At Fermilab, there is an ongoing pixel detector R&amp;D effort for high energy physics (HEP) with the objective of developing high performance vertex detectors suitable for the next generation of HEP experiments. The pixel module presented here is result of many years of R&amp;D on hybrid pixel systems and will be used by the PHENIX experiment. The PHENIX experiment is the largest of the four experiments currently taking data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory is a world-class scientific research facility that began operation in 2000, following 10 years of development and construction. The pixel module presented here will be installed on the PHENIX forward tracker region. The pixel modules will be stacked in four parallel planes that will then form the tracking stations for forward tracking. There will be up to twenty four modules per station adding to almost two million pixels. The pixel tracker will be used to identify charm and beauty quarks that are produced early in the heavy ion collisions. A new version of the hybrid pixel readout chips is being used on this experiment, the FPIX 2.1. This chip has improved electronics and is capable of providing trigger signals for the experiment.

This paper describes scheduling algorithms for scheduling traffic in wireless data networks with multiple channels per cell. The paper assumes that a reservation-based MAC protocol is used. The main objective of the scheduling algorithms is to reduce the computation time while maximizing the utilization of the network resources, thereby improving the system throughput. In this paper, we consider two type of systems-single priority and multiple priority. For each system, two different algorithms are considered depending on whether slots are allocated contiguously or not. A performance study that considers network utilization, computation time, and the throughput for 2 Mbps and 10 Mbps data streams for the above algorithms is presented.

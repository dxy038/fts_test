We study relay selection (RS) for time-division broadcast (TDBC) in a bidirectional network consisting of two different end-sources and multiple relays. By modifying the well-known proactive RS scheme valid only for unidirectional cooperative networks, we propose a proactive RS with TDBC (P-TDBC) for bidirectional cooperative networks. In the P-TDBC scheme, a single best relay is selected proactively before two consecutive source-transmissions by maximizing the bottleneck of the end-to-end maximal achievable rates in both directions. We then derive the exact outage probability of P-TDBC in closed-form for E<sub>s</sub> &#8804; E<sub>r</sub>, and in a single-integral form for E<sub>s</sub> &gt;; E<sub>r</sub>, where E<sub>s</sub> and E<sub>r</sub> denote the transmission powers at each end-source and the selected relay, respectively. Moreover, we derive very tight closed-form upper and lower bounds on the outage probability for E<sub>s</sub> &gt;; E<sub>r</sub>. Finally, we study the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) and show that the P-TDBC scheme achieves full diversity.

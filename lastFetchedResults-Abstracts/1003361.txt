The objective of this paper is to investigate whether or not paradigm shift from modernism to postmodernism can inspire rural and developmental studies. Having discussed scientific and rational principles of modernism and some of its prominent beliefs, it is argued that modernism was enforced the processes of exclusivity and marginality in the process of rural development, owing mainly to its character of abstraction and segregation of thinking from the actual life. In contrast to emphasis of modernism on the principles of professionalism, rationalism, global truth etc., postmodernism underlines on cultural and moral relativity in the process of development. Having discussed the postmodern basic theoretical, methodological and policy tenets– in the fields of radical pluralism, action-network approach, local development and participatory action research– the paper concludes that all of these developments paves the way for hearing 'the voices of the neglected others' and '(rural) marginalized geographies' in the process of change and progress.

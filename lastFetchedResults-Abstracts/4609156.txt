This paper considers the flexible flow shops scheduling problem. The objective is to minimize the makespan. This is an NP-hard problem. A scheduling algorithm is presented. In this algorithm, the longest-processing-time-first heuristic is used for machine allocation. A genetic algorithm is used for solving the problem of finding a good loading sequence. Finally, the results of experiments are shown.

This work presents the implementation of an agent based model concept to simulate a sample of the German society under a governmental social transfer system. Subsequently the behavior of the model is analyzed under changing conditions in order to proof that it can be used for the simulation of real societies under similar conditions. An important objective is to give evidence on economic interdependencies between individual behavior, governmental interaction and macroeconomic outcomes. The model is based on the economic concept of Homo Oeconomicus, while it widens some restrictions of this concept aiming to create a framework that resembles reality more closely. Our analysis provides evidence that the model works reasonably well and can serve as a basis for more detailed investigations.

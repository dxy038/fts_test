Objective(s)
Quinazolinones are heterocyclic compounds, with biological and pharmacological activities, such as inhibiting some proteins, enzymes and reducing blood lipids. 
Materials and Methods
Following previous results of our group, effects of two new derivatives of quinazolinones 9(3)-quinazolinone-2-propyl-2-phenylethyl (QPPE) and 9(3)-quinazolinone-2-ethyl-2â€“phenylethyl (QEPE) on livers, intestines and kidneys of newborn Balb/C mice were investigated. Pregnant mice were divided into four groups of control, sham, experimental 1, treated with QPPE, and experimental 2, treated with QEPE. Experimental groups received 100 mg/kg body weight (most effective dose) of QPPE and QEPE, sham groups received methyl cellulose 0.05% (the solvent) and control groups received distilled water, intraperitoneally (IP), on day 8 of gestation. Five days after birth, livers, intestines and kidneys were removed, fixed in formalin 10%, stained with hematoxylene and eosin for histological and pathological studies.
Results
Results showed appearance of fatty changes in livers, an increase in diameters of hepatocytes and central veins of livers, and reduction in the lengths of villi of proximal, middle and distal segments of newborn Balb/C mice intestines. Furthermore, there was a diminished diameter of the lumen of the proximal tubules, and average diameter of the lumen of distal tubules which led to an increase in the number of glomeruli cells of newborn Balb/C mice kidneys.
Conclusion
Regarding inflammation in different parts of the kidneys, livers and intestines, our investigations suggest that quinazolinones may have some toxic effects on embryos.

The design of neuro-fuzzy models is still a complex problem, as it involves not only the determination of the model parameters, but also its structure of special importance is the incorporation of a priori information in the design process. In this paper two known design algorithms for B-spline models will be updated to account for function and derivatives equality restrictions, which are important when the neural model is used for performing single or multi-objective optimization online.

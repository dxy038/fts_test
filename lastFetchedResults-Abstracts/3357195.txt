The objective of this paper is to design of an intelligent electronic throttle control system (ETCS). A high performance DC servo motor, and conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID), sliding mode control (SMC) with PD and PID type sliding surface (SS), and fuzzy logic control techniques are used for the design of ETCS. A comparative performance analysis among all the designed controllers is performed.

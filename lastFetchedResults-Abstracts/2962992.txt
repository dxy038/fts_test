Performance of multi-carrier power amplifiers (MCPAs) in a multi-layer cellular network is studied. The study consists of an analysis and field measurement of MCPAs in a hierarchical cellular structure. Three sources of interference to the mobile station are considered: intermodulation generated by the MCPA, receiver blocking and intermodulation generated by the receiver in the mobile station. The objective of this study is to determine the source that limits the system performance

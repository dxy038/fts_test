There have been many security events in the Internet. Many of them are due to arbitrary
access permissions to the network resources of the malicious users, especially their free
sending packets to anywhere in the network. However, current existing solutions such as
ingress filtering and network firewalls cannot solve the problem of malicious access to
the network flexibly and effectively. In this paper, we present an efficient access control
method based on host identifiers, in which a safe and bidirectional authentication process is
introduced whenever the host begins to access the network. Meanwhile, all the succeeding
information exchanges between the host and the network can be controlled through the
encrypt scheme negotiated during the access authentication process. Through analysis
and experiments, we find that the proposed method has the following merits. First, our
method has the capability to support various end-nodes to access the Internet in a uniform
way. Second, with our method, end-nodes and the core network can establish a mutual
trustworthy relationship to avoid any spoof from the other side. Third, our method can
support host mobility very well.

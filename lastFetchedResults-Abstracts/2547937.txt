The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary natural sorbent-sodium humate (HuNa) on the prevention of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) toxicity in the broiler chicken. Seventy-two (72) broiler hybrid Hybro birds were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group (G1) and 3 experimental groups (G2-G4) with addition of HuNa (G2); only AFB1 (G3) and HuNa; and AFB1 (G4). HuNa was added to a complete feed mixture daily for broiler chicks (1 g HuNa/100 g feed mixture) and AFB1 at the concentration of 25 µg.kg^-1 of b.w. Parameters evaluated were body weight and serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). AFB1 and HuNa were applied for broilers from 28 days of age. Statistically significant decrease activity of ALP (P≤0.05) was recorded in group G3 of broilers from day 42 and 56 of age onwards in comparison to group G1. However, statistically increased activity of ALP (P≤0.05) was observed in group G4 in comparison to control group G1. The body weight of broilers was lower by about 180 g after exposure to AFB1 (G3) compared to control (G1). Also, the addition of HuNa increased the body weight of broilers by about 26.67 g at the end of the experiment in comparison to control group. Statistically significant increase (P≤0.001) in body weight was recorded for group G3 and G4 on 56th day of age, compared to 28 days. The results of our experiment showed that HuNa has a positive effect on the growth of broilers. And it could have been a suitable natural supplement for growing broilers against the adverse effects of aflatoxins.

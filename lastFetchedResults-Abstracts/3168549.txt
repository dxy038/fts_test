This paper addresses the problem of harmonic distortion that introduced in traditional short time noise suppression methods, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) noisy environments. We propose a simple but effective harmonic regeneration method to solve this problem. The full harmonics of the speech are obtained by applying a non-linear function to the enhanced speech after traditional short time noise suppression methods. The artificial signal is then refined by updating the spectral amplitude in three different frequency sub-bands respectively. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed and tried. Both the subjective and objective experiment results show that the harmonic regeneration algorithm can help improve the quality of the enhanced speech.

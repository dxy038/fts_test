A compact configuration for achieving wavelength tenable and stable Multi wavelength Brillouin fiber laser (MWBFL) configuration is proposed and experimentally investigated based on a 100 m long photonic crystal fiber (PCF) as a Brillouin gain medium. A stable room-temperature even order Brillouin Stokes waves appear in the figure-of-eight oscillation direction of with the line spacing 0.16 nm (~20 GHz) between each two consecutive waves. With a BP of 15.3 dBm, Up to 3 even order Brillouin Stokes lines are generated and tuned over 70 nm tuning range. The anti-Stokes lines are also obtained due to four wave mixing and bidirectional operation. This Brillouin fiber laser can operate at any wavelength depending on the Brillouin pump (BP) wavelength used which is a benefit to the others.

Stepped impedance technique is a popular method to achieve size reduction of planner circuit, dual band operation and improvement of stopband response for filters. Stepped impedance ratios have an effect on the relationship between the two bandwidths of a dual band circuit. Stepped-impedance is a technique to control the bandwidths of dualband filters. Its major role is in controlling the two bandwidths independently, used in much larger range of bandwidth control. Bandwidth control becomes easy simply by changing the stepped-impedance ratios. The main objective of this paper is to study application of stepped impedance technique and dual band filter implementation.

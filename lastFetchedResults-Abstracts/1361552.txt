Objective(s): To improve water stability of electrospun chitosan/ Polyethylene oxide (PEO)
nanofibers, genipin, a biocompatible and nontoxic agent, was used to crosslink chitosan based
nanofibers.
Materials and Methods: Different amounts of genipin were added to the chitosan/PEO solutions,
chitosan/PEO weight ratio 90/10 in 80 % acetic acid, and the solutions were then electrospun to
form nanofibers. The spun nanofibers were exposed to water vapor to complete crosslinking. The
nanofibrous membranes were subjected to detailed analysis by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy,
swelling test, MTT cytotoxicity, and cell attachment.
Results: SEM images of electrospun mats showed that genipin-crosslinked nanofibers retained
their fibrous structure after immerging in PBS (pH=7.4) for 24 hours, while the uncrosslinked
samples lost their fibrous structure, indicating the water stability of genipin-crosslinked
nanofibers. The genipin-crosslinked mats also showed no significant change in swelling ratio in
comparison with uncrosslinked ones. FTIR-ATR spectrum of uncrosslinked and genipincrosslinked
chitosan nanofibers revealed the reaction between genipin and amino groups of
chitosan. Cytotoxicity of genipin-crosslinked nanofibers was examined by MTT assay on human
fibroblast cells in the presence of nanofibers extraction media. The genipin-crosslinked
nanofibers did not show any toxic effects on fibroblast cells at the lowest and moderate amount
of genipin. The fibroblast cells also showed a good adhesion on genipin-crosslinked nanofibers.
Conclusion: This electrospun matrix would be used for biomedical applications such as wound
dressing and scaffold for tissue engineering without the concern of toxicity

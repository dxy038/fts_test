Bidirectional radiance functions (BRF) are estimated for two age-different conifer canopies using field mensuration data, a geometric-optical canopy reflectance (CR) model, ray-tracing software and imaging spectrometer data. The anisotropy or I-BRF (bidirectional change with reference to change in illumination direction, view direction constant) of two age-different stands are compared. Comments on the versatility of this BRF estimation methodology are offered

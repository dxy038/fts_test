The integration of interaction and simulation in e-learning systems represents a milestone in educational research and supports the student´s learning process in innumerable ways. Nevertheless, current standards do not provide appropriate mechanisms to treat simulations as learning objects, which makes their integration into e-learning systems a hard task. This work proposes an architecture as extension to SCORM which includes a Tutoring Module for Simulations (TMS). The main objective consists in providing mechanisms to track and &#194;&#191;observe&#194;&#191; the student´s actions while interacting with a simulation, thus enabling the TMS to take decisions or intervene when necessary, and/or to modify the simulation course.

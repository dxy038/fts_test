The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of currency devaluation on the trade balance of Iran by using J and S curve approaches over the period of 1976-2007.
For this purpose, we used the Johansenâ€™s co-integration approach and impulse response function for the long run and short run analysis, respectively. 
The empirical results reveal that currency devaluation has a negative effect on the Iranian trade balance in long run as well as short run and reject the J and S curves hypothesis for Iran. Overall the empirical findings of the J and S suggest that the trade balance of Iran does not improve as a result of currency devaluation.

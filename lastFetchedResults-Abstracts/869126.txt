The maximal expected covering location problem (MEXCLP) and its adjusted counterpart (AMEXCLP) compute expected coverage arising only from unqueued calls, whereas the interactive use of the hypercube queueing model (HQM) considers both unqueued and queued calls in this computation. In this note we show that the three models are not strictly comparable because of the structural differences in their objective functions and that, when using HQM, it is important to state clearly the factor being used to express traveling time in terms of service time units.

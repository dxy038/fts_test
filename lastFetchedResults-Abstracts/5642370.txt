In this paper we propose two price-based job allocation schemes for computational grids. A grid system tries to solve problems submitted by various grid users by allocating the jobs to the computing resources governed by different resource owners. The prices charged by these owners are obtained based on a pricing model using a bargaining game theory framework. These prices are then used for job allocation. We present the grid system model and formulate the two schemes as a constraint minimization problem and as a non-cooperative game respectively. The objective of these schemes is to minimize the cost for the grid users. We present algorithms to compute the optimal load (job) fractions to allocate jobs to the computers. Finally, the two schemes are compared under simulations with various system loads and configurations and conclusions are drawn.

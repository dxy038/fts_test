This paper presents a Bidirectional Hierarchy-based Any cast Routing (BHAR) protocol for collecting data over multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The BHAR protocol improves on existing HAR mechanisms to speed up the process of constructing hierarchical trees and repairing routes, and as a result to prolong network lifetime. Different from HAR, BHAR allows sinks and sources to initialize the construction of a hierarchical tree. By knowing only its own parent and neighbor nodes, each node can join a tree, exchange/refresh its routing table, and perform route repair without geographical information or being controlled remotely. Simulation results show that our BHAR performs apparently better than traditional HAR on network construction and route repair.

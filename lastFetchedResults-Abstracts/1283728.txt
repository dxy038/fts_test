A new series of S-alkylisothiosemicarbazones of 3- and 4-pyridincarboxaldehyde and 4-fluoro- and 4-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde was synthesized and evaluated for biological activity against various Mycobacterium strains. Inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 and INH-R ATCC 35822 was compared with activity against clinical isolated Mycobacteria as well as against MOTT. Some of newly prepared compounds showed best inhibitory values against clinical isolated Mycobacteria, besides to low citotoxicity values.

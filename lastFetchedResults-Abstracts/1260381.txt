The objective is to investigate the presence of dysphonic symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to compare quantitative acoustic parameters in multiple sclerosis patients and normal individuals. The method of study was an 8-month controlled cross-sectional that was carried out with 106 individuals (30 MS, 76 controls). Both groups included males and females from 20 to 55 years. Exclusion criteria were prior vocal disorder, laryngeal microsurgery, recent endotracheal intubation, tumors, laryngeal, lung or mediastinal metastases, respiratory disease, and other associated neurological diagnoses. For dysphonic symptoms (qualitative variables), associations were assessed using Mantel-Haenszel's د‡2test, with Yates correction or the Fisher exact test when necessary. Statistical significance was set at pâ‰¤0.05. Dysphonia was observed in 70% of MS individuals versus 33% of controls (pآ =آ 0.01). Association was found between MS and dysphonia (OR: 2.2, CI 95%: 1.13â€“4.25). Fundamental frequency was higher among MS patients (pآ =آ 0.01). Fundamental frequency deviation was significantly higher in MS women (but not men) than controls (pآ =آ 0.00). Jitter was higher in MS men than in all other groups (pآ =آ 0.00). Results suggest that evaluation and treatment of MS patients should be revised, evaluating voice alterations in relation to other signs. MS seems to intensify gender effect on fundamental frequency deviation, noise, and jitter, with MS women presenting fewer voice variations than men.

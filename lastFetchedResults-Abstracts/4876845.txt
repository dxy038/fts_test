The phased array formed by microstrip antennas is analyzed using the full wave Transverse Transmission Line (TTL) method. For the microstrip patch resonator a set of equations that represents the electromagnetic fields in the x and z directions as function of the fields in the y direction are obtained applying the TTL method. The PBG (Photonic Band Gap) structure is analyzed using the homogenization theory, where the objective is obtain the equivalent permittivity of structure. Numerical results of the radiation pattern for some phase excitation in a phased array are shown.

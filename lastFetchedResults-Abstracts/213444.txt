Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs most often to young men at the peak of
their reproductive health. Only 10% of SCI men can father children without medical
assistance due to potential impairments in ejaculation and sperm quality.
Objective: The main objective of this experimental study was to evaluate the
epididymal necrospermia- sperm death, after chronic SCI in rat.
Materials and Methods: Forty-five adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups of
SCI, sham, and control. Following laminectomy, SCI was induced onto exposed dura
matter (TIO) of anesthetized rats . Sham group underwent laminectomy of TIO only ;
while, control rats were not exposed to any type of injury or medication. The
spermatozoa from cauda epididymis were aspirated after 50 days for analysis of
necrospermia with three assays of Eosin-Y staining, Hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS), and
Hoechst 33258 fluorescent dye.
Results: The rate of necrospermia in SCI rats was significantly increased when
compared with other groups (p<0.05). Also, the rates of necrspermia in SCI samples
were similar with application of 3 assays (Eosin-Y: 46.l1±9.41; HOS: 45.88±8.89;
Hoechst: 46.76±9.3 1). Total necrospermia was not observed in any of the epididymal
samples.
Conclusio n: The results showed that chronic SCI is associated with high rate of
epididymal necrospermia in mammals such as rats. It is, therefore, recommended that an
effective laboratory technique, such as Hoechst 33258 should be used for separation of
live and motile sperms from necrospermic ones for assisted reproduction program.

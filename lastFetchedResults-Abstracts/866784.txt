The factory considered in this study consists of a mixed-model assembly line and a workcenter. The mixed-model assembly line (main line) simultaneously produces different product models whose assembly parts are provided in batches by the workcenter. The main purpose of this study is to develop a batch scheduling scheme for the workcenter. The objective function of the scheduling is to provide parts for the main line without delays. The problems that make the scheduling challengeable are as follows: (1) different product models being simultaneously produced on the main line require different parts and (2) space for part inventory in the workcenter is limited. This study presents two batch scheduling approaches used to build a real system for the workcenter.

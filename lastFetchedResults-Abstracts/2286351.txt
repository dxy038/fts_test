Choice-based conjoint experiments are used when choice alternatives can be described in terms of attributes. The objective is to infer the value that respondents attach to attribute levels. This method involves the design of profiles on the basis of attributes specified at certain levels. Respondents are presented sets of profiles and asked to select the one they consider best. However if choice sets have too many profiles, they may be difficult to implement. In this paper we provide strategies for reducing the number of profiles in choice sets. We consider situations where only a subset of interactions is of interest, and we obtain connected main effect plans with smaller choice sets that are capable of estimating subsets of two-factor and three-factor interactions in 2 n and 3 n plans. We also provide connected main effect plans for mixed level designs.

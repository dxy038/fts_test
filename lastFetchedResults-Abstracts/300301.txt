Objective: To determine if hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for the development of diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) and diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are both associated with premature vascular disease. Microvascular ischemia may be a risk factor for DSPN and DAN; therefore, the relationship of hyperhomocysteinemia to DSPN and DAN was investigated. Methods: Baseline neurological tests and homocysteine levels were determined in patients from a large prospective study of diabetic complications, the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial. Results: Total homocysteine (tHcy) was independently associated with DAN; for each 1 Î¼mol/l increase in tHcy, there was a 7.1% increased risk of developing DAN (P<0.05). There was no association between tHcy and DSPN. Conclusions: Hyperhomocysteinemia may be a risk factor for DAN but not for DSPN. This relationship may be related to differential small fiber injury. Further studies are needed to investigate this relationship between tHcy and DAN, specifically whether treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia may modify DAN.

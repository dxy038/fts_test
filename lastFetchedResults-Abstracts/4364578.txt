In this paper the implementation of a simple yet high performance digital current mode controller that achieves high power factor operation for a three phase boost rectifier is explained. This objective is achieved without input voltage sensing and without transformation of the control variables into rotating reference frame. The controller uses a resistor emulator concept for shaping of input current like input voltage in discrete domain. In implementation, Texas InstrumentsÂ´s DSP based unit TMS320F240F EVM is used as the digital hardware platform. The algorithm is tested on a 4 kW, 670 V DC output, boost rectifier. The execution time of the control algorithm is found to be less than 40 &#956;sec

In this paper, optimal corrective control actions are presented to restore the secure operation of power system for different operating conditions. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of the modern optimization techniques, which has been successfully applied in various areas in power systems. Most of the corrective control actions involve simultaneous optimization of several objective functions, which are competing and conflicting each other. The multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to optimize the corrective control actions. Three different procedures based on GA and MOGA are proposed to alleviate the violations of the overloaded lines and minimize the transmission line losses. The first procedure is based on corrective switching of the transmission lines and generation re-dispatch. The second procedure is carried out to determine the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generation (DG). While, the third procedure is concerned into solving the generation-load imbalance problem using load shedding. Numerical simulations are carried out on two test systems in order to examine the validity of the proposed procedures.

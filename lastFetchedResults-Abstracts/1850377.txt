The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many solid tumours. Targeting EGFR is emerging as a potential strategy to incorporate into cancer treatment regimens. Recent data have contributed to our understanding of the therapeutic potentials and limitations of EGFR targeted therapy. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of the various anti-EGFR agents presently in clinical trials. Specifically, we compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these EGFR inhibitors examined in preclinical and clinical studies. These data should enable the clinician to select the most suitable EGFR targeting agent based on objective data.

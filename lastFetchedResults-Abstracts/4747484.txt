This paper presents a methodology to obtain standard models of excitation systems for synchronous generators from time response tests. Excitation system modelling is discussed, and a series of tests are proposed to obtain these models. To obtain the small-signal parameters a continuous-time parameter estimation method with state-space models is used. An improvement to the Gauss-Newton algorithm, used in the minimisation of the objective function, is presented. The accuracy of the parameters obtained is also discussed. The methodology is illustrated in the identification of the excitation of a large hydraulic generator.

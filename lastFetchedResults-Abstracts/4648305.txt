A nonlinear model of a Rolls-Royce turbo machine supported by active magnetic bearings (AMBs) is presented. A multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used as a search and optimisation tool for designing distributed AMB controllers. The MOGA is used to select the controller structure as well as its parameters. The objective domain is comprised of measures of the controllersÂ´ dynamic performance in terms of disturbance and noise rejection, its efficiency and complexity. The optimisation is performed directly on the nonlinear model to ensure that realistic controllers are produced

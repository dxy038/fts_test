In this paper computer environmental planning in the field of forestry is studied. Forestry planningÂ´s target is focused on sustainable ecology development rather than economic concerns. Aim of this research is the creating new planting patterns which makes the future forest more safer against the affects of wind as an example to simulation the sustainable environment. For the reason of computer environment process simulation and planning the forest, recent technological advances in the field of computer aided design and computer aided engineeign are applied. Following it the application of multi-objective optimization based design in automative forest planning is presented.

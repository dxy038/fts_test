Summary form only given. This tutorial is organized into four parts that discuss four viewpoints of integrated management from e-business perspectives, namely (1) business viewpoint, (2) methodology and process viewpoint, (3) architectural viewpoint, (4) technology and standards viewpoint. Part 1 provides a brief review of the evolving e-business models and it discusses the problem of integrated management from the business perspective in terms of the four key management dimensions for e-business: people, organization, process, and technology. The objective of part 2 is to show the need for a holistic perspective on e-business services, integrating business processes with appropriate techniques to assist in the quantification of qualitative business parameters, such as service quality. This part also presents an approach to the study of the management of diverse services through a common 8-stage methodology. While a methodology gives a general guideline for development, architecture is needed to realize the design through software building blocks. Hence part 3 discusses architectures for e-business management in a top-down manner. The discussion covers various viewpoints on e-business management, namely the process view, transaction view, and the infrastructure view. Part 4 discusses various emerging technologies and standards covering the entire e-business constituent areas discussed in part 3. This part discusses various network, systems and application management standards, and their integration, illustrated by a case study of e-business in the telecommunication industry (e-telco).

Introduction & Objective: Tinnitus is one of the most common otologic complaints. This study
was designed for evaluation of different kinds of hearing aids effectiveness in treatment of
tinnitus in elderly patients in Hamadan.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial study 27 referral patients with complaint of tinnitus
and hearing loss to otolaryngology clinics in Hamadan during 2006-7 were evaluated. All
patients evaluated by PTA, SRT, SDS and Tinnitus matching tests. Persons with more than
40db SNHL and SDS above 60% were referred for hearing aid fitting. In each case behind the
ear analogue type of hearing aid were fitted for 3-month course and then it was changed to the
digital type for another 3 months. At the end of each course tinnitus evaluation were done and
the effect of hearing aids on SDS were reevaluated. Subjective patient satisfaction and the
degree oftinnitus diminution were evaluated by designed questionnaire.
Results: From 27 cases 17 were female and 10male and the mean of SDS and severity of
hearing loss were 77.5% and 60db respectively. Moderately to severe hearing loss (35%) and
downward sloping pattern (63%) were the most frequent types of hearing loss and audiogram
patterns. Complete recovery of tinnitus were achieved in 55.6% of digital and 33.3% of
analogue hearing aids users and the difference between them were significant(p=0.02). Digital
and analogue hearing aids performance were satisfactory in 70.4% and 33.3% of the patients
respectively and the difference between them were significant too (p< 0,001). Diminution of
tinnitus intensity in digital group were more than analogue one (p=0.03) and improvement of
SDS before and after fitting of digital hearing aid were better than analogue group( p<O.OO I).
Conclusion: Digital hearing aids can improve communication abilities and subsiding tinnitus in
elderly patients.

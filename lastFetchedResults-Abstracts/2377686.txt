Background and Objective: Previous studies indicate an inverse association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D level with obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular events. This study was aimed to assess metabolic syndrome correlation with serum Vit-D levels of physicians in Zanjan city (Iran).
Materials and Methods: In an analytical cross-sectional study, a total of 108 physicians were selected and their 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride and HDL were assessed using venous blood. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on ATPIII criteria. Data was analyzed using SPSS software.
Results: The mean serum 25(OH) D concentration was 23.40Â±23.72 ng/ml and its median level was 17.65 ng/ml. 25 (OH) D concentrations  < 20 ng/ml was observed in 62% of the participants. The prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome for the whole sample was 21.2%. The most prevalent components of metabolic syndrome were hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL with a prevalence of 55.6% and 38%, respectively. Significant correlative difference was found between serum 25(OH) D levels and triglyceride (P = 0.009). 
Conclusion: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and metabolic syndrome among physicians in Zanjan was lower than general population. A significant association between serum levels of Vitamin D and triglyceride was detected, which may be due to higher BMI.

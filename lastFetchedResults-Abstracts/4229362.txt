The main objective of this research is to develop an image matching prototype that can retrieve images based on the geometry feature representation of a complete object or a partial object. Consequently, a shape decomposition method is introduced to preserve the shape feature for the remaining portion of a partial object and to simplify the shape complexity by breaking down into segments.

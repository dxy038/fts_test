In the last years various practical appliances of sensor networks have been emerged. Most of them are focused on environmental data gathering. This paper presents a practical and evolutionary wireless sensor network project used to (but not specific to) monitor wine-cellars. This project will be developed and deployed based on incremental prototypes. These prototypes constitute the different steps to reach the final system. Using this type of approach, our team aims to get two distinct objectives: on the one hand to get the final system ready to be used to monitor environmental characteristics of wine-cellars, during the aging phase of the wine, but on the other hand to collect information about the different techniques and methods to get the job of environmental data gathering done. The purpose of this second objective is to compare, evaluate and propose enhancements to the existing data gathering techniques and probably to propose new efficient and robust methods. In this paper we present the first prototype (or the first step) of the WSNet-WineCellar project. In this primary prototype we are experimenting and evaluate the existing "off the shelf" software and hardware to develop data gathering applications in wireless sensor networks.

This paper proposes a systematic method to synthesise &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> loop shaping weights that would optimise performance while maintaining a pre-specified level of optimal robust stability margin. This objective is captured by two optimisation problems expressed in the form of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), which are solved by means of an iterative algorithm. This scheme will aid the designer to gauge the achievable performance of a plant for a specified level of robustness and to adjust pre-designed weights to further enhance performance.

This paper presents a construction of a computer assisted system in dental implantology. Preoperative planning and surgical navigation are two main sub-systems in our proposed system. In the preoperative planning subsystem, we provide different kinds of views to the surgeons based on CT data scanned for a specific patient. And the surgical navigation subsystem uses an infra-red light based navigation camera to locate the precise position of the surgical instrument. The two subsystems will combine together to form a seamless linked all-in-one system for dental implantological surgery. Due to the tight connection between the two subsystems, the depth and orientation of drilling will be tracked under the same coordinate space, which will guarantee the accuracy of match between the preoperative planned position and the realtime navigated position. The main objective of this paper is to present how to build such a system under the direct clinical requirement from dentists. At last, the experiments in phantom study demonstrate that the mean errors of the depth and the angle are 0.772 (mm) and 0.554 (degree) respectively

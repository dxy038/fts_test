Resource scheduling is one of the key problems of cloud computing, no wonder, the scheduling policy and algorithm affect the performance of the cloud system directly. In order to improve the utilization of cloud computing resources and keep load balancing, a cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm based on estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, the idea of population based incremental learning(PBIL) algorithm is fully used. In this paper, cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm model is established firstly, and then objective solution is made by using the PBIL algorithm. Finally, the simulation analysis of algorithm performance is conducted. The simulation results show that the PBIL algorithm can take shorter time to complete task and achieve resource load balancing, especially, for the resource scheduling with large-scale task, the advantages are more apparent.

Biomass gasification can be efficiently integrated with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) to properly deploy the energy content of this renewable source and increasing the ratio of electric to thermal converted energy. The key objective of this work is to analyze in a systematic and wide process the integration of a biomass gasifier process with the SOFC operation. In particular the work aims at identifying the role of SOFC H2 utilization as a basic parameter to maximize the system output and avoid gasifier bad operation issues such as tar production and carbon deposition. An efficient simulation framework is used to that purpose allowing for a detailed analysis of the influence of key driving parameters. The performance of the integrated system is thoroughly analyzed in the range of 1–2 kW electric power by also varying the input biomass characteristics in terms of Moisture Content (MC). Results show how a variation of the SOFC H2 utilization, a parameter whose effects are also correlated with the gasifier air requirement, affects electrical power output also depending on the biomass Moisture Content.

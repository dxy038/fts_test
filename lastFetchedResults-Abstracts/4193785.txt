In this paper a method based mainly on Data Fusion and Artificial Neural Networks to classify one of the most important pollutants such as Particulate Matter less than 10 micrometer in diameter (PM<inf>10</inf>) concentrations is proposed. The main objective is to classify in two pollution levels (Non-Contingency and Contingency) the pollutant concentration. Pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables have been considered in order to build a Representative Vector (RV) of pollution. RV is used to train an Artificial Neural Network in order to classify pollutant events determined by meteorological variables. In the experiments, real time series gathered from the Automatic Environmental Monitoring Network (AEMN) in Salamanca Guanajuato Mexico have been used. The method can help to establish a better air quality monitoring methodology that is essential for assessing the effectiveness of imposed pollution controls, strategies, and facilitate the pollutants reduction.

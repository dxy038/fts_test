This paper reports on preliminary research on food sensing based on evaluation of the electrical properties of food materials at radio frequencies with a focus on determining the quality and life time of the food materials before they deteriorate. The problem of food deterioration could lead to food poisoning and waste. The objective is to sense food items through measurements, to provide an understanding of the complex nature of the RF properties of food materials and their variability and different electrical behaviors. The paper presents a preliminary literature study on the electrical properties of specific food items and a method that is being investigated for use in food sensing using antenna arrays with multiple inputs and outputs.

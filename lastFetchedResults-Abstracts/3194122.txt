In recent years, different mathematical models have been used in comprehensive assessment calculation of various industries. This paper focuses on introducing the same-indefinite-contrary systemic assessment model of set pair analysis, which highlights its characteristics as strongly systemic and combination of qualitative and quantitative. In this model, the paper quotes the improved AHP method to calculate the index weight, analyzes the uncertainty of i in the connection degree expression, and dialectically studies the certainty and uncertainty of the information in engineering system. The evaluation steps and algorithm of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) are introduced. It aims to emphasize that SPA is more dynamic and open than FCE. The paper refers to the comprehensive evaluation of the studentsÂ´ quality, and the comparison of calculation results show that the SPA model is concise, objective and reasonable.

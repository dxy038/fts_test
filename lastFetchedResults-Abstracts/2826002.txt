The paper presents a TS fuzzy controller for a crane planar model developed through combining a local pole placement method and interval analysis of closed-loop characteristic polynomial coefficients. A family of local linear controllers represented by rule conclusions is determined based on the objective function derived from an interval Diophantine equation. The two methods, iterative procedure and evolutionary algorithm are developed to find minimum number of fuzzy sets and tune triangular membership functions satisfying the performances robustness to variation of operating conditions.

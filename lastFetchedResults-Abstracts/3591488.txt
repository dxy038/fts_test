This study provides a systematic thermal design methodology for both single-phase and two-phase micro-channel heat sinks under a fixed liquid coolant flow rate. The parameters relevant to heat sink design are grouped into geometrical parameters, operating parameters, and thermal/fluid parameters. The objective of the proposed thermal design methodology is to determine micro-channel dimensions leading to the most desirable heat sink performance corresponding to a given dissipative heat flux and liquid coolant flow rate. An acceptable design region is first identified which encompasses all possible micro-channel dimensions corresponding to the prescribed dissipative heat flux and liquid coolant flow rate. Heat sink performance maps are then constructed within the acceptable design region. Finally, micro-channel dimensions yielding most desirable heat sink performance can be selected using the performance maps.

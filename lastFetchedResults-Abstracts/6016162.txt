This paper presents a decision making strategy for autonomous multi-platform systems, wherein a number of platforms perform phased missions in order to achieve an overall mission objective. Phased missions are defined for both single and multi-platform systems and a decision making strategy is outlined for such systems. The requirements for a tool performing such a strategy are discussed and methods and techniques, traditionally used for system reliability assessment, are identified to fulfill these requirements. Two examples are presented in order to demonstrate how a decision making tool would be employed in practice. Finally, a brief discussion of the efficient implementation of such a strategy is presented.

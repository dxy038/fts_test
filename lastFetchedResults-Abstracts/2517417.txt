Background: Common cold is the most common infection in children and has multiple complications including acute otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia.
Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Echinacea in lowering the incidence of common cold and its complications in 1 to 5 years old children.
Methods: In a randomized clinical trial 100 children aged 1 to 5 years old were included in the study. Children were randomly assigned either to receive Echinacea (0.5 ml daily for children 1-2 y/o and 2 ml daily for children 2-8 y/o) and the other group as control did not consumed medication for 3 months. Children were followed for 3 months for occurrence of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI), sinusitis and otitis media. Chi-Square and T-test were used for data analysis.
Results: Two groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The incidence of URI and sinusitis was lower in Echinacea group (P < 0.05) but the incidence of acute otitis media was not different in two groups. The frequency of URI, sinusitis and otitis did not differ between two groups.
Conclusion: Echinacea is effective and safe and is recommended for prophylaxis of common cold and for prevention of its complications in children.

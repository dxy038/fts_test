Introduction: Oral carcinoma is among the most common cancers and one of the top-10 causes of death worldwide. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has the highest incidence and the lowest survival rate among oral cancer cases.  The study of OSCC epidemiology, incidence rate, and its association with age and gender among the patients could provide the oral and maxillofacial specialists as well as health officials and policy workers with valuable information.
Objective: Analysis of OSCC incidence rate and its association with sex and age among the oral cancer patients in the Guilan province during the 1378-87 period.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive and prospective  study was done by reviewing 12686 files of the cancer patients recorded by the Guilan Cancer Registry Center during  1377-87.  Medical information including age, gender, the type of cancer, and anatomical location of the tumor were extracted from the patients' records.  Data analysis was performed using SPSS software and chi-square test and Kruskal–Wallis.
Results: Among the total number of files studied, 2364 (18.6%) were diagnosed as head and neck carcinoma cases, of which 1152 (48.7%) were recorded as SCC, with a male to female ratio of 1.7:1 and a mean age of 63.41 ± 15.41 years.The most involved areas were tongue with 35.2% cases and buccal region with 24.4% cases. The 70-80 year age group had the largest number of 37patients (28%) with OSCC.
Conclusion: Our results show that the incidence of OSCC is significantly higher in the 8th decade of life. We also found that the most common risk site of the tumor in young patients is the tongue.

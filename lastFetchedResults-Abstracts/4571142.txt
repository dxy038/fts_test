The paper deals with the three dimensional modelling of the human body exposed to extremely low frequency (ELF) high voltage electric fields by mean of the boundary element method (BEM). Numerical results along head, neck, torso, abdomen, arms, legs and ankles are presented and discussed in the case of grounded subject standing under power distribution lines. The objective is to characterise the influence of different shape and geometrical factors on the current distribution inside the body and electric field in the near field. The inclusion of legs and arms with different orientations with respect to the incident field are considered. The main contribution is to present new results of the BEM for extremely low frequency exposure and to evaluate the relationship between degree of detail in 3D modelling and the corresponding fluctuation of results for induced currents

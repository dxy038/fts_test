This paper presents an algorithm for minimizing an objective function subject to conventional inequality constraints as well as to inequality constraints of the functional type: <img alt="\\max _{\\omega \\in \\Omega } \\phi(z,\\omega ) \\leq 0" src="/images/tex/3766.gif"/> , where &#937; is a closed interval in <img alt="R" src="/images/tex/1065.gif"/> , and <img alt="z \\in R^{n}" src="/images/tex/3767.gif"/> is the parameter vector to be optimized. The algorithm is motivated by a standard earthquake engineering problem and the problem of designing linear multivariable systems. The stability condition (Nyquist criterion) and disturbance suppression condition for such systems are easily expressed as a functional inequality constraint.

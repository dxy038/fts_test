In this paper, optimal gains tuning of a fuzzy
PID controller for solution of the multi area restructure
problem is proposed using Multi Objective Harmony
Search Algorithm (MOHSA). The problem of robustly
tuning of fuzzy PID based AGC design is formulated as
an optimization problem according to the time domain
based objective function which is solved by the MOHSA
technique that has a strong ability to find the most
optimistic results. To ensure performance and robustness
of the proposed control strategy to stabilize frequency
oscillations, the design process takes a wide range of
operating conditions and system nonlinearities into
account. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method a four-area restructured power system is
considered as a test system under different operating
conditions. The simulation results are shown to maintain
robust performance in comparison with the HPSOCFA,
RGA and BGA based tuned PID controllers through FD
and ITAE performance indices. Results evaluation show
that the proposed control strategy achieves good robust
performance for wide range of system parameters and
load changes. Moreover, the proposed control strategy
has simple structure, easy to implement and tune which
can be useful for the real world restructured power
system.

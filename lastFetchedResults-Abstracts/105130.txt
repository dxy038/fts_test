This paper describes the solution of power quality problems arising from 12-pulse smelter converters in the ETI Aluminum Works, Seydis$80ehir, Turkey. The design work is based on practical data collected in the field as well as on the results of detailed simulation studies obtained by EMTDC/PSCAD, SPICE, and MATLAB. The main design objective is to meet both present regulations and harmonic standards by using robust, reliable, and cost-effective systems with a long life expectancy. The shunt-connected passive reactive power compensation system is composed of a damped 11th harmonic filter and a make-up filter tuned to the 5th harmonic with optional damping resistor. Such a system exhibits nearly transient-free switching and series-resonance proof characteristics owing to damping resistors. A close correlation has been obtained between theoretical results and field data.

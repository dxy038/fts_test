Objective: In todayâ€™s world, 2.45-GHz radio-frequency radiation (RFR) from industrial,
scientific, medical, military and domestic applications is the main part of indoor-outdoor
electromagnetic field exposure. Long-term effects of 2.45-GHz Wi-Fi radiation on male
reproductive system was not known completely. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate
the major cause of male infertility during short- and long-term exposure of Wi-Fi radiation.
Materials and Methods: This is an animal experimental study, which was conducted in
the Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical
Sciences, Zanjan, IRAN, from June to August 2014. Three-month-old male Wistar rats
(n=27) were exposed to the 2.45 GHz radiation in a chamber with two Wi-Fi antennas on
opposite walls. Animals were divided into the three following groups: I. control group (n=9)
including healthy animals without any exposure to the antenna, II. 1-hour group (n=9) exposed
to the 2.45 GHz Wi-Fi radiation for 1 hour per day during two months and III.7-hour
group (n=9) exposed to the 2.45 GHz Wi-Fi radiation for 7 hours per day during 2 months.
Sperm parameters, caspase-3 concentrations, histomorphometric changes of testis in addition
to the apoptotic indexes were evaluated in the exposed and control animals.
Results: Both 1-hour and 7-hour groups showed a decrease in sperm parameters in a
time dependent pattern. In parallel, the number of apoptosis-positive cells and caspase-3
activity increased in the seminiferous tubules of exposed rats. The seminal vesicle weight
reduced significantly in both1-hour or 7-hour groups in comparison to the control group.
Conclusion: Regarding to the progressive privilege of 2.45 GHz wireless networks in
our environment, we concluded that there should be a major concern regarding the timedependent
exposure of whole-body to the higher frequencies of Wi-Fi networks existing in
the vicinity of our living places.

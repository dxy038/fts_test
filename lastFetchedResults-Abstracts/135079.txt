BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fascioliasis is a zoonotic disease that often involves sheep. Sometimes, it may be found in human as an accidental host. It is mainly occurred by consumption of contaminated herbs with metacercarias of fasiola hepatica. The adult phase is in the biliary tree. Most of the human infections are without symptom. This study was done on a case of fascioliasis with uncommon clinical manifestation.
CASE: An eight year old child referred with abdominal distention and with fever from four months ago. Severe ascites and hepatosplenomegaly were found in physical examination. In paraclinical investigations, eosinophilia in peripheral blood smear, eosinophilic granuloma in liver, and positive serologic titers and ova of fasciola hepatica in stool were seen. The patient was successfully treated with triclabendazole without any side effects.
CONCLUSION: In children, fascioliasis should be considered in differential diagnosis of ascites with eosinophilia. The administration of triclabendazole is recommended for children with fascioliasis.

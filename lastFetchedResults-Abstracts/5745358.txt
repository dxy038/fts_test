The main objective of this work is to process the voice signal and is implemented to control a wheelchair by the voice signal which is processed earlier. The adopted model is to combine PIC microcontroller and VRbot module with voice recognition system for identifying individual words and is speaker dependent. The command given by the user is taken into VRbot module by microphone which is built within speech recognition module. Once voice command is recognized, the signal is transferred to the controller where stepper motor module is connected. PIC microcontroller capture appropriate signals from speech recognition module and wait for the Ultrasonic Sensor, which is doing the process of obstacle detection in its path. Whenever the conditions, signal to move from VRbot and no obstacle detection from Ultrasonic Sensor is received, the motion of wheelchair is performed.

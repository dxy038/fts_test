3D human body models have been widely used in all fields. For acquiring precise human body models, the research about their recognition and reconstruction has become a major topic. Here we present a new method for modeling 3D human body based on single Kinect from the viewpoint of cost and operability. In this method, human body 3D information is recognized and acquired by only one Kinect while 3D human body models are reconstructed by using the tools of Processing and Point Cloud Library. To achieve the reconstruction objective, the iterative closest point algorithm is adopted for registering the captured upper human body 3D point cloud data with the standard reference human body data. The experiment results demonstrate that this method is feasible.

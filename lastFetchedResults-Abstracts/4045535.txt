INSTRUMENTATION for recording turbine speed, eccentricity, expansion, and vibration is now widely used on large steam turbines, particularly those over 80,000 kw. Most previous instrument systems for these measurements utilized four individual ink-type recorders; hence, one objective in developing a new instrument system was to use fewer recorders, reducing the panel space required. In addition, a high degree of reliability, long life, and good accessibility for inspection and servicing were major objectives.

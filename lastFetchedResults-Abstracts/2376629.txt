As e-commerce continues to grow, so does the opportunity for perpetrating online fraud. As a result many researches have focused to reduce the risks and costs of online transactions by providing fraud detection schemes. These methods are one of the main components of any online monitoring and automated fraud detection system. The objective of these methods is to minimize the cost of electronic payment fraud. Existing methods have benefited from artificial intelligence, data mining, fuzzy logic, and bio inspired algorithms such as genetic algorithms or artificial immune systems. Each of these methods have addressed one or more challenges in online fraud such as as skewed data, large volume of data, or fast response time, to name a few.
In this paper, we present an overview of fraud detection systems that are based on data mining. We start by enumerating the main challenges of fraud detection in electronic payment transactions, and then we review and categorize some of the most recent methods in this area.

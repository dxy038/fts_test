Mashups are composite applications that combine views and data from two or more data sources. Mashups have grown to be popular for dynamic social networks on the web. The objective of this paper is to display that mashups are useful in enterprise settings as well, since mashups can be used to organize information presented to the user according to relevance priority, and personalized, if necessary, according to the userÂ´s choices.

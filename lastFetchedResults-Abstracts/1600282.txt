Different kinds of meta-heuristic algorithms have been recently utilized to overcome the
complex nature of optimum design of structures. In this paper, an integrated optimization
procedure with the objective of minimizing the self-weight of real size structures is simply
performed interfacing SAP2000 and MATLAB® softwares in the form of parallel computing.
The meta-heuristic algorithm chosen here is Cuckoo Search (CS) recently developed as a type
of population based algorithm inspired by the behavior of some Cuckoo species in
combination with the Lévy flight behavior. The CS algorithm performs suitable selection of
sections from the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) wide-flange (W) shapes
list. Strength constraints of the AISC load and resistance factor design specification, geometric
limitations and displacement constraints are imposed on frames. Effective time-saving
procedure using simple parallel computing, as well as utilizing reliable analysis and design
tool are also some new features of the present study. The results show that the proposed
method is effective in optimizing practical structures.

Vegetation phenology was corresponding to the date of obvious change of vegetation. Regional vegetation phenology data were the basis for monitoring vegetation growth and predicting disaster and so on. The objective of the paper was to establish a method of monitoring regional vegetation phenology based on MODIS data. Double Logistic function was used to smooth the multi-temporal NDVI data to simulate the growing process of the vegetation. Through analyzing the fitted NDVI curve, four key plant phonological variables were extracted, including the start of the season, the end of the season, the length of the season and the largest value of the NDVI. The results showed that MODIS data could monitor the regional vegetation phenophase.

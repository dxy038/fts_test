In this paper we give a survey of multi-objective scheduling that have appeared in the literature or are to appear. Firstly, some basic concepts about multi-objective optimization and prevalent approaches for multi-objective optimization are given. Then, several multi-objective scheduling models are introduced and the comprehensive review of recent study on them is summarized. Finally, the trend of multi-objective scheduling are discussed.

A simulated annealing (SA) based approach to power system stabilizer (PSS) and FACTS based stabilizer tuning has been investigated in this paper. The design problem of PSS and FACTS based stabilizer is formulated as an optimization problem. An eigenvalue-based objective function to increase the system damping is proposed. Then, SA algorithm is employed to search for optimal stabilizer parameters. Different control schemes have been proposed and tested on a weakly connected power system with different disturbances, loading conditions, and parameter variations. Nonlinear simulation results show the potential of SA algorithm to the tuning problem of PSS and FACTS based stabilizer. Effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control schemes over a wide range of loading conditions and system parameter variations have been demonstrated. It was also observed that the SPS controller provides most of the damping and improves greatly the voltage profile of the system under severe disturbances.

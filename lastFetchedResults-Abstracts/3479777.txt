Recently, the author and his colleagues developed the Federated Computer-Aided Design System. The objective of this paper is to discuss the experience gained by using this system on a broad range of problems. From this perspective, the needs and future trends in the area are discussed. Of primary interest is the need for a blending of software engineering and controls to provide more effective micro-processor systems.

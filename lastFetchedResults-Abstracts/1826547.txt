In this paper, design optimization of Permanent Magnet-Brushless DC (PM-BLDC) motor is
presented by using Elitist Genetic Algorithm (GA). For this purpose, three objective functions are
considered i.e. total loss and power density of the motor and combinations of both. Aim of this paper
is to optimize the motor with these three objective functions separately. The first two objective
functions are single-objective but for the third case, multi-objective optimization is performed in
which total loss and power density that are technically opposite are formulated into one single
objective. Seven design variables including stator inner diameter (D), axial length of motor (L), pole
pitch (?p), specific magnetic loading (Bav), specific electric loading (ac), stator back-iron length (hbis)
and stator slot height (hs) are chosen as optimization variables. Optimization is carried out by Elitist
GA which has a better performance in comparison with conventional GA. Optimization results show
that multi-objective functions performs much better comparing to single-objective functions because
more reliable and realistic design optimization would be carried out by multi-objective functions. At
last, Finite Element Method (FEM) is used that its results have well validated the analytical design
optimization.

Objective: To find out the association of serum uric acid with type-II diabetes mellitus and to compare the level of serum uric acid between obese and non-obese type-II diabetics.Material and Methods: Fifty obese and fifty non-obese diabetic patients were included in the study one hundred non-diabetic subjects were selected as control group. The results were analysed by t-test for serum uric acid, glucose and lipid profile.Results: The mean level of serum uric acid in obese type-II diabetic patients was 6.07 mg/dl as compared to 5.01 mg/dl in the control group. The difference was significant statistically.Conclusion: Hyperuricemia is significantly associated with type-II diabetes mellitus and can increase the morbidity and mortality from diabetes if not managed in time.

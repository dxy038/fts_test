This paper proposes a non-isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter for use in renewable power generation, fuel cell, battery, electric vehicles (EV), and small scale DC-UPS systems. Compared to the traditional bidirectional dc-dc converters, the proposed converter integrates interleaved synchronous energy flow and soft switching technology. By using a resonant cell, the converter can realize zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) where both the switch and the rectifier diode achieve soft condition without increasing their voltage and current stresses. The proposed converter has the advantages of simple circuitry, reduced size, low cost and high efficiency because of a sing resonant inductor. The operation principle of the converter is analyzed and described. Simulation results of the proposed bidirectional ZVT dc-dc converter are shown to verify its feasibility.

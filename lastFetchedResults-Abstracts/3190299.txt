Cross talk is one of the most annoying distortions in the visualization stage of stereoscopic systems. Specifically, both pattern and amount of cross talk in multi-view auto-stereoscopic displays are more complex because of viewing angle dependability, when compared to cross talk in 2-view stereoscopic displays. Regarding system cross talk there are objective measures to assess it in auto-stereoscopic displays. However, in addition to system cross talk, cross talk perceived by users is also impacted by scene content. Moreover, some cross talk is arguably beneficial in auto-stereoscopic displays. Therefore, in this paper, we further assess how cross talk is perceived by users with various scene contents and different viewing positions using auto-stereoscopic displays. In particular, the proposed subjective cross talk assessment methodology is realistic without restriction of the users viewing behavior and is not limited to the specific technique used in auto-stereoscopic displays. The test was performed on a slanted parallax barrier based auto-stereoscopic display. The subjective cross talk assessment results show their consistence to the system cross talk meanwhile more scene content and viewing position related cross talk perception information is provided. This knowledge can be used to design new cross talk perception metrics.

This paper presents an innovative wheel direct drive which uses a novel topology of axial-flux permanent magnet machine having multi-stage structure and water-cooled air-wound stator winding. Battery supply of the motor is accomplished by means of a water-cooled IGBT power electronic interface which is the cascade of a bidirectional DC-to-DC buck-boost converter and current regulated PWM inverter. The paper discusses design and construction of a 25 kW prototype of the proposed wheel direct drive, which will find application in the propulsion system of a novel city car

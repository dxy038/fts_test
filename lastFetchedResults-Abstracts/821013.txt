This paper develops a bi-objective portfolio selection problem that maximizes returns and minimizes a risk measure called conditional Drawdown (CDD). The drawdown measures include the maximal Drawdown and Average Drawdown as its limiting case. The CDD family of risk functional is similar to conditional value at Risk (CVaR). In this paper, the fuzzy method has been used to solve the bi-objectives model. The relevance of the proposed model is illustrated by a real life portfolio selection.

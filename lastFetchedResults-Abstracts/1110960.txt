The transition in deformation textures between low stacking fault energy f.c.c. metals (e.g. brass textures) and the medium to high stacking fault energy f.c.c. metals (e.g. copper textures) is addressed. A detailed microscopy investigation was conducted in parallel with texture measurements on deformed samples of copper and 70/30 brass to different strain levels in three different deformation paths, namely, plane strain compression, simple compression, and simple shear. The objective of the study was to identify the specific trends in the transition between the brass textures and the copper textures that correlated with the onset of deformation twinning and those that correlated with the onset of micro-scale shear banding. It was found that several important transitions in the evolution of the deformation textures, especially in the rolled samples, correlated not with the onset of deformation twinning but with the onset of micro-scale shear banding. These results strongly suggest that the critical feature in texture transition is not twinning directly, but the shear banding promoted by the high strain hardening rates of low stacking fault energy f.c.c. metal.

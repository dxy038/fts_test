This paper presents a study on joint optimization of antenna orientation and spectrum allocation, with the objective of maximizing the total throughput of a cognitive radio network. The mathematical model is presented and subsequently formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. We obtain the optimal solution by adopting the branch and bound algorithm. Through simulation results, we investigate the impact of different parameters on the capacity performance of the cognitive radio network, including the transmit power and antenna directionality.

The risk of occupationally acquired tuberculosis (TB) remains a concern, even now that the infection has been under control to a great extent. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of latent TB infection and pulmonary TB, and to assess the risk factors for TB, among health care workers in Hamadan. Tuberculin skin test was performed on 245 health care workers, in two educational hospitals. The reaction was considered as &quot;positive&quot; if the induration diameter was â‰¥ 10 mm. Individuals with a positive test &gt; than 15 mm were encouraged to seek further medical evaluation, including a chest-x-ray and a smear and sputum culture of the sputum for acid-fast bacilli, in those with radiographic changes indicating TB. Out of 245 health-care workers included in this study, 92 (38%) had positive tuberculin test. There was a significant association between aging and tuberculin positivity. There was also a significant association between the length of employment and tuberculin positivity. Ward attendants had higher rates of positive test results, compared with other occupational groups. It was concluded that latent TB infection is common among health-care workers in the studied region. Age, occupational group and employment length were found to be strongly associated with tuberculin positivity.

The design of a linear phase FIR filter is formulated as a constrained minimization problem. The constraints express the maximally flat pass band frequency response requirement. The objective function is formed as a convex combination of two objective functions representing the energy of the error between the frequency responses of the desired and designed filters in both the stop and pass bands. This extends the results obtained where the mean squares error was minimized only over the stop band

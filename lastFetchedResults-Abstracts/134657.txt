BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOs) has been studied for years but the most intriguing issue of PCOs that is causal factors affecting on ovarian function are still unknown. Neuroendocrine drug therapies which affect on ovarian and adrenal function are currently used for treating patients with PCOs.
METHODS: This controlled clinical trial was done on 60 patients with PCOs referred to Mirza Koochak Khan hospital in Tehran during 2000-2001. Hormonal tests and the degree of hirsutism (Freeman- Galloway score) and medium diameter of ovaries were monitored by abdominal sonography at third day of the first menstruation during 6 month treatment. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (each group 30 persons). First and second groups were treated with OCPLD and OCPLD with GnRH agonist, respectively.
FINDINGS: Both therapeutical regimens were effective in reducing androgen levels, Freeman Gallway score and medium ovarian diameters during 6 month treatment. However, this reduction in second group in comparison to first group was significantly more. This reduction of plasma testosterone, androstenedione, LHIFSH, medium diameters of overies and hirsutism in second group was significantly more than first group.
CONCLUSION: According to the obtained data, it could be concluded that efficacy of the combined regimen (GnRHagomst+ OCPLD) is higher than OCP ID alone in treatment of patients with PCOs.

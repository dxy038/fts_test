Background and objective: The fibrinolytic regulator tetranectin (TN), in association with the circulating intercellular adhesive molecule-1 (clCAM-1) and interleukin -10 (IL-10), may be involved in the metastatic cascade of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Our aim was to investigate the potential usefulness of these molecules as prognostic markers in B-CLL. Design and methods: Therefore, TN, clCAM-1, and IL-10 were assessed (ELISA) in the serum of 53 B-CLL patients, classified in Binet A, B, and C stages in comparison with those in 45 healthy subjects (HS). Results: TN was significantly lower in B-CLL patients than in HS (9.63 [8.75-11.51] mg/L, 13.75 [12.56-14.64] ng/mL, respectively, p < 10power- 5), being lower (p = 0.05) in B and C stage patients (subgroup B+C) than in A stage ones (subgroup A). clCAM-1 levels were significantly higher in B-CLL patients than in HS (475.86 [355.86-593.79] ng/mL vs. 225.62 [118.49-312.83] ng/mL, respectively, p < 10power-5 with a tendency for higher levels in suAbgroup B+C than in subgroup A. A significant correlation of clCAM-1 with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (rs = 0.532, p = 0.049), and a significant increase in clCAM-1 in B-CLL with diffuse bone marrow infiltration (BMI) compared to that in B-CLL with nondiffuse BMI (624.48 (557.24-726.55] ng/mL vs. 480.34 [368,96-590.34] ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.0172) were found. A significant negative correlation between TN and clCAM-1 (rs= -0.5017, p = 0.0001) was observed. IL-10 was detected in all B-CLL patients and in no HS (7.37 [5.30-10.55] pg/mL), being higher (p = 0.0153) in C than in A stage patients. A significant correlation of IL-10 with TN and clCAM-1 in subgroup B+C (rs= -0.659 (p = 0.014] and rs = 0.679(P = 0.011], respectively) was found. Conclusions: The abovementioned findings and good performance characteristics of TN and clCAM-1 in B-CLL suggest the potential usefulness of these adhesive/recognition molecules as prognostic markers in B-CLL. The implication of these molecules along with IL-10 in the diAAsease process deserves further study. Copyright Â© 1999 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists

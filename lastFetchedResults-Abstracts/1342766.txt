The primary aim of this paper was to develop a more effective and economical procedure for cleaning polyethylene hollow fiber microfiltration membranes that have been used for removing oil from contaminated seawater. Alkaline cleaning showed higher recovery of operating cycle time but lower permeate flux recovery than acid cleaning. The combination of both alkaline and acid cleaning agents gave the best operating cycle time and flux recoveries (e.g. 96% and 94%, respectively). As the cleaning agent soaking time was reduced, the actual operating cycle time was reduced. However, the ratio of operating time/chemical cleaning time increased as the soaking time was reduced. The soaking time was recommended to be as short as possible (8â€“10 h) in the design of small capacity plants and 30 h or higher in case of large capacity plants. SEM analysis showed that in case of alkaline cleaning, most of the pores remained covered with a foulant layer, resulting in low flux recovery. The SEM results of acid cleaned membranes showed more complete removal of the foulant layer from the pores resulting in better flux recovery. Surface analysis of membranes cleaned with combined acid/base agents showed the best results. A membrane surface similar to the original one was obtained. The long-term objective is to increase the understanding of membrane fouling phenomena, preventive means and membrane cleaning processes as it applies to the clean-up and desalination of oil contaminated seawater.

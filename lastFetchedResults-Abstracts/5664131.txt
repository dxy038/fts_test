The development of a new digital signal processing card is described. This card, a PC slot plug-in card, is based on the AT&amp;T 32-bit floating point specialised signal processor, the DSP32C. Although it is a general purpose processing card, the specific application it has been developed for, is the voltage and current signal processing for quality measuring and monitoring in electric power supply lines. This characterisation involves measuring in real time the main perturbations distorting the global quality. The digital system used for these measurements needs a DSP based hardware. The objective has been to develop a truly low cost card

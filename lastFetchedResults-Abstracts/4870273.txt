In this paper, control of nonlinear teleoperator systems where both the master and slave systems are kinematically redundant robot manipulators is addressed. The controller is developed under the assumption that the user and environmental input forces are unmeasurable. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to prove that the proposed controller yields asymptotic tracking results and ensures the coordination of the master and slave systems while satisfying a sub-task objective.

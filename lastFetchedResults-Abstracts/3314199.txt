The power system which is independent has been used in the modern new armored vehicle. This paper describes a method for the analysis of the armored power grid fault diagnosis. Taking into account the structure and characteristics of armored vehicle, a kind of complete analytic model which is considering the influence of each protection and the joint influence between the main and back-up protections applies to the system. This model uses the improved discrete Particle Swarm Optimization to solve the objective function. The Particle Swarm Optimization has better population diversity, convergence and global optimal ability. The example verification shows that the rationality and veracity of the proposed method.

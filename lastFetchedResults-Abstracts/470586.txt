Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare Monsel's paste with fulguration with ball electrode for hemostasis after loop electrosurgical excision procedure.
Study design
One hundred healthy women were assigned randomly by computer-generated random numbers to ball electrode or thickened Monsel's paste for hemostasis after loop electrosurgical excision procedure. Patients rated pain during hemostasis using a visual analog scale. At 2 weeks, postprocedural vaginal discharge was rated on a Likert scale. Pathology was reviewed for dysplasia grade and margin status. Recurrent dysplasia on repeat Papanicolaou tests was noted.
Results
Six patients (2 Monsel's and 4 fulguration) required an alternate method of hemostasis. Patient demographics, postprocedural discharge, and recurrent dysplasia were comparable between the 2 groups. Visual analog scale scores and hemostasis time were significantly higher in the fulguration group. Estimated blood loss, although higher in the fulguration group, was not significant between groups.
Conclusion
Monsel's paste and fulguration with ball electrode appear be equally effective as hemostatic agents after loop electrosurgical excision procedure.

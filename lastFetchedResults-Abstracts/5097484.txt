In this paper an algorithm is described to optimally locate fault indicators in radial distribution feeders considering the existing switching equipments and feeder configuration. The objective function of the optimization problem is explained. We will then go through the process of taking GIS system into use to develop the optimization tool. Case study results are analysed for a real network.

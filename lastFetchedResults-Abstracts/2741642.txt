Objective performance assessment is a key enabling factor for the development of better and better image processing algorithms. In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) despeckling, however, the lack of speckle-free images precludes the use of reliable full-reference measures, leaving the comparison among competing techniques on shaky bases. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the objective (quantitative) assessment of SAR despeckling techniques, based on simulation of SAR images relevant to canonical scenes. Each image is generated using a complete SAR simulator that includes proper physical models for the sensed surface, the scattering, and the radar operational mode. Therefore, in the limits of the simulation models, the employed simulation procedure generates reliable and meaningful SAR images with controllable parameters. Through simulating multiple SAR images as different instances relevant to the same scene we can therefore obtain, a true multilook full-resolution SAR image, with an arbitrary number of looks, thus generating (by definition) the closest object to a clean reference image. Based on this concept, we build a full performance assessment framework by choosing a suitable set of canonical scenes and corresponding objective measures on the SAR images that consider speckle suppression and feature preservation. We test our framework by studying the performance of a representative set of actual despeckling algorithms; we verify that the quantitative indications given by numerical measures are always fully consistent with the rationale specific of each despeckling technique, strongly agrees with qualitative (expert) visual inspections, and provide insight into SAR despeckling approaches.

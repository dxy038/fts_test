The problem of salient region detection is formulated as the well-studied facility location problem from operations research. High-level priors are combined with low-level features to detect salient regions. Salient region detection is achieved by maximizing a sub modular objective function, which maximizes the total similarities (i.e., total profits) between the hypothesized salient region centers (i.e., facility locations) and their region elements (i.e., clients), and penalizes the number of potential salient regions (i.e., the number of open facilities). The similarities are efficiently computed by finding a closed-form harmonic solution on the constructed graph for an input image. The saliency of a selected region is modeled in terms of appearance and spatial location. By exploiting the sub modularity properties of the objective function, a highly efficient greedy-based optimization algorithm can be employed. This algorithm is guaranteed to be at least a (e - 1)/e 0.632-approximation to the optimum. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several recently proposed saliency detection approaches.

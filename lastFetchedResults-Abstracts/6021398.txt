Detecting and characterizing the community structure of complex network is fundamental. There are many algorithms, were sorted to three types of criterion: mathematical method,mechanism of community structure and optimization method. In this paper, we discuss the optimization methods of community detection, compare and analyse the objective functions and solution methods. Based on this, we develop a new optimization function, named community quantification which is accurate for many types of networks.

This article is a short report of a research project carried out, upon the recommendation of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, by the Department of Librarianship and Information Science of Meshed Ferdowsi University between 2003-2004. The goal was to study and revise the current curriculum to bring it closer to the changing needs of the present society. The curricula of the U.S.A., England, Australia, India and Iran were reviewed and compared with the objective of introducing a new syllabus for the two fields of Information Management and IT Management. The new curriculum was sent to some experts and faculty members of the departments of Librarianship and Information Science of Iran that ran courses at M. A. level. They were asked to issue their comments on the curriculum. Then, the final version of the curriculum was verified after undergoing some revisions by the Revising Committee of Meshed Ferdowsi University. The new curriculum was also sent to the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology to be sent to universities after being approved by the Ministry.

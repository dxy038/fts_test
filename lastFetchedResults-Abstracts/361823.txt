Study objective: The task force assessed the needs, demands, feasibility, and content of training for US civilian emergency medical responders (paramedics, nurses, and physicians) for nuclear/biological/chemical (NBC) terrorism. Methods: A task force representing key professional organizations, stakeholders, and disciplines involved in emergency medical response conducted an iterated instructional-design analysis on the feasibility and content of such training with input from educational professionals. We then analyzed 6 previously developed training courses for their congruence with our recommendations. Results: The task force produced descriptions of learning groups, content and learning objectives, and barriers and challenges to NBC education. Access to training and sustainment of learning (retention of knowledge) represent the significant barriers. The courses analyzed by the task force did not meet all objectives and challenges addressed. Conclusion: The task force recommends training programs and materials need to be developed to overcome the identified barriers and challenges to learning for these audiences. Furthermore, the task force recommends incorporating NBC training into standard training programs for emergency medical professionals.

The objective of this study was to identify how load-carrying postures and gender affect postural sway. Eight males and eight females (19-30 years old) participated in the study. The participants were instructed to look straight ahead and stand upright on a force platform as still as possible with feet together. A 10-kg load was carried in three different postures during upright stance: anterior load carriage, lateral load carriage, and posterior load carriage. Objective postural sway measures and subjective ratings of postural stability were used to assess balance control behaviors. Experimental findings suggested that lateral load carriage appeared to be more stable than anterior and posterior load carriage, and the females might have higher fall risks than males when carrying external loads. Practical implications and limitations of the study were discussed.

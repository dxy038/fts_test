Automatic recognition of formulas is one of the key parts in an OCR system. It could be really useful to be able to re-use knowledge in the scientific books which are not available in electronic form. A method of optical formula recognition is described. It consists of two major steps, namely, symbol recognition and structural analysis. Firstly, the search and process connect the components to gain the symbol components followed by symbol recognition. After that, we analyze the structure of the formula on the basis of the recognition result and the geometry features. The system works reliably on almost noiseless images obtained by scanning among the usual documents clearly printed.

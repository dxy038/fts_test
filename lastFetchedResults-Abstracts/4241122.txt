Two time-honored questions that the practitioners of Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) are frequently asked by their colleagues engaged in the design of electromagnetic systems are: (i) What is new in CEM; and (ii) What can you do to solve my problems. Their curiosity probably stems from the fact that CEM is being used more and more as a design tool for a wide variety of electromagnetic problems such as antennas, arrays, sensors, nanotechnology devices, etc., to name just a few. Since running through a large number of iteration steps to arrive at the final design is a very timeconsuming as well as expensive procedure, it is being increasingly apparent to the designer that an approach that can lead them to what is sometimes described as "correct by design," or CBD, is the best strategy to follow, and that reliable, computationally efficient and accurate CEM modeling tools are needed to accomplish their objective of rapid designing and prototyping, which in turn reduce the time to market. In this paper we will show that rapid developments in the emerging areas mentioned above are not only presenting us with new challenges, but are also fueling the development of innovative CEM techniques, the likes of which we have not seen heretofore.

SKAN: Skin Scanner - System for Skin Cancer Detection Using Adaptive Techniques - combines computer engineering concepts with areas like dermatology and oncology. Its objective is to discern images of skin cancer, specifically melanoma, from others that show only common spots or other types of skin diseases, using image recognition. This work makes use of the ABCDE visual rule, which is often used by dermatologists for melanoma identification, to define which characteristics are analyzed by the software. It then applies various algorithms and techniques, including an ellipse-fitting algorithm, to extract and measure these characteristics and decide whether the spot is a melanoma or not. The achieved results are presented with special focus on the adaptive decision-making and its effect on the diagnosis. Finally, other applications of the software and its algorithms are presented.

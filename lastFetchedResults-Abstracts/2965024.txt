An optimal substrate feeding strategy for an industrial scale fed-batch fermenter is determined through iterative dynamic programming in order to maximize cell-mass production and to minimize ethanol formation. The objective function is maximized with respect to the sugar feed rate. The obtained optimal policy indicates considerable increase in yeast production achieved while minimizing the undesired by-product-ethanol

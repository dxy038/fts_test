In this paper Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been used to minimize the active power loss and the total cost function, which includes the generation costs and the UPFC investment cost, through optimally placing the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) in the power system network. Three objective functions are taken as the indexes of the system performance; identification of most suitable buses using line loss sensitivity index, minimization of active power loss and total generation cost by employing PSO. For the validation and comparison purposes of the proposed techniques, simulations are carried out on modified IEEE 14-bus power system. Results validate that the static performances of the power system can be successfully improved due to the optimal allocation of single UPFC controller.

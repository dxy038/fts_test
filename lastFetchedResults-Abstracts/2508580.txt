BACKGROUND: Poor zinc nutritional status is suspected as a risk factor for coronary heart
disease (CHD). Since zinc absorption may be influenced by some nutritional and physiologic
factors, it would be better to investigate zinc status through biochemical measurements. The
objective of the present study was to review recent studies investigating the association of zinc
biomarkers with CHD, systematically.
METHODS: The MEDLINE database was used for relevant studies published from January 2009
to December 2013 with appropriate keywords. Articles were included in this study if they were
human studies, original articles, and published in English.
RESULTS: Six case-control studies and two prospective cohort studies that measured zinc
biomarkers were included in the study. Almost all case-control studies suggest that decreased
plasma zinc was associated with increased CHD risk. Cohort studies did not support this
relationship.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the evidence for this theory is extracted from case-control
studies, which might have bias. Prospective studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to
investigate whether poor zinc status is associated with increased CHD risk. Consequently, a
protective role of zinc in CHD could not be still established.

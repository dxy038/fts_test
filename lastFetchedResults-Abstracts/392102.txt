The effects of stimulus rise-fall and plateau times on the middle-latency response (MLR) waveform (Na-Pa amplitude and Pa latency) were investigated in 14 normally hearing subjects and an objective MLR threshold was evaluated at low and middle frequencies in ten normally hearing subjects and ten patients with slope of sensorineural hearing loss, using a selected stimulus-envelope time. After analyzing the effects of envelope times on the MLR waveform and the spectra of tone-pips, it was found that a rise-fall time of 4 ms with a plateau of 2 ms (4–2–4) is an acceptable compromise between a synchronous discharge and frequency specificity for estimating the MLR threshold. The MLR threshold produced by 4–2–4 tone-pips approximated the psychoacoustic threshold at low and middle frequencies in the normal and hearing impaired subjects. This demonstrates the clinical usefulness of the MLR in estimating low- and middle-frequency thresholds.

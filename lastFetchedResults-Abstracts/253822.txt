Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), caused by Stagonospora
nodorum, is an important disease in the northern
Great Plains of the United States and in other
wheat-producing regions in the world. SNB can be managed
by different strategies including the use of resistant
cultivars. Genetic variation in the pathogen populations
is one of the important factors in the development of
durable resistant cultivars. Our main objective was to
determine variation in aggressiveness⁄virulence in the 40
isolates of S. nodorum collected from various locations
in North Dakota. To achieve this goal, we tested the
isolates on two susceptible wheat cultivars (cvs  ND495 
and  Alsen ) and two resistant wheat cultivars (cvs  Erik 
and  Salamouni ) – two-leaf-stage seedlings under controlled
conditions. Aggressiveness of each isolate was
characterized by the two epidemiological parameters:
percent necrotic leaf area (% NLA) and lesion type
(LT) 8 days post-inoculation. The isolates differed significantly
(P £ 0.05) for % NLA and LT, and were
grouped into three aggressiveness groups (AG): low,
medium and highly aggressive. Four isolates (S50, S57,
S66 and S89) induced 18–26% NLA and were included
into the low aggressive group (AG 1). Three isolates
(S15, S39 and S89) induced 57–59% NLA and were
considered highly aggressive (AG 3). Thirty-three isolates
were medium aggressive (AG 2). No relationship
between AG and mating types was observed. There
were significant (P £ 0.05) differences in % NLA and
LT among wheat cultivars. Significant wheat cultivars
by isolates interaction was also demonstrated, suggesting
evidence for the existence of host specificity in this
system. Overall, our results indicate that S. nodorum isolates
prevalent in North Dakota varied greatly in their
aggressiveness and that AG 3 isolates can be utilized in
breeding wheat for resistance to SNB

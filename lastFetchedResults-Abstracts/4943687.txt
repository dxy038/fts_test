This work designs and implements a Not So Cooperative Caching system for Information Centric Networking (ICN). We consider a network comprised of selfish nodes; each is with caching capability and an objective of reducing its own access cost by fetching data from its local cache or from neighboring caches. These nodes would cooperate in caching and sharing content if and only if they each benefit. The challenges are to determine what objects to cache at each node and to implement the system in the context of Named Data Networking (NDN), a large effort that exemplifies ICN. Our results include both a solution for the Not So Cooperative Caching problem and an NDN design and implementation. We evaluate our approach by deploying the system we developed on PlanetLab and show that it improves the content hit ratio by up to 13%.

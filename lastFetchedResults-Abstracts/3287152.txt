This paper presents a new strategy to control the generated power that comes from the energy sources existing in autonomous and isolated Microgrids. In this particular study, the power system consists of a power electronic converter supplied by a battery bank, which is used to form the AC grid (grid former converter), an energy source based on a wind turbine with its respective power electronic converter (grid supplier converter), and the power consumers (loads). The main objective of this proposed strategy is to control the state of charge of the battery bank limiting the voltage on its terminals by controlling the power generated by the energy sources. This is done without using dump loads or any physical communication among the power electronic converters or the individual energy source controllers. The electrical frequency of the microgrid is used to inform to the power sources and their respective converters the amount of power they need to generate in order to maintain the battery-bank state of charge below or equal its maximum allowable limit. It is proposed a modified droop control to implement this task.

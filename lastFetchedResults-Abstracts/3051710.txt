The main objective of this paper is to present a new method based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for control of the multivariable and nonlinear systems. Problem design considers time domain specifications such as overshoot, rising time, settling time and stationary error as well as interaction effects. Genetic algorithms are employed to satisfy time domain design specifications that are not considered in an explicit way in the standard nonlinear control theory. Adaptation, set point tracking and satisfaction of temporary response specifications are the advantages of this method that be shown by some simulations.

In this research the optimization of calibration parameters in vehicle engine is investigated by goals of
minimizing fuel consumption and emissions, and maximization of engine torque. Urgent demand for decrease
of fuel consumption and emissions has led to complexity of engines and power train control systems. Traditional
calibration procedures are very time-consuming and expensive and calibration of modem engines with lots
of increasing ECU parameters by tradttional procedures, arc against the demand of decreasing power train
development duration. In this research we will introduce an applicable methodology and related experimental case
study for engine calibration and determination of controllable parameters which determine the benefits of using
design of experiment and statistical modeling in development of applicable models by als of decreasing the cost
and duration of experiments execution. Also we will present the design of experiments and modeling with neural
network in the same case study and compare it with the statistical modeling approach. An optimization algorithm
has been presented for solving the multi objective problems of research based on dynamic weight factors. Two
statistical and neural network models have been solved with this algorithm and the results have been compared
with each other.

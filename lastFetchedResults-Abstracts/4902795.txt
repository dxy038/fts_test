Spectral parameters such as the mean and median frequencies have been documented to be reliable outcome variables for the assessment of muscle fatigue. The objective of this paper is to examine young subjectsÂ´ surface electromyography (EMG) signals at different levels of maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) and to analyze spectral shifts in mean and median frequencies (MNF, MDF). In this study, continuous stream of EMG data sets from lower extremity muscles are used to characterize muscular fatigue from minimum to maximum MVC level. EMG data were recorded from the biceps brachii muscles during isometric contraction at constant torque levels using automated dynamometer. EMG metrics such as MNF, MDF, root mean square (RMS), and rectified root mean square (RRMS) were computed to assess muscle fatigue patterns.

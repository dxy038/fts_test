In regard to the above<sup>1</sup> wish to raise va question about the basic mathematical model represented by the first equation on page 105. This model permits one to compute the &#8220;research and development effectiveness model objective function coefficient&#8221; which is &#8220;in an overall sense &#8230; the measure of effectiveness of each task resource level.&#8221; This quantity consists of the sum of two terms; in one term we find in the denominator the probability of success of the task level, and in the other term we find in the denominator the confidence level for the task resource level. The motivation for this formulation is apparently to give some extra funds to those projects which need them; but the net result, as I see it, is that if we have one project which is almost certain to fail, that project will be heavily supported.

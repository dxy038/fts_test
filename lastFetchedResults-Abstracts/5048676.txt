Based on the analytic hierarchy process, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is proposed for power network operating schemes. Performance indices and corresponding membership functions are presented to denote their contributions on overall objective. The analytic hierarchy process is used to analyze influencing factors, to establish a hierarchical model and to rank the influencing factors in order of importance. After detailed analyses and calculations for each operating scheme, quantitative evaluation results that considering various factors comprehensively are obtained by a two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. A decision support system using the proposed method is developed. Simulation results of a practical power system show its validity and effectiveness.

For the first time, it has been possible to conduct airborne K<sub>u</sub>-band (14 GHz) radar cross section measurements with a full 360&#176; azimuthal sweep of the sea surface combined with simultaneous measurements of coincident wind speed, friction velocity and numerous other physical variables at the air-sea interface within a kilometer-sized area. Measurements were conducted from a blimp during September and October of 1993 off the coast of Oregon. The broad objective of the experiment was to understand air/sea interactions in a coastal environment using a variety of remote (active and passive), and in-situ sensors

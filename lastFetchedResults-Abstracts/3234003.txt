The objective of this work is to introduce Augmented and Mixed Reality technologies in aquatic leisure activities. We have proposed a new device which is autonomous, mobile and easily transportable by one person. It can also be easily installed, equipped with GPS and wireless systems, and has positive buoyancy. The device will be used at water surface as well as underwater using a tuba. Moreover, the device is equipped with one (can be upgraded for more) video camera pointing downwards. Augmented Reality contents combining actual underwater images with 3D animated images will be one of the preferred ways to use the device.

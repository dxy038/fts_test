We propose a connection setup scheme in a WDM bidirectional ring network, in which, under the destination address contention, the node, which has finished transmitting data, hands over the transmission right to the node waiting for connection setup. By handing over the transmission right, our scheme can reduce the average connection setup time, and, thus, can increase the connection setup number. We compare the performance of the proposed connection setup scheme with that of the conventional one with respect to the average connection setup time and the connection setup number by computer simulations. As a result, it is shown that the proposed connection setup scheme can reduce the average connection setup time and increase the connection setup number.

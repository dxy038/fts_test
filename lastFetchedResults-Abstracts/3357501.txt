A Permanent brushless DC motor posses high torque/weight ratio, operate at high speed, very compact and are electronically controlled. The speed control of BLDC motor is achieved by controlling the DC link voltage of the voltage source inverter feeding BLDC motor using a single voltage sensor. An electronic commutation of BLDC motor is used for voltage source inverter to operate in a low-frequency operation for reduced switching losses in the voltage source inverter. A Bridgeless buck-boost converter is meant to work in discontinuous inductor current mode to supply a unity Power at AC mains. The motor speed control is implemented using fuzzy logic controller. All control suffers from the problem related to undesirable overshoot, longer setting times and vibrations while going one state to another. To overcome the maximum overshoot fuzzy logic control technique is used. The purpose is to achieve accurate trajectory control of the speed of PMBLDC motor. The fuzzy logic speed control of BLDC motor and bridgeless power factor correction configuration of the buck-boost converter for improved power quality was simulated using MATLAB/ Simulink and the objective is observed and validated.

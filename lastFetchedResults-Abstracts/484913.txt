Background and Objective: To find out appropriate method for improving physical and motion factors has been considered as a major aim of sport experts and physiotherapists. Power and strength can be considered as important parameters in physical fitness. In recent years, various tactics and programs have been used by experts and trainers to improve the given parameters. Weight and plyometric training are significantly included in such programs. This research explores the effects of two-way training on biceps and rectos femoris with regard to surface electromyography.
Subject and Methods: Participants in this research consists of 45 male students aged from 22.5 to 25.6 years old (15 in plyometric group, 15 in weight training group and 15 in control group). The subjects were selected among male students in physical education faculty. Before and after 6 weeks of weight and plyometric training the EMG flactuation of muscles was measured via surface electromyography. Vertical jump test and squat test were used to evaluate power and strength respectively. The MT8 system and MBM software were also used to collect and analyze the EMG data.
Results: The results made in this research show the significant increase in the experimental group for IEMG, compared with the control group(P<0.05). No meaningful difference came to exist between weight and plyometric training groups for power in rectus femoris muscle (P<0.05).
Conclusion: The results show that weight training can be used to increase power and strength. While plyometric training causes more increase muscular power. These two practical styles are useful in increasing muscular the power.

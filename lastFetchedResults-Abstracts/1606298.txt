BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children not only cause more hospitalization than adults but also permanent disability and even death from these complications are more common in this age group. In this study, these complications in hospitalized children at Amirkola childrenâ€™s teaching hospital (Babol; Iran) over a 5 year period were studied. 
METHODS: In this descriptive study, ADR reporting forms of ADR registration and survey center which were filled according to instructions of registration of ADRs and medication errors over 5 years for 162 patients in Amirkola children's hospital were reviewed and categorized according to age and sex of child, type, severity level, and outcome of ADR, drug class and type and causality. 
FINDINGS: Among drug classes, anticonvulsants with 74% (120 cases) of cases were the most common cause of ADRs and then were antibiotics with 16% (26 cases) and immunoglobulin with 7% (11 cases) of cases. Among anticonvulsants, phenobarbital was the most common cause of ADRs [68% (110 cases)]. 41% (67 cases) of children aged 1-5 years. The most common symptoms were diffused cutaneous symptoms [60% (97 cases)]. In 44% (71 cases) of cases causality was probable. 
CONCLUSION: According to the high prevalence of ADRs caused by antiepileptic drugs particularly phenobarbital in this study, more attention in administering these drugs and careful follow-up of children treated with them is demonstrated. Awareness of the ADRs in children for all healthcare professionals and continuous monitoring of children treated with drugs with common side effects, in order to improve the detection and reporting of these complications is recommended.

Objective
rdered body image, emotions such as shame and disgust, and intrusive thoughts are described as important and interdependent features of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). However, research in this field is scarce and knowledge is often based on clinical observation.
s
esent study examined body image dimensions, emotions, and thought control strategies in individuals with: BDD (n = 31), anorexia nervosa (n = 32), bulimia nervosa (n = 34), and healthy controls (n = 33). Assessment was based on structured diagnostic interviews and self-report questionnaires.
s
duals with BDD scored higher on psychosocial and appearance manipulation dimensions of body image compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, they reported higher psychosocial impairment due to appearance than both eating disorder groups. In terms of emotions, BDD subjects reported a higher degree of negative emotions compared to healthy controls, whereas no differences were found in comparison to eating-disordered patients. Individuals with BDD reported using maladaptive strategies such as worrying and confrontation more often than healthy controls, when encountering intrusive and unwanted thoughts.
sion
sults indicate that individuals with BDD experience substantial psychosocial impairment due to appearance, high levels of various negative emotions and frequently use maladaptive thought control strategies.

In this paper, aiming at the wing-body joint location of quasi-waverider hypersonic vehicle, improving on the Simple Genetic Algorithms (SGA), inducting the Constrained Flexible Polyhedron Method (CFPM), the Serial Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (SHGA) is presented. Optimizing the wing-body location with the SHGA, getting the Pareto optimal solution of the multi-objective optimization question, the best configuration is recommended. Comparing with the basic model configuration, the recommended configuration improves in the balancing, maneuverability and stability, hiding ability. The SHGA and results of this paper are valuable for hypersonic vehicle design.

Background: There are many underlying factors that increase the chance for occurrence of UTI and some reports indicate a role for hypercalciuria in UTI.
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the Ca/Cr status in urinary tract infection of children.
Methods: This was a cross- sectional antegrade study conducted in Qods teaching hospital of Qazvin from 2006-2007, in which 50 children with urinary tract infection were studied for hypercalciuria. To determine hypercalciuria, the Ca/Cr ratio of a random urine sample was measured. Different variables such as age, gender, history of UTI and etc, were compared between hypercalciuric and normocalciuric groups. Results were analyzed with SPSS using t-test and chi square test.
Findings: Of 50 patients, 27 cases (54%) were found to have hypercalciuria. There was   a significant difference between hypercalciuric and normocalciuric groups regarding the abnormal sonographic findings (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Based  on results of  this study evaluation of hypercalciuria in UTI is recommended.

Operation of cascade hydroelectric stations is complex. Many dynamic factors such as cross-time, multi-constraint, multi-objective affect the scheduling. In order to get optimal scheduling, an intelligent management information system is always used to help cascade hydroelectric stations decision. Ontology is one of the most important bases of intelligent system. All reasoning is computed by knowledge of ontology. This paper proposes an ontology model for intelligent management information system of cascade hydroelectric stations. And it is described in two aspects. The first part is domain knowledge of ontology which is described about cascade hydroelectric stations decision in OWL. The second part is about an ontology based data mining framework designed to study the cascade hydroelectric stations´ optimal scheduling making. All this research contributed to understand the cascade hydroelectric stations´ operation schedule making in ontology and contributed to build operation models and intelligent management information system.

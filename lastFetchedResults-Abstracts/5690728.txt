The objective is to show that a lock-on-after-launch air-to-air missile fired from an aircraft can be successfully delivered to within seeker acquisition range of a passively tracked, nonmaneuvering air target by means of a track filter augmented with a missile acceleration profile. The algorithm used to track both the target and missile is a six-state Cartesian-domain extended Kalman filter. A Monte Carlo analysis technique was used to demonstrate that, embedded within a weapon delivery system, the filter outputs can be utilized to accurately point the missile seeker at the target

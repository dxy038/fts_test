This work proposes new modified hybrid H-bridge multilevel inverter using bidirectional auxiliary switch. The new topology produces a significant reduction in the number of power devices and capacitors required to implement a multilevel output when compared to the conventional MLIs. It is used in the design of a five-level output. The reduced number of switches reduces the switching losses and improves the efficiency of the inverter. This method achieves the variation of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in the inverter and output voltage is observed from various modulation indices. Simulation is performed using MATLAB-SIMULINK. Variable Frequency (VF) strategy provides output with relatively low distortion for all strategies. It is also seen that Carrier Overlapping (CO) is found to perform better for all strategies since it provides relatively higher fundamental RMS output voltage.

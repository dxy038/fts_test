This paper presents the preliminary results of a physical placement algorithm for heterogeneous Dynamically Reconfigurable Arrays (DRA), based on a multi-objective, multi-threaded GA. The algorithm deals with the spatial and temporal nature of the configurations used in DRAs, in an attempt to find a suitable layout for a wide range of applications, since general applicability is a key criteria for DRAs.

The objective of this paper is to derive an intimate relationship among three
important mathematical tools, namely: polynomial interpolation, Marcinkiewicz-
Zygmund inequalities, and Ap-weights. In particular, it is shown that minimum
separation of sample points on the unit circle together with certain uniform
Ap-weights generated by these sample points constitute a necessary and sufficient
condition for the validity of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality evaluated at
these points, which in turn, is equivalent to the Jackson-type estimate, using the
Popov-Andreev module of continuity, of polynomial interpolation, again at these
sample points.

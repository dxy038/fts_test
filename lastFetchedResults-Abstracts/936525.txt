Concern regarding the occurrence of chemicals that disrupt endocrine system functions in aquatic species has heightened over the last 15 years. However, little attention has been given to monitoring for estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EEDCs) in California's freshwater ecosystems. The objective was to screen surface water samples for estrogenic activity using vitellogenin (Vtg) mRNA quantification in livers of juvenile rainbow trout by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT PCR). Vtg mRNA analysis of livers from fish exposed to 113 ambient water samples collected from surface waters in California's Central Valley and northern area indicated that six samples (5% of total) may have contained EEDCs. The six samples induced marginal, but statistically significant, increases of Vtg mRNA. No ambient water sample evoked Vtg mRNA responses equivalent to those in positive controls (all responses were less than 2% of the positive control response). Thus, EEDC concentrations in these samples were low (at or near the threshold for the procedure) or results may have included false positives. To establish a more definitive assessment of EEDC occurrence, follow-up screening at sites where statistically significant, but weak, estrogenic activity was observed is recommended. Overall, results reveal that a majority of the California surface waters tested were below EEDC detection threshold concentration for the screening procedure utilized.

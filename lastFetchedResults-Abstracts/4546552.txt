In this report research it is proposed a methodology for the design of the blades turbine of low power, which is going to be an efficient solution for the electricity supply problem, besides, it is going to cover the energetic necessities of an isolated house without power grid, that is situated in a rural zone of the Puebla State, without the access to essential services. This method has as the objective of estimate the distribution of the chord line profile distribution and the angle pitch, along the blade radius, based on conservation of axial and angular momentum equations, applying the theory of the blade element theory and the process of optimization. With this method it is taken into consideration the concept to get the wind power for the different values of the profile chord and to select which is going to supply the maximum value of the wind power.

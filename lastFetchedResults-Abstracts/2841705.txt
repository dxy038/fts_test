The main objective of this paper is to propose a new state-space modeling approach for AC-DC single-stage power factor correction (PFC) buck-boost converters by using a modified version of conventional state-space modeling approach. In the paper, the operation of a single-stage PFC buck-boost converter is briefly reviewed and the proposed modeling approach is introduced and explained in detail. It is then shown how a small-signal model and key transfer functions can be extracted from the average statespace model of such a converter. The output to input small-signal transfer functions of the converter that are generated using this approach can then be used to keep the small-signal values at zero so that the states of the system can operate at their predefined steady-state conditions.

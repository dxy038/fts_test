The objective of this chat application is basically to avoid the misinterpretation about the messages that normally occurs during chatting. The current emotions of each user of the application will be captured in the form of an image via a webcam. These emotions will be reflected in the form of a smiley face on chat window of the other user of the application whom he/she is chatting with. The purpose of using face detection algorithm in is to determine whether or not there are any faces in an captured image, if any, the location of each face is shown. We also present a system, based on Piecewise Be&#769;zier Volume Deformation tracker for detecting the facial features and keeping a track of their deformations. TAN classifier basically aims to recognise the facial expressions by considering all the deformations, occurring each time. Thus the users of application can express their emotions in better way at nearly the same cost of data transfer.

Chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) is a synergistic tribological process. It occurs between a polymeric polishing pad, a wafer, and between which is a chemical slurry containing nanoabrasive particles. CMP functions similar to chemical boundary lubrication of mechanical systems, except that the objective of the CMP is to remove materials in a controlled manner. In this article, evidence is provided to discuss lubrication behavior during CMP.

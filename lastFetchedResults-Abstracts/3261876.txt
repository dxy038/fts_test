China is not only the largest and the most efficient producer of wheat but also one of the most populous country. The increase of wheat productivity is critical to guaranteed self sufficiency for China. The major objective of this paper is to examine the spatial and temporal variations of wheat yield in China, then to analyze the underlying causes for the trends. For this purpose, we firstly apply methods of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to check the spatial and temporal patterns of Wheat yield. Then we use the spatial econometric modeling to further investigate the underlying cause of the spatial and temporal variation difference of wheat productivity which intrinsically is a natural-social-economic composition affected by climate change, land use change, agro-technology diffusion, rural labor migration, and so on. this paper may be helpful to establish crop production policy and trade policy.

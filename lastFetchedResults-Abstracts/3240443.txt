Langkawi is a resort island in the northwestern part of Malaysia where the island´s economy is reliant on agro-based activities and tourism for sustainable development. With the Digital Era, it is important that the indigenous islanders adjust their income generating ways by using information and communication technology (ICT) for better capacity building. This is in line with the government´s four pillars of transformation, specifically, the National Key Economic Areas (NKEA) and the Strategic Reform Initiatives (SRI) for creating a competitive domestic economy, enhancing the sources of growth and ensuring sustainability of growth. Henceforth, the objective of this study is to evaluate the islanders´ accessibility to the internet and correlate this to their ability to regenerate sustainability through their various occupations. The cross-sectional design of this fundamental study from which interviews and survey administration will be the staple for data collection will result in parametric and non-parametric analyses for the disclosure of demographic profiling of the sample population relevant to digital access and sustainable regeneration. The findings will provide significant insights for the Langkawi Development Authority (LADA) to re-strategize their plans for the island´s growth which will inadvertently and positively affect the well-being and quality of life of the islanders.

The objective was to investigate the influence of the recovery liquid medium on the repair of Saccharomyces cerevisiae sublethally injured cells after Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) in media of different pH. Sublethal injury was detected in the yeast S. cerevisiae after 50 pulses at 12.0 kV cm− 1 in both pH 4.0 and 7.0, by using a selective medium plating technique. PEF treatments cause a repairable sublethal injury in S. cerevisiae. Injured cells showed their maximum repair capacity when suspended in Sabouraud Broth compared to Peptone Water or citrate–phosphate buffer of pH 4.0. The extent to which cells repair their injuries depended on the treatment medium pH, and on the nature of the storage medium. No repair was detected when the recovery liquid medium was citrate–phosphate buffer of pH 7.0. Acid conditions favour repair and survival of PEF-treated S. cerevisiae cells. This work contributes to the description of the mechanisms of PEF injury and inactivation, which would be useful in defining adequate PEF treatments, alone or in combination with additional hurdles, to assure food stability.

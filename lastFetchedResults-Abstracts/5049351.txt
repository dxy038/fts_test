This paper gives the basic description of fuzzy metering control of the auxiliary road signals. On the base of this description, the basic fuzzy logic control structure and fuzzy control algorithm are described. The necessity of using the exit-auxiliary-road density as the fuzzy metering control objective is analyzed. The real membership function is used in the design process of the auxiliary road fuzzy controller. The XueYuan Road exit on the second ring road in Beijing is selected as the study object in the simulation, and the simulation results reflect the adjustment results of the fuzzy controller with the present fuzzy control rules. The metering rate only changes a little. However, when the average delay is selected as the evaluation parameter, the fuzzy metering control will produce less delay than the field cycle-split control strategy. The exit delay of the expressway decreases 66%. The delay of the auxiliary road downstream of the stop line decreases 93%.

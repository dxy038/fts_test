Designing communication networks is a complex, multi-constraint and multi-criterion optimization problem. We present a multi-objective genetic optimization approach to setting up a network while simultaneously minimizing network delays and installation costs subject to reliability and flow constraints. In this paper, we use a Pareto-converging genetic algorithm, present results for two test networks and compare results with another heuristic method

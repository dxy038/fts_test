In this paper the characters of pitch angle, yaw angle and roll angle of kinetic interceptor (KI) with side window during the terminal guidance process are discussed. In order to guarantee that KI is able to track target missile with high speed continually, a novel method to design the desired attitude angles is presented. Given an ellipse side window, the constraints from visibility, angle of attack and the angle of sideslip on attitude angles are analyzed and illustrated in inequalities. The existence of the solution to these inequalities is confirmed through analyzing a special solution. An object function is designed and a single-objective nonlinear optimization model is thereby formulated. The solutions of this optimization problem, which could be obtained through solving the optimization model, are regarded as the desired attitude angles. The initial value chosen to solve the problem by numerical iterative algorithm is also discussed. The validity of the analysis and the effectiveness of the method are confirmed by simulation results.

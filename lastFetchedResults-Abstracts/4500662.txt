An iterative time-domain algorithm for reconstructing three-dimensional (3-D) objects using microwave data transmitted and collected by dipole antennas is presented. The incident pulse is estimated by using the genetic algorithm (GA) from electric data transmitted and received by dipole antennas in air. The objective functional of the reconstruction method is defined as the energy of weighted residuals between observed data and electromagnetic field excited by the guessed pulse calculated by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The functional is minimized by conjugate gradient method. Two reconstruction examples using the accurate and estimated pulse are shown.

Myocardial laser revascularization is a novel therapeutic technique aimed at delivering oxygenated blood via a series of channels to the ischemic regions of the heart. These channels may be created surgically or via a less invasive percutaneous approach. In patients with end-stage coronary artery disease, both transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) and percutaneous myocardial laser revascularization (PMR) have been associated with a reduction in symptoms, improved exercise tolerance, and enhanced quality of life. However, the mechanism of action of laser therapy is incompletely understood, the results of objective cardiac perfusion measurements are inconclusive, and multiple randomized trials have failed to demonstrate an increase in survival. In addition, the positive results seen in TMR trials have been questioned because of a lack of blinding, raising the possibility that the benefit may have been due to the placebo effect. Finally, two recent sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials of PMR have not shown any benefit of the procedure, but instead have highlighted the important role of the placebo effect in the response to PMR. Further research is, therefore, needed to elucidate the value of myocardial laser revascularization.

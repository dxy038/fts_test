This paper deals with the high pressure lamps feed by direct conversion AC to AC with ZETA converter implemented by bidirectional switches for the lamp operation on the mains frequency. The aim is to prevent the occurrence of destructive acoustic resonance. Also has high efficiency, high power factor and low cost. The approach focused on passive elements design in the circuit, the transfer function and the digital control applied to DSP controller. At the end is shown the prototype system response.

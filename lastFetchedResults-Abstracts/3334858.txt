In this paper, we consider a resource allocation with carrier aggregation optimization problem in long term evolution (LTE) cellular networks. In our proposed model, users are running elastic or inelastic traffic. Each user equipment (UE) is assigned an application utility function based on the type of its application. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers resources optimally among users in their coverage area while giving the user the ability to select one of the carriers to be its primary carrier and the others to be its secondary carriers. The UEÂ´s decision is based on the carrier price per unit bandwidth. We present a price selective centralized resource allocation with carrier aggregation algorithm to allocate multiple carriers resources optimally among users while providing a minimum price for the allocated resources. In addition, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm with different carriers rates. Finally, we present simulation results for the performance of the proposed algorithm.

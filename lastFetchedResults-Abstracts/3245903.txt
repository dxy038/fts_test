When a sudden change occurs in the condition of the environment and the body is forced to move away from equilibrium, it is said that a postural perturbation has happened [1]. Under this condition, a novel equilibrium assessment is used based on the stimulus-response technique, where a platform provides the stimulus through oscillating movements and the response is measured by an optic system that records the movements of the head. This signal is conditioned and submitted to processing under stability criteria used in control of systems. The result is an objective indicator, allowing an evaluation for absolute and relative stability of the human body.

Objective
This study evaluated the correlation between vital signs and hemoperitoneum and the association between abnormal vital signs and tubal rupture.
Study design
With the use of a retrospective case-control design, the initial heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate/systolic blood pressure were correlated with respect to degree of hemoperitoneum; predictive values were calculated.
Results
Fifty-two patients were studied (25 ruptured pregnancies and 27 unruptured ectopic pregnancies). Correlation coefficients were heart rate (r = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68), systolic blood pressure (r = −0.34; 95% CI, −0.56 to −0.08), and heart rate/systolic blood pressure (r = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.81). The sensitivity for heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate/systolic blood pressure was 28%, 36%, and 72% respectively; the specificity was 96%, 96%, and 67%, respectively.
Conclusion
Normal vital signs alone are poor predictors of ruptured ectopic pregnancy; the heart rate/systolic blood pressure correlates best with the quantity of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.

In this paper, the element free Galerkin method (EFG), combined with evolutionary structural optimization method (ESO), is applied to carry out the topology optimization of the continuum structures. Considering the deletion criterion based on the stresses, the mathematical formulation of the topology optimization is developed. The objective function of this model is the minimized weight. Several numerical examples are used to prove the feasibility of the approach adopted in this paper. And the examples show the simplicity and fast convergence of the proposed method.

In Ibn Arabi’s philosophy, knowledge means knowing about the essence of objects. In his view, it is only God who can attain the knowledge of objects by essence without resorting to the existence of an extra affair. Thus, except for God, everyone possesses an imitative kind of knowledge. That is why imitation comprises the basic pillar of Ibn Arabi’s epistemology. Because of the limitations of perceptive faculties, he believes that their grasp of the truth is only accidental. Hence, he maintains that imitating God is prior to imitating perceptive faculties.
Imitating God, which is the gist of Ibn Arabi’s epistemological theory, means that man should gain knowledge through eliminating the mediation of perceptive faculties and appearances of objects. In this way, he will encounter the essence of objects directly. This theory, which is the main concern of this paper, is based on Ibn Arabi’s anthropology. Here, the authors intend to explore this epistemological theory in depth and, after describing its accurate meaning, importance, and levels, discuss the conditions and characteristics of correct imitation in Ibn Arabi’s view. It is necessary to mention that, in his gnosis, imitation is considered an epistemological theory when it functions as an attribute for intellectual and wise people. This imitation is formed in the bed of spiritual wayfaring towards God and leads human beings up to the level of becoming similar to the Necessary Being until they turn into a rational world matching the objective world.

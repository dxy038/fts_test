Introduction: Healthcare as a high hazard industry, should work to enhance their patient safety. To achieve this
objective, they first have to identify their existing safety climate status.
Methods: This study was conducted in summer of 2010. We assessed safety climate Using Hospital Survey On
Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC). 385 employees of three teaching hospitals affiliated with Kerman University of
Medical Sciences participated in the study. The results were expressed as percentage of positive answers toward
patient safety.
Results: Patient safety culture scores were low to average in all dimensions. Supervisor expectations and actions
promoting patient safety and teamwork within units received the highest scores in all three hospitals, while non
punitive response to error attained the least score in studied hospitals.
Conclusion: The studied hospitals, relying on their strengths concerning patientâ€™s safety climate and trying to
resolve their weaknesses, would be able to create a safe and suitable environment which supports patient safety.
Establishing a system for reporting errors, encouraging staff to report events and applying non- punitive response to
prevent the errors are suggested.

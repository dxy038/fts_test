An efficient algorithm for Multi resolution medical image segmentation is presented. The main objective of medical image segmentation is to extract the anatomic structures and its characteristics with respect to some input features. There exists various methodologies for medical image segmentation but struggles with missing features due to the noise presence in the medical images. We propose a new technique to increase the resolution of the medical images to identify the features and edges of the medical images. We use multi-class Histogram based segmentation method to preserve the edges and increase the resolution of the medical images. With the proposed technique the memory and time consumption is hugely reduced, which is an important factor in the medical field and produces good results.

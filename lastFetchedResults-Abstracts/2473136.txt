Objective
This study was conducted to investigate the sleep symptoms and
polysomnographic patterns of obstructive sleep apnea in overweight and obese
children.
Materials & Methods
Overweight or obese children aging 6-18 yr old referred during 2010 to
Endocrinology Clinic of Ghods Hospital in Ghazvin, central Iran were enrolled
in the study. Polysomnography was done for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep
apnea and the BEARS and Childrenâ€™s Sleep Habits questionnaires were used to
survey sleep behaviors.
Results
We enrolled 30 children (14 males, 16 females). Twenty-one cases had body
mass index (BMI)  > 95% and 9 had 85%  < BMI < 95%. Respiratory disturbance
in polysomnography was seen in 90% of cases. Symptoms included snoring
18 (60%); frequent awakening 17 (56.6%); nocturnal sweating 15 (50%);
daytime sleepiness 12 (40%); sleep talking 10 (33.3%); bedtime resistance 9
(30%); nightmares 8 (26.6%); waking up problems 6 (20%); sleep walking 6
(20%); difficult breathing 4 (13.3%); bedwetting 3 (10%) and sleep onset delay
2 (6.06%). Severe, moderate and mild apnea â€“ hypopnea Index (AHI) were seen
in 12, 9 and 6 subjects, respectively. A significant Pearson correlation was found
between the BMI values and sleep latency.
Conclusion
Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is high among overweight and obese
children. Physicians should be familiar with its manifestations and consider
polysomnography as an invaluable diagnostic test. There was no relation
between the degree of obesity and severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

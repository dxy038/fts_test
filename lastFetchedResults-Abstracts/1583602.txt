Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) can be realized with models. It can be used to find the cause of the degradation on energy efficiency and indoor climate quality in building heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Real buildings are diverse. It requires a general modeling method. General modeling concept comprises three steps: hierarchical modeling procedure, parameterization and tuning procedure. In the procedure of hierarchical modeling, the process is split into levels ranging from global to micro level. The objective is to detect faults on the various levels. Consequently, different models for each level should be built. It is important to increase the accuracy of the models and let the models applicable for FDD on building HVAC systems. Parameterization and tuning procedure are necessary. An example model for a real air-conditioned room shows the results of general models and the results after tuning.

A kind of vehicle routing problem about one point provides services to multipoint that contains the constraint conditions of operation time and soft time windows was studied, a minimum cost objective function model was constructed, the thoughts of full arrangement searching and minimum cost of each single route were added to the tabu search algorithm which could obtain the integral optimal solution in all combinations of routing based on the high-speed arithmetic capability of computer, then a practical problem by the program written in Visual Basic was analyzed and solved, it is an effective way to solve the VRP and achieve the production efficiency by working out the artificially intelligent algorithm through the computer.

With regard to the increasing demand for energy to meet various needs, renewable energies should be achieved. The scholars believe that renewable and clean energies can be the first alternative to generate power, if we take into account the limited fossil fuels and environmental pollution.  Iran is of numerous capabilities in generating new and renewable energies. This study aims to present an optimum model to develop renewable energies, which reduces the environmental pollution in addition to supply the required power. By minimizing the objective function and regarding 3 types of limitations on sources, demands and techniques, and using robust optimization method, we propose a model for Iranian energy sector at the 2025 horizon in which 15% of electricity is generated using solar energy.

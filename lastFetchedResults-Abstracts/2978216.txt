This paper presents results of the analysis of internal oceanic and atmospheric wave patterns viewed by means of a Ku-band airborne real aperture radar capable to produce simultaneous HH and VV images at large incident angles 72&#176;-84&#176;. Almost simultaneous contact measurements of meteorological parameters in the imaged area are also available. The objective of the study was to compare radar signatures of the oceanic and atmospheric internal waves from points of view of visualization mechanisms, values of radar signal variations and polarization features. The main parameters of internal waves such as wave lengths, phase speed and group velocity, number of packets and number of waves in a train, direction of the propagation and orientation of wave crests were retrieved from radar images of the sea surface

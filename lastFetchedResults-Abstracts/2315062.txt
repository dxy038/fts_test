The total solar eclipse of 24 October 1995 has provided an important opportunity to investigate a variety of eclipse-related atmospheric phenomena. The path of totality of the eclipse passed through a few stations in India. Field campaign experiments have been carried out with an objective to investigate the effects of solar eclipse phenomenon on atmospheric aerosol characterization and columnar ozone over Robertsgunj (24°42′N, 83°04′E, 312 m AMSL), Uttar Pradesh, India during 23–25 October 1995 using a multi-channel radiometer. The solar irradiance measured in the ultra-violet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) wavelength region has been utilized to study the spectral–temporal variations of height-integrated aerosol optical depth and corresponding aerosol size distribution, and total column ozone during the pre- and post-eclipse period (control days) and on the total solar eclipse day. The study has revealed that aerosol optical characteristics and ozone variations observed on the eclipse day, especially during the period of totality, differ significantly from those noticed on the control days. These deviations are explained on the basis of changes in meteorological parameters induced by the eclipse phenomenon.

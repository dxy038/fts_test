The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effective factors in irregular prenatal care. A cross-sectional study was performed on 800 healthy pregnant women who had prenatal care in our prenatal clinic and were in last month of their pregnancy. 400 women had regular prenatal care(at least 8 times visits according to health care records) and 400 women did not have regular prenatal visits. Age, occupation, number of pregnancies, race(Iranian or non Iranian), income level, place of residence(city or village), unwanted pregnancy and the level of education were recorded and compared in two groups. The two groups had statistically significant difference in terms of age(P<0,001), number of pregnancies(P<0.001), race(P<0.002), income level(P<0.005), place of residence(P<0.002), unwanted pregnancy(P<0.005) and education level(P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference between two groups in terms of occupation. Older age, more previous pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies, low education, low income and living in villages have essential importance in irregular and late prenatal care and render these groups as high risk in their pregnancies.

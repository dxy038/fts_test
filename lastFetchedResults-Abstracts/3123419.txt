Model merging is widely used in many domains, such as geography modeling, 3D design of highway and railway route and so on. So it is essential to design an efficient model merging algorithm. The objective of this paper is to research on models merging algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation. A method of obtaining model merged intersection lines quickly and an algorithm of searching triangles on the inside of the intersection lines fast are proposed. For the purpose of implementing Delaunay triangulation models mergence, two main steps, that is insert the merged intersection lines into the Initial Delaunay triangulation ( IDT ), and cut the triangles inside of the intersection lines in IDT out, are adopted. The processes of models merging are expatiated detailedly. The proposed algorithms are implemented by using VC++ programming language and tested by some experiment data. The experimental result validated the correctness and feasibility about the proposed algorithms.

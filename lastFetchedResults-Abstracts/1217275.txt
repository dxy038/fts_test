Explanatory factor analysis was used to assess the construct validity and discriminant validity to determine within groups analysis of variance. Cronbach's ? coefficient was conducted to evaluate reliability of the scale.
Results: The content validity index and ratio values were more than 0.78 and 0.90 respectively. In exploratory factor analysis, three factors erection, ejaculation, and satisfaction, were extracted. More than 70 % of the variation was explained by these three factors. Cronbach's ? coefficient was 0.80 for all dimensions of MSHQ indicating the reliability of this instrument.

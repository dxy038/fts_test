Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate temporal correlations between maternal serum placenta growth factor levels and placental perfusion in early human pregnancies.
Study design
Systolic umbilical artery Doppler blood flow velocity indices at fetal and placental insertion sites were measured between 7 and 22 weeks of gestation from normal singleton pregnancies. Maternal serum placenta growth factor levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Maternal serum placenta growth factor levels showed an exponential increase at approximately 14 weeks of gestation. Placenta perfusion, as estimated by systolic Doppler blood flow indices, significantly increased with gestational age (P< .0001). There was a close association between placenta growth factor expression levels and evidence of increased placenta perfusion (P< .033).
Conclusion
The significant increase in serum placenta growth factor coincides with the increased perfusion of the maternal/fetal interface at approximately 12 to 14 weeks of gestation. Correlation of placenta growth factor expression and placental perfusion suggests that placenta growth factor may contribute to assuring adequate vascular development/function of the placenta early in gestation.

This paper presents the principle of three-phase PWM AC-AC Matrix Converter using 9-units of bidirectional, IGBT-Power Diode as main power switching devices. This converter is able to convert a constant utility three-phase sinusoidal supply voltage and frequency into a variable output voltage and frequency of pulses PWM by adjusting the frequency and modulation index of the PWM signals of the converter. The principle of this Matrix Converter is first described in terms of mathematics equations and then implemented in terms of theoretical waveforms. Theoretical waveforms are finally compared to practical waveforms from the three-phase PWM AC-AC Matrix Converter which designed, constructed, and operated in the laboratory. Theoretical and practical results show to agree quit well.

The objective of the 2011 MEMOCODE Hardware Software CoDesign Contest was to improve the performance of a configurable Network-on-Chip (NoC) simulator. A C++ reference simulator was provided, whose output was defined to be correct. The simulator takes two inputs: (i) a specification of the NoC to be simulated (the target) and (ii) a traffic pattern that specifies the traffic to be simulated on that NoC. The simulator was designed to support virtually any NoC topology. Results were judged firstly on correctness (that the number of cycles is accurately modeled) and secondly on simulation speed (the amount of time it takes to complete the entire simulation).

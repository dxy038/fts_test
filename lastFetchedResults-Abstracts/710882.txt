Background
Most cases of ovarian edema are thought to result from intermittent ovarian/adnexal torsion. This study describes how, in some cases, this etiology was ruled out even though the edema was unexplained.
Study Objective
To evaluate the association between ovarian edema and hemorrhagic corpus luteum.
Setting
Department of gynecology in an urban medical center.
Participants
Five patients admitted to the department of gynecology with a sonographic diagnosis of ovarian edema of unexplained etiology.
Results
Laparoscopy performed on three of five patients in whom a diagnosis of unexplained ovarian edema revealed hemorrhagic corpus luteum and ovarian edema. The remaining two patients displayed typical sonographic imaging of hemorrhagic corpus luteum and ovarian edema and they were managed expectantly. The affected ovaries were between 4.8 and 10 times larger than the unaffected ovaries. During follow-up, the affected ovaries returned to their normal size and appearance.
Conclusions
Hemorrhagic corpus luteum can cause ovarian edema without interrupting the blood flow supply. The outcome of expectant management without any surgical intervention is the gradual disappearance of the ovarian edema in these patients and the return of ovaries to a normal sonographic appearance.

Background: Using computerized nuclear morphometry, we searched for common, objective parameters for use in predicting potential malignancy of primary T2 tumors of the rectum.
Methods: In 119 surgically resected T2 rectal cancers, the following parameters of the cancer cell nuclei were microscopically measured: mean nuclear area (NA), mean perimeter (PM), largest-to-smallest diameter ratios (LS), circularity factor (CF), and coefficient of variation of nuclear area (NACV). The calculated parameters were retrospectively analyzed and compared with patientsâ€™ outcome.
Results: NA, PM, and NACV correlated with recurrence. NA and NACV were significantly associated with disease-free survival. High NACV correlated with lymph node metastasis. In node-negative cases, high NACV correlated with recurrence and tended to be associated with poor prognosis.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that computerized morphometry is useful for predicting malignancy potential of T2 lesions of the rectum.

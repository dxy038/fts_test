A model for storage and retrieval of relevant documents during a document production workflow in an office is presented. The objective of the workflow is to review a document by multiple reviewers, where each reviewer contributes her own comments during review based on other documents containing standing rules, precedents etc, which is termed, the context. Storage of such documents is modeled as a Page Cube and query languages analogous to relational languages have been proposed for easy and efficient retrieval.

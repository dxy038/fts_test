In view of assembled MW-SCALE pitch doubly-fed wind turbine, due to its structure and more complex electronic control system, the original motivation of wind conditions through simulation, testing doubly-fed wind generator, wind speed converter in different operating conditions performance, and power curve. Testing machine and the fan controlling the normal communications, and complete the masterÂ´s control tasks, inspection MW-SCALE doubly-fed wind turbine operation mode, test the converter control system and its compatibility. Test a variety of fault conditions in the wind turbine, converter basic protection. Through the wind turbine, gear box, converter, control system of joint test (except tower, blades), completed on the generator set design, manufacture, assembly quality inspection, while in the performance of the entire assessment test machine safety and protection of property, and problems found to be eliminated to protect the unit under test to factory quality standards.

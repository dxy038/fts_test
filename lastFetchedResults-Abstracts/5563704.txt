This paper proposes a scheduling approach for mobile uplink WiMAX system that provides a trade-off between delay requirement satisfaction and throughput maximization. The paper starts by introducing three scheduling algorithms each with a different objective. The first aim is to maximize the throughput of the system, while maintaining the user fairness. The second aim is to satisfy the delay requirements and the third focuses mainly on user fairness while maintaining an acceptable delay. These three uplink scheduling algorithms are based on an Alternative Factor parameter that selects the best channel of each user for the system throughput maximization while providing the fairness among users. The trade-off proposed in this paper is achieved using Alternative Factor with Mix of SNR and Queue Aware (AFMSQA) scheduling algorithm. AFMSQA combines the features of these three algorithms. The paper uses NS2 to analyze the three algorithms and to compare them to the new proposed AFMSQA approach. The results show that AFMSQA provides the transaction between high throughput performance and good delay results.

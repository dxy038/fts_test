This paper details the development of a ldquobusiness gamerdquo created for a large financial institution. The objective of the game is to present the company to new employees. As the project unfolded, integrating the different kinds of knowledge into the game became the critical issue. The game has gone through 3 successive versions. A vast range of knowledge can be transmitted in a serious game; consequently, knowledge is integrated into the game in a number of different ways, either directly integrated into the game play (game mechanics) as scenarized knowledge, or made available as an external resource. A knowledge management approach has been used and refined during the development of the game. This methodology wants to complement Prensky and Chongpsilas arguments about learning techniques and learning styles.

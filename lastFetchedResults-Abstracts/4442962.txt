The prevalence of the Smart TV revealed the great potential for ubiquitous computing. The Smart TV facilitates various video contents and applications through interactive techniques. In order to enhance usability, these techniques should have an intuitive and dynamic interface. This study aims to investigate the usability of remote controls in regards to different interfaces. To achieve this objective, the usability test was conducted with twenty people who had normal vision. The task scenario for the experiment reflects the GUI structure and usage patterns of a commercial Smart TV. This research selected general and motion controllers for evaluation factors. The user response was then collected by subjective and objective measures for an evaluation. While the general controller had a better performance in utilizing basic search or simple navigation functions, the analysis of eye tracking movement revealed that the motion remote controller reduced visual distraction. Moreover, the motion control was relatively favoured in subjective ratings. These results indicate that the motion interface is suitable for advanced smart media.

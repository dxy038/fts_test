The objective of this study was to develop a preactivated chitosan derivative by the introduction of thioglycolic acid followed by 3-methyl-1-phenylpyrazole-5-thiol (MPPT) coupling via disulfide bond formation. The newly synthesized conjugate was characterized in terms of water-absorbing capacity, cohesive properties, mucoadhesion and drug release kinetics. Further in vitro characterization was conducted regarding permeation enhancement of the model compound fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells. Based on the attachment of the hydrophobic residue, chitosan–S–S–MPPT test discs showed increased stability of the polymer matrix as well as improved water uptake and liberation of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) compared to chitosan only. The mucoadhesive qualities on porcine intestinal mucosa could be improved 38-fold based on the enhanced bonding between chitosan–S–S–MPPT and mucus through the thiol/disulfide exchange reaction of polymer and mucosal cysteine-rich domains supported by MPPT as the leaving group. This novel biomaterial presents a disulfide conjugation-based delivery system that releases the antibacterial thiopyrazole when the polymer comes into contact with the intestinal mucosa. These properties, together with the safe toxicological profile, make chitosan–S–S–MPPT a valuable carrier for mucoadhesive drug delivery systems and a promising matrix for the development of antimicrobial excipients.

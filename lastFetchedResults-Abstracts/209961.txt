Objective: Co nside ring the fact that c hildren with Down
Syndrome have a severe delay in language development whi ch
does not app ear being improved by language therap y leaning
on auditory modality, this research was aimed to compare the
traditi onal educati onal method and reading method effects on
receptive and expres sive la.nguage of 4 - 10 years old Down
Syndrome children with 40 - 60 I.Q scores.
Materials & Methods: In thi s qua si expe r ime n ta l and
interv enti onal research from Navide Asr Reh ab ilitation clinic in
Tehran , Re z van Rehabilit ati on clini c in S ha hria r, Eh san
Reh abil itation clinic in Karaj and Down Syndrome Association of
Karaj , 20 Down Syndrome children were selec ted by simple and
co nvenient sampling from 96 Down Syndrome children and were
allocated int o two groups by bala.nced rand omi zed meth od. The firs t
group was edu cated by whole word reading meth od and the other gro up
was educated by traclitionaI method. Both groups had three IS-minute
educational ses sions per week for a peri od of 6-monrh.
Langu ages of both groups have been exami ned by TOLD- P: 3 test as pre
and post-test. The res ults were analy zed by statis tical test s including
Kolm ogoroff - Srnir onoff (K-S), Independent-T-Tesr and Paired- T-Test.
Results: Independent-T-Test in bo th gr oups revealed no significant
differen ces before education in receptive (P=0.452), expressive (P=O.l )
and speech (P=0 .428) Language, but after intervention period , the groups
have signific ant statistical differences in all lan guage portions such as
rec eptive (P=0.043) , express ive (P<O.OOl) and Speech (P<O.OOl ).
Conclusion: Reading educa tio n has more e ffec ts on receptive and
expressi ve la nguage in children with Down sy ndro me than the othe r
edu cat ional methods (traditional ones) .
Thu s it seems that focusing on beha vioral and cognit ive phen otype of
Down syndrome with emphas is on visual modality facilitates language
development more than auditory modality, and aptitude training may
have the best effec ts.

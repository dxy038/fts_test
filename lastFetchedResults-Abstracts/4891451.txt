In order to reduce vessel emissions and optimize berth allocation for the port group, we propose the twin ports coordinated optimization (TPCO) model within the framework of vessel-terminal coordination. By optimizing berth allocation of the twin ports and the sailing speed, both fuel consumption and total delay time of vessels can be reduced. We simulate the one-year operations of the twin ports by combining the weekly baseline berth plan and reassignment procedure to compare the performance of the TPCO strategy with the single port berth allocation (SPBA) strategy. The simulation results show that the berth plan provided by the TPCO strategy can optimize the departure delay objective, while reducing the total fuel consumption than that by the SPBA strategy. This paper provides theoretical support for the improvement of service level for the port group and the construction of green ports from the operational level.

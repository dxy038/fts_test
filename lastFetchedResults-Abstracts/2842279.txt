We study how to achieve optimal network capacity in the most energy-efficient manner over a general large-scale wireless network, say, a multi-hop multi-radio multi-channel (MR-MC) network. We develop a multi-objective optimization framework for computing the resource allocation that leads to optimal network capacity with minimal energy consumption. Our framework is based on a linear programming multi-commodity flow (MCF) formulation augmented with scheduling constraints over multi-dimensional conflict graph (MDCG). The optimization problem however involves finding all independent sets (ISs), which is NP-hard in general. Novel delayed column generation (DCG) based algorithms are developed to effectively solve the optimization problem. The DCG-based algorithms have significant advantages of low computation overhead and achieving high energy efficiency, compared to the common heuristic algorithm that randomly searches a large number of ISs to use. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the energy efficiency improvement by the proposed energy-efficient optimization techniques, over a wide range of networking scenarios.

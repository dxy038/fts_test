OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of isolated choroid plexus cysts in association with trisomy 18 and other abnormalities.
STUDY DESIGN: All patients from June 1992 through December 1995 were followed up after a screening ultrasonography. Any patient with a choroid plexus cyst was offered genetic counseling and an amniocentesis. Screening ultrasonographic examinations were performed on 16,059 patients, and 301 patients had a fetus with a choroid plexus cyst. One hundred thirty patients elected to have an amniocentesis. Patients were followed up to delivery.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three patients had an isolated choroid plexus cyst. Thirty-eight patients had a choroid plexus cyst associated with additional risk factors. Risk factors included advanced maternal age, additional ultrasonographic abnormalities, past obstetric history, or family history. No abnormalities were noted in the group with an isolated choroid plexus cyst. Four patients had an abnormality when the choroid plexus cyst was associated with an additional risk factor, including two patients with trisomy 18 and one with trisomy 21.
CONCLUSION: An isolated choroid plexus cyst was not associated with a trisomy or other abnormalities in this study. When a choroid plexus cyst was associated with an additional risk factor, 10.5% of the patients had an abnormality. Amniocentesis is recommended when a choroid plexus cyst is found in association with additional risk factors. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1381-3.)

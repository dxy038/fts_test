Distributed generation access is one of the key technologies in building smart grid. This paper added distributed power grid and energy storage system connected to the grid two indicators to current power quality assessment indicators, making the object of evaluation more comprehensive and reasonable. For the comprehensive assessment of power quality, making the assessment results more objective and accurate, constructed artificial neural network model of comprehensive assessment of power quality; take accelerated genetic algorithm to solve nonlinear optimization problems, and achieved good results.

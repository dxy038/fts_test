Nonsmooth finite-time stabilizing control laws have been developed for the double integrator system. The objective of this paper is to further explore the finite-time tracking control problem of a general form of uncertain second-order affine nonlinear system with the new forms of terminal sliding mode (TSM). Discontinuous and continuous finite-time controllers are also developed respectively without the singularity problem. Complete robustness can be acquired with the former, and enhanced robustness compared with the conventional boundary layer method can be expressed as explicit bounded function with the latter. Simulation results on the stabilizing and tracking problems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control algorithms

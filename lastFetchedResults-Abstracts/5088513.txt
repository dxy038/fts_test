Otoacoustic emissions (OAE), which are acoustic responses produced by the cochlea, can be recorded with a microphone in the ear canal to give diagnostic information regarding cochlear functioning. Recently, the researchers developed a novel stimulus for the acquisition of OAE using a hearing-level equalized (HL<inf>eq</inf>) swept-tone signal. The objective of this study was to observe OAE characteristics at a multitude of intensities to track the changes in temporal and spectral morphology. An increase in high-frequency emissions was found as stimulation intensity decreased. Furthermore, it was found that hearing level equalized swept-tone OAEs (HL<inf>eq</inf> sTEAOE) can be acquired at very low intensities, which is not typical under current acquisition modalities. This may result in clinical improvements by providing a fast and cheap method for contributing to the detection of auditory thresholds.

Bone is multi-scale hierarchical composite material making the prediction of fragility, as well as pinning it to a certain cause, complicated. For proper mechanical simulation and reflection of bone properties in models, microscopic structural features of bone tissue need to be included. This study sets out to gain a mechanistic insight into the role of various microstructural features of bone tissue in particular cement lines and interlamellar areas. Further the hypothesis that compliant interlamellar areas and cement lines within osteonal bone act as strain amplifiers was explored. To this end, a series of experimentally-based micromechanical finite element models of bovine osteonal bone were developed. Different levels of detail for the bone microstructure were considered and combined with the results of physical three-point bending tests and an analytical composite model of a single osteon. The objective was to examine local and global effects of interface structures. The geometrical and microstructural characteristics of the bone samples were derived from microscopy imaging. Parametric finite element studies were conducted to determine optimal values of the elastic modulus of interstitial bone and interlamellar areas. The average isotropic elastic modulus of interfaces suggested in this study is 88.5 MPa. Based on the modelling results, it is shown that interfaces are areas of accumulated strain in bone and are likely to act as potential paths for crack propagation. The strain amplification capability of interface structures in the order of 10 predicted by the models suggests a new explanation for the levels of strain required in bone homoeostasis for maintenance and adaptation.

The objective of this research was to identify factors affecting participation of sharers in watershed management project in the province of Fars. Iran. All sharers between 20 to 75 years of age, living in the watershed zones in Fars province, were considered as the target population for this study from which a random sample of 279 sharers were selected by Cochran's test and with cluster sampling. In addition to descriptive statistics such as Spearman coefficient (mean, S.D, variance, C.V) for analyzing data inferential statistics; such as, Kruskal-Wallis test, multivariate regression and path analysis techniques were also used. Applying Spearman rank correlation coefficient shows a meaningful relation between rate of extension services provided, motivation of sharers to participate in watershed management plans, communicative methods and public participation in watershed management projects. Applying Kruskal-Wallis test shows a meaningful difference between sharers participation based on the type of land ownership. Results from multivariate regression showed that participation in identifying the type and features of plans, contact with extension agents and experts, membership in local organizations, government infrastructure for participation and social participation of sharers had most impact(63.5%) on clarifying dependent variable (participation in watershed management). Results of path analysis showed that participation in identifying the type and features of plans have the most direct affect (0.273) on dependent variable and government infrastructure for participation have the lowest direct effect (-0.120) on dependent variable(participation in watershed management).

Societies  and  governments  are  becoming  increasingly  concerned  about  the  impact  of the  expanding  use  of  IT  equipment  on  the  environment,  especially  in  terms  of  energy efficiency, emission reduction and toxic waste. The objective of this article is to explore the relationship between IT Service Management (ITSM) and Green IT. To achieve this objective,  the  leading  best  practice  framework  for  ITSM  is  evaluated  to  explore  the depth and breadth of Green IT guidance provided in the ITIL resources. The analysis of the  ITIL  books  clearly  demonstrates  that  ITIL  provides  limited  guidance  to  support Green  IT  programs  and  confirms  the  view  that  Green  IT  and  ITSM  share  common goals,  such  as  operational  efficiencies  and  metrics-based  improvements.  In  the  second phase of  the  research,  results  of  a  recent  survey  of  IT  Service  Managers  in  Australia were  analysed  to  gauge  the  extent  of  Green  IT  awareness  and  implementation.  The extent  to  which  Green  IT  policies  and  procedures  have  been  implemented  varied substantially across the 65 organisations surveyed. The survey results indicate that most of the IT Service Managers have implemented a Green IT Policy and are aware of the importance of controlling IT waste disposal and improving energy efficiency. Based on the  discussion, recommendations  are  made  to  CIOs,  IT  Service  Managers  and  ITIL authors to continue to raise awareness of Green IT and to recognise that best practice in Green IT is evolving and needs to be distilled and articulated in ITIL publications.

Quantitative, objective methods for the evaluation of neuromuscular properties are required for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders and the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation. This paper describes how nonlinear identification and simulation methods may be used to evaluate joint properties quantitatively and distinguish the relative contributions of reflex and intrinsic mechanisms. Results from studies in normal and spinal cord injured subjects are presented to demonstrate the properties of the approach, its viability as a clinical research tool, and some of the issues that arise when comparing correlating its results with clinical evaluations.

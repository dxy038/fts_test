The objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of semi-rigid connection properties on steel frame behavior. A finite element model and computer program is developed to investigate the momentâ€“rotation behavior of eight-bolt stiffened endplate connections. The model includes both the beam side and the column side of a connection. A mesh generator is developed to generate a three-dimensional mesh with desired fineness. The numerical results are verified by comparison with experimental results. Parametric studies are conducted to develop prediction equations for the parameters in a power model representing the connection behavior. Frame analyses are conducted incorporating this connection model. A formula to classify fully and partially restrained endplate connections is proposed based on frame analysis results.

Objective: The aim of the present study is to assess the relation of the polysemic 
process of a Persian simple verb with cognitive factors. The present article Azad Islamic University
evaluates the hypothesis holding that polysemy as a linguistic process in which a
verbal element (here, a simple verb) takes diverse meanings, is not an accidental
process, but is based on cognitive abilities, and methodological differences affect
the semantic assessment of words. Method: This research can be considered as a
theoretical study regarding its aim, and as a descriptive (non-experimental) and
causal-comparative study regarding data collection. The samples of the study
were randomly chosen from among classical and modern literature as well as
colloquial language. Results: A characteristic of the present Persian language
structure is having a very limited inventory (about 115 to 130) of simple verbs
while there are many such verbs in languages such as French and English.
Polysemy or in other words the presence of various meanings for a single verbal
element can appropriately compensate for this shortcoming. In this study the
polysemy of the verb uoftadan" is assessed based on concepts such as
categorization, image schemas, prototypes and radial networks, which are central
to cognitive linguistics. Conclusion: After assessing the samples, the hypothesis
was approved and it was shown that humans' physical and material experiences
and tendencies influence their manner of conceptualization and understanding of
polysemic verbs. Also, it was revealed that the best function of prototype is in

polysemy. Semantic relations in a word are graduated and not absolute.

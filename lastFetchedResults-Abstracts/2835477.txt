This paper presents an efficient and reliable solution of economic load dispatch using pseudo gradient based particle swarm optimization (PGPSO). The objective of the problem is to minimize fuel cost for power generation while meeting operating constraints. The proposed PGPSO is the particle swarm optimization guided by pseudo gradient for better search ability As the wind energy is growing renewable energy source, it is necessary to include wind energy conversion system generators in the economic load dispatch problems. The stochastic nature of wind power output and the imbalance charges such as over estimation cost and under estimation cost due to forecasting errors of wind are taken into account. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for six unit and fifteen unit thermal system with and without wind power and the results are compared with PSO.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop and test an incremental dosing protocol for women with adverse reaction to metronidazole and severe symptomatic Trichomonas vaginitis. STUDY DESIGN: Two women with documented Trichomonas infection and presumed metronidazole allergy were initially treated with a number of alternative methods without success. With persistent severe symptoms associated with their infection, these women were admitted to the hospital and underwent an intravenous incremental metronidazole dosing protocol. RESULTS: Both patients were successfully treated without adverse event. They are both symptom-free and apparently cured several months after treatment. CONCLUSION: This protocol offers a new therapeutic option to women with adverse metronidazole reactions and severe symptomatic Trichomonas vaginitis resistant to treatment with nonmetronidazole therapy.

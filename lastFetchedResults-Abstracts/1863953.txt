Objective: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide. Conventional treatments use cytotoxic drugs which have high numbers of side effects. Currently pharmacologists are searching for novel drugs with fewer side effects and maximum efficiency as breast cancer treatment. The aim of the current study is to clarify the cytotoxicity effect of the recombinant outer membrane inflammatory protein (oipA) of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) on a breast cancer cell line.
Methods: We purified recombinant H. pylori oipA by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography. Breast cancer cells (4T1) were treated with different concentrations of recombinant oipA for various lengths of time. Cell viability was evaluated by the viability assay (MTT test).
Results: SDS-PAGE analysis showed the expression of an approximately 34000 dalton protein. Statistical analysis showed oipA toxic effects on 4T1 cells at a concentration of 250 µg/ml after 24 h.
Conclusion:  These findings suggested that oipA had a direct toxic effect on a breast cancer cell line (4T1) in vitro. The oipA protein might be a new tool for future therapeutic strategies in cancer immunotherapy.

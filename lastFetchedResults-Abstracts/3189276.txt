DIBR (Depth-Image-Based Rendering) is attracting a lot of interests as one of the new types of technologies. In this article, we propose a novel approach for virtual view rendering based on DIBR. For the problems of incorrect warped pixels and holes in virtual view image, we proposed the isolated pixels removing method to remove the isolated pixels and hole filling method based on background separation to effectively fill the holes. Experimental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory subjective visual effect and objective peak signal noise ratio (PSNR).

A CMOS integrated circuit for a noninvasive biological-signal telemetry system specified for use in medical and physiological studies of the influence of weightlessness in space is presented. The system can monitor multichannel (4 channels maximum) biological signals from multiple subjects (4 subjects maximum) in real time by using time multiplexing. A key technique so-called synchronized multiple-subject telemetry, to achieve multiple-subject telemetry has been proposed. This technique utilizes bidirectional optical transmissions with direct and scattered infrared lights between an observer and each of the subjects. An experimental CMOS IC to give a small light-weight low-power, and smart telemetry instrument for use on animals has been developed. This IC is for evaluating circuit blocks of the implantable monolithic telemetry instrument. The major circuit blocks include CMOS digital circuits for synchronization, subject selection and time multiplexing, analog circuits for pulse interval modulation, and other blocks such as a CMOS optical pulse receiver and an LED driver. A preliminary experimental multichannel telemetry from two subjects has been performed with the implemented IC chips, and the principal operation of the multiple-subject optical biotelemetry has been demonstrated.

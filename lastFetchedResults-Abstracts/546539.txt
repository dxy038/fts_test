The objective of this study is to report the research priorities of the Cardiovascular Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in 2009.
Materials and Methods: This study involved 48 faculty members and other stakeholders in 2009. There were five basic principles including stakeholders’ participation and consensus, situation analysis, need assessment, defining research priority topics, and scoring the criteria. This is a modified version of the proposed model of “The Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED).
Results: Twenty diseases were determined as research priorities of the cardiovascular research center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. These priorities included myocardial infarction, hypertension, unstable angina, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, heart failure, stable angina, metabolic syndrome, coronary bypass complications, pulmonary embolism, heart valve diseases, prevention of deep vein thrombosis, rheumatic fever, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death, Peripheral vascular disease, syncope, angioplasty and valvuloplasty, cardiovascular diseases: epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, prevention, rehabilitation, socioeconomic factors, knowledge, attitude, and practice to risk factors and prevention.
‍Conclusion: Providing researchers with a list of research priorities and commitment to it, conduct research topics toward priorities and consequently the most productivity is achieved from the limited resources.

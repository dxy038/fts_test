The primary objective of our study was to provide a simple and reliable assay for identifying the majority of G6PD genetic variants in the Chinese population. We optimized the multiplex primer extension reaction (MPER) assay for simultaneous screening of 14-point mutations in 98 G6PD-deficient subjects. Our data demonstrated that this method is precise, cost-effective and has successfully identified mutations in 97 out of 98 subjects, including all heterozygous mutants. We also detected a relatively high incidence (12.3%) of c.871G>A, and all of them harbored the silent mutation c.1311C>T. Apart from the screening program, the pharmacogenetic relationship between G6PD level and residual reduced glutathione (GSH) level was studied upon oxidative challenge by Î±-naphthol. The GSH levels were correlated with their status of G6PD deficiency, but no significant difference was observed between individual G6PD-deficient groups. Our data demonstrated the potentials of the MPER assay for characterization of G6PD deficiency and other genetic diseases.

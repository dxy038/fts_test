Modular permanent magnet poles have recently been proposed to enhance the performance of permanent magnet machines and improve the exploitation of used magnet materials. An optimisation method for these poles is proposed for use in linear permanent magnet synchronous machines. The main objective of the optimisation is to select proper dimensions and material properties of modular permanent magnet poles to enhance the machine developed thrust. The optimisation is carried out based on a mathematical model of the machine obtained analytically. In particular, the developed thrust of linear permanent synchronous machines with modular poles is given by the model. Genetic algorithm is then employed to optimise pole parameters where the ratio of thrust ripples to average thrust is chosen as an objective function. Extensive investigations carried out by analytical and finite element methods confirm that substantial lower thrust ripples are produced with almost the same average thrust.

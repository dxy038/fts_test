In this paper, we propose a game based learning content supporting intelligent tutoring functionality. The learning objective of our game based learning content is to understand the Karnaugh Map which is generally utilized to simplify boolean functions. Our game based learning content well-motivates learners with interesting game based scenarios and also its intelligent tutoring module gives learners some adaptive feedbacks such as hints and explanations as needed, while maintaining learners immersed in learning context. In the experiment of our game based learning content, we identified significant improvement in terms of learning effectiveness by analyzing the test results of two (experimental and control) student groups learning the simplification of boolean functions.

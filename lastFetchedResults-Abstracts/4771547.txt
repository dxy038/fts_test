A structurally integrated conformal wideband array operating in UHF over 4:1 band has been built and tested with excellent results obtained. The double-deck array is laminated in the leading and trailing edges of a non-conducting flying wing designed for an ultra lightweight high altitude long endurance ISR UAV design concept funded by AFRL. It has one array for each quadrant on the UAV platform to provide near 360&#176; field of regard in AZ coverage. The notional design of the objective array is 13.7 m long (60 elements), double-deck, H-pol, with ~23 dBi directivity and 2.5&#176; beam width in AZ, 60&#176; in EL, at 450 MHz.

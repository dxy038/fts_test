Objective
Factors correlated with cigarette smoking in young people have yet to be documented in most developing countries. This study assesses the correlates of smoking in Mexican young people.
Methods

School-based, cross-sectional study in the central Mexican state of Morelos during the 1998–1999 school year of 13,293 public school students aged 11 to 24 years. Multinomial logistic regression models were constructed with smoking as the dependent variable.
Results

Regular smoking (one or more cigarettes daily) prevalence was 13.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=12.2–13.9) in males, and 6.1% (95% CI=5.6–6.6) in females. Frequent alcohol intoxication was strongly associated with regular smoking (females, odds ratio [OR]=68.5, 95% CI=37.6–125.2; males, OR=34.5, 95% CI=22.6–52.7). Regular smoking was associated with illegal drug use and smoking by both parents in females, and with illegal drug use in males (males, OR=4.9, 95% CI=3.7–6.5). Also associated with tobacco smoking were high socioeconomic status, low academic achievement, illegal drug use by peers, marijuana use by parents, and depression in adolescents.
Conclusions

This study documents a strong correlation between tobacco smoking and other health risk behaviors, especially alcohol and drug abuse. In young women especially, the risk of tobacco use increased with alcohol abuse and higher socioeconomic status. School-based interventions are needed that focus on preventing smoking and also take into account other unhealthy behaviors.

Objective
luate whether a 3-factor model of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale would fit the constellation of sleep disturbances in patients with a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
s
utive CFS patients filled out the PSQI. Scores from this self-report questionnaire were examined with exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
s
S patients were included for analysis in this study. CFA showed that the 7 PSQI component scores clustered into the 3 factors reported by Cole et al. (2006), i.e. Sleep Efficiency, Perceived Sleep Quality and Daily Disturbances. In contrast with the single-factor and all 2-factor models, all factor loadings were significant, and all goodness-of-fit values were acceptable.
sion
, the PSQI operates as a 3-factor scoring model as initially seen in healthy and depressed older adults. The separation into 3 discrete factors suggests the limited usefulness of the global PSQI as a single factor for the assessment of subjective sleep quality, as also evidenced by a low Cronbach's alpha (0.64) in this patient sample.

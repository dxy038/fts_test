Cellular Automata is significantly applying to image processing operations. The description about the use of training of cellular automata for thinning and thickening of binary images is exemplified by this paper. The selection of best rule set from large search space has been performed on the basis of objective function MatchedCount values between standard function and CA rules applied to images. The proposed method is also compared with some standard methods.

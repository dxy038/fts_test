We discuss the effect of physical impairments on manycasting service over optical burst-switched (OBS) networks. Signal quality degradation in manycast networks is an important issue and it can occur due to fiber attenuation, splitter switch, and amplified spontaneous noise in EDFA. These physical layer impairments causes the signal quality to be weak at the receiver and hence burst may not be detected. Our objective is to select the manycast destinations based on resource unavailability and the quality of signal received. We propose three impairment- aware algorithms that take into account of the physical layer impairments. Using extensive simulation results we compute average burst loss probability, both due to contention and signal degradation. These simulation results are verified by the analytical model. We have also compared our results with random destination selection using binomial model and observe that our methods perform better than the random selection method.

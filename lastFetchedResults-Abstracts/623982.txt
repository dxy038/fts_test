Abstract

Background and Objective: Chronic neurologic diseases due to associated disabilities and high cost of  their medical services are considered as a crisis for patients and family. The stress caused by these problems can jeopardize the health of the caregivers. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the general health status of neurologic patients’ caregivers and the related factors.
Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted in 2009, the caregivers of the patients with neurological disorders (n=200) were selected via convenience sampling.  The data  was gathered by a demographic checklist and general health questionnaire (GHQ-28) completed by caregivers and analyzed by descriptive statistic , Pearson correlation coefficient and chi square, using  SPSS-16.
Results: The mean age is 31.78±9.94 and 59.5% of the subjects are males. The caregivers (72.5%) general health is disturbed (Score more than 23 based on GHQ-28 cut of point). General health of male and female caregivers is significantly different (P < 0.05). Between the subscales of GHQ-28, female caregivers compared to males have higher depression score, which is significant (P < 0.05).   The caregivers’ general health are correlated with (P < 0.05) the patient’s care dependency and the income of family.  There is no significant relationship between general health and demographic variables such as marital status, history of the disease and educational level.
Conclusion: Based on the results, significant percent of caregivers of the patients with neurological disorders suffer from disrupted general health. Thus, the presence of supportive resources and effective coping skills can be effective in improving the health.

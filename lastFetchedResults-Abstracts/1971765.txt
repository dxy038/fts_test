The objective of this study was to develop a species-specific PCR assay for authentication and traceability of Yellow Drum (Nibea albiflora) from surimi products using a primer pair design based on mt-DNA 12S rDNA sequences for amplification of 193Â bp DNA fragments. The specificity of the PCR assay was broadly tested with DNA of eleven species of samples, such as Yellow Drum, Large Yellow Croaker, Hairtail, Silver carp, Grass Carp, Bighead carp, Eel, chicken, pork, corn starch and wheat starch, all of which were mainly used in surimi products in China. The results showed that positive amplification was only observed in N. albiflora. The detection limits of the PCR assay was found to be less than 0.5% in admixed fresh surimi products containing Yellow Drum and Large Yellow Croaker. Even in chewed and vomited samples, N. albiflora could also be authenticated and traced successfully. In conclusion, the developed assay was very specific and sensitive for rapid authentication and traceability of N. albiflora in deeply processed surimi products.

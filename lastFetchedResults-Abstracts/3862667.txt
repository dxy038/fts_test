In this paper, we characterize the polarization impedance behavior of several common metals in diluted NaCl solution operated at low current densities. The objective was to provide a useful reference for those wishing to calculate the electrode polarization impedance in diluted NaCl solutions. Serial equivalent resistance (R) and capacitance (C) for silver, aluminum, gold, platinum, and medical stainless-steel were measured as a function of frequency (10<sup>-2</sup>-10<sup>3</sup> Hz) and NaCl concentration (2.4-77.0 mmol/L). The ratio of electrode polarization impedance with respect to the bulk resistance was calculated and plotted against concentration for each metal. Such a ratio shows the effect of the electrode polarization contribution as a function of electrolyte concentration when the bulk resistance of the solution changes. All metals showed a decrease of serial resistance R<sub>p</sub> and capacitance C<sub>p</sub> as a function of frequency. The medical stainless-steel electrode showed largest impedance values at lower frequencies compared to the other electrodes, and was concentration independent at all frequencies. Aluminum had smallest polarization impedance at low frequencies. Pure gold and platinum behaved similar with the exception that the serial resistance for gold showed a lower value at higher frequencies.

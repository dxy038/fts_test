Objectives
The objective of this study was to investigate the use of three new bis-(acrylamide)s as cross-linker in resin-based composite restoratives. Selected mechanical properties such as flexural strength and flexural modulus of model composites containing bis-(acrylamide)s were investigated and compared to the properties of composites that are based on only conventional dimethacrylates. In addition, the hydrolytic stability of composites containing an acidic monomer was examined.
Methods

The flexural strength and flexural modulus of elasticity were determined according to ISO 4049:2000. For this purpose, test specimens (2 mm × 2 mm × 25 mm) of the composites investigated were prepared in stainless steel moulds and light-cured (150 mW/cm2, 2× 180 s). The flexural strength and flexural modulus were measured after the samples had been stored in dry conditions or in water for 24 h at 37 °C as well as after they had been stored in water for 7 days at 37 °C, and in certain cases, after they had been boiled for 24 h in water.
Results

Visible light cured mixtures of dimethacrylates with bis-(acrylamide)s and composites based on these mixtures show a similar reactivity, flexural strength and flexural modulus of elasticity compared to materials that contain only dimethacrylate. The composites did not show any deterioration of the mechanical properties after water storage. Only when strongly acidic monomers were added to the composites containing dimethacrylates or bis-(acrylamide)s did the flexural strength and flexural modulus of the samples decrease after they were stored in water.
Significance

Bis-(acrylamide)s were similarly reactive than dimethacrylates and therefore can be used as diluents to substitute dimethacrylate diluents in composites. Although the bis-(acrylamide)s are entirely soluble in water, non-ionic materials based on bis-(acrylamide)s did not strongly change their mechanical properties during storage in water.

Background and Objective: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of a broad spectrum of chronic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Patients in 90% of cases characterized by elevated levels of serum aminotransferases. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of diet and aerobic training with diet on serum aminotransferases levels in patients with NASH. 

Materials and Methods: Twenty-three NASH patients with an age range of 25 to 50 years old were randomly divided into two groups of diet (n=11) and aerobic training with diet (n=12). In this study, diet in both groups included 500 kilocalories of energy and loss was daily calculated. The second group in addition to diet also participated in aerobic training which consisted of walking, jogging and running for a period of 8 weeks, 3 days a week with 55â€“60% heart rate reserve.
Serum aminotransferases levels before and after the intervention was measured by photometric method. Data were analyzed by paired samples and independent-samples t-test at a significance level of p < 0.05. 

Results: The changes within groups regarding serum ALT and AST levels were not significant in patients of diet group; but changes were significant in aerobic training plus diet group. The comparison of between groups showed that there exists a significant difference between both groups in levels of serum aminotransferases. 

Conclusion: Reduction of serum aminotransferases levels occurs due to reduced risk factors pathogeneses and reduced hepatocyte inflammation. Probably, the combined program (aerobic exercise with diet) is more effective for prevention, control and treatment of NASH.

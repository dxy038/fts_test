Main objective of this study is to create hydrological cycling environment in the salt flats, called ChiKu KuanHaiLou National Wetland in Taiwan as case study, so the gate operation based on three designed planning and assessments in wetland by SMS-2D simulation, carried out rain water into the salt flood plain to dilute the salinity of salt water beach area. In other words, this study intends to control the water level and salt water by gate operation following the existed infrastructure for the division of the segments and water circulation system and provides reliable information and references for the concept of wetland ecological habitat planning.

Compania Geral de Cal e Cimento SARL (SECIL) is in the process of implementing a comprehensive and modern energy management project for rational use of electricity. A step in energy management implementation is the reduction of electric energy consumption (kWh/t). The preparation and first results of this new effort is the major topic. Emphasis is placed on extensive electronic energy metering and process data recording. These data are processed and refined to energy information that, in effect, uncovers hidden savings potentials. Energy information and related saving measures are introduced into daily organizational operating procedures and are backed up by a permanent energy management team. More than a 6% per annum electric energy cost reduction has already been achieved. Additionally, a 3 to 6% reduction of specific electric energy is a projected savings objective

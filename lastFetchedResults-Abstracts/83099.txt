Understanding reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) is essential in planning the most effective use of water resources in the arid northwest China. The objective of the present work in the middle Heihe River basin were: (1) to determine the best model for calculating the areal distribution of reference crop evapotranspiration in this region, and (2) to estimate the spatial distribution of the irrigation requirements of spring wheat. Note that eight commonly used formulates were tested and that FAO-Penman was the best. The irrigation amount of spring wheat in 2000 was estimated by three steps. First, DEM-based and GIS-assisted methods were employed to estimate the spatial distribution of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) according to FAO-Penman model. Then, spring wheat evapotranspiration (ET) was calculated by ET0 and crop-coefficient (Kc). Finally, the maximum irrigation amount of spring wheat was estimated with the spring wheat evapotranspiration and precipitation in the different growing stage. The maximum irrigation has temporal-spatial variation. Temporally the irrigation amount appears the largest in June when it is the peak period of spring wheat development. The irrigation amount is the smallest in July because spring wheat was in late-season stage. In April, spring wheat was in seedling stage during which the water demand is also small. Spatially the irrigation amount increases from southeast to northwest.

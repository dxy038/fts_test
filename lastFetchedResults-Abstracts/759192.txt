We investigated a risk-resilience model in 91 girls with ADHD and 58 age- and ethnicity-equated
comparison girls, who participated in all-female naturalistic summer research camps. The hypothesized
risk factor was peer rejection (assessed via sociometric nominations), with criterion measures
including multiinformant composites of aggressive behavior and anxious/depressed symptoms. The
two hypothesized protective factors were the girlsâ€™ popularity with adult staff (assessed via staff ratings)
and objective observations of goal-directed solitary play. Peer rejection was related to higher
levels of aggressive behavior and depressed/anxious behavior, confirming its status as a risk factor.
Next, for all girls, popularity with adults predicted lower levels of aggression and goal-directed solitary
play predicted lower levels of anxiety/depression. Whereas popularity with adults was most protective
among the peer-accepted subgroup, solitary play was most protective among the peer-rejected
subgroup. Diagnostic status (ADHD versus comparison) moderated the findings such that engaging
in meaningful solitary play was a stronger predictor of lower levels of anxious/depressed behavior
in girls with ADHD than in comparison girls. We discuss the need for replication in prospective research
and implications for research and intervention regarding the social functioning of peer-rejected
children, particularly those with behavior disorders.

Inroduction & Objective: Neurogenin-3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NEUROG3 gene. Neurogenin-3 is expressed in endocrine progenitor cells and is required for endocrine cell development in the pancreas and intestine. Ngn3 expression peaks during the major wave of endocrine cell genesis، is greatly diminished at birth، and is largely absent from the mature pancreas.
Materials and Methods: Total RNA was extracted from adult human pancreatic tissue using Mini-RNease RNA extract kit. PCR was used to identify the gene expression on Neurogenin-3 in adult Pancreas.
Results: RT-PCR analysis showed Neurogenin-3 gene expression.
Conclusion: NGN3 is transiently expressed in endocrine progenitor cells when the pancreas developed in the human embryo. But in this study we showed that NGN3gene expresses in adult human Pancreas. Probably the endocrine progenitor cells present within human adult pancreas and maybe NGN3gene expresses  after any major organ insult.

Objective: The study was undertaken to evaluate whether raloxifene influences endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation in women. Study design: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study, 30 osteopenic but otherwise healthy postmenopausal women received either placebo (n = 15 with one dropout) or raloxifene (60 mg/d, N = 15). Brachial artery flow-mediated endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation was evaluated by ultrasound before and after 6 months of treatment, along with lipid and glucose metabolism. Endothelium-dependent dilatation was evaluated after a 4-minute block of artery blood flow through a cuff insufflated at suprasystolic blood pressure. Endothelium-independent vasodilatation was evaluated after sublingual nitroglycerin administration (400 μg). Results: Placebo did not modify any vascular or metabolic parameter. Raloxifene significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein levels (4.60 ± 0.18 mmol/L vs 3.94 ± 0.30 mmol/L, P< .015) but did not modify endothelium-dependent (21.6% ± 4.6% vs 20.6% ± 3.8%) or endothelium-independent vasodilatation (26.3% ± 5.1% vs 32.0% ± 5.5%). Conclusion: Prolonged administration of raloxifene does not influence endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation of osteopenic but otherwise healthy postmenopausal women.

Participation is one of the main factors of development, especially of sustainable development. But in Developing countries plans and projects of rural development has failure because of not considering this fact. We studied the social attitudes and their effects on the rate of social participation by using survey method. We chose randomly 190 head of the families of Desheh by using Cochran Formula. To collect the needed data, we have applied questionnaires', interviews and using Spss and descriptive and interpretive statistics proportional with the levels of studied variables and data to analyze. In the finding section, we have measured indicators of social participation in subjective and objective levels along with the social attitudes including: believing in group working, innovation, fatalism, improvement and progress of village condition and tribalism. Due to finding, we came to this conclusion that: if we have a higher degree of innovation, willing to group working and belief in improvement among villagers, we will have a higher degree of social participation, whilst, tribalism and fatalism function as obstacles of participation among villagers. Also multi variant regression showed that belief in improvement, progress and fatalism in order have the most and the least effects on social participation.

The Whiteboard is a synchronous and collaborative tool of Eduquito virtual learning environment, projected in line with the accessibility principals and universal design, whose objective is to increase the knowledge socialization and promote the real-time decision making. When we consider the development process of this online collaboration tool, we reveal permanent verification and validation movements of its resources and features together with the human diversity. Aspects resulting from the Culture of Collaboration and Participation are discussed to delineate the WEB2.0, a perspective that will be concrete with the guarantee of everybodyÂ´s participation, specially of the ones with special needs. The whiteboard tool adds to the other resources of Eduquito virtual learning environment modeled by the NIEE/UFRGS team with the objective of aggregating digital resources to open spaces of individual and collective authorship, to promote literacy and impel practices that value the human diversity.

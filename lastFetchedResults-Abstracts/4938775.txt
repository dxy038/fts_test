In this paper we consider the problem of minimum nominal H<sub>2 </sub>-norm with H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-constraints for systems with multiple operating points. The performance measure is defined as a weighted sum of the corresponding nominal H<sub>2</sub>-norms while robust stability of the individual closed-loop systems is defined in terms of a H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-bound for each plant condition. In this paper we define a new time-domain scalar cost function J<sub>&#8734; </sub>(t<sub>f</sub>) representing the H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-bounds in an overall cost function for the mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-design. J<sub>&#8734;</sub>(t<sub>f </sub>) is, for finite time t<sub>f</sub>, a penalty function and, for t <sub>f</sub>&#8594;&#8734;, a barrier function. Using J<sub>&#8734;</sub>(t<sub>f</sub>), the mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-design problem results in an unconstrained optimization problem, that, for t<sub>f</sub>&#8594;&#8734;, recovers the original objective of minimizing the performance measure subject to the H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-bounds. The resulting optimization problem is smooth and hence standard gradient-based software can be applied. The class of controllers considered includes proper and strictly proper LTI controllers with fixed structure and/or fixed order

The main opsonins in serum are antibodies and complement factor C3. The opsonization mechanisms including complement activation and deposition are important in studies of phagocytosis and of mechanisms of microbial immune evasion. The objective of the present study was to monitor the deposition of complement C3 and IgG from equine serum on yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using a flow cytometric immunoassay. Correlations were made between the opsonic coating and phagocytic capacity using equine blood neutrophils. In addition, the bound C3 fragments were characterized by SDS–PAGE and Western blot analyses.

c coating of yeast with equine C3 and IgG occurred rapidly with detectable levels with as little as 0.75% serum. C3 deposition was a result of complement activation and no passive adsorption was observed. When complement was inactivated, the fluorescence indicating IgG deposition increased 3–6-fold, indicating spatial competition between C3 and IgG at binding.

zation with 1.5% serum led to suboptimal equine neutrophil phagocytosis of yeast cells which was dependent on complement activation by the classical pathway. With ≥6.25% serum, IgG contributed to opsonization and phagocytosis. With 50% serum and more, C3 was deposited also by the alternative pathway. Phagocytosis rates became optimal with 3% serum, and did not increase further with higher serum concentrations. The main form of C3 on the yeast cells was iC3b and the rest was C3b without any detectable breakdown products (C3c or C3dg). The equine complement components are similar in size to the human equivalents.

 be concluded that opsonization of yeast particles leading to phagocytosis, occurs at very low serum concentrations (1.5%) and that it is dependent on activation of the classical complement pathway at this low opsonic level. This is an important finding for efficient host defense, e.g. extravascular phagocytosis at infection sites.

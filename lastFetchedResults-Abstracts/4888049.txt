As Third Generation (3G) mobile networks start to be implemented, there is a need for effective network planning. However, deciding upon the optimum placement for the base stations of the networks is a complex task requiring vast computational resource. This paper discusses the conflicting objectives of base station planning and characterises a multi-objective optimisation problem. We present a genetic encoding of the third generation mobile network planning problem and parallel genetic algorithms to solve it.

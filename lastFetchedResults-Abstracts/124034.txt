Objective:
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the oral cavity. Since its incidence in the world is increasing and survival index continues to be small and also histopathological features are not defined sufficiently to determine the true nature of this neoplasm. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Argyropilic nucleolar organizer protein region (AgNOR) in dysplastic and SCC of oral cavity.
Material and methods:
58 Paraffin embedded tissue of resected specimens of the oral cavity from patients. were retrieved from files of pathology department of Mashhad Dental School. Samples were including: non-dysphasic mucosa (n = 10), dysphasic mucosa (n = 10), oral scc grade I (n = 20), grade II (n = 9) and grade III (n = 9). Nucleolar AgNOR dots were studied in epithelial cells of non-dysphasic, dysphasic and squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity by a light microscope. The average number of AgNOR dots in the nuclei of 100 cells and their distribution rate in nuclei, which had five or more AgNOR dots were counted.
Results:
There was a significant increase in the number of AgNOR dots as histological grading of lesion was increased and the percentage of cells exhibiting AgNORs dots with at least five or more AgNOR dots also increased.

Conclusion
We have showed that the rate of AgNOR distribution score in the nucleous of epithelial cells in malignant and non-malignant lesion is an important diagnostic marker at the light microscopic level.

In image fusion domain, generic pixel-based image fusion methods are sensitive to imperfections of source images, and it therefore has much influence on the quality of the fusion results. Focusing on this problem, a region-based multi-focus image fusion scheme is proposed based on the local spatial frequency (LSF) in this paper. Firstly, calculate LSF for each pixel of source images, and a segmentation of the average image is introduced to segment the source images. From the segmented image, a shared region representation is obtained to label the source images. The identification of important features in shared region representation, region spatial frequency (RSF), is used to guide the fusion process. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme works well in multi-focus image fusion, and it outperforms comparison methods in terms of visual and objective evaluations.

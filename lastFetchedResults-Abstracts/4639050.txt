In this paper we address the problem of content-based image retrieval using sketch-based queries. We focus on the particularities of image databases encountered in typical topographic applications, and present the development of a spatial data management system that enables such queries. The query uses as input user provided sketches of the shape and spatial configuration of the object (or objects) which should appear in the images to be retrieved. The objective of the search is to retrieve images that contain a configuration of objects sufficiently similar to the one specified in the query. Our approach combines the design of an integrated database with the development of the necessary matching tools. Our matching tool is inspired by least-squares matching (lsm), and represents an extension of lsm to function with a variety of raster representations. We discuss our overall strategy and present some relevant algorithmic and implementation aspects, as well as associated system design issues

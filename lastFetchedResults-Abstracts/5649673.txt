The performance of call capacity for the base station (BS) in the CDMA mobile system (CMS) is analyzed, and the simulation results are compared with the analytical results. Also, the bottleneck points and problems which may occur in the BS are pointed out. For analyzing the call capacity, the major parameters for the modeling the BS are extracted and the simulation model for the BS is suggested. The simulation results are estimated by finding major objective factors such as the blocking probability, the utilization ratio and the delay time in the traffic channel elements (TCEs), the CDMA interconnection network (CIN) packet router, the base transceiver subsystem (BTS) interconnection network (BIN)-GIN trunks and the transcoding channels

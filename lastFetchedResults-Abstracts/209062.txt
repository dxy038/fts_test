Background & Objective: Hinosan is an organophosphate that inhibit acetylcolinesterase
activity, which could be resulted in damages of genital organs. This compound has been used
extensively in the agriculture, for pest control. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the
effect of Hinosan on spermatogenesis in mice.
Materials & Methods: For this experimental study, the male mice were divided into three
groups. In the cases group, mice were injected with Hinosan consecutive doses (20mglkg i.p,
live consecutive days per week for one month), sham (normal saline) and control (no injection).
Animals were scarified 7 days after the latest Hinosan injection, Therefore, the mice testis
sections were prepared and morphologic aspects of testis and spermatogenesis processes were
examined. Data were analyzed using of one-way ANOVA. Significance was set at P<O.05.
Results: The Hinosan showed a significant decrease in number of germ cells, spermatocyt,
spermatids, Leydig cells, blood vessels and also diameter of seminiferous on testes of the mice
decreased, compared with control groups (P<O.05),
Conclusion: This study demenstrated that Hinosan is effective on spermatogenesis and
seminiferous tubule structure, also can decrease germinal cells.

Introduction & Objective: The nosocomial infection is great medical problem and caused infectious disease, increased hospitalization time, pert of time, energy, and economical source and death. This research for evaluation microbial contamination level of different hospital instrument In medical training center of Hajar shahrekord.
Materials & Methods: This is a descriptive cross sectional research carried out for a period of 3 years at Hajar educational hospital. Sample were selected judgmental sampling. For data collection based on the goals of research the 137 microbial culture from different hospital wards and equipments (medical and non medical) were done.
Results: The finding frame 137 cultures were showed that125 microbial culture was positive (91%) and 12 microbial cultures was negative (9%). The among microbial culture the highest bacterial contamination is related to bacillus bacteria (32.1%). The among different hospital wards highest bacterial contamination is related to heart, neonate, internal ,intensive care unit 1 and 2 and dialysis  is(96%) labor (95.5%)- neonate (90.5%) operation room (80%)-the among different hospital instrument highest microbial contamination for non medical instrument is related to phone device and patient document cover (100%) and handle refrigerator (90%) and for medical instrument is related to O2 manometer and personal hand is (100%).
Conclusion: The findings of this research showed that microbial contamination of Hajar hospitals equipment (medical and non medical) is high. Their for indication of appropriate disinfectant agent for equipment and suitable hand washing before nursing procedures and randomized microbial culturing from hospital equipment and used from arteriogram test for reduce of microbial contamination-mortality- morbidity are suggested.

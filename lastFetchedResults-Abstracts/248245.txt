A large-deformation model for thin shells composed of elasto-plastic material is presented in this work.
Formulation of the shell model, equivalent to the two-dimensional Cosserat continuum, is developed from
the three-dimensional continuum by employing standard assumptions on the distribution of the displacement
Þeld in the shell body. A model for thin shells is obtained by an approximation of terms describing the
shell geometry. Finite rotations of the director Þeld are described by a rotation vector formulation. An
elasto-plastic constitutive model is developed based on the von Mises yield criterion and isotropic
hardening. In this work, attention is restricted to problems where strains remain small allowing for all
aspects of material identiÞcation and associated computational treatment, developed for small-strain elastoplastic
models, to be transferred easily to the present elasto-plastic thin-shell model. A Þnite element
formulation is based on the four-noded isoparametric element. A particular attention is devoted to the
consistent linearization of the shell kinematics and elasto-plastic material model, in order to achieve
quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence typical for the NewtonÐRaphson-based solution procedures. To
illustrate the main objective of the present approach Ð namely the simulation of failures of thin elastoplastic
shells typically associated with buckling-type instabilities and/or bending-dominated shell problems
resulting in formation of plastic hinges Ð several numerical examples are presented. Numerical results are
compared with the available experimental results and representative numerical simulations.

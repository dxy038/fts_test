In situ force in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has been quantified both in vitro in response to relatively simple loads by means of robotic technology, as well as in vivo in response to more complex loads by means of force transducers and computational models. However, a methodology has been suggested to indirectly estimate the in situ forces in the ACL in a non-invasive, non-contact manner by reproducing six-degree of freedom (six-DOF) in vivo kinematics on cadaveric knees using a robotic/UFS testing system. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of this approach. Kinematics from eight porcine knees (source knees) were collected at 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion in response to: (1) an anterior load of 100 N and (2) a valgus load of 5 N m. The average of each kinematic data set was reproduced on a separate set of eight knees (target knees). The in situ forces in the ACL were determined for both sets of knees and compared. Significant differences (ρ<0.05) were found between the source knees and the target knees for all flexion angles in response to an anterior load. However, in response to valgus loads, there was no significant difference between the source knees and the target knees at 30° and 90° of flexion. It was noted that there was a correlation between anterior knee laxity (the distance along the displacement axis from the origin to the beginning of the linear region of the load–displacement curve) and internal–external rotation. These data suggest that in order to obtain reproducible results one needs to first match knees to knees with comparable anterior knee laxity. Thus, an estimate of the in situ forces in the ACL during in vivo activities might be obtainable using this novel methodology.

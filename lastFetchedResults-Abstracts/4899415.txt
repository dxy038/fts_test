This paper proposes a methodology for fusion of high resolution satellite SAR and Optical Panchromatic images. The main objective of fusion is to bring together complementary information contained in SAR and Optical images. The paper discusses and illustrates the issues involved in merging and choosing of suitable approaches to overcome them. The choosing of proper fusion method was explained from the point of nature of SAR and Optical wave interaction with the surface and objective of fusion. Two methods are proposed in this paper one is based on Fourier filtering and the other is based on multiresolution pyramid. The methodologies are applied on Cartosat-1 Panchromatic and TerraSAR-X images. The results and evaluation of the fusion based on entropy are presented.

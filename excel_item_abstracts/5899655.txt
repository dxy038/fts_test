Systematic error has a complicated transformation regulation. The separation of systematic error is one of the most important matters of researches on the measuring system. In order to break restrictions of traditional methods, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to the process of separating systematic error. Endpoints continuation based on the degree of wave similarity is put forward to restrain end effect. We give two kinds of simulations: only systematic error and systematic error mixed by random error. The results imply that EMD brings a good effect on the separation.

The AUV Guanay II is a vehicle developed by SARTI research group of Universitat Polite&#768;cnica de Catalunya with the objective of providing a platform for measuring oceanographic variables, such as the temperature and salinity of the water column. In the vertical dive is important not to disturb the environment to avoid influencing in the measurements. For this reason a variable buoyancy (VB) system to do the vertical immersions has been designed. This paper presents the model designed to change the buoyancy of the vehicle and the tests both laboratory and field.

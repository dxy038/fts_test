This paper examines the connections between
the training models of late19th century Schools
of Design (Art) as exemplified by the first municipal
School of Art (Margaret Street, Birmingham)
and the current preparation of specialist teachers
of Art and Design. A recurrent theme is the paradox
of objective, measurable standards, pitted
against notions of subjective independent learning,
individual relevance and choice. Consistent
with other papers from this author, the thrust of
the perspective is questioning the compatibility
of an examination-dominated agenda and opportunities
for experimentation, creative risk taking
and forms of supported, purposeful play. Continuing
research explores the concept and purpose
of drawing in an increasingly technological, global
information society.
Professor John Swift, former Head of School of
Art Education, made significant contribution to the
historical records associated with the Birmingham
School of Art archives and much of what follows
is drawn from his professional contribution over
the years.

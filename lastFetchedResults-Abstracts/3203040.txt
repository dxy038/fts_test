A novel cultural algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was proposed in this paper. After analyzing the partner selection problems of virtual enterprise, the CPSO algorithm was presented to solve enterprise alliance problem within reasonable time and cost. There are certain number partners of each sub-task in virtual enterprise environment. The objective is, by selecting the optimal combination of partners, to minimize project´s completion time and project´s total cost. We tested the CPSO algorithm against the PSO method. Simulation results demonstrate that it can be superior to the regular PSO. We also tested the CPSO algorithm with the exhaustion method to show the algorithm´s efficiency.

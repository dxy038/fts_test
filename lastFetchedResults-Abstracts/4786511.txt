We consider queueing systems in which the number of servers is the controlled variable. The cost structure includes service cost, switching cost and holding cost. The objective is to adjust the number of servers dynamically based on the state of the system so as to minimize the average cost over an infinite horizon. In this paper, a novel approach is presented using fuzzy control to solve this classical problem. Two cases, M/M/1 and M/M/m queueing systems with vacations, are studied in detail. Simulation shows that this new approach is efficient and promising, especially in cases where analytical solutions do not exist

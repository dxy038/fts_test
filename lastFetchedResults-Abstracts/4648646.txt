Kick selection is an important issue in robot soccer that has not been investigated deeply enough by the RoboCup research community. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to kick selection, which includes kick objective selection based on priorities. The proposed selection methodology is based on the maximization of the probability of success of the kick (the ball reaches the objective position). Experimental results of the proposed methodology show a high kick success rate, and give evidence of achieving accurate objectives even when using a set of imprecise kicks

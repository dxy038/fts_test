Most optimization methods are based on gradient in which the objective and constrain functions are gained easily, the gradient-based Kriging (GBK) approximation model can be constructed by using system response value and its gradients. The gradients can greatly improve prediction precision of system response. The mixed optimization method is constructed by coupling GBK approximate models to gradient-based optimization methods. Both mathematics example and aircraft aerodynamics shape optimization design example testify the presented methods of this paper have good efficiency.

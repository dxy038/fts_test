The objective of this article is to simulate thermal and mechanical behaviors of the diesel engine cylinder heads. The finite element analysis was performed using the ABAQUS software. Thus, to identify the material behavior, results of low cycle fatigue tests at various temperatures (stress- mechanical strain hysteresis curves at the mid-life cycle) were used and material constants of a two-layer elastic-viscoplastic model were extracted. Fatigue experiments were performed under the strain-controlled tensile-compressive condition on the aluminum-silicon-magnesium alloy (A356.0). Then, by using these material constants at 25, 200 and 250Â°C, thermal and mechanical stresses of the cylinder head were calculated. Validated results illustrated that the elastic-viscoplastic model has a proper accuracy to predict the hysteresis behavior of the aluminum alloy. Finite elements results showed that the location of cracking was in between valves. In addition, the calculated viscous strain could not be eliminated, although it was less than the plastic strain.

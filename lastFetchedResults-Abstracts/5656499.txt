Event description is a way to objectively describe an event and activity in a video stream in a measurable manner such that it can be processed by computer systems. Event Description Language (EDL) is an event description framework which is used to store and describe objective meaningful event and activity occurring in a video stream. This paper discusses the manual application of one such EDL, the InVISS Event Description Language in annotating actions and events in a video stream. The annotated sequence could later be provided to an activity recognition module for automated recognition of activity in a video stream.

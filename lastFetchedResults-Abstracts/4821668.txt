Summary form only given. A new approach to on-line assessment and control of transient oscillations is proposed. It relies on coupling Prony analysis and the SIME transient stability method, with the twofold objective: on one hand, to improve Prony´s, applicability and reliability, and on the other hand to design generation rescheduling patterns able to enhance the damping of poorly damped oscillations and/or stabilize them. Simulations performed on two different systems illustrate the technique and show main features: accuracy, ability to uncover and assess the influence of system machines´ generation on damping and compatibility with real-time requirements. Comparison of the results obtained by the proposed approach with conventional eigenanalysis techniques is provided. Additional method´s interesting by-products are also discussed.

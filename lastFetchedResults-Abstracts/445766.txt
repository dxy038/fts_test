Background: The management of multiply injured trauma patients is a skill requiring broad knowledge, sound judgment, and leadership capabilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based trauma simulator as a teaching tool for senior medical students.

Methods: All year-4 clinical clerks at the University of Toronto were approached to participate in a focused, 2-hour trauma management course. The volunteer rate for the course was 79%. Students were randomized to either computer-based simulator or seminar-based teaching groups. Outcome measures in this study were studentsâ€™ trauma objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores.

Results: Both the trauma simulator and seminar teaching groups performed significantly better than the comparison group (no additional teaching) on the trauma OSCE patient encounter component, but not the written component of the examination. There was no significant difference in the performances of the trauma simulator and seminar teaching groups. Students overwhelmingly felt the trauma simulator was effective for their trauma teaching, and improved their overall confidence in clinical trauma scenarios.

Conclusions: There is a significant benefit associated with a focused, clinically based trauma management course for senior medical students. No additional improvement was noted with the use of a high fidelity computer-based trauma simulator.

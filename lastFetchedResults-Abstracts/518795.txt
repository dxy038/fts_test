Background: Esophageal perforation is a true emergency caused by instrumentation, spontaneous rupture known as Boerhaave syndrome, foreign bodies, and trauma. For patients with an early diagnosis (less than 24 hours), the primary repair is performed and in case of delayed diagnosis the end esophagostomy with thoracic drainage and tube jujunostomy is the treatment of choice. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical technique of lateral esophagostomy with thoracic drainage in treatment of esophageal perforation.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed based on information derived from three patients admitted to the emergency ward of Shahid Rajaei hospital in Qazvin with the diagnosis of esophageal perforation who underwent lateral esophagostomy with thoracic drainage and tube jujunostomy.

Findings: Three patients with esophageal perforation caused by foreign bodies or Boerhaave syndrome underwent surgery with lateral esophagostomy, thoracic drainage, and tube jujunostomy technique. Following surgery, the patients were transferred to ICU and all recovered. Conclusion: This study confirms that patients with esophageal perforation, who undergo lateral esophagostomy, thoracic drainage, and tube jujunostomy, make a good recovery soon after a simple and short duration surgery without invasive surgical procedure.

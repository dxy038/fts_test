This paper considers for the first time the simultaneous multi-objective optimisation of design and operation of batch distillation as well as of batch hybrid distillation/pervaporation processes. The overall problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed integer dynamic optimisation (MO-MIDO) problem. The optimisation strategy comprises of different ranking procedures that allow the determination of the Pareto optimal set. A case study for the separation of a homogeneous tangent-pinch (acetoneâ€“water) mixture is presented for a dual-criteria optimisation case of minimising capital investment while at the same time minimising the energy consumption rate during the batch. It is found that the proposed distance ranking procedure yields the best Pareto optimal set when compared to other non-dominated sorting procedures. Furthermore, the distance ranking procedure was found to be further improved when used with an elitism operator.

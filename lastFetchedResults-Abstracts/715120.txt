ABSTRACT: Heat exchangers are devices that are used to transfer thermal energy between two fluid streams at different temperatures without mixing the two streams. Heat exchangers are key devices used in a wide variety of thermal applications in the chemical process industries. One of the most important designs in heat exchanger is controller design. Two main of controllers are conventional in nature and intelligent in nature. In the intelligent controller human intelligence is embed using soft computing algorithms. Most important note in design of intelligent controller is optimization of control results irrespective of every situation like plant and equipment non linearity, equipment saturation. In this research we survey different conventional and intelligent controllers implemented with a clear objective to control the outlet fluid temperature of shell and tube heat exchanger system.

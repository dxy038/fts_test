Background and Objective: Due to increasing cesarean section rate in recent decades among pregnant women and the effect of maternal desire to select delivery type and the importance of self-efficacy in the choice of delivery methods and to overcome the fear of childbirth, determining the self-efficacy rate in pregnant women during the pregnancy is required. Researches showed that mothers with low self-efficacy think that the delivery is unattainable and experience more fear during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the relationship between self-efficacy and outcome expectations with delivery type's selection among pregnant women.

Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 130 pregnant women referred to health centers in Shahrekord. Sampling method was stratified. For data gathering, the childbirth self-efficacy form and fear of childbirth questionnaires was used. Data analysis was performed using SPSS20.

Results: The findings showed there was inverse relationship between childbirth self-efficacy and fear of childbirth scores (p  < 0.001). Meanwhile, 51.5% of the pregnant women tend to NVD and 5.48% of them chose cesarean section and the mothers who desired to do a vaginal delivery had lower fear than those who choose cesarean section (p  < 0.001) and had higher expected delivery and self-efficacy scores.

Conclusion: The results of this study showed the role of self-efficacy as a factor in the willingness of mothers to natural childbirth and coping with the pain of labor. Therefore, the design of appropriate educational interventions based on self-efficacy is required.

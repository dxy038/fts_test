This paper presents a steady-state analysis for the bidirectional dual active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter operating in extended-phase-shift (EPS) control by proposing a new model that produces equations for RMS and average device currents, and RMS and peak inductor/transformer currents. The DAB converter performance is evaluated based on the mathematical model, focusing on zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operating range, average power transfer, and efficiency by considering a small dead-time on the transformer primary under light loads. Experimental results are presented to verify the model and validate the converter performance at 1kW, 160/65V, 20 kHz in ZVS boundary operation for an aerospace energy storage system.

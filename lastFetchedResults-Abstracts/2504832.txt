Background: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a recognized complication of ovulation induction, occurring in 1-10% of IVF and embryo transfer cycles. While mild OHSS is of no clinical relevance, severe OHSS is a life threatening complication. However, the efficacy of prevalent treatments appeared to be limited. We developed a continuous autotransfusion system with an ultrafiltration instrument for reinfusion the protein of concentrated ascites for the treatment of severe OHSS. Objective: To study the efficacy and safety of using a continuous autotransfusion system for the treatment of severe OHSS. Materials and Methods: 69 patients with severe OHSS who were treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation due to infertility from February 2002 to August 2010 in our reproductive center were divided into two groups. One group treated with continuous autotransfusion system with an ultrafiltration instrument which infused the protein of concentrated ascites, called ultrafiltration group, another group were treated with simple-albumin supplement, called albumin group. Several examinational results and adverse effect were compared between the two groups. Results: The volume of urine output after 72h in ultrafiltration group was more than that in albumin group, the waist circumference and body weight in ultrafiltration group were lower than those in albumin group after 72h. The serum creatinine levels after 72h in ultrafiltration group was still significantly lower than that in albumin group (p < 0.05). The ultrafiltration group rarely showed adverse effect compared with albumin group. Conclusion: Autotransfusion of protein in concentrated ascites for the treatment of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was effective and safe

The advancement of optical sensors and processes controlled by microprocessors and their reliability, in conjunction with the highly competitive environment of North American utilities with deregulation, mean that high reliability digital instrumentation in substation is seen as part of the solution to decrease safely substation expenditures. These advancements help to keep accounting records straight between generators, transmissions providers, and distributors of power. Digital apparatus are an improvement in output accuracy for conventional metering. They are called non conventional instrument transformers (NCIT). These digital apparatus offer many potential advantages and will probably grow in importance in the next decade. The ultimate objective is to increase the accuracy and to increase the overall reliability of the transmission system, to reduce the cost of these devices, and to make the utility more competitive.

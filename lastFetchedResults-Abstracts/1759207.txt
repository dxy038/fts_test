Objective
ng pediatricians to understand child health in the context of community and to develop skills to engage with community organizations remain priorities for residency education in the United States. Our objectives were to: 1) determine use of strategies to influence community child health by graduates of the Community Pediatrics Training Initiative (CPTI); and 2) to identify personal, practice, and residency program factors associated with use of strategies 1 year after residency.
s
is of data from the Dyson Initiative National Evaluation included surveys of physicians (“graduates”) 1 year after residency and surveys of CPTI program leaders. Graduates reported personal and practice characteristics and use of one or more strategies to influence community child health. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to examine associations between personal, practice, and programmatic factors with use of strategies.
s
 511 graduates (68% participation), 44% reported use of one or more strategies. After adjusting for residency site, time spent in general pediatrics, and program emphasis on individual level advocacy, we found that graduates were more likely to report using strategies if they felt responsible for improving community child health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.1, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.5–6.9), had contact with a person who provides guidance about community pediatrics (aOR 1.8, CI 1.2–2.6), or trained in a program that places great emphasis on teaching population level advocacy skills (aOR 2.3, CI 1.3–4.2).
sions
al perspectives and residency education influence community involvement, even early in pediatricians’ careers. Efforts are needed to understand how content and delivery of training influence community engagement over time.

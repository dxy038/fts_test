The mathematical models of each process link consumption in water purification systems were established by means of the mechanism method, and the model for optimal coagulant dosage was given by setting the sum of those units as the objective function. To take into consideration large time delay and disturbance characteristics in the coagulation sedimentation process, a forward-feedback control method was proposed in this paper. Actual results showed that the algorithm introduced was well suited to overcoming disturbances, improving control effectiveness, stabilizing effluent turbidity, and that the optimal coagulant dosage model was satisfied. The result achieved optimal operation of the water purification system, along with operating cost savings.

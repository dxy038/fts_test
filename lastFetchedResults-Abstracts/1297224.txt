The objective of this article is to propose a framework for analysis of the relationships between the four perspectives of the balanced scorecard (BSC) of Kaplan and Norton. To this end, several different models of efficiency have been developed, utilising data envelopment analysis (DEA). Each of the variables has been extracted from a model of the BSC for research and development (R&D) activities. A study has been carried out with 90 companies to illustrate a case of this analysis.

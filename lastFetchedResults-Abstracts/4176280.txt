The author develops a unified bidirectional linear systolic array for performing model reduction of a feedback control system using continued fractions. The array is capable of computing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cauer forms of the fraction and their associated inverses as well as the Routh stability criterion. Timing graphs are presented to indicate the speed-up obtained on five transputers for common problem ranges.

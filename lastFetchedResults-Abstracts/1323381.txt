Objective: To investigate maternal beliefs, practices about causes and determinant factors on drowning and
maternal socioeconomic correlated factors on child mortality from drowning.
Methods: From March 2005 to March 2009, in a register-based cohort study and household survey, individual
records utilizing drowning registry data of northern Iran were enrolled. Mothers (n=276) who responded
to multiple questions in a household survey were included. The patterns, interrelationships and effects of
socioeconomic correlated factors on child mortality were analyzed.
Results: A significant difference in relation to mother's educational level and age and family income distribution
was noticed. Participants in household survey also reported that establishment of a multi-sectorial collaboration,
integration of public health messages into local television, additional rescue stations and lifeguard, hazard
environment fencing, increasing adult supervision, more support on increasing swimming ability among the
children were all effective on reducing of drowning death.
Conclusion: Due to the high rate of drowning in children and lack of attention among olders, a greater emphasis
should be placed on educating mothers to assist a better supervision on their children.

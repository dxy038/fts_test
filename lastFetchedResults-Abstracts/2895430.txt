A wide range of problems in engineering require the simultaneous optimization of several objectives. Given the nature of such problems, it is often the case that the optimization process needs to take place from a device with very limited resources. Compact algorithms are a suitable alternative for being implemented in devices with limited computing resources, but so far, they have been used only to solve single-objective optimization problems. Here, we present a multi-objective compact algorithm based on differential evolution. The proposed algorithm obtains competitive results (and even better in some cases) than state-ofthe- art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms while using less memory resources because of its statistical representation of the population.

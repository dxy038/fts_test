We present an approach for constructing recommender systems that support a user in his navigation through a given Web site. This approach is based on a proxy-like architecture that intercepts the userÂ´s requests and the Web site answers, analyzes them in respect to an explicit model of the Web site and some prototypical uses of it and dynamically generates, in a separate window, a tip and/or an access to additional functionalities related to the Web site objective. We illustrate by examples from the construction of a recommender system for a Web site proposed by the French Ministry of Research and Education.

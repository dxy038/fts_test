Background and objective: Salmonella enteritidis is an important food-borne enteric pathogen. It
is very resistant in the environment and remains an important cause of gastroenteritis in humans
world-wide. It forms biofilms on many food contact surface materials. Development of biofilms on
these surfaces is a potential source of contamination of foods which may lead to spoilage or
transmission of food-borne pathogens. In this project biofilm formation by the Iranian species of
Salmonella enteritidis RITCC 1624 on food and medical contact surfaces was assessed.
Material and methods: Firstl the hydrophobicity of S. enteritidis RITCC 1624 was measured by
the Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbon method (MATH). Then biofi1m formation by the organism
was assessed after a lapse of 2, 4, 8, 16 and 20 hours on stainless steel type 304 no 2B,
polyethelene, and on glass by the drop plate method.
Results: Resultes indicated that this organism, with 73% hydrophobicity, can form biofilm on all
the three surfaces. Biofilm formation on glass and stainless steel surfaces withm 2 hours was more
than on polyethylen (P<0.05).increasing time to 20 h did not result in biofilm formation to a larger
extent (P>0,05). Biofilm formation by S. enteritidis was most extensive on the interface between air
and liquid phases.
Conclusion: Biofilm formation ability of S. enteritidis on the 3 surfaces increases the possibility of
its transmiision, important from a hugicnie and disease spreading viewpoint.

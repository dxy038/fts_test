Objective
To determine the effect of ThermaChoice uterine balloon system on the practice patterns of endometrial ablations performed at a large university-based teaching hospital.
Study design
A retrospective chart review was conducted of 226 patients who underwent endometrial ablation. Data were analyzed to determine any change in the type and rate of ablations performed since the introduction of second-generation technologies. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted risk factors for subsequent admission.
Results
A total of 72.1% of all cases were performed with the ThermaChoice uterine balloon. The postoperative admission rate was significantly higher after a balloon procedure (13.7% versus 3.1%, P = .02), with a 10.6% overall incidence of admission. Adjusting for confounding variables, more women were admitted after a balloon procedure, compared with women undergoing hysteroscopic ablation (odds ratio 5.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 22).
Conclusion
Second-generation endometrial ablation technologies represent frequently utilized and proficient treatment modalities for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Notwithstanding their facilitative design, clinicians should not lose sight of potential limitations of these new procedures.

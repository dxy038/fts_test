This paper studies a synthesis approach to predictive control for networked control systems with data loss and quantization. An augmented Markov jump linear model with polytopic uncertainties is modeled to describe the quantization errors and possible data loss. Based on this model, a predictive control synthesis approach is developed, which involves online optimization of a infinite horizon objective and conditions to deal with system constraints. The proposed MPC algorithm guarantees closed-loop mean-square stability and constraints satisfaction.

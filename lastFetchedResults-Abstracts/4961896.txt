Aiming at improving the efficiency and scientificity of raw materials purchasing for refined copper strip producing, a multi-objective optimization model is established, the model is transformed by introducing some constraints into the objective function. For the raw material purchasing problem of refined copper strip, the encoding system of BFO algorithm is designed, and the tumble direction in conventional BFO algorithm is adapted so as to ensure bacteria swim feasible location each time. Thereby, the detail implement steps of BFO algorithm are designed. By the practical instance application of raw material purchasing problem of refined copper strip, the validity of above optimization model and BFO algorithm for the complex optimization model such as raw material purchasing problem of refined copper strip is validates.

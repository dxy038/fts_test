Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of the TenElectrodes, a new stimulator for inching test, in the diagnosis and localization of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE).
Methods: Sixty-two ulnar nerves in 40 control subjects and 24 ulnar nerves in 23 patients with typical symptoms and signs of UNE were studied. The inching test of ulnar motor nerve using TenElectrodes was done along 8 cm across the elbow in the extended position.
Results: In the inching test of the control group, the mean segmental latency difference was 0.19Â±0.08 ms. Maximal latency difference over a 1 cm segment did not exceed 0.40 ms in any of the controls but exceeded 0.5 ms or more in all clinical UNE patients. In all UNE patients, the lesion sites were identified by the inching test using TenElectrodes: the retroepicondylar groove (54.2%), the humeroulnar arcade (29.2%), and dual compression (16.6%).
Conclusions: TenElectrodes is a useful stimulator for the inching test in the diagnosis of UNE. The precise localization of compression was possible in all patients with UNE and the most common site was the retroepicondylar groove.

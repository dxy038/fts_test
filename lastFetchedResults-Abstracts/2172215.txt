The objective of present study was to determine the effect of T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) on DNA fragmentation in spleen leukocytes and oxidative stress in chickens, and furthermore, to evaluate the potential of dietary nucleotides in reduction of toxin-induced DNA damage. Male broiler chickens were exposed to 10 mg/kg feed of either T-2 toxin or DON with or without addition of dietary nucleotides. After 17 days of treatment DNA damage of spleen leukocytes was measured by Comet assay, lipid peroxidation was studied by malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS) of plasma and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) assays, and the hepatotoxicity was studied by measuring plasma liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST and GGT) levels. T-2 toxin and DON induced DNA fragmentation in chicken spleen leukocytes and supplementation with nucleotides reduced the amount of damage only when added to T-2 toxin. In comparison to control group, values of TAS and AST decreased significantly in the groups fed T-2 toxin with or without nucleotide supplementation. Plasma and liver MDA content in groups fed T-2 toxin and DON did not differ significantly from the control. Dietary nucleotides did not affect MDA formation when added to the diets with mycotoxins. The results obtained suggest that dietary nucleotides have the potency to reduce the extent of DNA damage induced by the action of T-2 toxin in immune cells. This underlines their possible beneficial effect on the immune system in mycotoxin intoxication.

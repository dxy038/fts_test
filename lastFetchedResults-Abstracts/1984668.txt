The objective of this study was to develop a new method to measure the degree of amylose retrogradation in rice starch using size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). This developed method is based on the change in molecule size related to the retention time of amylose. Results showed that SE-HPLC was able to provide accurate data to evaluate the amylose retrogradation by comparing with other well-established methods. The principle of the measurement was further studied in molecular level by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. It indicated that amylose molecules were transformed from disordering configuration to ordering one due to the increase in Van der Waals (Vdw) and hydrogen forces, and decrease in bonded interaction during the short-term storage.

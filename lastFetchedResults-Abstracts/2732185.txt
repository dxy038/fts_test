In this paper, a simplified pulsewidth modulation with switching constraint control scheme is proposed to eliminate the circulating currents for bidirectional paralleled ac/dc converters in grid-tied system. The proposed control scheme can reduce the circulating currents and does not need additional current sensors and communication device among paralleled converters compared with conventional methods. Therefore, the paralleled system cost can be reduced. In addition, the current shaping and sharing between the paralleled converters can be well accomplished so that the overall performance of the paralleled converter system can be raised. Furthermore, the dc, ac, and self-generated circulating currents are clearly analyzed by graphics, and the synchronous circulating currents are first explored. Finally, a prototype system is constructed, and the proposed control scheme is implemented using a Spartan-3E XC3S250E FPGA. Both simulation and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed theory and control scheme.

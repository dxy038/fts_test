In the present article, an iterative scheme for placing the poles of the closed loop system inside an LMI-region for a continuous system with parametric uncertainties and control input saturation constraints, is proposed. The objective is to reduce the size of the LMI-region in order to address the performance of the system. An iterative scheme that starts from the Left Half Plane and proceeds to the intersection of a vertical strip and a conic sector is proposed, where the boundaries of this strip and the angle of the sector are reduced. Simulation studies are offered in order to investigate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

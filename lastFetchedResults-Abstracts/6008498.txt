Depth image based rendering (DIBR) is an important technology for virtual view synthesis in 3DTV. This paper presents a bi-directional depth image based rendering system without preprocessing depth image. An algorithm for three-dimension (3D) warping which declines exposed area is also proposed, and so is an improved merging algorithm for eliminating image ghosting. The proposed DIBR scheme can reduce computation cost compared to previous techniques. Experimental results show that edge ghosting can be completely eliminated in our method. We also demonstrate that both objective and subjective effects of the paper are better than the previous ones.

Objective
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic anemia that is characterized by a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins due to phosphatidylinositol glycanâ€“class A (PIG-A) gene abnormalities in various lineages of peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic precursors. The purpose of our study was to clarify the distribution of PIG-A gene abnormalities among various cell lineages during differentiation and maturation in PNH patients.
Patients and Methods

The expression of CD16b or CD59 in peripheral blood granulocytes or cultured erythroblasts from three Japanese PNH patients was analyzed using flow cytometry. PIG-A gene abnormalities in both cell types, including glycophorin A+ bone marrow erythroblasts, were examined using nucleotide sequence analysis. The expression study of PIG-A genes from each patient was also performed using JY-5 cells.
Results

Flow cytometry revealed that the erythroblasts consisted of negative, intermediate, and positive populations in Cases 1 and 3 and negative and intermediate populations in Case 2. The granulocytes consisted of negative and positive populations in all three cases. DNA sequence analysis indicated that all the PNH cases had two or three types of PIG-A gene abnormalities, and that a predominant clone with an abnormal PIG-A gene was different in granulocytes and erythroblasts from Cases 2 and 3. Expression studies showed that all the mutations from the patients were responsible for the null phenotype.
Conclusion

PIG-A gene abnormalities result in deficiencies of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in PNH erythroblasts and granulocytes. The distribution of predominant PNH clones with PIG-A gene abnormalities is often heterogeneous between the cell types, suggesting that a clonal selection of PIG-A gene abnormalities occurs independently among various cell lineages during differentiation and maturation.

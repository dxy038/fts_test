This paper sketches and evaluates the impact of BiCyQLE, a framework for bidirectional cross-layer management of QoS capabilities in wireless multimedia environments. It is bidirectional in that it improves the utilization and provisioning of scarce wireless network resources toward the lower layers of the communication model. In direction of the higher layers, it performs adaptive source rate control of multimedia transmissions with different levels of granularity. The rate adaptation gracefully adjusts the user-perceived QoS to presently experienced link conditions. Thus, BiCyQLE takes on new and unique design challenges for the QoS traffic control which require leveraging of the interaction among individual QoS approaches across different layers in the communication model. The purpose of BiCyQLE is to increase the visual quality and the quality-cost ratio of multimedia transmissions.

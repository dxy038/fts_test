A technique using a fuzzy search method which is based on fuzzy multi-criteria function has been proposed for GMS(generator maintenance scheduling) in order to consider uncertainties of forced outage rate of generators and multi-objective function. This paper evaluates the results of maintenance scheduling of the seven generation company obtained by the previous proposed method. Especially this paper focus on the GMS of Korea Western Power Co. The probabilistic reliability evaluation method was used to calculate production cost and used as criterion.

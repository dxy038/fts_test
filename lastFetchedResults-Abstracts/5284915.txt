This paper presents a method to design a Power Oscillation Damper (POD) for Double-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS), operating with voltage control loop. Based on eigen values information from Small Signal Stability Analysis (SSSA), an objective function comprising damping ratio and real part of eigen values of electromechanical oscillatory modes is established for the further optimization. Modified Particle Swarm Optimizer (MPSO) is used to tune all the parameters of damping controller. With implementation of tuned POD, case study on modified Two-Area Four-Machine system has illustrated that proposed method effectively enhances dynamic stability of power system.

Pulse width modulation techniques based on novel carrier functions to provide maximum utilization of dc-link voltage in the linear region is proposed in this paper. The objective of the proposed methods is to achieve improved fundamental voltage with reduced total harmonic distortion (THD). The performance of the proposed strategies is tested with a single phase seven level multilevel inverter using MATLAB/Simulink.

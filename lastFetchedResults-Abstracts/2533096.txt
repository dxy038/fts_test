Background and Objective: Upper gastro intestinal cancers are considered to be a global health problem and gastric cancer is the fourth common malignancy worldwide. In cancer patients, low levels of albumin,
Creactive protein and platelets are considered as bad prognostic factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of Albumin (Alb), Creactive protein (CRP), and Platelets in patients admitted to Endoscopy Unit of ValieAsr Hospital in Zanjan in 20112012.

Materials and Methods: 308 patients who had been admitted for upper gasterointestinal endoscopy to Endoscopy Unit of ValieAsr Hospital in Zanjan were entered into this study. Through the upper endoscopy of all abnormal lesions went through biopsy and pathological studies were followed.

Results: Patients were assigned to three groups of normal, benign and malignant lesions and their platelets, albumin levels, BMI and Creactive protein were measured and compared as prognostic factors. The mean BMI, in the malignant group was significantly lower than the other two groups) PV=0.051(. The mean values of serum albumin in the malignant group was significantly lower than the other two groups (PV=0.023). Meanwhile, the average level of CRP and platelets in the malignant group was significantly higher than the other two groups.  

Conclusion: Due to the high prevalence of gastrointestinal malignancies in Iran, measurement of albumin, Creactive protein and platelet levels can be an efficient approach to diagnose or prognosis in these diseases.

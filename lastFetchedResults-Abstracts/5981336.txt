In this paper, the notion of platforms for the design of digital basebands for multi-mode radio, software defined radio (SDR) and cognitive radio (CR) is introduced. These platforms need major evolutions to attain the ultimate objective of personalization of the mobile terminal We propose and discuss the definition of three kinds of platforms, called respectively configurable, dynamically reconfigurable and evolutive, able to meet the requirements induced on physical layer by the radio families mentioned above.

This paper is devoted to the localisation problem of acoustic-magnetic sources moving in straight line at constant speed. Our technique is based on the association of Acoustic Doppler and Magnetostatic Methods. The objective of this study is to achieve localisation with only one sensor performing both frequency and magnetic measurements. The set of possible location is shown to be a circle since no angular information is available. The subsequent developments describe an Extended Kalman Filter with a linear observation equation to perform maximum performance in case of poor initialisation. The filter convergence is actually ensured when tested with simulated signals. A small residual bias on the velocity estimate is however noticed due to the non linearity of the prediction equation.

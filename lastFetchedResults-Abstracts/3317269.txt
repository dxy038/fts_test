A new approach to the cross-layer design of wireless networked control systems under limited computing and energy resources is presented. The idea is to provide a methodology that jointly takes the aspects of Control e.g. control algorithms, Communication e.g. communication protocols, and Computation e.g. energy consumption into consideration. The design objective is the predictability and optimization of the control performance for a given control application. The control performance is a complex function of network parameters e.g. delay, packet loss, network throughput and control system parameters e.g. sampling period, control algorithm. Control performance predictability and optimization can only be achieved by imposing requirements on the wireless network design. A cross-layer design methodology is shown to be very useful for this purpose. To illustrate the methodology, an inverted pendulum system with low-energy wireless network is used for the cross-layer design of control algorithms and communication protocols under computing and energy constraints.

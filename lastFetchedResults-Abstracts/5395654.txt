Previous research produced a multi-objective metaheuristic for partial classification, where rule dominance is determined through the comparison of rules based on just two objectives: rule confidence and coverage. The user is presented with a set of descriptions of the class of interest from which he may select a subset. This paper presents two enhancements to this algorithm, describing how the use of modified dominance relations may increase the diversity of rules presented to the user and how clustering techniques may be used to aid in the presentation of the potentially large sets of rules generated.

A procedure for the calibration and compensation of near-field scanning is described and demonstrated. Ultimately, the objective is to quantify the individual field components associated with electromagnetic interference (EMI) from high speed circuitry and devices. Specific examples of these methods are shown. The effects of compensation are small but noticeable when the uncompensated output signal from near field scanning is already a very good representation of the field being measured. In other cases, the improvement provided by compensation can be significant when the uncompensated output signal bears little resemblance to the underlying field.

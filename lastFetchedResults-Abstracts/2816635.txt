A wavelength-reuse topology with downstream carriers based on 1.25 Gb/s directly modulated self-seeded reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) is investigated in regard to post-filtering effects (PFE) and chromatic dispersion (CD) tolerances. Downstream and bidirectional reaches up to 80 and 60 km, respectively, with maximum 2 dB power penalty (for a BER of 10<sup>-12</sup>) on 1.25 Gb/s are achieved for our combined scheme. The proposed topology enables the enhancement of CD and PFE tolerances as well as the best cost-effective configuration for intensity-remodulation topologies while surpassing the conventional scheme pre-spectrum slicing light (PSSL) injection topology in 40 km.

Linear programming(LP) is the term used for defining a wide range of optimization problems in which the objective function to be minimized or maximized is linear in the unknown variables and the constraints are a combination of linear equalities and inequalities. LP problems occur in many real-life economic situations where profits are to be maximized or costs minimized with constraint limits on resources. While the simplex method introduced in a later reference can be used for hand solution of LP problems, computer use becomes necessary even for a small number of variables. Problems involving diet decisions, transportation, production and manufacturing, product mix, engineering limit analysis in design, airline scheduling, and so on are solved using computers. This technique is called sequential linear programming (SLP). This paper describes LP´s problems and solves a LP´s problems using the dual simplex method neural networks

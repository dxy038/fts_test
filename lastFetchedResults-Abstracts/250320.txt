A new multiscale enrichment method based on the partition of unity (MEPU) method is presented. It
is a synthesis of mathematical homogenization theory and the partition of unity method. Its primary
objective is to extend the range of applicability of mathematical homogenization theory to problems
where scale separation may not be possible. MEPU is perfectly suited for enriching the coarse scale
continuum descriptions (PDEs) with fine scale features and the quasi-continuum formulations with
relevant atomistic data. Numerical results show that it provides a considerable improvement over
classical mathematical homogenization theory and quasi-continuum formulations

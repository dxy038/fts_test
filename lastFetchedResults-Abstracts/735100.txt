Many techniques for solving the linear multi-objective problems in multi-objective decision making are presented. One of the best developed methods is L-p metric technique with different values of norm. In this research L-p metric technique with extreme norm is considered and integrated with the goal programming technique. The result shows that the L-p metric technique can be formulated based on goal programming procedure. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technique, a numerical analysis is presented.

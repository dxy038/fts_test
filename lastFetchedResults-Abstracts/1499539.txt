In this study, the measured wind speed data for year 2007 at 10 m, 30 m and 40 m heights for two provinces of Iran, North and South Khorasan, have been statistically analyzed to determine the potential of wind power generation. This paper presents the wind energy potential at four zones in these provinces, Bojnourd, Esfarayen of North Khorasan province and Nehbandan, and Fadashk of South Khorasan province. The objective is to evaluate the most important characteristic of wind energy in the studied sites. The statistical attitudes permit us to estimate the mean wind speed, the wind speed distribution function, the mean wind power density in the sites at the height of 10 m, 30 m and 40 m. Also, three new types of wind rose diagrams were shown.

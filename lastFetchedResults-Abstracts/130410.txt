Background : Oxidative damage is considered as a major factor involved in senile cataract. Objective : To determine the relation between plasma vitamin C level & nutritional behaviour and age- related cataract.
Methods : This case - control study was implemented on 102 patients with cataract and 102 healthy volunteers attending the ophthalmology clinics of Tabriz university of medical sciences both over 45 years old. The anthropomeiric measurement was carried out and a food frequency questionnaire was used. Personal information was also collected and capillary blood was drown to determine plasma vitamin C with 2, 4- dinifrophenylhydrazine method by the UV detection spectrophoEometry.
Findings: Plasma vitamin C level and BMI in the patients were found to be signcantly lower than the control (0.43± 0.03 mg/dl, 23.181 0.9 kg/m^2 vs. 0.69± 0.03 mg/dl, 26.10± 0.8 kg/m^2 respectively) (PVA 0.05).
Conclusion : The findings indicated that the inadequacy of plasma vitamin C level can lead to cataract & the lack of enough information about nutritional value may paly an important role in this matter.

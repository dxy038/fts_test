The main objective of this study is to extend the potentialities of bioinformatics and the tools of molecular genetics to storage, indexing and digital image processing. The first approach consists of carrying out the direct coding of the digital image, with the RNA four bases A. G. C. U. I. We also study the possibilities of information rearrangement in the image contents, from the RNA concept, by a specific preprocessing. The illustration of the interest of this process is realised with a synthetic image model. Finally the problems and the advantages of the direct use of bioengineering in digital imagery, by biomimetism will be evoked.

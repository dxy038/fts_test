To achieve good performance from the system, performance index plays vital role in the objective function. In this paper various performance indices are used as the objective functions. The choice of the objective function is the most crucial and complicated step in applying any optimizing algorithm for an adaptive control system. They are used to evaluate fitness of items for iterations. The various objective functions like Mean of the Squared Error (MSE), Integral of Time multiplied by Absolute Error (ITAE), Integral of Absolute Magnitude of the Error (IAE), Integral of the Squared Error (ISE) and Integral of Time multiplied by the Squared Error (ITSE) have been analyzed and compared to find the most suitable one. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is applied to tune a PID controller to find out best solution and to study the behavior of different performance indices.

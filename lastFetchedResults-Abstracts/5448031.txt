This paper addresses the problem of evaluating virtual view synthesized images in the multi-view video context. As a matter of fact, view synthesis brings new types of distortion. The question refers to the ability of the traditional used objective metrics to assess synthesized views quality, considering the new types of artifacts. The experiments conducted to determine their reliability consist in assessing seven different view synthesis algorithms. Subjective and objective measurements have been performed. Results show that the most commonly used objective metrics can be far from human judgment depending on the artifact to deal with.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation of uterine fibroids.
Study design
Eighteen women with symptomatic intramural uterine myomas underwent radiofrequency ablation under laparoscopic guidance. Postoperative sonographic evaluations of the fibroids size were scheduled at 1, 3, 6 ,9, and 12 months. The impact of myoma-related symptoms on quality of life (QOL) was assessed using a validated questionnaire.
Results
The median number of myomas treated per patient was 1 (1-3). The median baseline volume of the dominant myoma was 67.2 cm3 (14.8-332.8). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The median reductions in myomas volume were 41.5%, 59%, and 77% at 1, 3, and 6-months, follow-up evaluation, respectively. No further change in fibroid size was observed at 9 months and 1 year. A significant improvement in the symptoms score and QOL score was observed at 3 and 6 months, follow-up.
Conclusion
In this pilot study, laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation successfully reduced fibroid symptoms and fibroid volume in short-term follow-up. Additional studies are needed before its efficacy and safety can be confirmed.

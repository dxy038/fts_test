Some clay soils are highly susceptible to erosion and piping because of dispersion or deflocculation in pore water. These soils, called “dispersive clay soil” in geotechnical engineering, are structurally unstable, easily dispersive and, thus, highly erodible. There are many tests to determine dispersibility both physically and chemically. However, these tests can give different results for the same soil sample. Therefore, more than one test should be used to identify dispersive soils more accurately. In previous research, the discriminant method was used to combine these test results. In this study, a fuzzy logic approximation method was developed to combine the different results of the double hydrometer, pinhole, Na(%)–TDS and ESP–CEC methods into a single value. This new method was applied to the dispersibility test results of 29 samples, and it gave more reliable and objective results for identifying the dispersibility of the clay soil.

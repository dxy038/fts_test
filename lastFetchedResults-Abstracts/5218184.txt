Purchasing is the primary point of contact with most supply-chain partners and thus extremely crucial for the performance of the supply chain specifically and in overall for the firm. Understanding how the various criteria for evaluating suppliers play a role is crucial for a better understanding of the dynamics of the supply chain. This study attempts to find out the relative importance of the various criteria in the decision making process for supplier selection in e-procurement using a multi-response fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The objective of the study was to capture the dynamics of these criteria in the Indian manufacturing industries.

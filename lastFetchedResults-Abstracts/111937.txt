The objective of this work was to compare the mechanical properties of epoxy resins cured by thermal heating and microwave heating. Epoxy-anhydride (100:80) resins were cured in a domestic microwave oven and in a thermal oven. The hardening agents included methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride. Three types of accelerators were employed. Thermal curing was performed at 150 (degree) C for 20 and 14 min for resins containing 1 and 4% accelerator, respectively. Microwave curing was carried out at a low power (207 or 276 W) for 10, 14, and 20 min. All cured resins were investigated with respect to their tensile properties, notched Izod impact resistance, and flexural properties (three-point bending) according to ASTM standards. The tan (delta) and activation energy values were investigated with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and the extent of conversion was determined with differential scanning calorimetry. The differences in the mechanical properties of the thermally cured and microwave-cured samples depended on the resin formulation and properties. Equivalent or better mechanical properties were obtained by microwave curing, in comparison with those obtained by thermal curing. Microwave curing also provided a shorter cure time and an equivalent degree of conversion. The glass-transition temperatures (tan (delta)) of the thermally and microwave-cured resins were comparable, and their activation energies were in the range of 327-521 kJ/mol.

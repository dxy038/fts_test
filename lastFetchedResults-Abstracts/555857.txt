Introduction: Sudden deafness (SD) is one of the major complaints of patients who referred to otolaryngology or neurology clinics. Most of the cases have idiopathic etiology; but some of them have other causes that must be diagnosed by appropriate diagnostic modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this study, we showed the findings of MR Imaging in 32 patients with SD.
Objective: Determination of MRI findings in sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
Materials and Methods: We had performed gadolinium enhanced brain MRI, along Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEP) before treatment in 32 patients with SD referring to ENT Clinics of Kashani hospital in Isfahan and Amiralmomenin hospital in Rasht from August 2005 to September 2008 and were analyzed their results. Results: Abnormal findings in MRI were reported in 6 cases (19.35%). In 3 cases (2 females, 1 male) were found cerebello-pontine angle tumors in the same side of suggesting 8th cranial nerve schwannoma (acoustic neurinoma). In one 45 years old male were found multiple hyperintense lesions in T2 and FLAIR that were hypo to isosignal in Ti and PD in pons, left cerebellar hemisphere and middle cerebellar peduncle that were more compatible with infectious, carcinomatous or lymphomatous processes and in 2 other cases, inflammatory process in mastoid regions, like mastoiditis were seen. Subcortical and periventricular lesions were found in one patient, compatible with migrainous changes and without any relating to SD. In one case MRI was normal but were found abnormal BAEP findings which indicatived an auditory neuropathy.
Conclusions: In the investigation of the etiology of SD in patients, MRI is an invaluable instrument and can identify and clear up structural causes of sudden deafness.

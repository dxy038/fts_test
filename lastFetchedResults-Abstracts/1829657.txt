Differences in the deposition efficiency of individual powders in a mixed composite powder during kinetic spray processes can cause differences between the composition of the starting powder and the final coating. The objective of this study was to use a mixed Wâ€“30wt.%Cu composite feedstock and ascertain an optimal process that minimized composition variation by controlling particle size distribution, particle temperature, and process gas pressure. According to analyses of the coating's microstructure and deposition efficiency, high deposition efficiencies and dense coatings were obtained by increasing the gas pressure and preheating the particles. By controlling the particle size distribution of the soft copper particles, the coating composition remained nearly the same as the initial feedstock composition.

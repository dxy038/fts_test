In this paper, a hybrid method is developed for optimum design of
castellated beams by combining two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely the Colliding Bodies
Optimization (CBO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this hybrid algorithm
(CBO-PSO), positive features of PSO are added to the CBO. Two common types of
laterally supported castellated beams are considered to be the design problems: beams
with hexagonal openings and beams with circular openings. These beams have found
widespread usage in buildings because of great savings in materials and construction costs.
Here, the minimum cost is taken as the design objective function and the new hybrid
method is utilized for obtaining the solution of some benchmark problems. Comparison
of the results of the CBO-PSO with those of some other meta-heuristics demonstrates the
capability of the presented optimization algorithm. For most of the examples, the results
obtained by CBO-PSO have less cost than those of the other considered methods. It is also
concluded that the beams with hexagonal openings

In this paper, a single soft-fault diagnosis approach using the theory of multi-objective programming (MOP) for analog circuit with parameter tolerance is proposed. Based on the sensitivity analysis, node-voltage incremental equations are built. Then, with the equations as constraint conditions, MOP concept is used to diagnose analog circuit under test (CUT) quantitatively. Through evaluating the parameters deviations from the solution of the MOP equation, it enables us to state whether the actual parameters are within tolerance ranges or some elements are faulty. Simulated examples illustrate the proposed approach and show its effectiveness.

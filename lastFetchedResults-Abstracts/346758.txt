Objective: We examined how behavioral context influences novelty processing by varying the degree that a novel event predicted the occurrence of a subsequent target stimulus.
Methods: Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction times (RTs) were recorded in 3 detection experiments (23 subjects). The predictive value of a novel stimulus on the occurrence of a subsequent target was varied as was novel-target pairing intervals (200â€“900 ms). In Experiment 1, novel stimuli always preceded a target, in Experiment 2, 40% of novel stimuli were followed by a target, and in Experiment 3, novel stimuli occurred randomly.
Results: In Experiment 1, RTs following 100% predictive novels were shortened for targets at all spatial locations and novel-target pairing intervals. Novel stimuli predicting a target generated a central negativity peaking at 300 ms and reduced P3a and P3b ERPs. In Experiments 2 and 3, target RTs were prolonged only when novel and target stimuli were presented in the same spatial location at short ISIs (200 ms). The central novel N2 was smaller in amplitude in comparison to Experiment 1, and novelty P3a and target extrastriate N2 and posterior scalp P3b ERPs were enhanced.
Conclusions: The enhanced N2 for100% predictive novel stimuli appears to index an alerting system facilitating behavioral detection. The same novel stimuli with no predictive value distract attention and generate a different ERP pattern characterized by increased novelty P3a and target P3b responses. The results indicate that behavioral context determines how novel stimuli are processed and influence behavior.

The main objective of this article is to study numerically a two-dimensional, steady and laminar viscous incompressible flow in a sinusoidal corrugated inclined enclosure. In this analysis, two vertical sinusoidal corrugated walls are maintained at a constant low temperature whereas a constant heat flux source whose length is varied from 20 to 80% of the total length of the enclosure is discretely embedded at the bottom wall. The Penalty finite element method has been used to solve the governing Navierâ€“Stokes and energy conservation equation of the fluid medium in the enclosure in order to investigate the effects of inclination angles and discrete heat source sizes on heat transfer for different values of Grashof number. Results are presented in the form of streamline and isotherm plots. It is concluded that the average Nusselt number increases as inclination angle increases for different heat source sizes.

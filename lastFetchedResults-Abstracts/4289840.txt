In three dimensional television (3DTV), an interactive free viewpoint selection application has received more attention so far. This paper presents a novel method that synthesizes a free-viewpoint based on multiple textures and depth maps in multi-view camera configuration. This method solves the cracks and holes problem due to sampling rate by performing an inverse warping to retrieve texture images. This step allows a simple and accurate re-sampling of synthetic pixel. To enforce the spatial consistency of color and remove the pixels wrapped incorrectly because of inaccuracy depth maps, we propose some processing steps. The warped depth and warped texture images are used to classify pixels as stable, unstable and disoccluded pixels. The stable pixels are used to create an initial new view by weighted interpolation. To refine the new view, Graph cuts is used to select the best candidates for each unstable pixel. Finally, the remaining disoccluded regions are filled by our inpainting method based on depth information and texture neighboring pixel value. Our experiment on several multi-view data sets is encouraging in both subjective and objective results. Furthermore, our proposal can flexibly use more than two views in multi-view system to create a new view with higher quality.

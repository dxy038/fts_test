The NetComm objective is to develop an electric utility owned and operated communication network using specially designed UHF packet radios capable of two-way communication with a large number of destinations while satisfying the utilityÂ´s concerns regarding system reliability, data integrity and security. A solid-state meter that can be accessed over the communication network has also been developed and is the first device of its type. Prototype equipment is presently undergoing a Beta test at a site approximately fifty miles north of Los Angeles, California. Ultimately, 2500 meters and 350 radios will be installed at this site. The author describes the packet communication system concept, the solid-state meter, and the status of the field test and demonstration program

This work aims to study a new flat slab strengthening technique based on post-tensioning with anchorages by bonding using an epoxy adhesive. The main advantages of this technique over the traditional prestress strengthening systems that use mechanical anchorages are that it does not need external permanent anchorages, meaning that the forces are introduced into the concrete gradually instead of being localized, thereby preserving aesthetics and useable space. The seven tested slab models show that this technique meets its objective as it is able to reduce reinforcement strains at service loads by up to 80% if the strengthening technique is applied in two directions and slab deformations by up to 70%, consequently making crack widths smaller. It can also increase punching load capacity by as much as 51% when compared to non-strengthened slabs. The results are compared with the EC2 (2004) [20], ACI 318-08 (2008) [23] and MC2010 (2010) [21] provisions. The main conclusions are that this strengthening technique is effective regarding ultimate and serviceability states and that it represents an advance in RC slab strengthening techniques.

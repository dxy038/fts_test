Therapeutic games can be considered as a promising rehabilitation tool since they provide personalized rehabilitation sessions in which training intensity and challenges can be adapted to the patient´s ability, motivation and performance. In this paper, we discuss post-stroke therapeutic game design challenges and requirements that open-up a variety of adaptation issues. Our objective is to present a generic difficulty adaptation technique for a family of post-stroke upper-limb rehabilitation games. The proposed technique aims to increase rehabilitation volume by maintaining patients´ motivation and engagement.

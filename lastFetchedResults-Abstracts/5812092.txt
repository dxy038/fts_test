A novel computer simulator to generate mixed Doppler ultrasound signals from the pulsatile blood flow and vessel wall with mild stenosis is presented in this paper. In-phase and quadrature Doppler blood flow signals are generated using cosine-superposed components modulated by a spectrogram estimated from velocity profile. Meanwhile,Doppler signals echoed from bidirectional moving walls are generated with the input waveforms of the wall velocities. Finally, the Doppler signals determined above are summed respectively to yield the combined Doppler signals in terms of given sample volume shape. The experimental results show that the proposed simulator generates mixed Doppler signals with the characteristics similar to those found in practice, and could be an useful experimental data source for evaluating the performance of wall filters.

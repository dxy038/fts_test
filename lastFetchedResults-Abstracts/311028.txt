Objective.  To determine whether body balance is perturbed more in low back pain patients than in healthy subjects, under the concept of posturo-kinetic capacity.

Design. Comparison of posturographic and respiratory parameters between low back pain and healthy subjects.

Background. It has been demonstrated that respiratory movements constitute a perturbation to posture, compensated by movements of the spine and of the hips, and that low back pain is frequently associated with a loss of back mobility.

Method. Ten low back pain patients and ten healthy subjects performed five posturographic tests under three different respiratory rate conditions: quiet breathing (spontaneous), slow breathing (0.1 Hz) and fast breathing (0.5 Hz).

Results. Intergroup comparison showed that the mean displacements of the center of pressure were greater for the low back pain group, especially along the antero-posterior axis, where respiratory perturbation is primarily exerted. Inter-condition comparison showed that in slow and fast breathing relatively to quiet breathing, the mean displacement of the center of pressure along the antero-posterior axis was significantly increased only for the low back pain group.

Conclusion. According to the results, respiration presented a greater disturbing effect on body balance in low back pain subjects.

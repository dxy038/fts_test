A nonlinear discrete-time model that simulates a vibrating string exhibiting tension modulation nonlinearity is developed. The tension modulation phenomenon is caused by string elongation during transversal vibration. Fundamental frequency variation and coupling of harmonic modes are among the perceptually most important effects of this nonlinearity. The proposed model extends the linear bidirectional digital waveguide model of a string. It is also formulated as a computationally more efficient single-delay-loop structure. A method of reducing the computational load of the string elongation approximation is described, and a technique of obtaining the tension modulation parameter from recorded plucked string instrument tones is presented. The performance of the model is demonstrated with analysis/synthesis experiments and with examples of synthetic tones

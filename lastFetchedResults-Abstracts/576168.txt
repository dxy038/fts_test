In the theory of phrasal phonology and on the basis of the leveling rule, Kahnemuyipour (2003) claims that in the stress representation, the words with  symbols in the intonational phrase level, receive secondary stress. The objective of this article is scrutinizing the intonational evidence for secondary stress in Persian. Analyzing the data which had secondary stress and were produced by the authors with Pratt software, revealed that the phonological phrases that take secondary stress are marked by a high boundary tone; except in the cases where the phonological phrase taking secondary stress is the last phonological phrase of an intonational phrase. In this situation, the boundary tone of the last phonological phrase will be subordinate to the boundary tone of the intonational phrase. In other words, if an intonational phrase is marked by a high boundary tone or by a low boundary tone the last phonological phrase taking secondary stress in the intonational phrase, will be marked respectively by a high and a low boundary tone.

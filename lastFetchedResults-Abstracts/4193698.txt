In Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), the battery system would be recharged from the AC grid at home or at work and would thus allow for a reduction in the overall fuel consumption. This paper proposes an advanced power electronics interface (APEI) for PHEV applications, which mainly comprises a Bidirectional Multi-Device Interleaved Converter (BMDIC) and Eight-Switch Inverter (ESI), in order to reduce the cost and the volume of the power electronics interface (PEI) used in PHEVs with high performance at any operating mode. In the proposed power electronics interface, the Eight-Switch Inverter (ESI) is able to function as a bidirectional single-phase AC/DC battery charger/vehicle to grid (V2G) interface and to transfer electrical energy between the DC-link (connected to the battery) and the electric traction system as a three-phase DC/AC inverter. In addition, a novel bidirectional multi-device interleaved converter (BMDIC) is proposed for interfacing the ESI to a low-voltage Li-Ion battery to minimize the input current/output voltage ripples and to improve the efficiency of the DC system. In this paper, the four-quadrant operation of the proposed topology is analyzed and investigated to evaluate the dynamic performance of the proposed configuration. This configuration is simulated and its performance is validated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Moreover, Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the proposed configuration.

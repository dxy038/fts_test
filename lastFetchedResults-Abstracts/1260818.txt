 The objective of the study was to analyze comparatively the jitter and shimmer values of spoken voice among women in menacme and menopausal women using or not hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). Forty-five women were studied, divided into the following groups: Control Group (CG), 15 women aged 20â€“40 years with regular menstrual cycles who did not take hormonal contraceptives; Treated Group (TG), 15 women aged 45â€“60 years with at least 2 years of menopause, under continuous HRT with1 mg estradiol valerate + 90 خ¼g norgestimate per day for at least 6 months; Untreated Group (UG), 15 women aged 45â€“60 years with at least 2 years of menopause who did not use HRT. Mean age was 30.3, 54.5, and 56.5 years for CG, TG, and UG, respectively. All subjects were submitted to acoustic analysis of jitter and shimmer for the sustained vowels /e/ and /i/. Mean jitter values were 0.56%, 0.64%, and 0.56% for the vowel /e/ and 0.88%, 0.79%, and 0.68% for the vowel /i/ for CG, TG, and UG, respectively. Mean shimmer values were 4.17%, 4.38%, and 4.77% for the vowel /e/ and 5.19%, 4.59%, and 5.37% for the vowel /i/ for CG, TG, and UG, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups studied. The results obtained here by the methodology used suggest that there were no significant differences in jitter and shimmer when we assessed the sustained vowels /i/ and /e/ between menopausal women using or not HRT or between young and menopausal women treated or not.

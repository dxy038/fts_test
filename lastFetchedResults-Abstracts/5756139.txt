A complete Si-based dielectric waveguides technology fabricated on InP substrates has been developed. The lowest attenuation measured at 1.5 &#956;m wavelength is 2 dB/cm without any high temperature annealing of the waveguide structure. This result is due to the quality of the material obtained by new deposition techniques, namely RTCVD and UVCVD. These deposition techniques have proved their compatibility with brittle materials such as InP. They are also compatible with waveguide fabrication at the end of a device or circuit process. The objective is now to integrate this technology into simple OEICs

Association rule mining, or in other words, extracting the possiple relationships among the
data in a large data base, is one the most important and time consuming tasks in data mining.
Many algorithms have been proposed for this task in literature which differ in speed and the
quality of solutions. In this Article and attempt is made to propose an evolutionary method
based on multi-objective PSO which has high speed and proper quality in generating the rules.
The proposed algorithm has been applied and tested on a set of transaction data with four
thousand records and the results prove the efficiency of our algorithm.

A new methodology for the determination of an objective metric for still image coding is reported. This methodology is applied to obtain a picture quality scale (PQS) for the coding of achromatic images over the full range of image quality defined by the subjective mean opinion score (MOS). This PQS takes into account the properties of visual perception for both global features and localized disturbances. The PQS closely approximates the MOS, with a correlation coefficient of more than 0.92, as compared to 0.57 obtained using the conventional weighted mean-square error (WMSE). Extensions and applications of the methodology and of the resulting metric are discussed

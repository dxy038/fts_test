Objective
Seizures in neonates are very different from those of older children and adults.
The aim of this study was to determine the etiology, clinical presentation, and
outcome of seizures in hospitalized neonates of Besat Hospital, Hamadan, Iran.
Material & Methods
In this retrospective study, we evaluated all neonates with seizures (aged 0-28
days) admitted to the Besat hospital, Hamadan, over a period of three years
from September 2008 to September 2011. The data were obtained from hospital
records and analyzed using SPSS 12.
Results
Seizures were reported in 102/1112 (9.1%) neonatal admissions. Among
neonates with seizures, 57% were male and 23.5% were preterm. The mean
birth weight was 2936±677 grams and the mean gestational age was 37.60±1.94
weeks. 16.7% of them were LBW and 2.9% VLBW. In terms of seizure type,
subtle seizures were observed in 38.2%, tonic in 29.4%, clonic in 26.4%, and
myoclonic in 5.9% of cases. The main diagnosis in neonates with seizures
included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (34.3%), infections (24.4%),
intracranial hemorrhage (6.9%), hypoglycemia (5.9%), hypocalcemia (2.9%),
inborn error of metabolism (1%), and unknown cause (24.5%). The mortality
rate was 14.7%.
Conclusion
Neonatal seizures indicate a significant underlying disease. HIE was the most
common cause of neonatal seizures in our study. Therefore, efforts should be
made to improve care during childbirth.

Objective: The purpose of this prospective study is to define the advantages and disadvantages of KTP laser tonsillectomy compared with those of the conventional method. Methods: Eighteen adult patients (ten male and eight female, ranging in age from 14 to 44 years) underwent KTP-532 laser tonsillectomy on one side and standard dissection surgery on the other side under general anesthesia. Results: By KTP laser tonsillectomy, there was a reduction in intraoperative blood loss and average time for removing one tonsil. On the second day of tonsillectomy, subjective pain on the KTP laser surgery side was less than that on the conventional surgery side. By the days 5â€“8, however, this effect disappeared and many patients indicated the laser side was more painful. There was no postoperative bleeding after KTP laser tonsillectomy. Laser surgery appeared to lead to slow wound healing during the whole post-operative course with significant difference compared with the conventional method. Disadvantages of postoperative pain and the possibility of secondary infection due to slow wound healing could be prevented by application of antibiotics and an anodyne. Conclusion: Considering safety and reliability during surgery, KTP laser was considered useful for adult tonsillectomy.

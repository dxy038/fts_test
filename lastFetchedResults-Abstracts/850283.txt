Background and Objective: Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity–induced oxidative stress and inflammation are risk factors for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of the pro-inflammatory markers, lipid peroxidation and body fat percentage after 6 weeks of regular water-based exercise and ginger supplementation in obese women with breast cancer.

Materials and Methods: In a semi-experimental study, forty obese women diagnosed with breast cancer with a weight of 76±9 kg and a fat mass of 41.8±4 percent were randomly divided into four groups: placebo, water-based exercise, ginger supplementation and a combined group of water-based exercise and ginger supplementation. Subjects of the ginger supplement and combined group received 4 capsules of ginger powder on a daily basis (each capsule contained 750 mg) for 6 weeks. The water-based exercise training program was collected at a progressive intensity and time: 4 times a week for 6 weeks. 

Results: Implementation of water-based exercise, ginger supplementation and the combined programs caused a significant decrease in concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and fat mass. However, considering Pearson correlation coefficient, it was concluded that just the relationship between fat mass and MDA in the ginger supplementation group was significant (r= 0.63, p= 0.05). 

Conclusion: Although performing water-based exercise and ginger supplementation programs attenuate systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with breast cancer, there was no relationship between stress and changes of pro-inflammatory markers.

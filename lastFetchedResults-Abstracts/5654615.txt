An expert system technique for improving contingency analysis and optimal correction using multiple-objective-function optimal power flow is presented. The system aids in identifying harmful and nonharmful contingencies, thereby reducing the number of cases to be studied. It also aids in eliminating masking and misranking phenomena by systematically selecting appropriate weights applicable to chosen performance indices. The selected violations are included in the multiple objective optimal power flow program using a generalized quadratic-based model. An appropriate objective function for a given contingency is selected by aid of the expert system. The expert system is developed using if-then rules derived from the experience of planning engineers and system operators during system security analysis and corrective activities. The algorithm has been tested for actual power systems, and optimal solutions were reached in relatively few iterations

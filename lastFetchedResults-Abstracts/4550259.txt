The main objective of this proposal is to automate control and communication systems of the train using High Performance Multi-core Embedded Processors (MCEP). This method will overcome the difficulties faced by the existing methods such as detecting cracks at rails, monitoring distance between rails, compartments monitoring, fire and smoke monitoring in compartments, and controlling of motors, transformers, pantograph etc. by manual operations. As Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) and High-energy laser based ultrasonic approach are available in the recent techniques, Train Automation (TA) can be resourcefully done for managing train parameters and monitoring any abnormal conditions in real-time without delays and accidents. All parameters will be processed, controlled, and managed at Electric Locomotive Engine (ELE) with help of advent of wireless technologies. To speed up the operations, all received data will be quickly processed by Multi-core Embedded Processors (MCEP) with help of Multi-core Embedded Software. From the point of view of energy efficiency, train automation is an interesting approach to the challenges of traffic fluidity control, energy efficient driving, regenerative braking, and managing power consumption in electrical devices in trains. To reduce human errors and get the fast response, TA will be a wonderful one with help of MCEP.

Background and Objective: Dyslipidemia is one of the consequences of overweight and obesity. Hence, this research was conducted to compare the effectiveness of behavior-nutritional and Beck cognitive therapy in combination with dietary-physical activity prescriptions on declining overweight and modifying lipid profile among overweight and obese women. 

Materials and Methods: Applying semi-experimental design and using convenient sampling method, 32 volunteer women with BMI?25 eligible to exclude-include criteria were selected and randomly assigned into two experimental groups (each group included 16 subjects). Prior to, after, and 3 months after each intervention, all participants' weight, height, and lipid profile were measured. 

Results: Data analysis with SPSS (16th version) and applying repeated measures analysis of variances method revealed that both interventions could significantly decrease the weight, TG and TC (p < 0.05), and HDL significantly increased (p < 0.05) too. But there were no significant differences between two interventions (p < 0.05) except for LDL level.

Conclusion: It appears that different psychological interventions in combination with dietary-physical activity interventions focused on multidisciplinary (bio-psycho-social) approaches for modifying them with controlling overeating and correcting sabotaging beliefs and behaviors could decrease weight and improve lipid profile.

Objective
To investigate whether very low EEG frequency activity can be recorded from post asphyctic full term neonates using EEG equipment where the high pass filter level was lowered to 0.05 Hz.
Methods
The time constant of the amplifier hardware was set to 3.2 s in order to enable recordings that equal to a high pass filter cut off at 0.05 Hz. Burst episodes were selected from the EEGs of 5 post asphyctic full term neonates. The episodes were analysed visually using different montages and subjected to power spectrum analysis. Powers in two bands were estimated; 0–1 and 1–4 Hz, designated very low- and low-frequency activity, respectively (VLFA, LFA).
Results
In all infants, VLFA coinciding with the burst episodes could be detected. The duration of the VLFA was about the same as that of the burst episode i.e. around 4 s. The activity was most prominent over the posterior regions. In this small material, a large amount of VLFA neonatally seemed to possibly be related to a more favourable prognosis.
Conclusions
VLFA can be recorded from post asphyctic full term neonates using EEG equipment with lowered cut off frequency for the high pass filter.
Significance
VLFA normally disregarded due to filtering, is present in the EEG of sick neonates and may carry important clinical information.

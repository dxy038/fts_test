In this paper, the study of polarimetric optimization techniques for Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) applications is analyzed. This work has been carried out in the framework of deformation map retrieval on landslides. A large number of landslides occur on vegetated areas with a poor density of temporal coherent scatterers, which are characterized by a fast decorrelation at X-band. The objective of the techniques proposed in this paper is to increase the number of temporal coherent scatterers to improve the robustness of the DInSAR algorithms exploiting the polarimetric capabilities of data. The relationship between optimum coherences and its corresponding phase quality in terms of DInSAR application is analyzed using Ground-Based SAR zero-baseline fully-polarimetric data.

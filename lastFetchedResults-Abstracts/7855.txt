Reports on the robust optimization of experimentally derived objective functions. Definition of the objective function in the design or improvement of systems and processes; Identification of the levels of the design variables that optimize the estimated model; Development of a minimax deviation model to find a robust solution that is resistant to the error in the estimated empirical model.

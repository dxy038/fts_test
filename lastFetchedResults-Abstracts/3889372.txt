A quadratic programming method is described for studying simultaneous sum and difference synthesis compromises, and establishing performance bounds, under the restriction of a two-section array feed network. A composite objective function is minimised, subject to a union of separate sets of sidelobe constraints, for the sum and difference modes of operation, to avoid a conflicting constraint set. Examples are given to illustrate the principal features of the method.

The objective of this work was to examine linear thermal expansion of virgin and poled 0.57Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3–0.43PbTiO3 ceramics between 30 °C and 600 °C by contact dilatometry. The thermal expansion dL/Lo of the virgin ceramic increases with increasing temperature until approximately 260 °C. The physical and technical thermal expansion coefficients were determined. At 260 °C the physical thermal coefficient is 2.08 × 10−6 K−1. Between 260.0 °C and 280.0 °C an anomaly in the thermal expansion vs. temperature and an endothermic peak in the differential scanning calorimetry curves correspond to the phase transition region from tetragonal to cubic phase. At temperatures from 280 °C to 600 °C the thermal expansion dL/Lo increases again.

 derivative of the dL/Lo heating curves of the poled ceramics, additionally to the anomaly at 270 °C, also the anomaly at 160 °C is observed, which is associated with the depolarization of the material during heating.

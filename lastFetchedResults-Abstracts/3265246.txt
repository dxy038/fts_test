This paper studies the feasibility of a VoIP phone service with binaural 3D audio. For this purpose, the paper evaluates it with the objective and subjective evaluation that are for the legacy IP phone services by experiment. Moreover, it assesses the sound source localization, which is inherent in evaluation of 3D audio, for the service. By experiment, the authors show that ITU-T G.711 is better than Speex for the encoding of the service; consequently, they indicate the service is feasible over the Internet.

More and more each day users (universities, hospitals, residential, etc) require not only high-bandwidth data transport networks, but also dynamic control of the network infrastructure through a user-friendly interface. The objective of this paper is to present the ADRENALINE testbed, a hybrid platform that combines both real and emulated optical nodes and DWDM links based on a distributed GMPLS-based control plane (RSVP-TE signaling for lightpath provisioning and OSPF-TE routing for topology and optical resources dissemination) and a distributed management plane combining the industry standard SNMP with user-friendly XML based tools to allow users the dynamic provisioning of lightpaths.

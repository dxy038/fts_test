Demonstrates the application of a simplified version of the GENOCOP (GEnetic algorithm for Numerical Optimisation for COnstrained Problems) system to calibrate gravity and logit models of road traffic simultaneously for the road network in the Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley regions in Western Australia, as well as other regions in Australia. From the census population data by locality and a set of data on traffic flows by link, it is possible to estimate the entire set of origin-destination travel volumes and the full set of link loadings. Calculation of the objective function involves a complex process in which the parameters for an individual in a genetic algorithm are applied to two sequential models of road traffic. This application of a genetic algorithm indicates that it is possible to calibrate the two traffic models simultaneously

Introduction & Objective: Adiponectin and leptin are peptide hormones regulating the energy balance. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the possible mechanisms of the effect of omega-3 and aerobic exercise on the balance of these two hormones. Materials & Methods: 60 healthy young women with the average age of 23.4±1.8 and the average weight of 60.45±5.85 were randomly selected and divided into training, omega 3-training, omega-3 and control groups. A basketball training program was performed including specialized training 3 times a week for 90 minutes. During the 12 weeks of training, omega-3+exercise and omega -3 groups were fed a number of oral capsules of omega-3 every night. Blood samples were taken from the brachial vein. To analyze the data and determine the relationship, one way ANOVA and Tukey test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used. Results: Significant differences in serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin secretion in exercise, omega-3 and exercise+omega-3 groups were observed. However, there was a significant correlation between changes in serum levels of adiponectin, and leptin and insulin secretion was not observed in any of the groups. Conclusion: It seems that omega-3 fatty acid intake with exercise enhances fat metabolism and is helpful to regulate the secretion of adiponectin and leptin hormone.(Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2015; 22 (2): 129-136)

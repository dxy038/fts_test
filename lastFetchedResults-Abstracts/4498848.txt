The integration of optical and radar sensors in a common area is an important task in data fusion as well as other applications. The objective of this study is to perform the feature-based registration of ALOS PALSAR and AVNIR-2 images. The proposed method iteratively minimizes the discrepancy between the feature edges in PALSAR and AVNIR-2 images. A coarse-to-fine strategy is also adopted by applying an image pyramid. The accuracy of feature based matching has increased from low to high resolution. The test images are synchronous PALSAR and AVNIR-2 images in Japan. The experimental results indicate that one pixel accuracy can be achieved using feature-based matching.

Diagnosis decision-making and evaluation analysis is two closely-related contents in the process of intelligent fault diagnosis, correct decision-making could be made only based on objective and fair evaluation. This paper gave the evaluation indicator architecture for intelligent fault diagnosis decision-making; combining the special superiority of grey correlative analysis in the way of quantify analysis and evaluation for nonlinear, dispersion, and dynamic date, associated the grey correlative analysis with hierarchical analysis method, brought forward the evaluation method based on multi-hierarchy grey correlative analysis and applied it into intelligent fault diagnosis, researched deeply its principle, algorithm and evaluation execution process, and finally gave analysis sample. By integrating estimation into the decision-making process of intelligent diagnosis, provides the strong support in the way of analysis method for the correct decision-making of intelligent fault diagnosis.

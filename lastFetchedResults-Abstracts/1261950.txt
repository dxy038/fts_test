Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), which include raffinose and stachyose, are thought to be an important source of energy during seed germination. In contrast to their potential for promoting germination, RFOs represent anti-nutritional units for monogastric animals when consumed as a component of feed. The exact role for RFOs during soybean seed development and germination has not been experimentally determined; but it has been hypothesized that RFOs are required for successful germination. Previously, inhibition of RFO breakdown during imbibition and germination was shown to significantly delay germination in pea seeds. The objective of this study was to compare the germination potential for soybean seeds with either wild-type (WT) or low RFO levels and to examine the role of RFO breakdown in germination of soybean seeds. There was no significant difference in germination between normal and low RFO soybean seeds when imbibed/germinated in water. Similar to the situation in pea, soybean seeds of wild-type carbohydrate composition experienced a delay in germination when treated with a chemical inhibitor of Î±-galactosidase activity (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin or DGJ) during imbibition. However, low RFO soybean seed germination was not significantly delayed or reduced when treated with DGJ. In contrast to the situation in pea, the inhibitor-induced germination delay in wild-type soybean seeds was not partially overcome by the addition of galactose or sucrose. We conclude that RFOs are not an essential source of energy during soybean seed germination.

This paper presents the characterization, and modelling of the volumetric balance equation contributing to the elaboration of Continuous Stirred Tank Heater (CSTH) plant. The conventional Proportional Integral (PI) controller technique is used to control the physical variables such as cold water valve position, and the liquid level in the tank of the CSTH plant. The controller is designed and implemented using Simulink in Matlab to achieve the operational objective of the CSTH process. The response of CSTH with and without PI controller is compared.

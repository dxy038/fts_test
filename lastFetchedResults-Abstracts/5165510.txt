An optimal extremum seeking approach is developed in this paper to identify frequency and voltage modulation parameters for a neuromuscular electrical stimulation control objective. The control objective is to externally apply optimally varied voltage or frequency modulation parameters to a human quadriceps muscle to generate a desired knee joint angle. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the limb positioning performance of a real-time extremum seeking routine (i.e., BrentÂ´s Method).

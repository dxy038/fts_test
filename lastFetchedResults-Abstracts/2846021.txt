According to pulse-compression radar theory, the sidelobe reduction using nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) signal processing represents a major and present research direction. Although in literature a lot of techniques to design efficient NLFM waveforms are indicated, one of the most important methods as application area is focused on stationary phase technique (SPT) use. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to make an extended comparative study as sidelobe suppression among some very promising NLFM laws achieved by applying of a proper SPT synthesis algorithm. In addition, some aspects related to the suitable choice of the parameters involved in the synthesis process of NLFM signals are also indicated.

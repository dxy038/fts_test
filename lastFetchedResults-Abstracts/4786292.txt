A mathematic model for multi-objective bus route optimization based on the date of a bus corporation and limited conditions in the route network is developed on account of route optimization of bus dispatching. MAX-MIN Ant System is used to improve the global searching ability of ant colony algorithm and the improved algorithm is applied to solve the problem and its global optimization is obtained. Through comparison of the example results, the algorithm is proved to be feasible and practical for route optimization of bus dispatching.

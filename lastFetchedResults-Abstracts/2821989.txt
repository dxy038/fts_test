To help integrate the utility-scale PV system into the power grid, the battery energy storage has been introduced as one promising scheme. With the rapid development of battery technology, the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO<sub>4</sub>) battery has attracted attention in the renewable integration applications due to its high power and energy density. The main objective of this work is to analyze the performance of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery when it is applied to help the integration of utility-scale PV plant system. Three factors are considered as the performance criteria of the battery, including LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery lifetime with cost, the dispatchable-generation duration in one year, and the annual generation of the PV and battery system. Specifically, a developed LiFePO<sub>4</sub> physical battery model is incorporated into a utility network model with PV plant systems. The analysis results can improve the understanding of the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery performance in the application with utility-scale PV systems and provide a design reference for PV plant owners and battery manufacturers.

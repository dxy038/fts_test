A central training objective of virtual reality based surgical simulation is the removal of pathologic tissue. This necessitates stable, real-time updates of the underlying mesh representation. Within the framework of a hysteroscopy simulator, we have developed a hybrid cutting approach for tetrahedral meshes. It combines the topological update by subdivision with adjustments of the existing topology. Moreover, the mechanical and the visual model are decoupled, thus allowing different resolutions for the underlying mesh representations. With our method, we can closely approximate an arbitrary, user-defined cut surface while avoiding the creation of small or badly shaped elements, thus strongly reducing stability problems in the subsequent deformation computation. The presented approach has been integrated into a virtual reality training system for hysteroscopic interventions. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by examples of intra-uterine tumor ablations.

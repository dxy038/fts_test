In this paper we consider the single-machine scheduling problems with the effects of learning and deterioration.
By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that job processing times are defined by
functions of their starting times and positions in the sequence. It is shown that even with the introduction
of learning effect and deteriorating jobs to job processing times, single machine makespan and sum
of completion times (square) minimization problems remain polynomially solvable, respectively. But for
the following objective functions: the weighted sum of completion times and the maximum lateness, this
paper proves that the WSPT rule and the EDD rule can construct the optimal sequence under some special
cases, respectively.

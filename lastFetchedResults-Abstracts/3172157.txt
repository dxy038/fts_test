In this paper, a model predictive controller is proposed for anti-jerk during the tip-in/out process of the vehicles. The contradictive control objectives of smooth acceleration/deceleration and satisfying the driverÂ´s torque request are included in the objective function, which aims to improve driving comfort and guarantee fast dynamic response. Due to the physical characteristics, the maximum frequency response amplitude of engine as actuator is considered explicitly in the problem formulation. The designed constrained model predictive controller is tested in the nominal conditions and the changed conditions. The simulations illustrate the efficiency of the proposed controller. At the same time, the closed-loop system has ability to reject uncertainties, such as road grade.

This paper presents a formulation of the optimal power flow problem to include the minimum emission objective. A computational solution using the basic Newton's approach is suggested. Fuel cost and emissions such as NOx objectives are included in the formulation. Emissions also may be added as constraints while minimizing cost. A decoupled Newton's approach, as well as a hybrid technique are also investigated in this presentation. It is shown that faster convergence is achieved using these latter two techniques.

Objective: Observation the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress in kidneys of diabetic rats. Methods: Fifty Sprague Dawley(SD) rats (male) were randomly divided into four groups: the normal rats, the diabetic rats treated with resveratrol(10mg/kg/d), the diabetic rats treated with resveratrol(20mg/kg/d) and the diabetic rats treated with resveratrol(40mg/kg/d). After 12 weeks, the levels of blood glucose, serum creatinine, 24h urinary protein, the contents of malondialdehyde(MDA), glutathione(GSH) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the renal tissue were measured. Results: Compared with the diabetic model group, the levels of blood glucose, serum creatinine, 24h urinary protein and MDA in the renal tissue were decreased, the activity of T-SOD and GSH in the renal tissue was increased, the renal pathologic changes was improved in resveratrol treated group. Conclusions: Resveratrol can increase the renal function and antioxidant capacity, it has protective effect on kidney of diabetic rats.

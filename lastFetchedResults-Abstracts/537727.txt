Energy consumption in Iran is 3.5 times of the
world average and electrical energy consumption in Iran
is 5 times of the world average. So it is necessary to have
the standard of energy consumption in particular of home
energy and consuming tools. 42% of the total energy
consumption in the world is related to the home sector.
Fans with 9% of home consuming energy, after the
refrigerators and air conditioning systems are the third
energy consumers in this sector. Researchers conducted
in other countries show that there has been a considerable
reduction of energy consumption of fans when standard
methods of fans tests have been applied. For this purpose,
the standard and criteria of energy consumption in fans
have been developed and communicated in accordance
with the legal duties. The objective of developing these
standards is to determine the method of energy
consumption measuring and energy label of home
centrifugal fans. This standard is applied on centrifugal
fans from air giving out of 170 to 3500 cubic meter per
hour. The index of energy consumption in various
countries of the world has been defined based on
CFM/W, M3/min/Watt or M3/S/Watt.

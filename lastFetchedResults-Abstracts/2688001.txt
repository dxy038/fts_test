The magnetron injection gun (MIG) is an important component in the gyro-traveling wave tube (gyro-TWT). The electron velocity spread induced to the mismatch of the electric and magnetic fields influences the performance of gyro-TWT. To improve electron beam quality, we designed a modulating anode with curved geometry. And the multi-objective genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the curved geometry. An electron beam with a velocity ratio of 1.05 and low transverse velocity spread of 0.31% in a MIG for a Q-band gyro-TWT is obtained. Compared with the previous design with a transverse velocity spread of 1.17%, the electron beam performance got improved. And the thermal analysis and parametric sensitivity were done. The curved MIG can stably provide an electron beam with a transverse spread lower than 0.8%.

This paper analyses the availability of networks with perfectly reliable nodes and unreliable links (unidirectional and/or bidirectional). The links are subject to instantaneous scheduled maintenance (sc.m.). The number and order of links which are consecutively sc.m.Â´ed are adjustable. The presentation uses the symbolic network reliability-function and matrix notation to facilitate digital computer implementation. A computer algorithm is given; a simple example is used to demonstrate the approach.

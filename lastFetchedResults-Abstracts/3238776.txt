Loss of visual acuity on account of retina-related vision impairment can be partly prevented through periodic screening with fundus color imaging. Largescale screening is currently challenged by inability to exhaustively detect fine blood vessels crucial to disease diagnosis. In this work we present a framework for reliable blood vessel detection in fundus color imaging through inductive transfer learning of photon-tissue interaction statistical physics. The source task estimates photon-tissue interaction as a spatially localized Poisson process of photons sensed by the RGB sensor. The target task identifies vascular and non-vascular tissues using knowledge transferred from source task. The source and target domains are retinal images obtained using a color fundus camera with white-light illumination. In experimental evaluation with the DRIVE database, we achieve the objective of vessel detection with max. avg. accuracy of 0.9766 and kappa of 0.8213.

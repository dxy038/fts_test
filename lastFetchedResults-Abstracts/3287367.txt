The main objective of this paper is to present an alternative procedure to design resonant controllers for Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS). With this aim, a set of equations to determine controller gains is proposed based on the desired output response and the parameters of a class of UPS systems. First, the desired closed-loop poles are determined considering the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) framework. Based on the characteristic polynomial representing the desired closed-loop performance and the plant parameters, algebraic conditions are derived to determine the controller gains for a range of UPS parameters and loads. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

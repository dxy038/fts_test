An iterative method for the design of two-band quadrature mirror-image filter (QMF) banks proposed by Chen and Lee is examined and improved by deriving simple, explicit, and precise expressions for the evaluation of two integrals involved in the computation of the objective function. The method is then extended to the design of QMF banks with low reconstruction delays and to the design of filter banks with equiripple complex reconstruction error. The paper concludes with design examples which illustrate the efficiency and performance of the algorithms developed and the quality of the filter banks that can be designed

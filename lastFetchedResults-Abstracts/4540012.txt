The variable delays imposed on different cells of a connection by various functions of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network may alter the traffic characteristics of its source. ATM user/network parameter control (UPC/NPC) functions should consider the introduced cell delay variation (CDV) in order not to discard cells unjustifiably. The paper quantifies the distortions introduced by single multiplexing stages (FIFO, bus topologies) and dimensions the threshold values of a leaky bucket (LB) control mechanism so that it can tolerate such traffic distortions. Three LB threshold dimensions schemes are also proposed which consider ATM traffic contract renegotiations and their effect on the network performance optimisation objective

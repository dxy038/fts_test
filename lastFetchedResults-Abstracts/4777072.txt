In order to provide an alternation to the currently used decision making method, this paper starts with a new method named multi-objective collaborative group decision making of public project. In the beginning of this paper, entropy and REM of entropy theory, as well as the concept of weight of decision-makers are introduced. Following by this, group decision REM model and algorithm for public project are constructed. In the last section, a case is used to demonstrate effectiveness and practicality of the method.

This work aims at establishing a new management paradigm for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) collection and treatment networks, based on Lean Thinking methodological approaches. The objective is to maximize the WEEE recovery rate to effectively support the production of new products, creating on one side the conceptual basis of the Closed Loop Supply Chain, and on the other side minimizing the environmental impact of production processes in exploiting natural resources. The achievement of such results is supported by the application of a System Dynamics simulation approach.

Following problems have been found in traditional learning material management model based on courseware: common redundancy, the overlapped and desultory construction of the learning materials, and hardly adaptive to the diversity of the learning objectives and teaching methodologies. In the paper, a material-framework-objective model was proposed to improve the efficiency and quality of learning material management in the distance education by separating and recombining the basic materials, courseware, knowledge-points and learning goals. The model can also achieve the unification of the reuse, mobility and pertinence of the learning materials. A prototyping based on this model has been developed and taken into practice in Dongbei University of Financial and Economics.

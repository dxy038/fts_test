Objective: Signaling pathways such as extracellular regulated kinase/mitogen activated
protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) have increased activity in leukemia. Ribosomal 6 kinase
(RSK4) is a factor downstream of the MAPK/ERK pathway and an important tumor suppressor
which inhibits ERK trafficking. Decrease in RSK4 expression has been reported
in some malignancies, which leads to an increase in growth and proliferation and eventually
poor prognosis. In this study we measured RSK4 expression rate in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2013-2014 at
Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, on 40 AML patients and 10 non-AML patients as the
control group. The expression rate was measured by real-time polymerase change reaction
(PCR) and employing the ??CT method. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney
and Spearman tests using SPSS (version 11.5).
Results: Expression rate of RSK4 was significantly decreased in the AML group in comparison
with the non-AML group (P < 0.001). There was also a significant decrease in
RSK4 expression in AML with t(15;17) in comparison to other translocations (P=0.004).
Conclusion: We detected a down-regulation of RSK4 in AML patients. This may lead to
an increase in the activity of the ERK/MPAK pathway and exacerbate leukemogenesis or
the prognosis of the patients.

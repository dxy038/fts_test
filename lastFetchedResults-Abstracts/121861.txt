The objective of this paper is to develop a method for selecting the most suitable location for establishing a wood industry unit. Decision making is examined within the framework of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR), called the merits of the decision. A hierarchy is developed to prioritize the BOCR in itself, while Analytic Hierarchy Process ratings approach is applied to evaluate the hierarchy. It is recognized that benefits, opportunities, costs and risks are often not emphasized proportionately when making a decision. In fact, it is vital to design a decision supporting system to evaluate them in terms of the values attached to by decision-making person or organization. A control hierarchy is then created and prioritized using the AHP to evaluate the "control criteria" of the system. There are a total of 18 control criteria in the system each controlling a decision network evaluated while using the Analytic Network Process (ANP). This method was applied for a real case in Iran. There were six potential locations, or in fact alternatives found for the decision network. The final synthesis of the system indicates Baneh in the province of Kurdistan as the best choice available.

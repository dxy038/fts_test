Hair cells act as neural interfaces of sound signals and, therefore, circuit representations are important to signal processing systems based upon characteristics of the ear. Here a nonlinear bidirectional model of a hair-cell is presented. Also developed are a canonical semi-state description for its Potassium and Sodium channels, and circuits suitable for a transistorized hardware implementation

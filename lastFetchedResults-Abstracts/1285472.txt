America's hostile relations with Iran, after the Islamic revolution, inclined many Americans to write books and articles about Iran. Robert Baer, the author of the book The Devil We Know (Dealing with the New Iranian Super Power), is one of these people. Nevertheless, we should ask whether they have been able to show a different picture of the contemporary (new) Iran or not? (Question)
The author of this book, although tried to sketch a new picture of Iran as a regional super power in order to encourage American politicians to negotiate with Iran, has not been able to convince Americans to do so, since he regarded  Iran's policies as being aggressive and expansionist. (Hypothesis)
 The authors of the present article have tried to analyze Robert Baer's work as well as introducing it to show that writings like this try to draw a devilish picture of Iran in a delicate and implicit manner (Objective). The results of the present article include the integration of American's picture of Iran with Zionist views, American writers and officials lack of understanding about the nature of the Islamic revolution, America's planning for suppression of Shiite Crescent and its heartland, i.e. Iran (Findings).

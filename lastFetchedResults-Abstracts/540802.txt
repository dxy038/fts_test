The objective of this study was to evalu¬ate the efficacy of a Nutrient Synergy (NS; Blend of nine nutrients) in maintaining the performance and alleviating the pathologic effects in broilers challenged with a high and a low dose-E. coli, following a primary chal¬lenge with H9N2-avian influenza virus. Six groups of broilers were included (19 birds/ group). Each bird in groups 1-4 received at an age of 20 d. a primary intratracheal challenge of 2 HA units of H9N2 virus. At the age of 23 days, birds of groups 1 and 3 received a high dose-E. coli challenge in the right thoracic air sac (1.5x10 9 cfu/0.5ml/ bird), while birds of groups 2 and 4 received a low dose-E. coli challenge in the same route (1.5 x 106 cfu/ml). The initiation of a NS-daily administration, intraesophageally, was according to the manufacturer instruc¬tions (Epican Forte®) (976mg/Kg of body weight). The treatment was restricted to birds in groups 3, 4, and 5, effective the age of 17 days and until 28th day of age. Birds of group 6 were unchallenged and untreated.

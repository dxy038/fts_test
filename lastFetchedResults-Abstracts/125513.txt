Background&Objective: Ramsar a coastal city in the north part of Iran has among the highest levels of natural radiation known to exist in an inhabited area. This is mainly due to radium-226 and its progenies coming to the earth surface through hot springs. The health effect of low doses of ionizing radiation is not clear and is still under the matter of discussion. The study of the effects of high natural background Radiation on human health was the main goal of this investigation. The present article is showing the results of the first phase of our work.
Materials&Methods: This cross-sectional. analytical study was conducted on 101 families (402 residents) of high background radiation areas and 98 families (374 residents) from adjacent normal radiation areas. After description of the study and its objectives to the participants, they were asked to participate in interviews and complete questionnaires containing some socio-economic and health items. Some items of questionnaires were determined using the information recorded in local health centers in those areas.
Results: Overall data showed no significant differences between the frequencies of any mental and physical disabilities as well as death, abortion and mental depression in residents of normal and high background radiation areas. However the frequency of some special diseases such as cardiac diseases and malignancies among residents of high background radiation area in comparison with ordinary radiation level areas was lower (P<0.05).
Conclusion: These preliminary results, showed lack of ill effects and even some positive effects Among population of high background radiation areas. Although we used census method for getting data, we believe that other radio-epidemiologic prospective studies can improve our knowledge about radiobiology of low doses of ionizing radiation.

This paper presents a new fault detection scheme for voltage fed inverter to improve the reliability of power electronic system, which is of paramount importance in industrial, commercial, aerospace, rolling mill and military applications. The proposed method is achieved by using voltage of lower switches in each phase under the inverter fault condition. The reconfiguration method is achieved by the four-switch topology connecting a faulty leg to the middle point of DC-link using bidirectional switches. The proposed method has a simple algorithm and fast detecting time to detect faults. Also, this method is not influenced hardly for noise. As a result, continuous free operation of the system after faults is achieved by reconfiguration of system topology. The superior performance of the proposed fault detection and tolerance method are proved by simulation

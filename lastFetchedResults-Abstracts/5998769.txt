In this paper, we propose a new statistical objective perceptual video quality measure PSNR<sub>r,f</sub>-MOSr. PSNR<sub>r,f</sub> is defined as the PSNR achieved by f% of the frames in each one of the r% of the transmissions over a network. This quantity has the potential to capture the performance loss due to damaged frames in a particular video sequence (f%), as well asto indicate the probablity of a user experiencing a specified quality over the channel (r%). The percentage of transmissions also has the interpretation as what percentage out of many video users who access the same channel, would experience a given video quality. A subjective experiment is conducted to establish a linear equation connecting PSNR<sub>r,f=90%</sub> and MOS<sub>r</sub>, the mean opinion score (MOS) achieved by r% of the transmissions. It is shown from this subjective experiment that PSNR<sub>f=90%</sub> correlates much better with the delivered perceptual video quality than the average PSNR across all frames of a video, and is a good representation of perceptual quality of a video transmitted over networks with possible transmission errors.

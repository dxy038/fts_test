The technological aspects of a novel non-magneto equipotential capacitive (NEC) sensor and a sensitive earth field giant magneto resistive (GMR) device are investigated. The objective of this effort is to measure the air capacitive currents (ACC) associated with the high voltage (HV) power equipment, such as transmission lines or cables. Here, selected experimental setups and schemes are proposed to support and indicate the measurement concepts of ACC. The obtained ACC measurements are utilized for the estimation and evaluation of other essential parameters for power systems that include: line sag/clearance, conductor surface temperature, conductor voltage, and more. Simulation results from "Maxwell Q-3D" software predict the proposed sensor impedance\Â´s parameters (i.e. resistance, capacitance, and inductance). Key charts are produced to show the functionality and feasibility of the proposed method

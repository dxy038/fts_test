The soil geochemical baseline is an important index in environmental assessment. Detailed baseline studies are necessary in large areas with complex geological settings, landforms and soil types. The Jianghan plain, a major industrial and agricultural region located in central China, has a soil geochemical baseline that has yet to be fully defined. The objective of this paper is to study the baseline of Cd, Pb and Zn in the topsoil of the Jianghan plain in a subarea using principal component regression (PCR). A total of 9030 samples were collected from the surface layer, and 2 soil profiles and 2 sedimentary columns were sampled near the Yangtze and Han rivers. Fifty-two elements and two parameters were analyzed. Data processing and the creation of spatial distribution maps of the elements were performed using MapGIS, R and SPSS software. The results show that the distributions of Cd, Pb and Zn are mainly controlled by parent material, drainage system and soil type. The study area is divided into 3 subareas, with factors reflecting the physico-chemical characteristics of the soil using factor analysis (FA). The geochemical baseline model is established in every subarea to predict the Cd, Pb and Zn values using principal component regression analysis (PCR); the exceptional values (as a result of anthropogenic input or mineralization) are distinguished by residuals (Î³); and the natural background values and anthropogenic contributions are clearly distinguished. Therefore, the PCR method in these subareas is objective and reasonable, and the conclusion provides effective evidence of exceptional high values for further environmental assessment.

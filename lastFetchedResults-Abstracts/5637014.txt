The objective of Web services technology is to facilitate the creation of reusable and network accessible business applications over the Web for automatic discovery and compositions. Automatic discovery of Web Services can be achieved by describing Web service functionality in a richer (in terms of context and semantics) and machine readable form. With a rapid growth in Web services, finding suitable services for the requesters has become a challenging task. In this paper, the authors present an effective Web service discovery mechanism which exploits the strengths of functional semantics, keyword matching, structural matching, syntactic matching and semantic matching in order to explore the relevant Web services which satisfy the requester´s functional needs. The proposed discovery mechanism also makes use of the Web service crawler which explores the Web services accessible over the Web and the WordNet lexical database to obtain synonyms of the functional semantic enriched requester´s query. The proposed discovery mechanism is implemented and the experimentation proves the effectiveness in terms of Recall and Precision.

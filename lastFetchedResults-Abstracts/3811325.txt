This paper describes an improved infrared scanning microscope. It was designed for use as an analytical tool where temperature or small thermal gradients might be an indication of device failure or potential failure. This method would be particularly applicable, for instance, to dynamic testing of integrated circuits where conventional techniques are generally unsuitable. Initial tests indicate that the instrument is capable of 0.5&#194;&#176;C temperature resolution and 1.5 mil spatial resolution. A prime design objective was to achieve a direct temperature readout.

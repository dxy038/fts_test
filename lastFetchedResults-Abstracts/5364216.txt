The objective of this qualitative study was to explore and understand the problems of software testing in practice and find improvement proposals for these issues. The study focused on organizational units that develop and test technical software for automation or telecommunication domains, for which a survey of testing practices was conducted and 26 organizations were interviewed. From this sample, five organizations were further selected for an in-depth grounded theory case study. The analysis yielded hypotheses indicating that a software project design should promote testability as architectural attribute and apply specialized personnel to enhance testing implementation. Testing tools should also be selected based on usability and configurability criteria. These results of this study can be used in developing the efficiency of software testing and in development of the testing strategy for organization.

In this paper, we integrate goal programming (GP), Taylor Series, Kuhn-Tucker conditions and Penalty Function approaches to
solve linear fractional bi-level programming (LFBLP)problems. As we
know, the Taylor Series is having the property of transforming fractional
functions to a polynomial. In the present article by Taylor Series we
obtain polynomial objective functions which are equivalent to fractional
objective functions. Then on using the Kuhn-Tucker optimality condition
of the lower level problem, we transform the linear bilevel programming
problem into a corresponding single level programming. The complementary and slackness condition of the lower level problem is appended to
the upper level objective with a penalty, that can be reduce to a single
objective function. In the other words, suitable transformations can be
applied to formulate FBLP problems. Finally a numerical example is
given to illustrate the complexity of the procedure to the solution.

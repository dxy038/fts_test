The paper deals with the optimal control of switched piecewise linear autonomous systems, where the objective is that of minimizing a quadratic performance index over an infinite time horizon. We assume that the switching sequence and the corresponding jump matrix sequence is known, while the unknown switching times are the optimization parameters. The optimal control for this class of systems, assuming a switching sequence of finite length, takes the form of a homogeneous state feedback, i.e., it is possible to identify a homogeneous region of the state space such that an optimal switch should occur if and only if the present state belongs to this region. We show how such a region can be computed with a numerical procedure. As the number of allowed switches goes to infinity, we study the stability of the system and discuss some preliminary results related to the convergence of the state feedback law

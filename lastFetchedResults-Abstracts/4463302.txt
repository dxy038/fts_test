The author briefly discusses some characteristic differences between computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) and management information systems (MIS) applications. He then discusses the changes in computer technology that have led to the proliferation of these systems in a variety of applications. He also reviews the traditional perspectives of MIS departments in the development of earlier computer systems, the impact of the integrated computer automated manufacturing model, some marketing strategies of control equipment and computer vendors, and the importance of technical and economic analysis. He concludes with a set of objective guidelines for organizations in selecting computer technology appropriate to the control applications

A bidirectional radio-over-dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing transport system using injection-locked and optoelectronic feedback controlled vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is proposed and demonstrated. It is shown that the system performance, which is evaluated by using bit-error rate, error vector magnitude, and intermodulation distortion-to-carrier ratio, is improved due to using injection-locked and feedback controlled VCSELs

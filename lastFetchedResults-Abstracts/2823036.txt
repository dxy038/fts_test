In this paper, a family of bidirectional dual-input dc/dc converters is proposed to combine the Photovoltaic (PV) system with the Energy Storage System (ESS). This family of converters utilizes a full-bridge or half-bridge current-source circuit as the primary side, and the Quasi-Switched-Capacitor circuit as the secondary side. Depending on the power level of the primary side and voltage level of the battery, different topologies can be selected. Compared to other bidirectional multiple-input dc/dc converters with the galvanic isolation function, this family of converters utilizes less number of switches and passive components, reduces voltage stress on switches, and is easier to achieve a high boost ratio. The operation principle of the converter is presented, and a power sharing strategy between two input sources is proposed. A 1.3 kW prototype utilizing Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET is built and experimental results are presented to verify the proposed technology.

Background: The main claimed advantage of model driven engineering is the improvement of productivity. However, little information is available about its actual usage during software development and maintenance in the industry. Objective: The main aim of this work is investigating the level of maturity in the usage of software models and model driven engineering in the Italian industry. The perspective is that of software engineering researchers. Method: First, we conducted an exploratory personal opinion survey with 155 Italian software professionals. The data were collected with the help of a web-based on-line questionnaire. Then, we conducted focused interviews with three software professionals to interpret doubtful results. Results: Software modelling is a very relevant phenomenon in the Italian industry. Model driven techniques are used in the industry, even if (i) only for a limited extent, (ii) despite a quite generalized dissatisfaction about available tools and (iii) despite a generally low experience of the IT personnel in such techniques. Limitations: Generalization of results is limited due to the sample size. Moreover, possible self-exclusion from participants not interested in modelling could have biased the results. Conclusion: Results reinforce existing evidence regarding the usage of software modelling and (partially of) model driven engineering in the industry but highlight several aspects of immaturity of the Italian industry.

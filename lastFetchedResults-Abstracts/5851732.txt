The reservoir group along the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River is composed of the Luhun reservoir, Guxian reservoir and Xiaolangdi reservoir, in addition to Huanyuankou hydrological station as the common flood control point, with each reservoir having its own flood control objective respectively. The flood protection priority of the reservoir group along the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River is to regulate flood scientifically and reduce peak discharge at the flood control points of every reservoir and Huanyuankou hydrological station in the most efficient way. A flood optimal control model is established to optimize flood control of the reservoir group along the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River, based on the maximum flood peak clipping criterion. The combination of particle swarm optimization with reservoir cycling method is proposed to solve the model, whose effectiveness is validated through an expirical study.

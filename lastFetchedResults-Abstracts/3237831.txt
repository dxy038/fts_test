In this paper is presented a method to monitor and analyze data from the instrumentation system of electric power substation 69/13, 8kV as a way to identify false alarms that lead to erroneous decision making from maintenance and operation teams. The data are extracted from the field instrumentation automation system through the digital relays that have protective function and measuring the electrical grid. Uses model-based quantitative method applying physical laws to develop a fault detection module from all current sensors substation. To identify whether a particular event is real or false alarm we use analytical redundancy. This module is part of the failure recovery system designed to meet the Maintenance Management Center (MMC), whose overall objective is to assist in the maintenance of their equipment operational intervention.

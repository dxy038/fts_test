Objective: The aim of this study was to establish the presence of malnutrition in elderly
institutionalized people through Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores and to observe the changes of
nutritional status through the Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis (BIVA). Design: Observational study.
Setting: Nursing home located in the territory of Florence (Italy). Participants: 463 elderly individuals from
twelve nursing homes, all aged 65 yrs or over. Measurements: We carried out the MNA and measured the
bioelectrical parameters of resistance (R) and reactance (Xc), with standard, tetrapolar analysis at 50 kHz
frequency; these bioelectrical parameters were interpreted according to BIVA analysis. Results: According to
the MNA score, 23.1% of the women and 20.4% of the males are malnourished (MNA<17), 60.0% and
52.8%, respectively, are at risk for malnutrition (17≤MNA≤23.5). Malnourished, at-risk and well-fed subjects
differ significantly (p<0.05) in their mean scores obtained in each of the MNA areas. Fifteen of eighteen
MNA items show a significant correlation to the total MNA score (p<0.001). The items not significantly
related to the MNA global score were those concerning protein intake, independence and number of
medicinal drugs taken. In both genders, the decrease of the MNA score increases the proportion of subjects
placed outside the 95% confidence ellipse on the BIVAtolerance graph. Conclusion: A routine assessment of
nutritional status through BIVA analysis combined with more “traditional” tools like the MNA could be
useful for recognizing malnutrition and the risk of malnutrition in the elderly as these instruments provide
complete information and are easy to use even with heavily impaired subjects.

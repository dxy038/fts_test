Partial discharge (PD) produces characteristic indications and patterns about the state of an insulation system, which can be studied via computer numerical simulations. Whilst experiments are critical to understanding how these PD patterns affect the aging of insulation systems through the formation and growth of electrical trees, they are also difficult and expensive to setup and actual physical effects sometimes take days and even months to show up. Accurate numerical simulation models can be a workaround, in such a scenario, to aid in studies related to condition monitoring of insulation materials. This paper is a prelude to research into developing prognosis tools for machine condition monitoring. Here we provide an overview of simulation attempts with respect to modeling partial discharge and electrical treeing. A comparison of different simulation approaches is given as per research objective and fidelity to reported experimental data. The reported studies have been used to explore the suitability of using models to extract information from these two phenomena to determine the health of insulation systems, especially in regards to rotating machines, on shipboard power systems with emphasis on the notional concept of an all-electric ship (AES).

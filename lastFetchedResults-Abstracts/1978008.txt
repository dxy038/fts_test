This paper is focused on novel utilizations of raw materials and technologies for manufacturing lightweight metallic reservoirs. The objective is to develop an environmental friendly technology for producing gas and liquid storage reservoirs that ensures a more efficient utilization of raw materials and a better end-of-life management of products than other technologies currently used to fabricate metallic reservoirs.

oposed technology utilizes previously engineered single-stage nosing of thin-walled tubes using sacrificial (expendable) mandrels to develop a multi-stage process that makes use of recyclable mandrels for producing lightweight, axisymmetric, seamless reservoirs. Recyclable mandrels are cast from low melting point alloys, possess the ability to continuously adapt its shape to that of the preforms and are easily removed by melting, while leaving the reservoir intact, at the end of the process.

ospects for eliminating the welding routes commonly used in the fabrication of reservoirs and for remelting and recycling the mandrels, results in significant economic and time savings and offers potential for opening new markets for the production of low-cost seamless reservoirs.

esentation is supported by experimentation and numerical modelling based on independently determined mechanical properties of the materials with the purpose of understanding the deformation mechanics and identifying the major operating parameters of the proposed technology.

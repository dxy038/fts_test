The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of clothing pressure exerted by the girdles on female´s autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Three different styles of girdles were tried by seven healthy females. Skin pressures of 6 different positions were measured. The ANS activities were assessed by means of heart rate variability power spectral analysis. Results showed that style Z had the least effect on the ANS activity, because the ratio of low frequency (LF) to high frequency (HF) had nearly no change. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) was more excited with style U, because the values of LF, total power, standardized LF (LFnorm) and the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) were all inclined to increase. SNS was more inhibited with size L of style Y, because the values of HF, LF, LFnorm and LF/HF were all tended to decline. For size XL of style Y, The local skin pressure was the highest at the lateral waist, which probably made SNS be stimulated. Therefore, size L of style Y had a more negative physiological effect on the women´s health, but style U and size XL of style Y had a beneficial physiological effect on the female´s health due to activation of SNS. In conclusion, magnitude and gradients of local skin pressures caused by the girdles could influence ANS activity. If the local skin pressure was significantly higher at the abdomen than at any other parts covered by girdles, SNS activity would be inhibited. If the local skin pressure was significantly higher at the lateral waist than at any other parts covered by girdles, SNS activity would be stimulated.

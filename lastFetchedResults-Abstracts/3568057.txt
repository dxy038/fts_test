This paper presents a novel solution optimizing satellite access lower layers and system performances called variable size packets (VSPs) designed for the transport of Internet protocol (IP) datagrams or any packet type from the network layers characterized by a highly variable size. VSP objective is to maximize the efficiency of layers 1 and 2 through a joint optimization of access and transport mechanisms mainly for satellite systems addressing residential or corporate terminals market through a multiple-access scheme. It is particularly attractive for the return link of next-generation satellite systems to be IP-based, as a possible evolution of the digital video broadcast-return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS) standard. The VSP solution relies on the definition of multiple encapsulation sizes, and is associated to a waveform and an access adapted to variable size packets´ transport. It uses the traffic´s variable size nature to increase encapsulation efficiency, coding, and spectral efficiency performances, and system flexibility. It is well adapted to systems using an adaptive waveform leading to system capacity´s increase and better performances. This paper describes the VSP principle, advantages and possible high-level system tradeoffs. It then focuses on one critical issue, the coding, and presents a suitable coding scheme´s choice with regards to performances and implementation complexity.

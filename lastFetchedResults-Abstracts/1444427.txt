Given a plant together with an exosystem generating the disturbances and the reference signals, the problem of asymptotic tracking and regulation is to find a controller such that the plant variable tracks the reference signal regardless of the disturbance acting on the system. If a controller achieves this design objective, we call it a regulator for the plant with respect to the given exosystem. In this paper, we formulate the asymptotic tracking and regulation problem in the behavioral framework, with control by interconnection.

Objective
estigate the short- and long-term in vitro wear resistance of experimental resin-based composites (RBCs) derived from a commercial formulation.
s
perimental RBCs were manufactured by manipulating the monomeric resin composition and the filler characteristics of Grandio (Voco GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany). The Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) oral wear simulator was used in the presence of a food-like slurry to simulate three-body abrasion and attrition wear for 50,000, 150,000 and 300,000 cycles. A three-dimensional image of each wear facet was created and the total volumetric wear (mm3) and maximum wear depth (μm) were quantified for the RBC and antagonist. Statistical analyses of the total volumetric wear and maximum wear depth data (two- and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey's post hoc tests where required) and regression analyses, were conducted at p = 0.05.
s
y ANOVAs identified a significant effect of RBC material × wear cycles, RBC material and wear cycles (all p &lt; 0.0001). Regression analyses showed significant increases in the total volumetric wear (p ≤ 0.001) and maximum wear depth data (p ≤ 0.004) for all RBCs with increasing wear cycles.
icance
ences between all RBC materials were evident after ≥150,000 wear cycles and antagonist wear provided valuable information to support the experimental findings. Wear simulating machines can provide an indication of the clinical performance but clinical performance is multi-factorial and wear is only a single facet. Employing experimental RBCs provided by a dental manufacturer rather than using self-manufactured RBCs or dental products provides increased experimental control by limiting the variables involved.

Lifestyle management is a growing area aimed at giving individuals support for an increased self-awareness; self-monitoring technologies are essential in providing an objective account of our daily events. However, most self-monitoring technological solutions largely focus on physical health and ignore other aspects. Our goal is to utilise context aware technologies in order to support people in understanding how various aspects of their lives influence their wellbeing, including, for example, mental and social health. For that, we need to gain a deeper insight into the challenges of designing such solutions, from sensing to interaction paradigms. The paper describes the design and implementation of our system, including novel story-based information presentation concepts. We conclude with preliminary results from our exploratory user-based experiments.

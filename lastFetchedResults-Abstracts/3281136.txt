In this paper, we investigate the beam squint problems in 60 GHz mm-wave wireless communication beamforming process. To minimize the degree of beam squint we formulate the objective task into a constrained optimization problem and derived a phase improvement scheme based on IEEE 802.15.3c codebook. For further improvement of system performance, main response axis (MRA) alignment scheme is proposed, the direction of MRA can be adjusted alignment exactly in different frequencies and can achieve higher array antenna gain with a lower side lobe level (SLL) and it is more effective than the first schemes, but requires more phase shifters. In order to reduce the complexity of MRA alignment scheme, we proposed MRA alignment simplify scheme, the scheme only require 1/2 phase shifters has a negligible performance loss compared with the second scheme. Extensive simulations have demonstrated that the proposed three schemes can suppress beam squint, improves system throughput and performs better than the existing scheme.

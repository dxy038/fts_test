This paper presents a design and simulation results of protection and control functions of the low voltage part of a distribution substation. The substation acts as a service provider for distributed resource units in a microgrid and can be used for bidirectional energy exchange between prosumers, such as electric vehicles, battery pack energy storage devices and utility networks. Improved functions for automated energy exchange are described. Functions of an experimental microgrid application are simulated with MATLAB. The aim of the modelling and simulation is to define and optimize parameters and functions for construction of a microgrid prototype. Sample control algorithms and program modules for the substation controller are developed and described. Use of the IEC 61850 communication protocol in the communication between prosumers and a substation is analyzed.

This paper presents an efficient method based on inter-field information for video de-interlacing. The basic idea is to classify the field dynamically to background or foreground area. The proposed method interpolates missing pixels using temporal information in the background area, and then interpolates remaining pixels using spatial and temporal information in the foreground area. Extensive simulations conducted for video sequences show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the previous methods based on the ELA and the line averaging method in terms of the objective and subjective image qualities. Moreover, our proposed algorithm requires lower computational complexity and provides high-quality video sequences on the progressive devices.

This paper presents a new system for three-dimensional (3-D) orthodontic treatment planning and movement of teeth. We describe a computer vision technique for the acquisition and processing of 3-D images of the profile of hydrocolloid dental imprints. Profile measurement is based on the triangulation method which detects deformation of the projection of a laser line on the dental imprints. The system is computer-controlled and designed to achieve depth and lateral resolutions of 0.1 and 0.2 mm, respectively, within a depth range of 40 mm. The 3-D image of the imprint is segmented in order to identify different teeth. Two operators are presented: one for the detection of molars and premolars based on a directional gradient, and one for incisors and canines based on 3-D registration with dental models contained in a database. We apply these 3-D dental models to simulate the 3-D movement of teeth, including rotations, during orthodontic treatment. With this objective, we have developed an original simplified model of arch-wire behaviour and a viscoplastic behaviour law for the alveolar bone in order to simulate teeth displacements during orthodontic treatment. The contribution of the paper is part of a diagnosis system (called MAGALLANES) that is designed to replace manual measurement methods, which use costly plaster models, with computer measurement methods and teeth movement simulation using cheap hydrocolloid dental wafers. This procedure will reduce the cost and acquisition time of orthodontic data and facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies.

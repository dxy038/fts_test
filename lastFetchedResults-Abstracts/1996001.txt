Polyurethanes were modified using monobenzyloxy polyethylene glycol (BPEG) which possesses a bulky hydrophobic benzyloxy group at one end and a hydroxyl group at the other end as a preconstructed BPEG layer, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and monomethoxyl poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) with various chain lengths as fillers. Our objective was to investigate the effect of PEG graft density and conformation on protein adsorption at PEGlated surface. The graft density was estimated by a chemical titration method. The combination of ATR-FTIR, AFM and titration results provide evidences that the graft density can be increased by backfilling PEG or MPEG to a BPEG layer. However, fibrinogen and albumin adsorption significantly increased on all surfaces after PEG or MPEG backfilling. We conclude that the conformation of hydrophobic benzyloxy end groups of the BPEG layer plays a key role. The benzyloxy end groups of preconstructed PEG chains stretch to the surface after PEG backfilling, which possibly accounts for the observed increase in protein adsorption. The BPEG conformation change after backfilling with PEG or MPEG was also suggested by contact angles. Additionally, protein adsorption was slightly influenced by the length of filler, suggesting a change in surface morphology.

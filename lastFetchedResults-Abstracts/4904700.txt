The objective of this paper is to present a series of novel doubly salient electromagnetic generator (DSEG) with multiple rotor poles for direct driven wind turbine. The 6k/4k-pole DSEGs are restricted in direct drive wind power application for the constraint between stator pole number and rotor pole number. Recent work by the authors shows a series of DSEG which the rotor pole number is more than the stator pole number. 2-D finite element analysis software for DSEG was developed and the obtained results verify the rationality of new structures and also show that the new structures have many attractive advantages, such as cogging torque, external characteristic, power density and efficiency.

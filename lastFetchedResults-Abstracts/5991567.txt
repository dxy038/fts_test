The present paper describes the architecture of an ongoing project (called &#8220;VQI - Video Quality Indicators&#8221;) that aims to generate indicators of the quality of video received by the viewers of Free to Air Digital Television. Particularly, it is oriented to ISDB-Tb system so the video codec used is H.264 with both HD and SD resolutions. The final result of the project is to obtain an objective indicator of video quality and direct subjective measures, based on the average opinion of the audience. For the subjective measurements, the concept of crowdsourcing for TV is introduced. They are performed through an Interactive TV application using Ginga middleware. The paper includes a brief discussion on the treatment of packet loss for DTV, and a description of a new application for smartphones developed to input the ratings in subjective test sessions which simplifies processing of results and minimizes errors.

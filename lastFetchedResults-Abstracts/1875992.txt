Objective: The objective of this study was to explore preweaning mood state and dyspnea in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: Before ventilatory weaning, 21 critically ill patients completed the short profile of mood states (higher scores equal greater disturbance), and a 10 cm dyspnea visual analogue scale (none to extremely severe). Weaning outcome at 24 hours was recorded. Results: The mean ± SD total mood disturbance (possible range, 0 to 16) and subscale scores (possible range, 0 to 4) were as follows: total, 6.10 ± 4.06; tension, 1.07 ± 0.64; depression, 1.16 ± 0.93; anger, 1.05 ± 0.82; vigor, 1.04 ± 0.84; fatigue, 1.96 ± 0.90; and confusion, 1.27 ± 0.91. Mean dyspnea was 3.22 ± 2.26 cm. Dyspnea intensity correlated negatively with vigor (r = –0.38, P &lt;.10). Lower preweaning vigor tended to differentiate successful from unsuccessful weaning (Mann-Whitney U = 22.0; P =.07). Conclusion: Patients who weaned successfully experienced greater mood disturbance. Moderate mood disturbance may be a necessary stimulus for successful weaning. (Heart Lung® 2000;29:173-9.)

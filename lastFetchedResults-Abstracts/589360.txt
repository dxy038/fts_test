In this paper, we develop an approach to optimally allocate a limited nonrenewable resource
among the activities of a project, represented by a PERT-Type Network (PTN). The project needs to
be completed within some specified due date. The objective is to maximize the probability of project
completion on time. The duration of each activity is an arbitrary discrete random variable and also depends
on the amount of consumable resource allocated to it. On the basis of the structure of networks, they
are categorized as either reducible or irreducible. For each network structure, an analytical algorithm is
presented. Through some examples, the algorithms are illustrated.

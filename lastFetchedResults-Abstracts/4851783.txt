This paper focuses on designing a closed-loop state feedback controller for a grid-connected wind turbine system including a matrix converter. The system the open-loop system is stable; therefore, the closed-loop controller design objective is to track a class of desired references. The state-feedback controller is designed based on the linear quadratic (LQ) method. A genetic algorithm is used to determine the weighting matrices of the LQ method to locate the closed-loop eigenvalues as close as to the desired values. An observer estimates the states by measuring the system output and input. Simulations show that the system outputs follow the references with zero steady-state errors.

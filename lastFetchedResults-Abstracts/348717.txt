Objective
Mismatch negativity (MMN), a change-specific component of the auditory event-related potential (ERP), is sensitive to deficits in central auditory processing associated with many clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to obtain a comprehensive multi-dimensional profile of central auditory processing by extending the recently developed fast multi-feature MMN paradigm [Näätänen R, Pakarinen S, Rinne T, Takegata R. The mismatch negativity (MMN): towards the optimal paradigm. Clin Neurophysiol 2004;115:140–144].
Methods
MMN responses to changes in sound duration, frequency, intensity, and perceived sound-source location at six different magnitudes of deviation were recorded from healthy young adults by using the multi-feature MMN paradigm. In addition, behavioural discrimination accuracy and speed were measured to examine the relationship between MMN and behavioural performance.
Results
All the 24 sound changes elicited significant MMNs. MMN amplitude increased and latency decreased with increasing magnitude of sound change. Furthermore, the MMN amplitude and latency predicted the subjects’ accuracy and speed in detecting these deviations.
Conclusions
This new paradigm provides an extensive auditory discrimination profile for several auditory attributes at different deviation magnitudes in a minimal recording time.
Significance
The auditory discrimination profiles can offer a comprehensive view of the development, plasticity, and deficits of central auditory processing.

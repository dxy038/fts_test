Background and Objective: Due to facing the cancers with existential issues, this study aims is to investigate the effectiveness of logo therapy on the anxiety of death and life expectancy in patients with stomach cancer.
Subjects and Methods: This study is quasi-experimental. The study population included all patients with stomach cancer in 1394 who visited Tehran Cancer Association. The sample consisted of 24 patients with stomach cancer selected by available sampling method and were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. After running the pretest on both groups, the experimental intervention group underwent ten weekly 90-minute logo-therapy sessions. After completion of the treatment program, post-test was taken. Data were collected from Miller life expectancy scale (MHS) and Templar Death Anxiety Scale (DAS). Analysis of covariance was used for data analysis.
Results: The experimental group pre-test scores of death anxiety were significantly reduced after the training of logo therapy (9.50 versus 5.50). The pre-test scores of life expectancy variables in experimental groups, after receiving the logo therapy training significantly increased (118 versus 127). In addition results of the analysis of variance showed that logo therapy training effectively reduced death anxiety (58%)and life expectancy (83%) in the experimental group (P  < 0/001).
Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, logo therapy training is effective in reduceing death anxiety and improves the life expectancy in patients with stomach cancer.

The paper presents a solution to the dynamic registration problem in augmented reality for telerobotics applications. The objective is to align the virtual camera used to render a 3D graphical replica of a robot manipulator with the real camera, providing images from the work site. We proceed in two steps: first, a static registration process requiring the intervention of the operator; next, a dynamic registration process that continuously and automatically updates the registration data. Our dynamic algorithm relies on feature tracking and an extended Kalman filter for state estimation. We present experimental results for the dynamic registration algorithm and discuss possible extensions and improvements of the method

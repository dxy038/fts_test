We examine the in-network optimal content placement and storage allocation problem by formulating a linear program. Our objective is to minimize the overall cost of content delivery subject to total storage budget and link capacity constraints. The solution determines whether/where to keep a copy of a content based on contents ranking distributions. In addition, we present a realization of the optimal content placement solution based on content-centric networking protocol. We show that such optimized content delivery significantly reduces the cost of content distribution and improves quality of service.

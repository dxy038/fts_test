The objective of the undertaken research was to compare infrared spectroscopy (IRS) and egg size measurements for non-destructive evaluation of eggshell strength. For the infrared analysis of the eggs from broiler breeds Ross 508×Ross and Case×Ross, an infrared spectrometer equipped with an upward looking diffuse reflection accessory was used. Data were collected from 5000 to 640 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Infrared and egg size parameters were correlated with eggshell quality parameters obtained using invasive techniques. Shell thickness was best predicted by IRS (correlation coefficient 0·52 versus 0·32 based on size measurements). Shell fracture force, maximal deformation, and shell stiffness were predicted with comparable accuracy by both IRS and egg size parameters (correlation coefficients ranging from 0·24 to 0·42). IRS was also able to predict shell weight with reasonable accuracy (correlation coefficient 0·72). Data suggest that neither physical size measurements or IRS yield high-quality predictions of eggshell quality, but IRS, given its speed and ability to predict multiple parameters with one measurement appears the favourable technique to explore further.

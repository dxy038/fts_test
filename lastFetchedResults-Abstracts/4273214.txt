A new input-switched single-phase high performance bridgeless AC-DC Zeta converter (Inverse SEPIC) topology is proposed. Instead of using a single phase rectifier followed by a boost DC-DC converter, or using a bridge rectifier with two diodes and two switches, the converterÂ´s input is chopped at high frequency during positive and negative cycles by a single bidirectional switch to get step-up/step-down AC-DC conversion. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the input current of the proposed circuit with small input current filter is low. Input power factor and the efficiency of conversion of the circuit are high. The circuit exhibits such performance with variable loads at constant frequency switching. No additional control is required to achieve the advantages.

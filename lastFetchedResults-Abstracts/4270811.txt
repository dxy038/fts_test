This paper presents a bidirectional arbitrated adaptive DFE (BAAD) algorithm that enables the use of low- complexity adaptive DFE in the bidirectional equalization framework. Through converting a nonminimum phase channel into two near minimum phase channels, which facilitate concurrent equalization using two DFE´s with short feedforward filters in a time-forward and a time-reverse directions and the application of the existing approximate channel inverse initialization method, we overcome the slow and/or ill convergence problem of the two adaptive DFE´s in BAAD algorithm. In terms of computational complexity, the BAAD algorithm is more amenable to practical implementation than the existing bidirectional arbitrated DFE (BAD) algorithm that necessitates long FFF and computationally intensive minimum- mean-square-error DFE (MMSE-DFE). Numerical simulation results of BAAD algorithm corroborate its effectiveness.

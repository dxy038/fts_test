Mountains of data are symbol of the smart city. In order to make the design better for future we have to analysis the historical data to find the trends and the potential pattern. The best way to solve the challenge of processing huge number of data as the development of smart city is using mathematical model. In this report power load of a domestic area is used as an example. The objective is to show the trends and behaviors of consumers in using electricity through data processing. The different diagrams are plotted to help determine highest and lowest usage consumers and other temporal patterns. In this case Mat lab is a very useful tool to visualize the data and give accurate result. At the last the influence in engineering and some ideas for future study have also been discussed.

The influence of DFIG based wind-farms on network operation is investigated with the objective of establishing the minimum level of synchronous generation required for the effective operation of converter-connected generation. The impact of DFIG wind generation on both power system dynamic stability and transient stability is explored with particular reference to system damping and fault recovery performance. A generic network model for the study of networks comprising mixed conventional and wind generation was employed. The results of simulation studies are presented and discussed.

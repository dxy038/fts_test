International trade scrutinises food safety practices and procedures, and food businesses have to review their safety procedures more rigorously. HACCP is increasingly relied on to ensure food safety in both meat-producing and meat-processing enterprises. The objective of this study was to compare incentives, costs, difficulties and benefits of Chinese and Mexican meat-exporting enterprises related to food safety management systems implementation. A questionnaire was applied to identify the main factors involved in HACCP implementation. Data were collected among 32 Chinese and 42 Mexican companies, and analysed using the SAS package. The implementation of the HACCP system was filled out in all exporting meat industries. The results indicated that the major incentives were related to improving product quality for both countries, whilst improving control of the process was the first motivation in the Chinese industry and access to new foreign markets was the first motivation in the Mexican one. In addition, both countries' industries reported that staff training was the most important implementing cost, while product testing was the major operating cost. The difficulties found during HACCP implementation and operation activities were associated with availability of personnel for other tasks for China and costs of certification for Mexico. The reported benefits were relevant for the two countries, due to the ability to reduce microbial counts and increased access to foreign and domestic markets. A better understanding of the costs and benefits associated with HACCP systems could be helpful and is necessary in every segment of the food chain in every sector of domestic and international markets in order to assure food quality and safety.

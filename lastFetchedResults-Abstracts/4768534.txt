This paper introduces several Business Rules for maximising the revenue of Providers in Cloud Computing Markets. These rules apply in both negotiation and execution time, and enforce the achievement of Business-Level Objectives by establishing a bidirectional data flow between market and resource layers. The experiments demonstrate that the revenue is maximized by using both resource data when negotiating, and economic information when managing the resources.

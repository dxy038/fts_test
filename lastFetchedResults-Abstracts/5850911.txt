In wireless sensor networks, congestion control is a challenging task because it causes the loss of information and reduction of energy efficiency. The congestion control scheme is necessary to be carried out to detect congestion precisely and regulate it fairly. To achieve this objective, Fuzzy Based Adaptive Congestion Control (FBACC) is proposed which uses buffer occupancy, participants and traffic rate. FBACC provides a fuzzy logic based congestion estimation, smart way to drop packet in case of congestion up to acceptable quality level and most important it regulate traffic rate. It improves performance of network over other protocols which are presently available. Performance of FBACC is evaluated and compared with existing schemes e.g. Event-to-Sink Reliable Transport (ESRT), Fuzzy Logic Based Congestion Estimation (FLCE) and Congestion Control Scheme Based on Fuzzy Logic (CCSFL) with respect to congestion detection, packet loss, end-to-end delay and energy. FBACC detects the network congestion more preciously and uniformly and it also adapts to current traffic rate with respect to product of previous participants with previous traffic rate to reduce the packet loss. Finally, FBACC saves energy of retransmission because packet loss is minimal due to traffic adaption.

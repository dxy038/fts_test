Human can only perceive video distortions beyond certain intensity. Temporal variations of suprathreshold noise in a video induce annoying temporal noise (e.g., flickering artifacts). Prior studies on full-reference video quality assessment (VQA) focused mainly on spatial quality of impaired videos, and ignored or underestimated the impact of temporal noise on visual quality degradation. According to some characteristics of human visual system, we consider temporal noise as the most salient distortion in impaired videos and it can greatly influence the perceived video quality. Thus, we propose a novel and simple full-reference metric that evaluates quality of impaired videos by measuring the energy of temporal noise in them. This metric shows competitive performance with some state-of-the-art objective models on the LIVE VQA database.

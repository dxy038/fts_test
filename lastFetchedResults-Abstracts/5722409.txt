The objective of this paper is to present the results of the simulations conducted regarding the grid connected and islanded modes of operation of a test case microgrid. Such results are related to the pre-planned or intentional islanding and the forced islanding condition. Currently, the expectation about the performance of the microgrid technology is high, thus, more research is needed to guarantee that the different conditions that might be present in a real case are those shown in the simulations. It will be shown that the microgrid can face some difficulties, even unsuccessful attempts, during its islanding procedure from the utility. The Matlab/Simulink program was used as simulation tool.

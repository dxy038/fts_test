The aim of this study was to assess the effect of iron species present in fly ashes produced from coal combustion on mercury retention and oxidation. To achieve this objective the work was divided into two parts. In the first part the relationship between the mercury and iron content in fly ashes of different origin and characteristics was evaluated. In the second, a series of fractions enriched in iron oxides were separated from the fly ashes to determine the effect of increasing iron content on mercury retention and oxidation. Special attention was paid to the influence of iron on mercury behavior in enriched carbon particles in fly ashes. From the results obtained it can be inferred that, in the range of fly ashes studied, iron species do not affect the retention of mercury and do not play any role in heterogeneous mercury oxidation.

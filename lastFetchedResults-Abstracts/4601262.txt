The robust nonlinear servomechanism theory is applied to design a tracking controller for the familiar ball and beam system. The central objective is to have the ball position asymptotically track a sinusoidal reference input in the presence of the ball mass and beam inertia, uncertainties. Simulations show that the resulting controller demonstrates excellent robust tracking property in comparison with other approaches

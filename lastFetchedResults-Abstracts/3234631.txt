This paper deals with a home rehabilitation system, based on wireless motion sensors, for assisting therapists in assessing recovery of patients with motor dysfunctions. Measurements in home rehabilitation may complement the subjective perception of therapist with objective observations that lead to quantitative evaluation. The goal of this work is to discuss design and implementation of a complete system capable of bringing a real-time 3D reconstruction of human posture to therapist´s desk, starting from exercises performed at patient´s house. Attention has been paid to reducing costs and clutter of home-side equipments as much as possible.

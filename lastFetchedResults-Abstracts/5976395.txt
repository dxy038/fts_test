The problem of single dielectric slab parameters estimation on the basis of reflectometry data taken in microwave band is considered using objective function minimization approach. The ldquoquasidurationldquo-based objective function formed from frequency reflection coefficient samples is shown to be more appropriate in comparison with standard robust objective function. The method of estimation was tested on numerically synthesized reflection-coefficient data using genetic algorithm for global minimum searching.

The main objective of this research is to compare two different irrigation methods according to parametric evaluation System in an area of 15831 hectares in Kheran plain in Khuzestan province. Soil properties of the Study area including texture, depth, electro- conductivity, drainage, calcium carbonate content and slope were derived from a semi- detailed soil study regarding Kheran plain in a scale of 1: 25000. After analyzing and evaluating soil properties by means of Geographic Information System (GIS), suitability maps were generated for both methods. The results showed that about 3444 hectares of the under study process lands for level-irrigation method and merely 163 hectares expected for drop-irrigation are highly suitable and furthermore, about 9482 hectares are moderately suitable for drop-irrigation, and in both irrigating methods soil sery code 3, with an area about 406 hectares has been recognized inappropriate at the time being. The main limiting factors in using both gravity and drop irrigation methods in this area were soil salinity and drainge and the drop irrigation method added calcium carbonate to them.

Inroduction & Objective:  Formalin and copper sulfate are compounds than those who are constantly in aquaculture to treat parasitic infections and bacterial infections are used. Fish skin are as organs that are constantly exposed to the external environment and because of its role in respiration and osmotic balance of these chemicals and heavy metal are the first target. The purpose of this study is of histopathological effects of copper sulfate and formaldehyde concentrations on skin tissue of white fish in the Caspian Sea
Material and Methods: In this research, indication of probable waste for skin tissues of Khazar white fish with average weight of 428 Mg and length weight of 3.5 Cm is addressed after exposing to different compactness of copper sulfate (in 20 minutes short time care and 24 hours long time care,100ppm and 1ppm) and formalin (in short time care and long time care,25ppm and 250ppm). After stabilizing tissues in 10 percent formalin and making 5 micrometer section, it is painted with hematoxylin method and is studied by optical microscope.
Results: The results showed that in the consideration of skin histology, there was not any changes in skin cells which was in exposure of lowest compactness of copper, but in compactness of 100ppm disparting epidermis layers was more than basal layer. Keratinocyte layer existent in skin remained without any change and effects of bleeding was not seen.
Conclusions: In considerations of skin, individuation of layers is seen in a mild extent and in long time care is seen in Malpigy cells and disparting epidermis layers from basal layers and effects of hyperemia has not been seen.

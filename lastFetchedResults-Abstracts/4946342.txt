The multistability problem is discussed for 2n-dimensional bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with a general class of activation functions. By using analysis approach and decomposition of state space, &#194;&#191;<sup>2n</sup> can be divided into 3<sup>n</sup> regions. 2<sup>n</sup> regions of them are positive invariant, and under some conditions, every invariant set has a locally exponentially stable equilibrium. Moreover, new attractive basin is investigated. It is larger than the positive invariant set. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the results.

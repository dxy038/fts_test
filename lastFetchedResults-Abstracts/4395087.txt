A hybrid power system placed in Beaufort Sea in order to power supply the offshore oil and gas platforms is investigated in this paper. The proposed microgrid includes various energy sources such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, diesel generator as a secondary power source and stationary storage system. Simulation of each component and the proposed topology is discussed with the energy management strategy and the implementation of different scenarios that show relevant characteristics of the strategies. Finally, a multi-objective optimization of the system is carried out and the results obtained are used to construct a Pareto front, for the best trade-off between emissions and cost.

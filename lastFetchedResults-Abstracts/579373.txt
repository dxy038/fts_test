Abstractâ€”This paper studies the impact of using multihop wireless adhoc network in conjunction with cellular networks under a probabilistic routing strategy. Our objective is to obtain the outage probability of the two-dimensional hybrid CDMA network under path loss. In the proposed network the base stations are placed on a regular grid and users are distributed randomly according to a homogeneous Poisson point process. To obtain the outage probability of the proposed hybrid network, we study the outage probability of a cellular CDMA wireless network on both uplink and downlink as well as the outage probability of a multihop ad hoc CDMA network. We validate our analytical expressions via Monte Carlo simulations. Our results demonstrate that in order to improve the performance of a hybrid wireless network with a large density of users, it is beneficial to use multihop ad hoc communication.

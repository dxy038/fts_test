Apply computer-aided design and analysis software, combine with main design requirements of Loader work equipment,and investigate parametric design and simulation of reversal six-connecting-rod in the Work Equipment on Pro/E. On the basis of Work equipment loading characteristics, all hinge points of reverse the six bodies are looked as design variables, their job performance as the objective function. Considering to avoid the motion and structure interference as constraint conditions, establish multi-objective virtual prototype model of working bodies articulated positions, Completed working device parameters design. By kinematic simulation analysis, test and verify the feasibility of design.

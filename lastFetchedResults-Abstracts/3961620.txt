A novel circuit synthesis method is proposed in which a 3-way decomposition and reduction procedure is used recursively for a given logic function. Logic functions are described and manipulated using a 7-valued logic system to exploit such advantages as bidirectional conductivity of MOS networks. A circuit synthesis program (MOSYN) based on this method was implemented on VAX/UNIX and was able to generate a set of possible circuits under several constraints, which are equivalent in logic but have different topologies. The algorithm is applicable not only to CMOS static circuits but also to other static and dynamic circuits, including NMOS and cascode voltage switch logic.

Objective: Aim of this investigation was to study the effect of one-session karate training on muscle and renal damage markers in karate athletes.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study with pre- and post-test design, 10 elite volunteer male athletes were selected and participated in one-session training (2 hours). Urine and blood samples were collected before training and one hour after training and urine samples was collected 6 hours after training, too. Urinary and plasma creatinine, LDH and CK values were measured through laboratory methods. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, repeated measures, paired sample t test and Wilcoxon with 95% of confidence level. 

Results: There were significant differences between urinary values of creatinine, LDH and CK in the three sampling phases (p < 0.05 There were also significant differences between the mean urinary and blood values of creatinine, LDH and CK within pre-exercise and 1 hour post-exercise values and urinary values of creatinine, LDH and CK within 1 hour post-exercise value and 6 hours post-exercise, too (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: It seems that a session of intensive karate training can increase muscular damage and renal function markers but these values decreased to initial measures 6 hours after training.

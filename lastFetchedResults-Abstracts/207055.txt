BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The incorrect and unsuitable use of antibiotics affects on the transfer of antibiotic resistance. Since, pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most serious pathogenic bacteria in hospitals and it is resistant to different antibiotics and it has created therapeutic problems for physicians, this study was done to determine the multiple resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa against antibiotics, arsenate and metals.
METHODS: In this study, 23 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from clinical samples. They were tested against the antibiotics penicillin groups by Kirby-Bauer test. M.1.C and M.B.C of antibiotics and heavy metals (cadmium, mercury) and arsenate were measured respectively by broth and agar dilution and grown on agar plate methods.
FINDINGS: In this method, the most and less M.1.C against heavy metals were cadmium (0.6, 4.9 µg/ml), mercury (<0.12, 4µ.g/ml) and arsenate (8.103, 256.103 µg/ml). Of 23 strains of P. aeruginosa, 84% were resistant against antibiotics carbenicillin, 63% to piperacillin and 100% to metals cadmium and arsenate. 82.6% of these strains were resistant to mercury.
CONCLUSION: So our results showed that these strains are generally multi-resistant to antibiotics carbenicillin, piperacillin, arsenate and metals.

Background: Test anxiety is frequently viewed as a major factor that can impair testperformance and lead to underachievement. Objective: the current study was a meta-analysis of the performed studies in the area of therapeutically methods applied to reduce test anxiety. Method: to do so, the meta-analysis was used as a statistical technique to collect, to combine, and to summarize the performed studies in the regarded area which finally led to the collection of 45 convenient studies. After entering the data to the software and the sensitivity analysis on one of the studies which digressed away from the other studies, the aforementioned study was removed from the studies collection and in the end 44 studies were analyzed.  Findings: the effect size in the random model for all of the therapeutically methods was 0.68, for behavioral methods it was 0.84, for cognitive methods it was 0.75, for behavioral-cognitive methods it was 0.43, for skills training it was 0.49 and for the combination of behavioral-cognitive and skills training 0.58 was obtained which based on the Cohen scale only the effect size of the behavioral method has been reported very high, the effect size of the two methods of cognitive and the combination of behavioral-cognitive with skills training is higher than medium and the two methods of behavioral-cognitive and skill training obtained lower than medium. Based on the Q-statisticsignificance, gender variables, study population, study tools, sampling method, research method, number of treatment sessions and the sample subjects schooling grade were entered the analysis as the modulating factors. In the random effects model, the role of gender variables, study population, study tool, sampling method and the number of treatment sessions were in the 0.01 significance level.  Conclusions: the study results show that from among the applied therapeutically methods in reducing the test anxiety there has been greater success for behavioral method followed by cognitive method and the therapist should pay more attention to these methods.

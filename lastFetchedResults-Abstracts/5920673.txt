The relationship between the one-axis angle and two of front axle heavy truck steering mechanism is studied. Based on characteristics of steering and Ackerman theorem, the reasonable objective function is used to build. The steering mechanism is designed by the grid method. The design method is reasonable and effective. The research results can be used as a reference for the design of the steering mechanism of other multi-axle vehicle.

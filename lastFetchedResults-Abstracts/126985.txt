Objective: To compare histological changes of the vaginal wall during non-pregnancy period and different stages of pregnancy in buffaloes.
Design: Observational study.
Animals: Fifty nine specimens from non-pregnant and pregnant buffaloes in different stages of pregnancy.
Procedures: After preparation of specimens in the lab anatomy. They were stained by the method of hematoxilin - cosine and four special methods of Verhoof, Toluidine blue, Pantin and Veigerts Iron.The number of cell layer, type of epithelial cells, vascular activities, distribution of plasma cells, elastic fibers and collagen in the mucosa and submucosa were studied.
Statistical analysis: One way ANOVA, Duncan's multiple range test.
Results: During different stages of pregnancy, no significant difference in the number of cell layers and cell type of epithelium was observed. From the second month of gestation, the secretory cells were seen between the epithelial cells which increased significantly to maximum number in the fifth month (P<o.ol) and decreased in the seventh month of pregnancy. Special pregnancy cells, were present in the epithelium from the fourth month of gestation and increased with pregnancy progress, which was more remarkable during months 9 and 10. During the first three months of pregnancy, the number of plasma cells in mucosa and submucosa were greater than the other months. Vascular activities increased with the pregnancy progress and during the last months of gestation, submucosa was more vascular and oedematous. Distribution of the collagen fiber in the deep portion of the mucosa and submucosa was higher than the other regions. Elastic fibers were fairly distributed in the all layer of the vaginal wall.
Clinical implications: Although there is some differences in the histological structure of the vaginal wall during pregnancy in buffalloes, but it can not be used as a method for pregnancy diagnasis.

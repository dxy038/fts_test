In most social networks that are observed over time, we find that some individuals leave and others join the network. It is often important to modify the connections in the resulting network to satisfy desired properties associated with the network as well as individual nodes. We formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem that requires maximization of two measures: the network Information Flow Quality (IFQ) and the Personal Satisfaction Quality(PSQ). Algorithms are developed to accomplish these optimization tasks, and shown to result in satisfactory network reconfiguration.

Background Few studies have investigated strategies to
identify and resolve drug-related problems among clients
of community mental health teams (CMHTs).
Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the
clinical impact and appropriateness of comprehensive
medication reviews for clients of CMHTs.
Methods Trained pharmacists conducted interviews (30–
45 min each) with clients of CMHTs to identify actual and
potential drug-related problems. The pharmacists prepared
medication review reports that detailed their findings and
recommendations to optimize drug therapy. An expert
panel comprising a psychiatrist, general medical
practitioner, mental health pharmacist and medication
review pharmacist evaluated reviews for 48 clients of 5
CMHTs. Panelists independently assessed review findings,
review recommendations, likelihood of recommendation
implementation and the overall expected clinical impact.
Results Two hundred and nine medication review findings
and 208 medication review recommendations were evaluated.
Panelists agreed with 76% of findings and considered
that 81% of recommendations were appropriate. Collectively,
69% of recommendations were considered likely to be
implemented. Thirty-seven (77%) reviews were deemed
potentially to have a positive clinical impact. The agreement
between panelists was statistically significant (P\0.01) for
the assessment of the findings, recommendations and likelihood
of recommendation implementation.
Conclusions Pharmacists’ findings and recommendations
to optimize drug therapy were considered appropriate and
likely to result in improved clinical outcomes. Comprehensive
medication reviews may be a valuable strategy to
identify and resolve drug-related problems among clients of
CMHTs.

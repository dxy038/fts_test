This paper presents a preprocessing method for pedestrians tracking and counting in sequences of grayscale images acquired by a stationary camera on the bus. The objective is to integrate this technology with a traffic control application such as bus carrier traffic statistics at every station. The proposed method can also be used to detect and track humans who will get on or get off the bus. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be employed for the multi-object detection. Among these tasks, object segmentation and labeling are perhaps the most important problem in single image processing. So the aim of the paper is to present the key technologies of object segmentation and labeling for the tracking in video sequences taken.

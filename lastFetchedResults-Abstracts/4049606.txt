This paper presents a systematic optimal design algorithm to design the shape of rotor slot to get a specific speed-torque characteristic in three-phase squirrel cage induction motor for the application to motor operated valve (MOV) actuator. The developed method consists of three steps: design based on equivalent circuit method (ECM) utilizing multi-objective formulation, selection of the strongly influential geometric parameters of rotor slot, and precise design based on finite element method (FEM). The validity of the suggested design method is demonstrated through applications to rotor slot design of three-phase induction motor to achieve a NEMA class D speed-torque characteristic.

OBJECTIVE: A quantitative effect of the hypothermia treatment was made on the cranial-cavity deformation with the increasing intracranial pressure (ICP). METHORDS: Finite element software-ANSYS was used to construct a human cranial cavity model, and simulate the deformations with and without hypothermia treatment. RESULTS: The deformation of the cranial-cavity model with hypothermia treatment is 0.56% less on average than the results without hypothermia treatment. CONCLUSION: The influence of hypothermia on the cranial-cavity deformation should be considered in clinical situations.

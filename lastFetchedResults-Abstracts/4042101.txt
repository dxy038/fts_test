The Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI) has initiated the development of a 5 T HTS insert magnet system. The objective of this program is the design and fabrication of HTS insert magnet for GHz class LTS/HTS NMR applications. Compact and efficient HTS magnet system is designed to be inserted into 15 T conduction-cooled superconducting magnet with 100 mm room-temperature bore. In this paper, the status of the HTS insert magnet development in KBSI is presented. The design issues of the 5 T HTS insert magnet including 2G HTS conductor properties with additional reinforcement and insulation, coil configuration with supporting structures, magnetic winding and bending stress-strain, detect and activate protection, and spatial and temporal field performance are discussed. In addition, the design of cryostat for 5 T HTS insert magnet is presented.

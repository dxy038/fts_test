In the paper, particle gradient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (PGMOEA) on GPU is presented. PGMOEA extends the classical particle dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm by incorporating the gradient information of each particle from evolutionary programming. We perform experiments to compare PGMOEA on GPU with PGMOEA on CPU and demonstrate that PGMOEA on GPU is much more effective and efficient than PGMOEA on CPU.

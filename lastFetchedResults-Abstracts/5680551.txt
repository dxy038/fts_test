A series of multi-objective <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> design problems are considered in this paper. The problems are formulated as a number of coupled <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> design problems. These <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> problems can be formulated as sensitivity problems, complementary sensitivity problems, or control sensitivity problems for every output (or input) in the system. It turns out that these multi-objective <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> design problems, based on a number of different types of sensitivity problems, can be exactly decoupled into k <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>&#8734;</sub> sensitivity problems for stable systems, where k is the number of outputs (for unstable systems, independent stabilization is required).

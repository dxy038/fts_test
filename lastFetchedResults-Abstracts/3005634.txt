The performance of a scheduled cdma2000 reverse link is evaluated. Scheduling allows for trading-off system throughput and fairness. In our algorithm, the base station prioritizes the requests received from the mobiles and schedules mobiles by greedy filling the available rise-over-thermal (RoT) noise. The scheme provides for time division scheduling gains, while maximizing available RoT utilization. The choice of prioritizing function is driven by the objective of maximizing the throughput by exploiting the link condition of the mobile, reducing interference to the neighboring cells and providing fairness to all mobiles.

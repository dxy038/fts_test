This paper considers the problem of nonlinear H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering for sampled-data systems with nonlinear time-varying parameter uncertainty. The objective is to design a dynamic filter such that the ratio between the energy of the estimation errors and the energy of the exogenous inputs is minimized or guaranteed to be less or equal to a prescribed value for all admissible uncertainties. The connection between the robust nonlinear H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering and the nonlinear H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering problem for sampled-data system without uncertainty has been established. This connection enables us to solve the robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering problem via recently developed nonlinear H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering technique in terms of both continuous and discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equations

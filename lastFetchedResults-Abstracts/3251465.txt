Input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) inverter system is very suitable for high input voltage and high output current power conversion applications. The control objective of the system is to achieve input voltage sharing (IVS) and output current sharing (OCS) among the constituent modules. Aiming at the target, this paper presents a novel compound control strategy, i.e., the method entitled input voltage sharing combined with the same inductor current amplitude. In the proposed scheme, the phase of inductor current and accordingly the active power of each module are regulated by IVS loop based on the deviation between input voltage of respective module and average input voltage. And meanwhile, the amplitude of each inductor current is kept the same and so the OCS is realized. Furthermore, a new solution dedicated to distributed configuration is put forward, and the communications among the modules are realized through three buses. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the control strategy and the distributed configuration.

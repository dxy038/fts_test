Using new approaches to optimize the process of power transmission line routing can solve many complex problems which power transmission line routing decision-makers are faced. Due to the expansion of involved parameters we can consider multi-objective evolutionary algorithms as appropriate method in this area. In this thesis with using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II and offered suitable genetic operators, the power line routing has been optimized. In consultation with experts in Ministry of Energy and Mazandaran Regional Electric Company, it was designed three objective functions to build routs with following characteristics: F1-Minimum cost, F2- Minimum environmental and social effects and F3- easy accessibility and maintenance of transmission lines. Implementation and evaluation of developed model embed in Geospatial information system (GIS) represent that model have high capability to optimize the objective functions. This model tested and evaluated in Mazandaran province-IRAN, between two power-post 400KV Hasankeif (in Kelardasht City) and Narivaran (in Amol City). The obtained result shows a 15 percent improvement on average in objective function compared with the existing power transmission line.

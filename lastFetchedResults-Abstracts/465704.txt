Objective: This study was undertaken to examine the effects of prenatal betamethasone administration on corticosteroid-binding globulin concentrations in maternal and fetal plasma and amniotic fluid. Study Design: Two groups of patients with preterm labor at 24 to 35 weeks’ gestation who were receiving prenatal betamethasone (2 intramuscular doses of 12 mg) were studied. Maternal plasma was obtained before and at variable intervals until 1 week after betamethasone administration. Umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid samples were collected at the time of delivery. Samples were also collected from patients at risk for preterm delivery who did not receive glucocorticoids. Results: Betamethasone suppressed maternal cortisol concentration by >70% within 24 hours of injection but did not significantly alter corticosteroid-binding capacity or relative concentrations of corticosteroid-binding globulin isoforms in either maternal or umbilical cord plasma. Betamethasone reduced corticosteroid-binding capacity in amniotic fluid within 24 hours of injection, and values remained suppressed 1 week after treatment. Conclusion: Maternal and fetal plasma corticosteroid-binding globulin concentrations were unchanged after maternal betamethasone administration at 24 to 32 weeks’ gestation but amniotic fluid corticosteroid-binding globulin concentrations decreased significantly, suggesting different sites of either corticosteroid-binding globulin production or regulation or both.

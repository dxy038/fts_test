This study uses a dynamic multi-objective programming approach to establish a risk assessment model, and develops an iterative algorithm for the model solution. The results obtained show that the sum of the interactive utility value could determine whether or not the interactive relationship is characterized by independence among negotiators. In addition, our numerical example shows that the risk measurement model developed can reflect risk assessment made by the negotiation group for certain events, and can analyze interaction characteristics among negotiators.

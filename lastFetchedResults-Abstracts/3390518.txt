In this paper, we consider a class of envelope-constrained filters with uncertain input (ECUI). The ECUI problem was first formulated as a nonsmooth optimization problem. Recently, it was shown that a nonsmooth optimization problem of this type is, in fact, equivalent to a standard quadratic mathematical programming problem. Thus, it admits a unique solution which can be obtained efficiently by the standard techniques. The objective of this paper is to investigate several issues relating to the sensitivity of ECUI filters. They are: i) the output mask tolerance, and ii) the effect of the order of ECUI filters on the output mask tolerance. Theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulation studies

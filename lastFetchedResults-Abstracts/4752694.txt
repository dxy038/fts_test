In current data centers, an application (e.g. MapReduce) usually generates a collection of parallel flows sharing a common goal. These flows compose a coflow and only completing them all is meaningful. Accordingly, minimizing the average coflow completion time (CCT) becomes a critical objective for flow scheduling. In this topic, the state-of-the-art centralized method, Varys, achieves a good average CCT; but it has the scalability problem. Alternatively, the only existing decentralized method, Baraat, suffers from the head-of-line blocking problem. To solve these problems, we propose D-CAS, a preemptive, decentralized, coflow-aware scheduling system in this paper. D-CAS pursues coflow-level remaining-time-first (MRTF) principle by leveraging a simple negotiation mechanism between each coflowÂ´s data senders and receivers. As the MRTF principle is inherently preemptive and proven to be a near-optimal guideline to minimize average CCT, D-CAS avoids the head-of-line blocking problem and gets good performances. Through extensive simulations, we find that D-CAS achieves a performance close to Varys (gap &lt; 15%) and outperforms Baraat significantly (about 1.4&#8211;4&#215;).

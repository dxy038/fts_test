This paper presents an approach for optimal operation of distribution networks considering distributed generators (DGs). Due to private ownership of DGs, a cost based compensation method is used to encourage DGs in active and reactive power generation. The objective function is summation of electrical energy generated by DGs and substation bus (main bus). A particle swarm optimization is used to solve the optimal operation problem. The approach is tested on an IEEE34 buses distribution feeder

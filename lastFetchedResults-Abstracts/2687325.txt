The Wells turbine is a bidirectional air turbine which operates efficiently over a restricted range of air flow. The optimization of its efficiency requires control of rotational velocity in order to maintain the ratio between airflow and tip speed within the high efficiency range. This paper introduces two generator control strategies that optimize the power take-off efficiency for low inertia turbine systems in which instantaneous control of the turbine air flow to tip speed ratio is a realistic goal. The first control strategy requires measurement of turbine rotational speed and air chamber pressure, and the second strategy removes the requirement for air pressure measurement. The implementation issues associated with this level of control are examined and the simulation results are validated in an experimental test rig.

Introduction & Objective : Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit both cyclooxygenase-1(cox-1) and cyclooxygenase - 2 (cox-2) are widely used to treat pain and inflammation. However, their use is Limited by gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. So, selective cox-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib have been developed. This study was conducted to determine the incidence of GI side effects with celecoxib among two groups of patients (first without and second with a history of GI disease) at the polyclinic of NIOC Medical and Health Orgnization in Shiraz.
Materials & Methods: 145 patients who celecoxib were prescribed for, were subject of our cohort study . Data were collected by the questionnaires which contained the information such as age, sex, history of GI diseases, etc. Further information such as G1 side effects was added to the questionnaires after treatment. A total of 114 patients consisted of 82 women and 32 men completed the study. The first group consisted of 52 patients and the second group of 62 patients.
Results : 26% of patients reported GI adverse effects. 21% of patients in the first group and 31% of the second group had GI side effects. The incidence of GI adverse effects between two groups didn't reach statistical significance.
Conclusion : Since the use of celecoxib was associated with some GI adverse effects in more than one-forth of the patients, its dose, history or having a GI disease and concomitant use of other medicine which may cause GI disorders must be considered when prescribing celecoxib.

The objective of the present work was to prepare heterojunctions in the 3C-6H system and to investigate their characteristics. The heteroepitaxy was carried out using sublimation epitaxy (SE) in an open system. The presence of 3C-SiC in the deposited structures was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The p-n junction parameters were investigated from current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements, electroluminescence spectrum and DLTS data.

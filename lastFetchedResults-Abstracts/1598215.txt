The principal aim of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using gradient-based approximation methods for the optimisation of the spring and damper characteristics of an off-road vehicle, for both ride comfort and handling. The Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm and the relatively new Dynamic-Q method are the two successive approximation methods used for the optimisation. The determination of the objective function value is performed using computationally expensive numerical simulations that exhibit severe inherent numerical noise. The use of forward finite differences and central finite differences for the determination of the gradients of the objective function within Dynamic-Q is also investigated. This is done in investigating methods for overcoming the difficulties associated with the optimisation of noisy objective functions.

eational off-road vehicle is modelled in ADAMS, and coupled to MATLAB for the execution of the optimisation process. The full vehicle ADAMS model includes suspension kinematics, a load-dependent tyre model, as well as non-linear springs and dampers. Up to four design variables are considered in modelling the suspension characteristics.

found that both algorithms perform well in optimising handling. However, difficulties are encountered in obtaining improvements in the design process when ride comfort is considered. Nevertheless, meaningful design configurations are still achievable through the proposed optimisation process, at a relatively low cost in terms of the number of simulations that have to be performed.

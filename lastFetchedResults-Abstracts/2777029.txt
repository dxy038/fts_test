A recent solution to tackle environmental issues is the electrification of transportation. Effective integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the grid is important in the process of achieving sustainable development. One of the key solutions regarding the need for charging stations is the installation of PEV parking lots (PLs). However, contrary to common parkings, PLs are constrained by various organizations such as municipalities, urban traffic regulators, and electrical distribution systems. Therefore, this paper aims to allocate PLs in distribution systems with the objective of minimizing system costs including power loss, network reliability, and voltage deviation as possible objectives. A two-stage model has been designed for this purpose. PLsÂ´ behavior considering market interactions is optimized at the first stage to provide profit to the PL owner. At the second stage, the PL allocation problem is solved considering various network constraints. Conclusions are duly drawn with a realistic example.

This paper proposes a new method for probabilistic transmission network expansion planning with Controlled Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (CNSGA-II) of multi-objective meta-heuristics (MOMH). Recently, power networks increase the degree of uncertainties due to new environment of power network liberations, the emergence of renewable energy, etc. As a result, the importance of improving power supply reliability has been recognized. In this paper, a new method is proposed for probabilistic transmission network expansion planning. The proposed method solves a multi-objective optimization problem that optimizes probabilistic reliability criterion EENS as well as the construction cost to obtain a set of the Pareto solutions in Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The effectiveness of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus system.

Objective
We evaluated whether statins, in view of their anti-inflammatory properties, may effectively prevent the onset or modulate the severity of muscle wasting during cancer cachexia.
Methods
Simvastatin was administered to rats bearing the Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepatoma, a well-studied cytokine-dependent experimental model of cancer cachexia.
Results
Quite surprisingly, the drug negatively affected the wasting pattern induced by the AH-130 hepatoma. In fact, the administration of simvastatin to tumor hosts induced a further weight reduction of all the tissues examined except for the soleus, in the absence of significant effects of simvastatin on tumor growth or on food intake. No effects were observed after simvastatin administration in control animals, with the exception of a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in heart weight.
Conclusions
Simvastatin administration, although capable of negatively modulating the inflammatory response, did not prevent muscle wasting in this experimental model of cancer cachexia. Moreover, the further muscle loss observed in simvastatin-treated tumor-bearing animals suggests that a note of caution should be introduced in treating cancer patients with statins in view of the possible occurrence of harmful side effects.

The error concealment is an important technique in the video transmission that can assure the reconstruction video quality and can efficiently recovery the data loss and the data errors in the transmission process caused by the transmission environment, thus improve the subjective quality of the video received in the end. In order to enhance the error resilience of AVS-P2 standard, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive temporal-spatial error concealment method based on the redundancy motion vectors. To conceal a lost block, we use the spatial error concealment for the I-frame macroblocks, and use the temporal error concealment for the non-I-frame macroblocks. At the same time, according to the motion intensity of the macroblocks, we use the default error concealment and based on redundancy motion vectors error concealment method, respectively. Lastly, we realize the algorithm on the platform of the AVS-P2 RM52; the simulations results show that the proposed method is significantly better than the existing techniques in terms of both objective and subjective quality of reconstruction video.

In recent years, the influence of power shortage on the economic growth has attracted attention of the government departments and the academic community. To avoid the bias from the true value in data collecting process, we introduce the concept of grey numbers in this paper to make the depiction of phenomena objective. We analyze the efficiency of regional electricity input-output by means of data envelopment analysis from the standpoint of efficiency. Results show: the central and western regions of China have high energy consumption in per output unit, with the western regions the highest and the eastern regions lower; almost every region of China has rarely made full use of its power input, with the western regions the worst. It is consistent with the conclusion that ChinaÂ´s economic development is accompanied by high energy consumption. Hence, for the sustainable and safe development of China, it is an emergency for relative departments to develop policies to make effective use of limited resources.

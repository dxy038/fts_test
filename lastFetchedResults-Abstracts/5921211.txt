The objective of this study is to induce chondrogensis in primary bovine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and determine the effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) delivery on the resulting chondrocyte population. Chondrogenesis was initiated by TGF-&#946;3 delivery over 8 days, and IGF-1 was delivered from days 9 through 13. Gene expression of chondrogenic markers (sox9, type II collagen, and aggrecan) was quantified throughout the culture period to determine differentiation potential based on temporal growth factor delivery. Results indicate that TGF-&#946;3 treatment followed by IGF-1 treatment is effective for upregulating chondrogenic markers in MSCs.

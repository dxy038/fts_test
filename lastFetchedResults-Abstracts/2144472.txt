The main objective of ecosystem health management is to preserve the capacity of ecosystems to respond to disturbances and future changes. We proposed a set of ecological indicators for coastal ecosystem health assessment using physical stressors such as total suspended matter, chemical stressors including nutrients and heavy metal pollutants, community structure metrics including species richness, diversity and evenness, and ecosystem level eco-exergy indicators. The results of our case study indicate that the health status of the Jiangsu coastal ecosystem is limited by environmental stressors and factors that affect the community species diversity. The health status of nektonic and benthic communities is reflected by water quality and sediment physicochemical properties, respectively. The results of our case study demonstrate that the integrated ecological health indicator system can provide a comprehensive assessment that corresponds with the current health of coastal ecosystems and a reliable theoretical basis for regional coastal management.

The objective of this paper is build upon prior research [1], to provide some new perspectives in explaining how Information Technology (IT) can create a sustained competitive advantage (SCA) and supply chain quality management (SCQM) capabilities for the firm. The result shows that most of IT resources are positively related with SCQM capabilities and firm performance. Especially, the outside-in and spanning resources are more likely to achieve better supply chain quality capabilities and provide a SCA for firm performance.

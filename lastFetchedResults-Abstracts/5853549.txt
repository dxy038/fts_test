This paper presents a block receding horizon control based on multi-objective optimization (BRHCBGA) for reheated steam temperature system. The proposed control algorithm incorporates (1) a block scheme which is multiple step of the optimized input is applied instead of a single value; (2) a new specific performance index is put forward for the reheated steam temperature control system; (3) a tuning method for the block RHC based on goal attainment is used to meet the requirement for multi-object. The simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the control method and the tuning strategy.

The paper gives a general description of the Danube waterway data management in Croatia at both national and Pan-European levels. For
these purposes, we initiated the development of a specialized geographic information system (GIS), the so-called River IS, which provides
efficient waterway related data management for the Croatian part of the Danube River. In addition, Croatian activities in the Pan-European
programme Consortium Operational Management Platform River Information Services (COMPRIS) and INTERREG project data warehouse
for the Danube waterway (D4D) are described. Focusing on how to solve the major problems identified by ‘‘GIS Forum Danube’’ expert groups,
we present our solutions for two important D4D project objectives. The first project objective concerns preparation of national GIS data of the
participating countries in the world geodetic WGS84 coordinates as well as checking the transnational compatibility of GIS data. The second
important project objective concerns the development of a commonly agreed catalogue of object types and their attributes necessary to describe
waterway related data. For example, the conversion of the Croatian national geographic data into Inland ECDIS digital navigation maps is
described

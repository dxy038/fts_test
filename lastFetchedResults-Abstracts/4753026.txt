Image fusion is a process of integrating two or more images into a single image with more details and information. The different focus images involve different details according to changing the lens of camera. Recently, the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2-D DWT) is applied widely to image processing field. A novel method is proposed for multifocus image fusion based on 2-D DWT. In order to select adapted pixels effectively from the source images, spatial frequency (SF) is adopted to choose maximum value from the high pass subbands, which decomposed using one-level 2-D DWT. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed fusion algorithm can obtain the resultant image well, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.

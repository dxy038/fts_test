Hoz-e-Soltan playa catchment area 195 km2, depth 25-50 cm, is located 85 km southwest of
Tehran. The objective of this research was to determine the paleoclimate and water table
fluctuations in Holocene through sedimentary facies studies. In this research, 9 cores
(maximum length of 7 meters) were taken from the lake substrate, and then facies
investigations, such as sedimentsâ€™ characteristics, organic matter contents, colors, crystals of
evaporative minerals and sedimentary sub-environment were determined. 155 subsamples
were prepared from different sedimentary facies, and then granulometric analysis and
mineralogy (XRD) were carried out. Results indicated that there are 5 sedimentary subenvironments,
including sand flat, mud flat, saline mud flat, salt pan and ephemeral lake in
the studied cores. On the basis of granulometry results, 5 sedimentary types were recognized
in the subsurface sediments; slight gravel-bearing sandy mud, slight gravel-bearing muddy
sand, mud, sandy mud and muddy sand. Sedimentary sub-environments of HS1 and HS2
cores are in relation to saline-mud flat and mud flat environment, respectively. Also, during
Holocene lake water table fluctuation were drown and wet and dry period sediments were
defined. Result shows that 6 major drought period exist in this region so during the last few
thousand years, the lake had wet and dry conditions. Recent climate change and global
warming doesn't serious effect on more drying of the lake; these wet and dry periods were
frequently repeated.

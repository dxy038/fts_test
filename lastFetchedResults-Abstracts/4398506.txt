With the rapid economic development, the depletion of traditional energy and environmental problems have become increasingly prominent. so, people need to find new energy to replace. Using Distributed Generation(eg: Wind and solar power)could offer efficient and clean Electric Energy. But, problems posed by power distribution system is gradually revealed when a lot of Distributed Generation(DG) access to distribution network. The main content in this paper is research of Distributed Generation on power system voltage stability and optimal allocation of DG First, in this paper researched the voltage distribution when DG accessed to distribution network by different location, operation and capacity, and then used the method of sensitivity analysis the influence of voltage, and got the conclusion by simulation examples. Second, we researched that when DG accessed to distribution network based on the system line losses, voltage stability margin and node voltage deviation as the objective function, combining fuzzy theory, converted Multi-objective to single goal, aiding to avoid that different dimensions may cause different impact. And, used particle swarm optimization for solving the problems. In order to verify the feasibility of the particle swarm optimization. In this paper used standard distribution network for simulation calculation, and got the conclusions by analyzing simulation results.

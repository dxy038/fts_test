The thesis introduces the scientific concept of highway-ecosystems, the highway-ecosystem is define as an open, dynamic, nonlinear, and complicated huge system with dissipative structures and far from equilibrium states, moreover it is a complex system of highway and ecosystem, gathering substantial cycle and ecological evolution as well as their common natural and artificial environments together. The highway ecosystem sustainable development valuation may provide the science accurate basis and suggestion for the road ecosystem further control, and conforms to the needs of sustainable development and the building the harmonious society. Aiming at the highway eco-systems of the present sustainable development, the concept of highway-ecosystems is introduced, on the basis of detailed analyze of the concepts of multidimensional space of sustainable development system, a new multi-objective comprehensive evaluation method for sustainable development is presented and a calculation formula for multi-objective comprehensive level of sustainable development. This method was used to evaluate sustainable development of Lin-Chang Expressway. This method possessed definite theoretical value and reliability in practice.

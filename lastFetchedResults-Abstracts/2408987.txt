Accurate crude oil measurement at the metering station is one of main aims in an oil
export terminal. The main objective is to decrease or remove any error at the metering
station. It is found that crude oil temperature at metering station has significant effects
on measured volume and may cause big uncertainty at the metering point, as crude oil
flows through the pipeline pick up the solar radiation and heat up. This causes the
crude oil temperature at the metering point to rise and higher uncertainty to be created.
The amount of temperature rise depends on the main pipeline flow rate. In Kharg
Island, there is about a 3 km distance between crude oil storage tanks and the metering
point. The crude oil flows through the pipeline due to gravity effects as storage tanks
are located 60m higher than the metering point. The flow rate could be controlled by
the appropriate valves. In this study, based on the climate and geographical conditions
of Kharg Island, the temperature at the metering point has been calculated and the
effects of main pipe line flow rate have been investigated. Further, the uncertainty in
the measurement system due to temperature rise has been studied

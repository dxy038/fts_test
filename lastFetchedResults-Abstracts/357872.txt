Objective We investigated the associations between heart rate recovery after exercise (as a suggested measure of vagal activity), heart rate variability, and measurements of the insulin resistance syndrome. Material and Methods  Seventy men aged 70 years were examined with a symptom-limited bicycle exercise test, a 24-hour heart rate variability test, and different measurements of different components of the insulin resistance syndrome. Results Heart rate recovery after exercise (mean ± SD 20 ± 9 beats during the first minute) was related to both the SD of the R-R interval and the low frequency power at the heart rate variability analyses (r = 0.39, P  < .002 for both). Furthermore, heart rate recovery after exercise was related to insulin sensitivity at the hyperinsulinemic eugleucemic clamp (r = 0.28, P  < .03), and to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and exercise capacity, and inversely to obesity and insulin and glucose levels 2 hours after an oral glucose load (P  < .05 for all). Heart rate recovery after exercise was not related to left ventricular mass measured by means of echocardiography or to the number of ventricular premature complexes at a 24-hour Holter recording. Conclusion Heart rate recovery 1 minute after exercise was related to measurements of 24-hour heart rate variability. Furthermore, heart rate recovery after exercise was related to several of the major components of the insulin resistance syndrome, thereby establishing a link between this syndrome and cardiac autonomic nervous activity.

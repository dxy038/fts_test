During the last few years, the cdma2000&#174; cellular system has undergone a major enhancement within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2. The objective of this enhancement was to improve the bandwidth efficiency of the cdma2000 system by creating a new set of high-speed packet data channels, the forward packet data channel and the reverse packet data channel. This new set of high-speed packet data channels utilize technologies such as fast packet scheduling, hybrid automatic repeat request, and adaptive modulation and coding. This article discusses the performance evaluation aspect of the high-speed packet enhancement of cdma2000 revisions C and D, the so-called 1&#215;EV-DV system. Insights into how the performance evaluations of cdma2000 revisions C and D were conducted, and the results of these evaluations are discussed.

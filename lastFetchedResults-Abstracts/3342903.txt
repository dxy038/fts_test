When a magnetostrictive actuator (MA) is designed, it is general to use a bias magnetic field for various purposes. One of them is to design a bidirectional MA. It is also expected that the performance of the MA can be fully utilized. The way to impose the bias magnetic field can be classified into the use of a solenoid or a permanent magnet (PM). The PM is preferred to the solenoid due to volume of the actuator, generated heat, etc.

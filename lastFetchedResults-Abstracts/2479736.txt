The technology of magnetic water has been widely studied and adopted in the field of agriculture in many countries. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of magnetic water on germination and vegetative growth of two varieties of tomato (lycopercicum esculentum) seeds. A factorial experiment in completely randomized design was carried out using three replications, in 2014. Based on the results, seeds irrigated with magnetic water exhibited marked increases in rate of germination, vegetative growth, vigor index, root length, seedling length, seedling fresh weight and chemical constituents i.e. photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids), over the control. Percentage of germination for seeds irrigated with magnetized water was 94.6 for the two varieties, while for the control it was 90 and 93 in Sunseed and Sudin, respectively. Results indicated that irrigation with magnetized water induced positive significant effect on all studied parameters. It appears that utilization of magnetized water may lead to improved quantity and quality of tomato production.

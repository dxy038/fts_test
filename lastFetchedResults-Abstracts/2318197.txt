Soil erosion and sediment transport is an important issue in many Iranian watersheds. ‎Watershed planning without accurate estimates of erosion and sediment yield with appropriate ‎models is not possible. The objective of this study was evaluating of two common empirical ‎models of MPSIAC and EPM. First, 10 small watersheds were selected in Western ‎Azerbaijan Province, with several consecutive check dams on their streams implemented ‎under watershed management projects. No flow over the last downstream check dam was ‎considered as the main criterion in each selected basin. In addition to the direct measurement ‎of sediment deposited behind the dams, sediment yield of watersheds were estimated using the ‎models. Comparison of means using (Mann-Whithney) did not show any significant ‎difference at 0.05 percent level between measured and estimated data. At final step, both ‎models were tested by MAE and MBE statistics. The MPSIAC showed better performance ‎than EPM with MAE=1.34 and MBE =-0.12.‎

Background: Milk is long being known to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and potentially beneficial

for bone health particularly among Iranian populations where consumption of dairy production is

Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to assess the physiological effect of milk consumption on bone mass density (BMD) and prevention of osteoporosis in adult girls. Methods: This investigation was performed on twenty non-athlete thin and obese girls. BMD and blood parameters were measured by routine laboratory tests at the beginning and two months later. Both groups received two glasses of semi-skimmed milk (1.5% fat; 600 mg/dl calcium) three times a week for a total duration of 2 months.

Findings: The study findings showed that the BMD of hip and spinal cord (L2-L4) significantly increased in both groups after 2 months (p<0.05).

Conclusion: According to our data, consumption of two glasses of milk 3 times a week could remarkably increase the BMD in adult girls hence, it could be concluded that the frequent consumption of milk by both thin and obese girls can reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

Course outcomes (CO) or course learning outcomes is a practice used as a method of assessment on accumulated knowledge, skills, or attitudes gained in a learning process. A clear set of final learning expectations usually exposed to students at the beginning of the course and these expectations should be correlated to assessment methods. However, assessments of the achievement of course outcomes usually just rely on grades. This paper manipulates a Rasch-based measurement model as assessment tool to measure the CO. An overview of the measurement model and its key concepts were presented and illustrated. For this paper, all assessment methods applicable to the course KP3423- Facilities Planning &amp; Material Handling are manipulated to achieve the objective which includes final exam, midterm exam, integrated project and assignments. An assessment form using BloomÂ´s Taxonomy as parameter was initially designed showing each dimension of the ability to be measured. The results show that Rasch model of measurement can classify grades into learning course outcomes more accurately especially in dealing with small number of sampling unit.

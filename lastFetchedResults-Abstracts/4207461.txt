We adopt multi-point planning method based on cubic spline function to perform parametric design of dynamic walking. The objective of optimization is to achieve maximum ZMP stability and minimum joint driving torque, together with the combination of multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the gait parameters. Simulation verification has also been carried out in ADAMS and Matlab after optimization. In addition, we tested dynamic walking on kid humanoid robot platform, by which the realization of dynamic and steady walking of physical prototype further proves the validity of the theoretical research. Moreover, weÂ´ve made a preliminary study on the planning method of performing complex actions such as push-ups, by which the realization of scheduled actions through simulation and physical prototype experiments also proved the rationality of the planning.

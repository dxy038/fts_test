Dealing with municipal solid waste (MSW) is a worldwide challenge. When planning a MSW management system, conflicting objectives, i.e., the minimization of system operating costs and environmental risks, the maximization of resource utilization and equity, have to be simultaneously considered. The optimum solution for one objective is always not a good choice for another. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) for optimum waste management solution based upon a multi-objective dynamic logistics model. The DSS consists of a conceptual framework and the corresponding mathematical formulation. These have been further illustrated through a fictional example presented in the end of the paper.

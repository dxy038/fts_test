Results: Questionnaires were used to evaluate the systems in 50 percent of the studies. Questionnaires were distributed among study population in 42 percent of the studies. In 50 percent of the studies the information was collected by means of interviews, observations and the review of patientsâ€™ documents and records. With the exception of one study, all studies used quantitative methods and were summative.

Background&Objective: Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy it's about 5-7 percent in pregnants and it may complicate mother or fetus which ends with death. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the protein / creatinine ratio in prediction of 24-hour urine total among women with suspected preeclampsia.
Materials&Metbods: 60 women who were evaluated for suspected preeclampsia at ?24 weeks of gestation were studied prospectively in Deziani hospital Gorgan. There was no concurrent or preexisting systemic disease. They were undergoing a 24-hour urine collection for the determination of proteinuria. A single voided urine specimen was obtained after completion of the 24-hour urine collection and analyzed for the P/C ratio.
Results: The random urinary protein to creatinine ratios is strongly associated with the 24-hour total protein excretion (P<0.05, r 4l.75). The best cut off of 0.5 yielder a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 100%.
Conclusion: The random urinary protein to creatinine ratio could replace the 24-hour urine collection as a simple, faster more useful method for the diagnosis of significant protenuria.

This paper presents a new adaptive post-filtering algorithm for blocking and ringing artifact reduction. The proposed method extracts local statistics and constructs an edge map of the image. Based on the edge map information, blocking and ringing artifacts are detected, and then reduced by an edge map guided filter. The proposed method specifically targets the blocking artifacts at the block boundaries and ringing artifacts close to edges. Therefore, the algorithm is able to preserve sharp edges and details, while reducing the artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed post-filtering algorithm achieves better subjective and objective results compared with other methods. Also, the algorithm has very low complexity.

In order to achieve the dense-wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) in bidirectional optical transmission systems, we present a beat-frequency-locking method to stabilize the relative channel frequency offset between two communicating nodes. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate a bidirectional DWDM transmission having 50-GHz channel spacing in both 2.5- and 10-Gb/s bit rates.

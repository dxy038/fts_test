Few practical building structures can be modeled as planar structures, but in most of the research work on structural vibration control, only two-dimensional plane structural modeling has been considered, rendering these methods ineffective for the majority of practical building structures. This paper discusses multiobjective optimal design of an absorber system for torsionally coupled seismically excited buildings. This absorber system consists of four TMDs arranged in such a way that the system can control the torsional mode of vibration effectively in addition to the flexure modes. Nondimensionalized peak displacement, acceleration and rotation of the structure about its vertical axis have been considered as the three objective functions for multiobjective optimal design of the absorber system. A multiobjective version of the genetic algorithm has been used to obtain the design parameters of the absorber system.

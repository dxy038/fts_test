This paper reports on a study undertaken within the CEPT SE42 project team, with the objective of deriving regulatory radiation limits which mitigate the impact of adjacent-channel interference from fixed/mobile communication network base stations (BSs) in the Digital Dividend spectrum (790-862 MHz) to digital terrestrial television (DTT) services below 790 MHz. A novel stochastic approach for the calculation of BS block-edge mask (BEM) out-of-block (or baseline) limits is presented. Results indicate that, for a typical BS in-block EIRP of 59 dBm/(10 MHz) or greater, the fraction of locations in which a DTT receiver would suffer unacceptable levels of interference does not improve significantly with a reduction in the BS BEM baseline EIRP limit below 0 dBm/(8 MHz). This is due to the finite frequency selectivity of the DTT receivers. It is also shown that for in-block EIRPs below 59 dBm, the baseline EIRP limit should be reduced proportionately in order for the DTT location failure rate to be broadly independent of the communication network deployment geometry.

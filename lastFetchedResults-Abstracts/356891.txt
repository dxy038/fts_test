Objective To determine the short-term safety and tolerability of the addition of ecadotril to conventional therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Methods  Fifty ambulatory patients, 18 to 75 years of age, with mild to moderate heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤35%, taking stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretics, and optionally digoxin were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study of ecadotril 50 to 400 mg twice daily versus conventional therapy alone. Results:  No increases in deaths, serious adverse events, or dropouts from adverse events were observed for the ecadotril group compared with placebo. The serum measures of neurohormonal activation were highly variable. Changes in signs and symptoms of heart failure, New York Heart Association class, and patient self-assessment of symptoms were not observed with ecadotril therapy; however, the study was not designed to detect differences in these parameters. Conclusion  In this small pilot study, ecadotril in doses of 50 to 400 mg twice daily was generally well-tolerated and without severe short-term adverse effects in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Evaluation of the clinical efficacy and long-term safety of ecadotril and other neutral endopeptidase inhibitors in patients with heart failure requires further study. (Am Heart J 1999;138:1140-8.)

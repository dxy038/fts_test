The authors aim to develop a generalized model of a data structure which would serve to collect the necessary billing data for an arbitrarily complex broadband session. The generalized nature of the model data structure would achieve the objective of service independence and in that sense be reusable. They discuss some issues which arise in the context of billing. In order to produce the data structure model, they show it is necessary to first develop a model of an arbitrary broadband network session

This paper aims at developing a well-balanced performance framework for measuring the effects of e-government and designing the selection process to e-governmentpsilas KPI as reflecting the governmentpsilas strategies and goals. These methods measure effectively visible and invisible effects from the post e-governmentpsilas projects. To accomplish the purposes of this study, we applied the general success factors of e-government and the concept of KPI. The performance framework consists of three perspectives; process efficiency, service quality, and information resource management, which comprehensively cover the fields of its effect. Also we develop the selection process of KPI composed of analyze, gather, screen, and redesign in order to screen the objective fitted KPI. Following the selection process, we can validate whether the KPI is suitable for the strategies and goals. This present study will lay the groundwork for continuous improvement of the e-governmentpsilas performance.

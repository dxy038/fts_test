In this paper, a five-parameter statistic model of spectral Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which contains both of specular and diffuse reflection factors, is introduced for space target surface material. The optimal five parameters of the model at different wavelength are independently retrieved by using simulated annealing algorithm (SAA). An absolute measurement method of BRDF data is presented. A spectral radiation meter with 3nm resolution and a three-dimensional rotating system with 0.01&#176; accuracy are utilized to establish the automatic measurement platform. The spectral BRDF data of typical space target sample (silver tinfoil) is measured in the range of 380-2500nm. The modeling results are coincided with the measured results, which verifies the validity of five-parameter statistic model.

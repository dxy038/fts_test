The utility of NOAA NDVI data for the classification of wide areas has been demonstrated in several occasions. Few tests, however, have been performed in relatively small, complex regions such as Tuscany (Central Italy). This objective has been pursued in the present study using an integrated data set composed of LAC NDVI and thermal infrared images and ancillary data. A specific methodology has been developed to obtain an unsupervised classification of the region describing the main eco-phenological features. In particular, a procedure has been devised to identify the number of classes optimal for the study data set. The best results have been obtained with a classification in ten categories, which shows many interesting details consistent with previous knowledge and existing cartography

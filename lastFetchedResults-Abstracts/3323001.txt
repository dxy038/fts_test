This paper presents a multi-objective output-feedback H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf> synthesis framework with non-common Lyapunov variables (NCLV´s) for continuous-time systems, and clearly summarized the numerical algorithms for controller design. This H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf> synthesis framework is less conservative than the traditional one with common Lyapunov variables (CLV´s). Although the computation of this new method is more time-consuming, the controller obtained remains the same order as the one designed by the traditional method. Furthermore, this framework is ready to be extended to a more general multi-objective framework with slight changes. The advantage of this framework is illustrated by a numerical example.

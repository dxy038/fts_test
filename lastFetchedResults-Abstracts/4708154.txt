Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease mainly injuring white matter. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can improve the detection and quantification of MS. The objective of this study was to observe that whether there is a certain pattern in the changes of texture features in NAWM surrounding the MS lesions. The results corroborate the point. A new method of radiation growth to the segmentation of MS lesions was applied in this study. These results may be of value to further studies on predicting MS.

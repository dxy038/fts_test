Tooth bleaching is receiving an increasing interest by patients and dentists since it is a relatively non-invasive approach for whitening and lightening teeth. Instrument designed for tooth color measurements and visual assessment with commercial shade guides are nowadays used to evaluate the tooth color. However, the degree of color change after tooth bleaching varied substantially among studies and currently, there are no objective guidelines to predict the effectiveness of a tooth bleaching treatment. Fuzzy logic is a well known paradigm for data modelling; their main advantage is their ability to provide an interpretable set of rules that can be later used by the scientists. However these models have the problem that the global approximation optimization can lead to a deficient rule local modelling. This work proposes a modified fuzzy model that performs a simultaneous global and local modelling. This property is reached thanks to a special partitioning of the input space in the fuzzy system. The proposed approach is used to approximate a set of color measurements taken after a bleaching treatment using the pre-bleaching measurements. The system uses as rule antecedents the colorimetric values of the VITA commercial shade guide. The expected post-bleaching colorimetric values are immediately obtained from the local models (rules) of the system thanks to the proposed modified fuzzy model. Additionally, these post-bleaching CIELAB coordinate values have been associated with VITA shades through the evaluation of their respective membership functions, approximating which VITA shades are expected after the treatment for each pre-bleaching VITA shade.

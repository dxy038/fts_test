Tremendous penetration of renewable energy in electric networks, despite its valuable opportunities, such as balancing reserve and ancillary service, has raised concerns for network operators. Such concern stems from grid operating conditions. Such huge penetration can lead to violation in the grid requirements, such as voltage and current limits. This paper proposes an optimization method for determining the number of photovoltaic (PV) panels together with their arrangement in the grid in order to maximize ancillary service, without violating grid operation limits. The proposed optimization method is based on genetic algorithm. To do so, single-objective and multi-objective optimization have been considered. The proposed method is implemented on a model of a part of a Danish distribution grid to verify its effectiveness. The simulation results prove the viability of the method, while keeping the grid requirements within standard operating limits.

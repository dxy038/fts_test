Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The study population consisted of veterans and their families, including parents, spouses and their children. Participants were recruited from Veterans and Martyrs Affairs Foundation by random sampling and 1016 veterans and heir families participated in the study.  Three areas of satisfaction with the use of supplemental health insurance including pharmacy, location (distance) and refund services were studied. Likert scale was used in order to rate the satisfaction of the respondents.
Results: Veterans have been used pharmaceutical care more than their families 65.1% (n=661). Most of the users were male 69.8% (n=710). The average disability rate was 19.13(SD=14.13). Among the study population (n=747) 73.4 % have received their medications by their supplemental health insurance. Of those who had to pay for their prescription (269 cases), 41.6% (n=112) applied for refund from the supplemental health insurance company. The data analysis indicated that participants were satisfied or very satisfied with pharmacy (93.6%), location/distance (82.5%) and supplemental health insurance refund services (31.5%). Veterans with higher disability rate (higher than 25%) had lower satisfaction (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Overall veteran and their families were satisfied. However, the satisfaction with refund services was low.

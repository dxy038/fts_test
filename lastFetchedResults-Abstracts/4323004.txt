With respect to the difference and complementarity of the probability distribution on the time and space, which is between system load and output power of intermittent distributed generation (DG), such as distributed wind generation (DWG), solar photovoltaic (PV), by dividing time into section and considering the probability distribution of intermittent distributed generation and system load in each time-section, the optimum allocation model is built by using chance-constrained programming method. Taking the optimum comprehensive benefit of investment and the sale of electricity, the system loss reduction, voltage quality and the best overall efficiency of emission reductions as objective function, the discrete variables-friendly genetic algorithm is chosen for optimum solution. The numerical results show that optimum allocation model in this paper has taken sufficient consideration of the difference and complementarity of the probability distribution on the time and space between system load and output power of intermittent DG. And the model also gives a relatively all-round reflection of comprehensive operating benefit of economy, environment and voltage quality after intermittent DGÂ´s injection into the system, which helps to testify its rationality and validity.

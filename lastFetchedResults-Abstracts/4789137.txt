Construction site layout is multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. However, the previous researchers treated site layout as a single objective optimization problem, which is far away from the reality. In this study, site layout was treated as MOO problem. The two objective functions are minimizing the likelihood of accidents happened and total handling cost of interaction flows between the facilities. The modified Pareto-based ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm was proposed to solve site layout problem. Moreover, fuzzy rule-based system was used to quantify the interaction flows. Finally, a case of office building was used to evaluate the modified Pareto-based ACO algorithm for solving MOO site layout problem. The results showed the feasibility and effectiveness of the modified Pareto-based ACO algorithm to solve MOO site layout problem.

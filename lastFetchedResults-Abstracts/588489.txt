Background and Objective: Adolescence is a critical period that underlies lifestyle in later periods of life. The aim of this study was evaluation of the impact of a model based intervention on lifestyle among adolescents.

Materials and Methods: A group randomized clinical trial for assessing the effect of educational intervention on 365 adolescents (192 females and 173 males) was designed. Adolescent life style questionnaire (ALQ) and a demographic scale were used for data collection. Data were collected before and two weeks after the intervention with regard to PRECEDE PROCEED model. Statistical tests such as Chi 2, independent and paired t-test were used by SPSS software version 17 for data analysis.

Results: The mean age of adolescents was 15.77 years (SD = 0.74) years. A significant increment in lifestyle score was obtained between before and after intervention among intervention groups (p < 0.01). The standard mean of physical activity among males and the standard mean of social support among females were higher than the other gender. 

Conclusion: The findings suggest that an educational intervention based on PRECEDE PROCEED model may be effective for lifestyle improvement among adolescents. In light of these findings, necessity of gender-based healthy life style education among adolescents should be considered further.

Smart antennas have emerged as one of the most promising directions in supporting maximum communication link throughput. In this paper, we have investigated the impact of smart antennas on a complex mobile network such as a railroad wireless communications system. The objective is to analyze the selection of a Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm which provides the maximum efficiency when deployed in our railroad testbeds for wireless vehicular communication. Our findings are discussed to provide an in-depth understanding of how different algorithms should be selected to support efficient network operations.

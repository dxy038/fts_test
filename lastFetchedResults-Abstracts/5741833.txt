This article presents a strategy to solve thermal unit commitment (UC) integrated with an equivalent solar battery system using Fuzzy based Quantum inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (FQEA). As a renewable power source, solar power is injected stochastically with the model. To handle the uncertainty and intermittency involved while integrating solar power and load forecasting, the trivial crisp problem formulations are modified by fuzzification. An evolutionary algorithm based on the concept and principle of quantum computation is applied to solve the UC problem. The conventional Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) is advanced by using several operators such as binary differential operator, mutation and crossover along with trivial rotation operator with a re-defined rotational angle look-up table. The QEA is further modified by introducing multi-population based scheme. The fitness function is formulated by combining the objective function, penalty function and the aggregated fuzzy membership function. The proposed FQEA is applied to UC problem in different scaled power systems up to 100 units. Provided simulation results will show the effectiveness of FQEA.

Objective: We examined the psychometric properties of the Arabic
version of the Obsessive Compulsive Beliefs Questionnaire-44 (OBQ-44)
in a sample of Kuwait University students. This questionnaire was
developed by the Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group in
order to assess belief domains believed to be crucial in the development
of obsessive compulsive symptoms.
Method: The Arabic version of the OBQ-44 was developed according to
the standard translation and back-translation methods. The Arabic
versions of the OBQ-44, the Maudsley Obsessive - Compulsive Inventory
(MOCI), and Beck Depression Inventory-Revised (BDI-II) were then
administered on a sample of 200 Kuwait University students from the
faculty of humanities chosen through random cluster sampling. Retest
was administered within a 4 week time period.
Results: The results of principle component factor analysis with varimax
rotation indicated 6 factors which overlapped to a high degree. A 3 factor
solution was chosen based on the scree plot and factor loadings which
explained 36.12% of the variance. The factors were labeled as
responsibility and threat estimation (RT), importance and control of
thought (ICT) and perfectionism/Certainty (PC). The reliability coefficient
of the three factors and the total score were assessed using three
methods: Internal consistency, Test-retest reliability and Split-half
reliability. Results showed an acceptable internal consistency for the
Arabic version of the OBQ-44. Regarding the validity of OBQ-44, the
instrument correlated with the total score of MOCI and most of its
subscales .
Conclusion: These data support the reliability and validity of the OBQ-44 in a sample of Kuwait University students

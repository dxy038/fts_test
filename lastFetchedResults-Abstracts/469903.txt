Objective
To correlate levator ani contraction strength and genital hiatus measurements with surgical failure in prolapse.
Study design
This retrospective study involved chart review for documentation of levator contraction strength, genital hiatus measurement, and recurrent pelvic floor disorders in women who underwent surgery for prolapse.
Results
The recurrent prolapse rate was 34.6%. Median follow-up interval was 5 months. Diminished levator strength was associated with recurrent prolapse (35.8% versus 0%; P = .017). A genital hiatus 5 cm or greater was associated with recurrent prolapse (44.2% vs 27.8%; P = .034). Inability to contract the levator ani was associated with urinary incontinence (35.1% vs 18.8%; P = .023). Increasing levator contraction strength was associated with a decreased reoperation rate for pelvic floor disorders, whereas genital hiatus correlated best with recurrent prolapse.
Conclusion
Diminished levator ani contraction strength and a widened genital hiatus correlate with an increase in surgical failures in the early postoperative period. These tools are useful for counseling a patient concerning surgery for prolapse.

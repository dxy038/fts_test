Objective: In developed countries, patients' factors and esthetic concerns have predominantly influenced prosthodontic treatments. The objective of this investigation was to see if such factors in local partially dentate patients influenced the clinicians' decision regarding the prostheses planned. Material & Methods: This was a descriptive study carried out in Khyber College of Dentistry, Peshawar from March to October 2007. Using a structured data collection-sheet, patient's data including gender, age, socio-economic status, educational level, oral-hygiene status, main concern of patients for consultation and the number, location and type of saddles in the jaws were all recorded. The type of prosthodontic service planned for each patient was also recorded. One investigator collected the required data from each of the 206 partially dentate patients by the method of direct interviewing. Results: Acrylic removable dental prostheses (RDPs) were more frequently provided than fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). No precision-retained or implant-supported prosthesis were planned. Irrespective of the type of prosthesis, the restoration of chewing function was the major concern of patients for consultation. Age, socioeconomic status, educational level and type of saddle in the maxilla influenced patients' treatment with RDPs. In comparison, better socioeconomic status and educational level were the reasons in case of planned FDPs. The reason for the planned FDPs in the maxilla was esthetics as compared to improvement in chewing function in case of the mandible. Conclusion: Acrylic RDPs were the most frequently planned prostheses. Patients; socioeconomic status and educational level and the type and location of saddle influenced the type of prosthesis planned for patients.

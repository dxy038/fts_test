In this paper we propose a new method of structuring of residuals for detection and fault localization by the PCA (Principal Component Analysis). This method is based on the multi-objective optimization by genetic algorithms. The principle of this approach is to maximize the sensitivity of some residuals at certain defects and simultaneously minimize the sensitivity of the remaining residuals for other defects. Numerical example is simulated to validate the proposed technique.

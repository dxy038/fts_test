With increasingly using for spacecraft applications which demand the high reliability, validating the performance of Multicore SoC is extremely important for its significant properties of over-complexity, high integration level, high processing rate and miniaturized feature size. In this paper, we discuss the objective and properties of the Multicore SoCÂ´s post-silicon performance validation base general performance validation, and proposed a method to validate a certain quad-core SoC, including forming a test bench and the flow of the test. We also take an example of validating the irradiation hardened performance of the SoC to explain the method, after analyzing the SEU, SEFI, SEL of the part base the testing data, the test result shows that the method is beneficial and effective.

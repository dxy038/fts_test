The main objective of this paper is to analyse Low Voltage Ride through capability (LVRT) of Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) in Real Time Simulation. DFIG and PMSM wind turbines consists of power electronics circuits which are modeled in detail in RSCAD software of Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) for analysis. A Sample 33kV system is considered and LVRT capability of DFIG and PMSM for different Short circuit ratios is analyzed.

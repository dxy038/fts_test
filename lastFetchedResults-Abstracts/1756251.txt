Objective
m of this study was to test which personality traits were related to quality of life (QOL) of adolescents with asthma, and whether relations between personality and QOL were mediated by coping strategies and symptom reporting.
s
le of 405 12 to 16-year-olds with asthma completed questionnaires on personality, coping, symptom reporting, and QOL (overall QOL and positive effects QOL). The direct relations between personality traits and QOL, as well as mediation pathways were tested with structural equation modeling.
s
cents high on extraversion and low on neuroticism had better overall QOL, while adolescents high on agreeableness had better positive-effects QOL. The coping strategy restricted lifestyle fully mediated the relation between extraversion and overall QOL, the relation between neuroticism and overall QOL was fully mediated by symptom reporting and the coping strategy worrying about asthma. The coping strategies positive reappraisal and hiding asthma fully mediated the relation between agreeableness and positive-effects QOL.
sion
sults show that personality is related to QOL in adolescents with asthma. These relations were fully mediated by coping and symptom reporting. This study sheds light on the underlying mechanism why personality is associated with QOL. The results of this study will help to understand what determines QOL in patients with chronic illness in general and adolescents with asthma specifically. Furthermore, the results will help to design interventions that could facilitate minimizing the negative effects of having asthma on the QOL of these adolescents.

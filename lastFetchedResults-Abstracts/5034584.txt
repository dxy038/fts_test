This paper presents the development of car navigation system for portable navigation devices and car telematics applications. The objective was to develop a system that can provide uninterrupted reliable navigation even when GPS signals are not available. The approach uses digital maps, 3D accelerometer and one gyro for directional measurements to improve positioning availability and reliability in weak signal environment and during short GPS signal outages. This system does not require vehicle installation and can be easily transferred between vehicles. Loosely coupled extended Kalman filter and probabilistic map-matching algorithm provide optimally tuned navigation solution and continuous auto calibration of inertial sensors. A real-time prototype was built. The system accuracy performance was investigated using field tests in an urban environment.

Control and Instrumentation Group at the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Thiruvananthapuram, has deployed an integrated control and monitoring system at a 210 MW thermal power plant in India. This system has all the features of an advanced Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) and in addition has support for web-based SCADA. This paper outlines and discusses the various hardware and software components used in this SCADA system. How these basic components are combined in realizing various subsystems of this SCADA like the Prediction based Superheater and Reheater Steam Temperature Control, Genetic Algorithm based Pulverized Coal Flow Soft Sensor and Wireless Monitoring of Cooling Water Pump House are also detailed. Various results obtained with this SCADA system in place are pondered upon. The main objective of this paper is to bring out the salient features of this SCADA system against the backdrop of a critical and dynamic environment as in a 210 MW coal-fired thermal power plant which expects maximum efficiency and minimum downtime from a SCADA system overseeing it.

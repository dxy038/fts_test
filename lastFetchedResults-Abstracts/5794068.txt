This paper presents a novel method of redundancy resolution with multiple performance criteria. In this method the homogenous solution of differential kinematics is derived as a weighted sum of joint velocities lying in the null space of the manipulator Jacobian instead of establishing an overall objective function as a weighted sum of multiple criteria. It remarkably increases flexibility in adding new secondary performance criteria since it does not require to recalculate the gradient of new overall objective function. A systematic design of variable weights is introduced to actively reflect the instant states of each criterion in real-time. Experimental results with a 7-DOF redundant robot illustrate the validity of the proposed scheme

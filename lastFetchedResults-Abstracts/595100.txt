Objective: To see the prevalence of coronary artery disease in rural areas of Peshawar above the age of 30 years.Material and Methods: They were interviewed according to performa by trained interviewer. Fasting blood was taken for sugar and serum cholesterol. ECG was done of every subject. Height, weight, BMI and blood pressure were recorded. Diagnosis of CAD was made both on the Rose questionnaire and ECG criteria according to the Minnesota code.Results: The total number of males was 189 as compared to 309 females. The mean age was 46.54 Â± 12.85 years. The prevalence of coronary artery disease among all the respondents was 11.2%. CAD prevalence among females was greater (13.3%) as compared to males (7.9%). The prevalence of hypertension was 38%, which was more common in females (41.1%) as compared to males (32.8%). In this study 11.9% of the population had cholesterol levels > 200mg/dl. More females were hypercholesterolaemic (14.2%) as compared to males (8.1%). Only 6% of the population was smoker. Prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 8.5%. More Females were diabetic (10%) as compared to males (5.9%). Obesity was present in 64.3% of the total population and was seen more in the female subjects. Physical inactivity was 64.3% in the total population. 97.4% females were physically inactive. Age > 40 years, hypertension (> 140/90 mmHg), fasting blood sugar (>126 mg/dl), fasting cholesterol (> 200mg/dl) and physical inactivity were significantly associated with presence of CAD on univariate analysis while age > 40 years, physical inactivity, sugar > 126 g/dl, cholesterol >200mg/dl were more important and significant variables on multivariate analysis.Conclusion: The most prevalent risk factors for CAD in rural area in Peshawar were physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Coronary artery disease risk factors, i.e. age > 40 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and physical inactivity were significantly associated with CAD in rural population. CAD was more prevalent in females as compared to males, though not statistically significant. Male gender, smoking and increase body mass index did not turn out to be important risk factors for CAD in rural area in our study.

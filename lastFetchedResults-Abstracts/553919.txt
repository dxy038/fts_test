Objective: The purpose of this study was to review briefly related literature on nature, diagnosis, and treatment for nonverbal learning disorders (NVLD). Method: Related research and text literature were reviewed for this purpose, and the most important pivots were emphasized. Results and Conclusion: As a result, we can suggest that NVLD is a condition including deficits in visuo-spatial, sensory, motor, and social abilities. It has various features in different stages of development, and may be misdiagnosed. Brain white matter has been claimed to be responsible for the condition. The intervention guidelines stress on individualized, concrete, and paced therapeutic techniques.

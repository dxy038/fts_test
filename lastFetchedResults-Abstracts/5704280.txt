Large-scale neural correlates of the tinnitus decompensation have been identified by using wavelet phase stability criteria of single sweep sequences of auditory late responses (ALRs). Our previous work showed that the synchronization stability in ALR sequences might be used for objective quantification of the tinnitus decompensation and attention which link to Jastreboff tinnitus model.

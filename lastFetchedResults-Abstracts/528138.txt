Agriculture is one of the most important activities of natural system application where must be done only in suitable areas for the economic purposes, and it will be achieved by using land suitability evaluations. The objective of this study was qualitative and quantitative land suitability evaluation of irrigated croplands for rice, wheat and potato in Shirvan plain, Ilam province. Soil survey of the field, laboratory analysis of the soil maps, qualitative and quantitative evaluation were different successive stages of research. In qualitative evaluation, climatic, topographic and soil suitability classes were determined according to the degree of the matching with plant requirements, by parametric (square root) method. Quantitative suitability was done based on observed and potential yield analysis. Results of the qualitative land evaluation showed that most of the land units were classified as unsuitable (N) for rice and potato and as moderately suitable (S2) for wheat, because of topographic and soil limitation. Qualitatively, most of the land units were classified in the same classes as, or in lower classes than Quantitative suitability classes for given crops, due to high management level at the farms and suitable climatic and soil properties. Quantitatively, most of the evaluable land units were classified as moderately suitable (S2) class for rice and wheat crops and as suitable (S1) class for potato. Results of the economic assessment showed that the rice production was the most economic land utilization type.

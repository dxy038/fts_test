Reducing energy consumption in the Telecom industry has become a major research challenge to the Internet community. Towards this end, numerous research works have been carried out to mitigate the growth of energy consumption through intelligent network control mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel approach to achieving energy efficiency in ISP backbone networks according to dynamic traffic conditions. The main objective is to enforce as many links as possible to go to sleep during the off-peak time, while in event of traffic volume increase, the minimum number of sleeping links should be required to wake up to handle this dynamicity and in a way that this creates minimal or no traffic disruption. Based on our simulations with the GEANT and Abilene network topologies and their traffic traces respectively, up to 47% and 44% energy gains can be achieved without any obstruction to the network performance. Secondly, we show that the activation of a small number of sleeping links is still sufficient to cope with any traffic surge instead of reverting to the full topology or sacrificing energy savings as seen in some research proposals.

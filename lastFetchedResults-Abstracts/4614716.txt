This paper presents an automated procedure for coils conductorsÂ´ arrangement. The procedure has been applied to slotless permanent magnet machines having planar magnetic stator windings, such as printed circuit board (PCB) coils. The proposed method is driven by optimization techniques whose goal is to find a proper arrangement of PCB traces, which make up stator windings in order to find some trade-off solutions, optimal respect to some objective functions. A time-efficient numerical model has been developed to reduce computational load and thus make the optimization based design attractive. The paper shows results of numerical simulations of an annular permanent magnet synchronous machine having 200 poles and PCB windings.

As the military moves toward the objective force, satellite communications on-the-move (SATCOM OTM) becomes a key element in maintaining continuous warfighter communications. The wideband gapfiller satellite (WGS) will operate at X and Ka-band and offers great near-term potential to fill the SATCOM OTM gap that exists today. This paper addresses the general mobile ground segment requirements including channel specifications; noise power generation and satellite transponder gain states; system operational limitations, and how satellite operations can address potential solutions at Ka-band. The paper includes appropriate background material, practical satellite link calculation results and examples of small aperture terminals, suitable for OTM operation, over the WGS.

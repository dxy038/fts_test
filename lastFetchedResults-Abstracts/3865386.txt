An energy management control system for a parallel hybrid electric vehicle is presented. The proposed system incorporates an optimization scheme to assess the amount of engine torque for generating propulsive power (torque distribution task) as well as a charge sustaining scheme to ensure that batteryÂ´s state of charge is maintained at sufficiently high level. In order to accomplish the torque distribution task, torque distribution control problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem, and recast and solved as a single objective linear optimization problem. Furthermore, a new vehicle-mode-based state-of-charge compensator is developed to accomplish the charge sustaining task. Computer simulation work is carried out to evaluate the proposed energy management system. Finally, through sensitivity analysis, robustness of the solution to changes in the parameters of the objective functions is investigated.

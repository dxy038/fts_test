We have researched for the applicability of the genetic algorithms (GA) to problems such as multi objective optimization, time series prediction, the analysis from observed noisy data and the solution of implicit functions. Concerning these problems, we reported that GA is effective for the tracking of the moving ships and for the tracking of the objects orbiting the earth from observed time series bearing and distance data or only from sound signals radiated by of unknown moving object. In this paper, we report on the analysis for the movement characteristics (distance, bearing, velocity, course) and sound source frequency by elimination Doppler effect from sounds radiated by the propulsion system of an unknown object in sea. To analyze those data, we applied two kinds of GA. One of them analyzes harmonic frequencies and their phases of the Doppler effected sound signals. The other GA analyzes the movement characteristics and sound source frequency based on the output of the former GA. We could prove the applicability of GA to this analysis through a computer simulation.

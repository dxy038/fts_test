In African countries, tertiary education occupies a nearly insignificant place in the national budget, 1.5% in Madagascar. The latter results in a lack of teachers, damaged infrastructure and poor quality education. Besides, the university capacity is only 35% of the students graduated with baccalaureate degree. This vicious circle leads to an increase of the brain drain rate; each year, thousands of students move mainly to France. The objective of this paper is to discuss the possible solutions for improving the tertiary education accessibility in Madagascar. By the mean of the systemic analysis along the STEEP (Social, Technological, Economical, Environmental and Political) dimensions, we found the possible solutions. Then, we made a comparative analysis of these solutions using three criteria: cost, teachers´ accessibility and students´ accessibility. As a result, we found that e-learning is the best alternative, especially now that optical fiber is implemented and that the universities equipments are reinforced with an agreement with Microsoft. However, reducing its cost requires the government involvement, the telecommunication companies´ investment in the network accessibility within public-private partnership (PPP), and an increase of the number of students.

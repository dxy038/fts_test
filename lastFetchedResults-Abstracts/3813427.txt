The Quality Oriented Adaptation Scheme (QOAS) is used for high bit-rate multimedia streaming in local broadband multi-service all-IP networks. It balances two opposing goals: providing high quality multimedia-based services to end-users, and increasing the infrastructure utilization and number of customers simultaneously served. Extensive objective testing results presented in this paper show that QOAS achieves high performance in terms of end-user perceived quality, loss rate, throughput, link utilization, and number of customers simultaneously served. These results were obtained even in highly loaded and variable delivery conditions caused by traffic of different types, sizes, and variation patterns. QOAS performance was assessed stand-alone and in comparison with other existing solutions, adaptive and non-adaptive

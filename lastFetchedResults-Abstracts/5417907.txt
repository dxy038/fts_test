For the equipment incomplete preventive maintenance in a finite time interval, this paper studies on the equipment maintenance time optimization problem. Focusing on equipments with reduced failure rates, the paper aims to optimize the objective function by minimizing total maintenance costs, establish the dynamic optimization model with consideration of equipment warranty period and resale value, and design algorithms for model solutions. Example analysis shows that in the incomplete maintenance case for failure rate reduction devices, it can result in a better expectation of total maintenance costs to perform preventive maintenance during the warranty period.

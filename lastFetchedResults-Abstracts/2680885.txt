 Background In Iran, the most common mode of HIV transmission among
                            male intravenous drug users is sharing injection needles and
                            syringes.Harm reduction initiatives, as a way of reducing the burden of
                            this problem , are a set of policies and programs which attempt
                            primarily to reduce the adverse health, social, and economic
                            consequences of substances to drug users, their families, and
                            communities. Objectives The objective of this study was to elucidate the
                            challenges and successes of HIV/AIDS services delivery as perceived by
                            senior officials and service providers. Patients and Methods
                            Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Shiraz, Iran
                            with a purposive sample of sub-national service providers. A thematic
                            analysis of these qualitative data was conducted by the authors. Results
                            Participants identified major challenges and successes of HIV/AIDS
                            services delivery. Service delivery and accessibility, in terms of
                            challenges and successes, were classified. Conclusions Our study
                            demonstrates that, despite greater availability of HIV/AIDS services,
                            this availability is not associated with greater accessibility and
                            utilization because of multiple, complex, and interrelated barriers to
                            HIV/AIDS service provision at the service delivery level.

Current wireless distributed computing (WDC) system has one of the major factors is latency. There has a demand for power efficiency, reliable in its communication system. These demands under fading channel conditions give stupendous challenges to WDC system over traditional distributed computing system. In this paper, the objective is to minimize the latency. Where constraints are considered as power efficiency and accuracy in huge data rate transmitting and receiving. I propose OFDMA based WDC system, to achieve the zero interference. This paper uses an evolutionary method, called the particle swarm optimization (PSO). This algorithm gives global optimum solution to above specified objective function with particularized constraints. The performance of proposed system with enumerated algorithm is analyzed using computer simulation.

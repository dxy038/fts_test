This paper describes an approach of implementing software based GPS receiver acquisition and tracking for LI C/A signal on ADSP SHARC. The main objective of this paper is bring out fast GPS signal tracking method using which more number of channels(satellites) can be tracked on a fixed and limited resources DSP platform. Further, GPS acquisition, Carrier Pull-in and C/A Code prediction modules are discussed.AH the processing for the algorithms are done using sign bit of the ADC.A time domain based approach without early and late codes is used for Tracking GPS signal.

Summary form only given as follows. The authors describe an ongoing research project to develop a comprehensive management system for continuous improvements in the new product (NPD) process. Primary emphasis of the study is on the measurement of performance indicators and controllable input variables. Causal relationships and transfer functions among these variables and indicators are developed. Judgment quantification, hierarchical decision modeling, online simulation, and animated response surface modeling are used in combination with industry-wide surveys and focused case analyses in technology-driven companies. The work on the measurement and evaluation system is supported by the design of an information system and an organization system to establish effective linkages for the implementation of continuous improvements in the NPD process. The objective of the study is to investigate the underlying factors that influence the cycle time, the design and production quality, and the financial parameters in the product design, development, and deployment process. The expected output is a set of descriptive and prescriptive models utilizing decision-theoretic approaches, expert judgment methodologies, and mathematical modeling techniques

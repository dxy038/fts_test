Background: 
Intravenous drug use (IDU) is a frequent route of infection transmission, especially during the recent
decades. Numerous studies have addressed the increasing frequency of IDU-associated infections such as hepatitis and
AIDS. The present study was achieved to determine the prevalence of IDU-associated infections in 3 teaching hospitals
in Iran.
Materials and methods: 
For this descriptive study, 3 teaching hospitals affiliated to Shaheed Beheshti University of
Medical Sciences were considered and patients who had been admitted in infectious ward were included. Totally, 126
IDU patients were evaluated for duration of drug abuse, type of drug, site and frequency of injections, and clinical
manifestations.
Results:
 The study population included 123 males and 3 females with a mean age of 37 years. They have averagely
abused IV drugs for 5.8 years 3.3 times a day. Groin (44%) and upper extremity (forearm, arm or hand) (36%) were the
most common sites of injection. Soft tissue and skin infection, respiratory infections and pulmonary TB, and viral
hepatitis were the most common IDU-associated infections.
Conclusion: 
Skin and soft tissues were the most common site of involvement among IDU patients. High frequency of
pulmonary tuberculosis in IDU necessitates clinicianâ€™s attention; however, the association between TB and HIV was
remarkable.

Objective: This study investigated behavior problems and educational
achievement between children with and without motor problems.
Materials & Methods: Seventeen children with motor problems
(as case group) and twenty five children without motor problems
(as control group) whom had been identified by Lincoln-Oseretsky
Motor Development Scale, were randomly selected and participated in
this comparative study . The parent form of the Child Behavior Checklist
was used to assess chi idren's emotional and behavioral problems. Data were
analyzed by Independent T test.
Results : Findings revealed that children with motor problems obtained
significantly poorer scores on school achievement areas than control group
(P<O.OO 1). Children with motor problems were also found to evidence
relatively high level of total, Internal, external and social problems, somatic
complaints, attention deficit and reclusion based on parent reports (P<O .OO I),
but there was no significant difference between two groups in anxiety /
depression, cogitation, sexuality, criminal behavior and quarrelsome behavior
(P>0.05).
Conclusions: These findings indicate that all children with movement
problems are at risk for problems on behavioral and school achievement
areas. Assessment of children with motor problems, regardless of the degree
or severity of these problems should examine a wide range of functions in
addition to motor functioning .

A model for predicting the evolution of damage in the form of numerous cracks on multiple length scales in composite materials subject to impact loading is presented. The objective of such a model is to develop the capability to predict failure of structural components subject to very fast loading. Such a capability would then be useful as a predictive tool for designing structural components so as not to fail, but rather to succeed in performing their intended tasks. The model developed herein is somewhat involved, being based in continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, but is nevertheless expected to be cost effective (wherever sufficient accuracy permits) when compared to more costly experimental means of determining component performance. An essential ingredient within the context of the model is that cracks must develop on widely differing length scales. Where this is observed to occur in nature, which is surprisingly often, there are potential simplifications that can lead to computational multiscale algorithms capable of assimilating failure due to multiple cracking with a high degree of accuracy. The model presented herein is briefly described within a mathematical framework, and some example problems are presented in order to verify the computational algorithm.

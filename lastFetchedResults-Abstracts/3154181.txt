For high-dimensional and diversity nature of the index data of listed firms, and in order to overcome the shortcomings of previous evaluation methods, we propose a comprehensive evaluation method based on entropy weight coefficient method. we study on the listed firms of appliance industry, and determine the objective weight of sample indexes of the listed appliance firms by entropy weight coefficient method, and then we comprehensively evaluate and research the profitability of listed appliance firms, at last we obtained objective evaluation results. This method is simple, efficient and feasible, and further, it can maximatily avoid human interference through weight in weighting assessment method.

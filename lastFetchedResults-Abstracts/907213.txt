Eating attitudes are defined as beliefs, thoughts, feelings, behaviors and relationship with food. They could influence people's food choices and their health status. Objective: This study aimed to adapt from Portuguese to English the Disordered Eating Attitude Scale (DEAS) and evaluate its validity and reliability. The original scale in Portuguese was translated and adapted into English and was applied to female university students of University of Minnesota—USA (n = 224). Internal consistency was determined (Cronbach's Alpha). Convergent validity was assessed by correlations between Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26) and Restrain Scale (RS). Reliability was evaluated applying twice the scale to a sub-sample (n = 30). The scale was back translated into Portuguese and compared with the original version and discrepancies were not found. The internal consistency was .76. The DEAS total score was significantly associated with EAT-26 (r = 0.65) and RS (r = 0.69) scores. The correlation between test–retest was r = 0.9. The English version of DEAS showed appropriate internal consistency, convergent validity and test–retest reliability and will be useful to assess eating attitudes in different population groups in English spoken countries.

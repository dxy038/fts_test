The enormous growth of Peer-to-Peer networks have evolved new breed of applications. A Web Service is a middleware technology which supports interoperability among the heterogeneous systems. The power of Web Service when coupled with Peer-to-Peer networks can make Web Services accessible by any small group of users to a very larger group of peers constructed over Internet. This approach enables peer-to-peer distributed Web Service discovery within the peer group of common interest. Every peer is allowed to publish and discover Web Service without central coordination. The information on Web services will be available to all the peers within the common interest peer group. When an end-user connects to the network via one peer, he/she will be able to view the list of Web Services and access them across all the peers relevant to his/her request. The objective of our work is to implement a distributed peer-to-peer Web Service discovery system for student community which would enable the students to chat, share, access materials of common interest and group documents in peer studentÂ´s system. Moreover, we have proposed Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to search Web Services available in the peer group. This would increase the search efficiency of the system. Our System is implemented in. Net on Window XP service pack 3 platform with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) which supports easy construction of peer-to-peer applications.

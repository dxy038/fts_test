We experimentally demonstrate a 10 Gb/s bidirectional subcarrier multiplexed (SCM) wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) passive optical network (PON). We use digital signal processing and square-root raised cosine pulse shaping techniques to generate M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation electrical signals for the downlink and uplink transmissions using simple intensity modulation and direct detection optoelectronics, and 10 GHz transceivers. The design includes spectral preemphasis and offset optical filtering to increase the effective bandwidth of a commercial 2.2 GHz reflective semiconductor optical amplifier based optical network unit. We realize symmetric 10 Gb/s transmission over a 20 km single feeder PON with optical line terminal launch powers from 1 to 9 dBm. We also demonstrate the ability of these SCM WDM PONs to withstand the effects of upstream impairments.

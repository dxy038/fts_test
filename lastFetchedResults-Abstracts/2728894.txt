TodayÂ´s life and industry are intimately dependent on the electric energy. This dependence in future will be still intensified, especially due to the appearance of electric-dependent vehicles overriding conventional fossil-fuel-based vehicles in the societies. Electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) carry battery storages to store the electrical energy they need. The batteries have recharging and discharging capabilities. A parking lot hosting multiple EVs could be considered as important aggregators for them. In this paper, a novel dc-dc multiport (MP) bidirectional converter (MPBC) is suggested to function in a parking lot integrating EVs as either electric load or source of energy. The switching strategies of MPBC and power sharing flowchart are presented and then its operation in the presence of three plug-in EV batteries is studied through simulation and verified through experimental testbench.

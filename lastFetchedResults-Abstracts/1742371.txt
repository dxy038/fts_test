The objective of this work was to determine the gelation kinetics, extent of swelling, sol fraction, and degradation kinetics of photo-crosslinked poly(l-lactide-co-ethylene oxide-co-fumarate) (PLEOF) hydrogels, with N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) crosslinker, as a function of composition as well as the time and intensity of UV radiation. The gelation process was monitored by in situ rheometry. The crosslinking was shown to be facilitated by increasing NVP concentration up to a certain value above which the hydrogel shear modulus did not increase with additional amount of NVP. Increasing the hydrophobicity of PLEOF macromer resulted in a decrease in the hydrogel swelling ratio and increase in sol fraction which was due to a reduction in the apparent reactivity of the PLEOF fumarate units. The degradation characteristics of PLEOF hydrogels depended on the ratio of PLA to PEG with PLEOF 30/70 (30% lactide) having the highest degradation rate.

In recent years, advanced data broadcasting services, which provide viewers with multimedia data on digital television, have drawn growing interest. At the same time, there is file-sharing peer-to-peer service on digital television field. However, few studies pay attention to their convergence that is data broadcasting can help peer-to-peer service. This paper studies file-sharing peer-to-peer application among set-top boxes in bidirectional HFC networks. The study proposes the new architecture that using data carousel completes search work in peer-to-peer system. Finally, the experiment demonstrates advantages of the proposed strategy in hybrid peer-to-peer system.

The paper presents the analysis of losses of a three-phase, high speed 12/8 switched reluctance motor (SRM), intended to be used in automotive applications. The objective is to investigate by comparison the iron losses considering different types of short pitch winding arrangements, as well as different core laminations, and how much these affect the performance of a SRM having the same structure and working under the same conditions. The flux paths and static characteristics of several configurations are analyzed by means of 2D finite-element method (FEM). The effect of different lamination materials on the iron core losses are also studied. Dynamic simulation results were used to evaluate the performance of different SRM variants.

The objective of performing this research is to analyze the earthquake hazard and to provide the iso-acceleration maps for different seismic hazard levels in the area of Imam Reza's (Peace Be upon Him) holy shrine. Since the construction in the vicinity of the holy shrine goes back fifty years, and some structures are historical and religious, in order to properly design and optimize the historical places, it is needed to provide the design acceleration in different seismic hazard levels. So, by using different resources, the catalogue of the seismicity data; in the radii of 150 and 200 km of the area, have been collected and, then, the seismicity parameters have been computed by the Kijkio method. The seismicity parameters of the provinces, which have been presented by Mirzaei & et al., have been used. Then, the faults of the region have been detected and modeled and, by using the proper attenuation relationships and SEISERISK III software, the values of the acceleration at different levels are computed and the coefficients of the logic tree are applied. Finally, the iso-acceleration maps are resulted.

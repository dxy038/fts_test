Using a bidirectional dc-dc converter along with low-voltage energy storage for the high-voltage dc bus and traction motor drives has been a prominent option for hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles. This paper will describe the significance of energy management power converters and their circuit topology options for efficiency, size, and cost considerations. Whether isolated or nonisolated, soft switching techniques have been widely used in high-power bidirectional dc-dc converters. Through some design examples, the component selection and circuit design optimization are discussed, and their efficiency evaluation results are also given. Major difficulties of developing a high-power bidirectional dc-dc converter are found in lack of high-power passive components and lack of multiphase dc-dc controllers. More development work needs to be done in these areas

The distribution capability for additional DECS-power of the existing distribution network is an important criteria for the soon-coming increasing installation of e.g. fuel-cell-systems for house supplying. In this paper, a method is described which allows the calculation of the maximum cumulated DECS-power of individual distribution networks. The calculation is based on an optimization problem, an objective function is presented and solved via an optimal power-flow algorithm. The optimization contains a special DECS-inverter model to keep the connection to reality. The method is tested on a real 84-node low-voltage distribution network

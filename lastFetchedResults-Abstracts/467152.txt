Objective: Our purpose was to determine the effect of in utero exposure to indomethacin on the need for surgical closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Study Design: Perinatal variables were compared between infants at <32 weeks who required surgical closure of PDA after failed medical management and those who did not. Statistical analysis was performed by Student t, Mann-Whitney, Ï‡2, and multiple logistic regression tests. Results: Eight of 77 infants with PDA failed therapy and required surgery. Maternal demographics, gestational age, birth weight, and delivery route were similar in both groups. In utero exposure to indomethacin was more common in neonates requiring surgery versus those who did not, particularly when exposure was for >72 hours (50.0% vs 8.7%, odds ratio 10.5, 95% CI 1.6-72.1, P= .008). Conclusion: Need for surgical closure of PDA appears to be increased by in utero indomethacin exposure. These findings should be considered in the overall context of the risk versus benefits of tocolysis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:886-8.)

However data of only 60 patients was available for analysis.Results: Out of the Sixty (60) cases, Thirty Six (36) were of antenatal, Nineteen (19) of intranatal & Fourteen (14) of postnatal eclampsia. The age range was from Thirteen (13) to Forty (40) years with a maximum number of patients between twenty one (21) to Thirty (30) years. 80% of the patients belonged to rural areas with 77% belonging to very low incoming group, 53% were primi gravidae with 90% of the cases presenting in the last Four (4) weeks of pregnancy.

All except one were admitted in emergency & all were un-booked for anternatal care. The results were compared with the data collected by the same author in the same hospital ten (10) years ago in 1988 as part of requirement for post graduate training in gynae & obs. The data was submitted in book form to the college of physicians and surgeons, as a prerequisite for F.C.P.S.

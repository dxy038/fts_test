In interactive voice applications, FEC schemes are necessary for the recovery from packet losses. These schemes need to be simple with a light coding and decoding overhead in order to not impact the interactivity. The objective of this paper is to study a well known simple FEC scheme, in which for every packet n, some redundant information is added in some subsequent packet n+&#966;. If packet n is lost, it will be reconstructed in case packet n+&#966; is well received. The quality of the reconstructed copy of packet n will depend on the amount of information on packet n we add to packet n+&#966;. We propose a detailed queueing analysis based on a ballot theorem and obtain simple expressions for the audio quality as a function of the amount of redundancy and its relative position to the original information. The analysis shows that this FEC scheme does not scale well and that the quality will deteriorate for any amount of FEC and for any offset &#966;

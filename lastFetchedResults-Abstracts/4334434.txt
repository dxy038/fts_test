In this paper, a fuzzy based sliding-mode (SM) control is presented. The main objective is to obtain an improved performance of highly non-linear unstable systems with guaranteed stability. Both the fuzzy controller and the controlled system are represented by the affine Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The chattering problem which is considered the main drawback of the SM control is solved by introducing a boundary layer around the switching surface. The stability issue is also examined. Finally the proposed method is explained by applying it on an inverted pendulum. The results show a robust and stable behaviour when the system is subjected to a perturbation effect

Summary form only given. The capabilities of modern military multifunction/multi-mission/multi-role radars cannot be fully realised by using older sensor control strategies, due to the advance in radar technology and the complexity of the tactical environment. The most obvious radar management imperative is the real-time optimisation of radar functionality &amp; radar resource management to meet the changing operational mission, according to an assessment of the current environment conditions and tactical requests from an external centre. The objective of the tutorial is to present: main principles of intelligent radar resources management; strategies for radar time budget regulation; algorithms for: threat assessment, dynamic dwell priority allocation, real-time dwell planning/scheduling, load handling/control,... new advanced tools for radar management simulation on complex scenarios. The tutorial will be illustrated with simulation and campaign results of advanced Thales Multi-function/Mission Radars (e.g. MASTER A radar).

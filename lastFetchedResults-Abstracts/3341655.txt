Current solutions to deal with control objectives in over-actuated systems consist in distributing control efforts among redundant actuators. However, there is no or little consideration on the employed criteria to achieve such distribution. This paper proposes reliable control allocation methods where the objective is to manage control inputs in order to maintain system performance and at the same time, to guarantee an optimal overall system reliability. The reliable control allocation methods are posed as optimization problems incorporating systemÂ´s reliability. The effectiveness of proposed methods is demonstrated by using an unmanned fixed wing aircraft model.

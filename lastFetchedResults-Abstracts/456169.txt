Background: Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at elevated cardiovascular risk. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been used to successfully predict cardiovascular events. Objective: We identified clinical and biochemical characteristics that correlate with CRP levels in diabetic nephropathy patients. Design: Baseline data obtained from 722 patients in the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, plasma low- and high-density cholesterol, triacylglycerol, serum albumin, hemoglobin A1C, 24 h urinary protein excretion, plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, B12, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP, active form of Vitamin B6), and plasma CRP levels. Results: In univariate analyses CRP was positively associated with female sex (r=0.08; P=0.04), BMI (r=0.34; P<0.01), serum creatinine (r=0.21; P<0.01), hemoglobin A1C (r=0.08; 0.04), and inversely associated with PLP (r=−0.17; P<0.01) and folate (r=−0.09; P=0.02). A stepwise multiple regression model found CRP directly correlated with BMI (P<0.01) and serum creatinine (P<0.01), and inversely correlated with PLP (P<0.01). The final model explained 16% of the total variance of CRP. Conclusions: These results extend previous findings of an inverse relationship between Vitamin B6 and CRP. The lack of association between CRP and certain established or emerging cardiovascular risk factors offers novel information regarding cardiovascular risk in this population.

A new multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm, which is named Riemann-Sphere Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (RSEA), is proposed in this paper. The characteristic of the RSEA is that it takes the infinite point as the reference point for sampling individuals first, then maps the object-space onto the Riemann-Sphere in order to evaluate whether the new individual can inserts the archive (elitist space). In this way, it can not only enhance performance of the distribution and diversity, but also accelerate the convergence rate. Finally, the numerical experiments show that the performance of the RSEA is excellent in the distribution, diversity, precision and convergence rate of the solutions.

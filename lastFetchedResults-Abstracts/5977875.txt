The purpose of this paper is to study the optimal size for a regenerator consists of circular tubes in a thermoacoustic refrigerator. The maximum cooling load per unit area is taken as the objective, and the optimal circular tube inside radius is obtained respectively. The effect of temperature gradient, wall thickness of circular tube, angular frequency and phase difference on the optimal circular tube inside radius are studied. The results obtained herein can provide some theoretical guidance for the optimum design of the regenerator in a thermoacoustic refrigerator.

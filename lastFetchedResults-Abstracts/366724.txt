Generally speaking in customary industrial and medical radiography, there is no tendency to reveal the nature of the samples. Ordinarily, the main objective of taking a radiograph is to show the position and dimension of unknown parts, inside the test object and to determine cracks, defects, etc. Whereas in radiography many important factors such as material cross-sections and build-up factors are also involved. In this paper, by using both neutron and gamma radiography techniques, some mathematical relations were successfully generated, in order to calculate the neutron and gamma total macroscopic cross-sections of some unknown elements in the presence of the other elements. For this work, some test pieces were defined and made of lead, silver, copper, Nickel, tin, graphite and polyethylene. The neutron radiography facility at Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) was used as mixed neutron and gamma radiography source (Proceedings of the Second World Conference on Neutron Radiography, Paris, France, pp. 25â€“32). On testing of a correction of the above-mentioned generated relations, a new technique of simultaneous neutron and gamma radiography was also investigated.

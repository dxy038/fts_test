We consider the problem of routing messages on Series Parallel Graphs (SPGs) and we introduce a new technique called Distance Routing. This technique is based on the idea of encoding in the label of each node x some information about a shortest path from the source of the SPG to x, and from x to the terminal node of the SPG. We first compare shortest path Distance Routing and I-interval Routing Schemes on directed SPGs. We then show that Distance Routing can be used to route on bidirectional SPGs, where no general shortest path I-interval Routing Scheme can be applied. We also show the relevance of the study of the time complexity in the choice of a Compact Routing method

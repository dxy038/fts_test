Nowadays the deinterlacing algorithm is using for converting the interlaced scan to progressive scan in HDTV system. The reason that the deinterlacing algorithm is necessity for this system is to prevent the serious distortion like flickering in fast motion. This paper presents an efficient deinterlacing algorithm that uses Wiener filter to detect the reliable direction of edge. With this algorithm the better image quality can be obtained in both subjective and objective way.

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of radio wave propagation through the forest, with a focus on the evaluation of propagation loss. We present considerations that, according to our belief, should be taken into account when designing a wireless sensor network system to be deployed in a forest environment. Apart from theoretical analysis we present evaluation of example data measured using two ZigBee communication devices operating on frequency 868MHz.

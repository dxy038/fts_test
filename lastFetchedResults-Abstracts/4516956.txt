Facing problems related to the information systems (IS) evolution and consequently decisional systems (DS), conceptual models must facilitate the organisational environment representing in which the (IS) may evolve and strategic objectives on which they must align so as to understand the imposed requirements for their development. Thus, changes have to accompany an alignment of (IS) and (DS) within optimising and strategic stakes of the company. As a solution, we suggest a multi-agent approach for the DS modelling. This approach is based on a referential framework to analyse the requirements of strategic alignment. The objective of this work is to give an overview of the DS concepts. In order to describe this central concept in the research on information systems, we will refer to all theoretical supports of these systems integrating the approach of situational decision and the question of the necessary architecture to implement these systems.

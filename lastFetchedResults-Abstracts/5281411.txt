In this paper, the mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is established for hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem (HFSP), with the minimum of energy consumption as the objective function. Aiming at the characteristic of this problem and the shortcomings of simple genetic algorithm, a hybrid genetic algorithm (Memetic) is presented. To validate the preciseness of the model and the availability of the method, the simulating experimentation is done on the three-two-three HFSP, and the result indicates that the scheduling algorithm can reduce the energy consumption in the process of production.

Background: Evaluation of healing effects of Echinacea extract in Arsenic induced dermal necrosis in rat is the objective of this study. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 20 male Wistar rats were divided to 2 groups. Dermal necrosis was induced by subcutaneously arsenic injection (4mg/kg) for 10 days. In group 2, after arsenic receiving, Echinacea were injected intraperitoneally (400mg/kg). After last day of injection, rats were euthanizes and pathologic samples were collected from dermal ulcers.
Results: Histopathologic results revealed necrosis of different dermal layers in arsenic group. There were inflammatory exudates instead of impaired structures. In group 2, there were granulation tissue with high cellularity and new vessels.
Conclusion: According to this research findings arsenic can induce dermal necrosis which is a good animal model for dermatologic researches and also Echinacea has healing effects and can protect and limit the Arsenic effects.

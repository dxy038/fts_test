Background
nin transporter (5-HTT) and 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) involved in the neurotransmission of 5-HT may play an important role in the development of major depression disorder (MDD). Several lines of evidence suggested that the gene–environment interaction may confer susceptibility to depression. The aim of this study is to analyze the combined effect of four serotonin-related genes and two environmental factors on MDD in a Chinese population.
s
tudy recruited a total of 401 patients with MDD and 391 age- and gender-matched control subjects. They were all Chinese Han origin. Negative life events and objective social supports were assessed using standard rating scales. Six polymorphisms in the four serotonin-related genes (5-HTT, 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR1B and 5-HTR2A) were selected to detect. The analyses of the gene–environment interactions were performed by the Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR).
s
c associations between patients with MDD and controls were observed for the polymorphism of 5-HTTLPR and for rs6295 at the 5-HTR1A locus. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was associated with negative life events on MDD. A three-way interaction between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, rs6295 and negative life events on MDD was found in the individuals aged from 20 years to 29 years. In addition, the individuals carrying the L/L genotype of 5-HTTLPR could be susceptible to MDD when exposed to negative life events.
sions
HTTLPR polymorphism may modify the interaction between negative life events and MDD in the Chinese population. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the combined effect for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and 5-HTR1A genes on modifying the response to negative life events conferring susceptibility to MDD in the 20–29 year group.

Background and Aims
evalence of infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species in patients with immunodeficiencies in Mexico is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify, at the molecular level, the mycobacterial species most frequently affecting patients with immunodeficiencies and evaluate the genotypic diversity of MTB complex strains.
s
ducted a retrospective study of 97 strains in patients with the diagnosis of pulmonary (all isolates were of pathological significance) or extrapulmonary tuberculosis. PCR analysis was performed to determine whether they belonged to the MTB complex (MTC) or the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Noncharacterized NTM were sequenced and, finally, MTC were genotyped by MIRUs-VNTR and spoligotyping.
s
 97 mycobacterial strains isolated, 53% were M. tuberculosis, 10% M. bovis, 24% M. avium, 9% M. simiae, 2% M. kansasii and 2% M. gordonae. A great genetic diversity was found by MIRU-VNTR with the greatest polymorphism in MIRU 10, 16, 23 and 27. By spoligotyping, the predominant family was T1. Combining both methods, the association of 13 strains in four different groups was found.
sions
s the first molecular analysis of mycobacteria isolated from patients with immunodeficiencies in Mexico, describing the prevalence of different mycobacterial species in this population. A great genetic diversity of MTB strains was identified. This is also the first report in Mexico describing clinically important isolates of M. simiae.

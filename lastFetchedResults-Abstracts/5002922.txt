We study a coordination problem where the objective is to steer a group of agents to a formation that translates with a prescribed reference velocity. In [1] we considered the situation where the information of reference velocity is available only to a leader, and developed a decentralized adaptive design with which the other agents reconstruct the reference velocity. Although [1] guaranteed that the desired formation is achieved, it did not ensure parameter convergence. We now propose a new adaptive redesign, which incorporates relative velocity feedback in addition to relative position feedback, to guarantee parameter convergence.

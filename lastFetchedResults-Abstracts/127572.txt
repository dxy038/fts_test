Background : Red pepper is frequently used as a therapeutic agent in traditional medicine.
Objective : To study the analgesic effect of capsanthin and its effect on morphine dependent mice.
Methods : Analgesia was measured by tail flick test. The degree of depencence on morphine was determined by the number of jumpings , five minutes after the induction of naloxone. Findings : Capsanthin (25 , 50 , 75 mg/kg) with morphine (10 mg/kg) had significant analgesic effect compared with morphine alone. Morphine dependent mice which received capsanthin differed in jumping rate compared with the control group. Jumping latency time increased significantly in capsanthin groups (particularly in 50 , 75 mg/kg).
Conclusion : Capsanthin together with morphine has significant analgesia effects in comparision with morphine alone.

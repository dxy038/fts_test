Quantitative techniques for the measurement of species diversity have been developed in ecological studies. One such technique, based on an entropy measurement, has been applied to the assessment of medical device diversity in large inventories of medical equipment. Using this technique it is possible to identify trends which are not apparent from simple considerations of the total number of devices, or the number of device types. Objective measurements of this type can be used to monitor the progress of planned equipment replacement programmes.

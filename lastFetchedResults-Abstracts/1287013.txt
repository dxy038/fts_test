Introduction & Objective: The Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS) is a clinical meas-ure that has been recently developed for the assessment of muscle spasticity. There is a dearth of research on the validity of the MMAS.  The aim of the present study was to investi-gate the relationship between the MMAS and the biomechanical measure of work-velocity slope in assessing   knee extensor muscle spasticity in patients with hemiparesia.
Materials & Methods: Fourteen patients with post-stroke hemiparesia were included in this cross sectional study. Knee extensor spasticity was assessed with MMAS. An isokinetic dy-namometer was used to impose knee passive flexion with the angular velocity of 10, 30, 60, and 90 °/Sec to measure Torque-angle data. Work (Joule) was calculated at each velocity to determine the slope of the work-velocity curves as the biomechanical measure of muscle spasticity.
Results: The mean work decreased as the velocity increased but was not statistically signifi-cant (P = 0.07). The mean slope was – 0.35 [J /(°/Sec)]. There was no significant correlation between the MMAS and the work-velocity slope (r =0.31, P = 0.28).
Conclusion: There was no significant relationship between the MMAS and the biomechanical measure of work-velocity slope. Further studies with larger sample size are suggested.

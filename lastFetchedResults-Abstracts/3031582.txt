Evolutionary computation is a new field of research in which hardware design is pursued by deriving inspiration from biological organisms. This new paradigm is expected to radically change the synthesis procedures in a way that allows discovering novel designs and/or more efficient circuits. In this paper, a multi objective optimization strategy for design of arithmetic circuits based on Ant Colony optimization algorithm is presented. Results are compared with those obtained using other techniques.

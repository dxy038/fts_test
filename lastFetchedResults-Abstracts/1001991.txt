The main objective was to study grazing behavior of goats; diet selection, nutritive value, digestibility of range plant and body gained at flowering and seed setting stage at September and November 2010 respectively in El-khuwei locality (El Rosa). A completely randomized design was used (CRD). Sampling was done by two stage flowering and seed sating stage were selected diets and feed intake locating a 2000 x 2000 m plots. The average weights gains during the flowering and seed setting stage were 17 and 18.28kg respectively. Goats during the flowering stage was preference on bite counts of the different species, however highly (P  <  0.0001) at the flowering and least during the seed setting stage. Goat preference ranked Bano (Eragrostis tremula), Huskneet (Cenchrus biflorus), Difra (Echinocloa colonum), leflef (Luffa aegyptiaca), Gaw (Aristida spp.), Fisiya (Fimbristyls hispidula), Himeira (Hymenocardia acida), Nuida (Sida cordofolia), Tmrfar (Oldenlandia senegalensis) and Aboelrakhus (Andropogon gayanus), while Gadgad (Geigeria alata), Buid (Commelinia subulata), Simeima (Sesamum alatum), Abodaib (Ceraotheca sesamoid) and Rabaa (Zalea spp) least than that. A significant higher (P  <  0.001) goats selective feed intake, in vitro dry matter digestibility, dry matter, organic matter and crude protein higher at flowering stage and lowers during the seed setting stage. However; ash contents and crude fiber of plants were significantly higher at the seed setting stage. Body weight gain was significantly highest during the flowering stage, while the distance walked by goats for diet search was significantly longest during the seed setting stage. It was concluded that flowering stage beneficially goats highly preference and selectivity different species, feed intake and inviter dry matter digestibility and body weight gained. The seed setting stage was highly ash contents, crude fiber distant walked

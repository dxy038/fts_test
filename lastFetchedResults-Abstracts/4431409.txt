A distributed switching local network for metropolitan area applications is proposed. The network has no centralized building to accommodate the switching system, but parts of the switching are distributed over the city in small metallic boxes. The objective of this kind of network is to reduce the cost of investment in a telephone local network which has customers spread over a large area. The network configuration and the access protocol are discussed. The access control, based on hybrid switching, is flexible enough to accommodate new switching technologies such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). The performance analysis and simulation of the network are also discussed. The network has a ring configuration and a fibre optical transmission system is provided

Airborne electromagnetic data can be obtained in time and frequency domains. In time domain, data consist of the time derivative of the ‎secondary field while in frequency domain it is the absolute value of the secondary field. Here, we have used Occam’s inversion method on ‎airborne electromagnetic data to resolve the resistivity of each layer in an assumed 1D layered earth. In the current modeling the number of ‎model parameters is much more than the number of data. So, by choosing an appropriate objective function to be minimized, we have used ‎the least squares method such that model parameters reached to a minimum structure and data are sufficiently fitted. One of the advantages ‎of this method is that it doesn’t need a primary model and converges to the final model for every starting model. Applying this method on ‎synthetic data provides reasonable results. The method is applied on real airborne electromagnetic data from Kalat-e-Reshm area in the east ‎of Semnan province in Iran. The recovered maps and sections prove the existence of an arc like structure which has outcrop at the surface ‎and is shown in the geological map. Besides, it reveals that the structure is considerably thick due to the alluvium deposits with 10 m ‎thickness covering the area with a dip towards south.‎

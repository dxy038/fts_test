A parallel multi-objective genetic algorithm is presented. The population selection and mating phase is kept distinct from the population fitness evaluation loop, that is implemented in parallel. The population can be logically split in sub-populations the number of which does not depend on the number of processors available for computation. Different sub-population topologies and migration rates among sub-populations can be used. Applications are illustrated both for single and multi-objective mathematical test cases, and aerodynamic transonic wing design

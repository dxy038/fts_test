 The clinical value of objective voice measures in nonsinging patients with superior laryngeal nerve dysfunction is unknown. In this study, patients with symptomatic unilateral superior nerve paresis were evaluated for maximum phonation time, frequency range of phonation, and mean flow rate. Patients with coexisting pathology, bilateral superior nerve paresis, and those with recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis were excluded from this analysis. A total of 35 nonsinging patients, 14 men and 21 women, with unilateral superior laryngeal nerve paresis were examined between 1999 and 2002. The severity of superior laryngeal nerve paresis ranged from 25% to 85% of normal recruitment with a mean of 70% superior laryngeal nerve recruitment in men and 65% in women by electromyography. In both men and women with superior laryngeal nerve paresis, the maximum phonation time and frequency range of phonation were decreased and the mean air flow rate was increased when compared with normal population values. The jitter percent, shimmer percent, and noise-to-harmonic ratio were also increased in patients when compared with normative data. Selected objective voice measures are abnormal in voice patients with superior laryngeal nerve paresis, which suggests that the measures may be useful as outcomes measures after therapy. More research is encouraged.

The main attack strategy in an intense robotic soccer match is for an attack robot (AR) to avoid the competing sideÂ´s threat and to avoid the most threatening defensive robot of the opponent to reach the objective and to effectively initiate an attack with the help of the cooperation robot (CR). This paper defines an attacking model and a cooperative model and their algorithms. Two co-evolution computation (CEC) populations of robot are also designed: one is denoted as AR subset, the other CR subset. Based on this definition, the paper proposes a new multiple robots avoidance based on CEC method (or MRACEC for short). A theoretical analysis indicates that the MRACEC method has better robustness and optimizing ability

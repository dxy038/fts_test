Objective
This study was undertaken to develop, implement, and evaluate a genetics curriculum for obstetrician-gynecologist residents.
Study design
We prospectively evaluated the effect of a genetics curriculum on obstetrician-gynecologist residents' knowledge and skills. Residents completed a needs assessment and pretest. Educational intervention included 2 3-hour didactic sessions with 1 hour of lecture followed by case discussion and 1 3-hour session of experiential learning using standardized patients who evaluated residents' knowledge and skills in taking family history, drawing genetic pedigrees, and counseling patients. Posttest scores were compared with pretest scores.
Results
Needs assessment was completed by all 40 obstetrics and gynecology residents and identified limited and variable genetics education in medical school. Twenty-eight of 40 residents attended the entire educational intervention and completed the pretest and posttest, and 25 of 28 showed improved test scores. Residents stated that they were more confident in their ability to take a family history, record a 3-generation pedigree, and counsel patients about genetic conditions after completion of the genetics curriculum.
Conclusion
This multifaceted genetics curriculum improved residents' knowledge of genetics as well as their confidence in applying genetic concepts as assessed by the pretest and posttest and by their comments in the debrief session.

Universities can play an important role in the high school educational system. In particular, New Mexico Tech has developed a robotics outreach program to provide high school students exposure to engineering concepts via building small robots. The authors have developed an integrated approach for incorporating robotics into secondary education with the objective of further engaging students through an exciting application of math, computers, and science. One of the principal objectives of this outreach effort is to promote the creation of programs at the secondary school level in New Mexico by providing a resource base for the teachers and students. These resources include an adaptable mobile robot kit, training, significant web-based materials (course offerings, an assembly/user manual,...) directed to both secondary students and teachers, and a personnel support structure including college engineering faculty, secondary teachers, practicing engineers, undergraduate engineering students, and junior-high and high-school students.

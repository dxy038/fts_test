We construct a sequence of processes that converges strongly to fractional Brownian motion uniformly on bounded intervals for any Hurst parameter H , and we derive a rate of convergence, which becomes better when H approaches 1 / 2 . The construction is based on the Mandelbrotâ€“van Ness stochastic integral representation of fractional Brownian motion and on a strong transport process approximation of Brownian motion. The objective of this method is to facilitate simulation.

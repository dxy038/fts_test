Addresses collision avoidance problem among multiple mobile robots traveling over two dimensional path network. A local approach based on nonlinear programming is given to solve this problem. The basic idea of this method is to find the desired velocity vector for robot given as the optimal solution of objective function under velocity vector constraint. Collision free navigation of robot is carried out by following the desired velocity vector. This method is implemented using experimental robot and simulated one. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method is discussed through the results

The paper presents a case study of progressive collapse analysis of a selected multistory building. The subject of the numerical study is an existing 8-story steel framed structure built for fire tests in the Cardington Large Building Test Facility, UK. The problem is investigated using nonlinear dynamic finite element simulations carried out following the GSA guidelines. The paper focuses on model development for global models subject to increasing vertical loading and notional column removal. Taking advantage of parallel processing on multiprocessor computers, a detailed 3D model with large number of finite elements has been developed for the entire structure. The objective of the presented feasibility study is to identify modeling parameters affecting the final result (potential of progressive collapse) and propose a hierarchical verification and validation program for reducing outcome uncertainties.

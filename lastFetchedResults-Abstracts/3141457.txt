The objective of this paper is to design and implement a direct-drive position control based on a simplified sinusoidal flux model for a linear variable reluctance motor. The motor under consideration is a three-phase linear motor with strong magnetic coupling between phases that has the advantages of simple structures, compactness and low cost with no permanent magnet. The experimental results show overall good performance indicating that the developed system can be considered as a strong candidate for high precision manufacturing automation applications.

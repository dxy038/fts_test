Background and Objective: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues are a valuable source of
DNA for molecular studies. We designed and optimized an efficient procedure for DNA extraction
from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues.
Materials and Methods: Seventy three blocks of cervical paraffin-embedded tissues were
investigated. DNA was extracted using 45 minutes boiling in alkaline solution together with 10
beads of Chelex-20, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation.
Results: This method produced DNA suitable for amplification using primers specific for human
SMN and B globin genes in 98.63% and 82.2% of samples respectively. We also detected human
papillomavirus DNA in 58.33% of appropriate samples.
Conclusion: This procedure provides simple and efficient method for recovery of amplifiable
genomic and viral DNA from paraffin wax embedded tissues.

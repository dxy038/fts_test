Although many studies have focused on the hydrological behaviour and classification of wetlands, the wide diversity of wetlands makes a clear and operational view difficult. The objective of this work is to compare the organisation and behaviour of two riparian wetlands (RWs) located, respectively, along Strahler order-2 and order-5 streams of the Scorff River catchment (Brittany, France). Groundwater table dynamics were monitored at the RWs during one hydrological year. Hydrochemistry was characterised during hydrological periods of high and low hydraulic head. The results show clearly the contrast in geomorphological and pedological organisation between the two RWs. In addition, the RW along an order-2 stream exhibited a strong hydrological connectivity with the adjacent hillslope whereas the RW along an order-5 stream showed a strong hydrological connectivity with the adjacent stream. We also observed the contrast between conditions favourable for high and permanent denitrification but on low nitrogen fluxes for order 2, and conditions less favourable to denitrification but on strong nitrogen fluxes for order 5. The relation between the contrasting hydrological and hydrochemical behaviour of these two RWs and their stream orders is discussed from the literature and local observations of the catchment. The results support the hypothesis of a relation between stream order and the hydrological and hydrochemical behaviour of the RWs and thus a catchment-scale organisation which may be taken into consideration in management strategies.

Time and cost efficient software maintenance is promoted to remotely manage devices distributed in the home network. In addition to the currently largely adopted monolithic software management, modular multi-tier software management needs are arising in order to respond to the requirements of various market actors using heterogeneous software platforms, e.g., Linux distributions, OSGi, .NET, MIDP. This paper defines a generic software management model, Genex, which provides a homogeneous view over these different types of platforms. The objective is to use a single generic platform that can manage several underlying heterogeneous platforms at a time. The paper also introduces our initial implementations of the model and presents some experimentation results.

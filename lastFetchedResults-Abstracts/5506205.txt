One of the most useful thresholding techniques using gray-level histogram of an image is the Otsu method. The objective of this paper is to extend it to the 2-dimensional histogram. The 2-dimensional Otsu method utilizes the gray-level information of each pixel and its spatial correlation information within the neighborhood. This method was compared with the 1-dimensional Otsu method. It was found that the proposed method performs much better when the images are corrupted by noise

In this paper a new heuristic hybrid technique for bound-constrained global optimization is proposed. We developed iterative algorithm called GLPτS that uses genetic algorithms, LPτ low-discrepancy sequences of points and heuristic rules to find regions of attraction when searching a global minimum of an objective function. Subsequently Nelder–Mead Simplex local search technique is used to refine the solution. The combination of the three techniques (Genetic algorithms, LPτO Low-discrepancy search and Simplex search) provides a powerful hybrid heuristic optimization method which is tested on a number of benchmark multimodal functions with 10–150 dimensions, and the method properties – applicability, convergence, consistency and stability are discussed in detail.

Recently, the success history based parameter adaptation for differential evolution algorithm with linear population size reduction has been claimed to be a great algorithm for solving optimization problems. Neuro-dynamic is another recent approach that has shown remarkable convergence for certain problems, even for high dimensional cases. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm by embedding the concept of neuro-dynamic into a modified success history based parameter adaptation for differential evolution with linear population size reduction. We have also proposed an adaptive mechanism for the appropriate use of the success history based parameter adaptation for differential evolution with linear population size reduction and neuro-dynamic during the search process. The new algorithm has been tested on the CECÂ´2015 single objective real-parameter competition problems. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing good solutions that are clearly better than those obtained from the success history based parameter adaptation for differential evolution with linear population size reduction and a few of the other state-of-the-art algorithms considered in this paper.

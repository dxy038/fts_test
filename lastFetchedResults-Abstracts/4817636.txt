This paper presents an Interior point method (IPM) and Adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) based hybrid method to solve the contingency constrained optimal power flow (OPF) in power systems incorporated with Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). Versatile FACTS devices TCPS (Thyristor controlled phase shifter) and Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) are considered. In the solution process APSO coupled with IPM to keep the power flows within their security limits. This Hybrid OPF algorithm with FACTS effectively relieves line flow violations under different single line contingencies. Severity Index is used as an objective function to be minimized to improve the security of the power system. The efficiency of proposed algorithm is illustrated by carrying simulation studies on IEEE 30 bus system. This analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm is quite simple and efficient for solving OPF problem.

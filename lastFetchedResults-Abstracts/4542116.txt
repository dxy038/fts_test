We present a switched finite-time control law for the point-to-point control of an underactuated underwater vehicle (UUV) moving in a horizontal plane in a neutrally buoyant condition. The control law consists of a sequential series of control actions, each of which achieves a certain objective, finally resulting in the system being moved to the origin. The methodology is demonstrated for one of the possible three actuator configurations.

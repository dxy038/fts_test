This paper presents the dynamic dimensional synthesis of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) precision parallel manipulator with 3 inextensible links. The dynamic model of the parallel manipulator is provided in detail based on the inverse kinematics. A novel global dynamic performance index of parallel manipulator defined by the maximum driving torque of a single active joint is proposed as the optimization objective function. General design requirements of parallel manipulators such as workspace, speed and accuracy are transformed into polynomial inequalities and combined into a compact linear matrix inequality, thus the dynamic dimensional synthesis is transformed into a max det optimization problem. A set of optimized dimensional parameters of the parallel manipulator is obtained for achieving a good dynamic performance throughout the entire workspace of the manipulator.

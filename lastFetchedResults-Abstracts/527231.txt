Objective: Because many of the medical journals read by family physicians now have an electronic version, the authors conducted a survey to determine the interest of family physicians in specific features of electronic journal publications. Setting and Participants: We surveyed 175 family physicians randomly selected from the American Academy of Family Physicians. Results: The response rate was 63%. About half of family physicians reported good to excellent computer proficiency, and about one quarter used online journals sometimes or often. Many respondents reported high interest in having links to: an electronic medical text (48% for original articles, 56% for review articles), articles' list of references (52% for original articles, 56% for review articles), and health-related Websites (48% for original and review articles). Conclusion: Primary care-oriented journals should consider the interests of family physicians when developing and offering electronic features for their readers.

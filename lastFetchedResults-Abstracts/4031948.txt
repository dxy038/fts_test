The use of polar nonlinear processing to reject a constant carrier envelope (and possibly wideband) jammer of a DS/SS spread spectrum link is explored, with the additional objective of ensuring constant false alarm rate (CFAR) in the reception of the associated DS/SS synchronization preamble. It is shown that the constant carrier envelope jammer can be rejected very effectively, with CFAR, whether it is transmitted continuously or pulsed at some maximally damaging duty cycle

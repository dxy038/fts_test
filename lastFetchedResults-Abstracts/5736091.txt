The unique nature of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) imposes several challenges when providing QoS. Traffic travelling on a MANET can be local traffic arriving from and targeting a node within the ad-hoc network. Traffic that is not local to the MANET is likely to travel over fixed networks that employ DiffServ, IntServ, or a combination of both. This paper investigates the interaction and the relation between a MANET network and a hosting access domain that provide QoS support potentially based on two distinct paradigms (namely IntServ, and DiffServ). The objective is to achieve a high level of autonomy. In this paper we propose a framework solution to the inter-domain agreements and the use of aggregate RSVP for collective resource reservations.

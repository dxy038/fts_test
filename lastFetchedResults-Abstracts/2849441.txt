In this paper, a novel region segmentation and sigmoid function based image fusion method is proposed. Different from the traditional fusion approaches limiting to a single fusion strategy, the proposed method is designed with an adaptive multi-strategy fusion rule (AMFR). In our method, the source images are decomposed into low frequency sub bands and high frequency sub bands via the shift-invariant Shear let transform (SIST). The low frequency sub bands are fused by the choose-max scheme and the high frequency sub bands are fused by the AMFR based on a sigmoid function. The AMFR includes the choose-max scheme and the weighted average scheme, which of them is selected is determined by the sigmoid function. The fused sub bands are merged to reconstruct fused image by using inverse SIST. Experiments conducted on various types of source images demonstrate that our approach achieve superior results compared with the existing fusion methods in both visual presentation and objective evaluation.

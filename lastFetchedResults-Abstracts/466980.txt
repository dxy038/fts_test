Objective: Our purpose was to assess the effects of the adjunctive use of cardiovascular dynamics monitoring in the ambulatory management of 199 pregnant patients with severe hypertension. Study Design: A prospective, observational study was performed. Determinants of mean arterial pressure were computed by using the Hon monitor. Indicators of arterial compliance and effective blood volume were developed. All patients were monitored in the outpatient clinic; additionally, 19 patients self-tested at home. No rigid medication protocol was followed, but furosemide was used in most cases when cardiovascular dynamics monitoring patterns were consistent with volume loading. Otherwise, vasodilators were prescribed. The t test for independent samples was used to compare the home-monitored subgroup with the outpatient-only group. Results: Pregnancy was prolonged by 74 ± 63.9 days (mean ± SD). Mean gestation was 37.6 ± 2.9 weeks, and mean birth weight was 2882.4 ± 837 g. The primary cesarean delivery rate was 23.7%, but only 15 (7.5%) cesarean deliveries were performed because of failed therapy. The 19 home-monitored patients gained 108 ± 75 days (83.1 ± 42.2 days beyond 20 weeks). Conclusion: Adjunctive cardiovascular dynamics monitoring may have a role in the evaluation and management of hypertension during pregnancy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1207-15.)

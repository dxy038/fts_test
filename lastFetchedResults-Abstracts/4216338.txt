The paper presents a novel error robustness method for H.264/AVC video data, based on the redundant data encoding concept. The proposed redundant data codec incorporates the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) theory and motion vectors (MV) of the H.264/AVC scheme. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated under both error free and error prone Internet Protocol (IP) Packet network environments. The proposed architecture improves the error recovery of the system in terms of objective quality. Furthermore, the simulation outcome shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing redundant coding method of JSVM by 0.7 dB in an error free environment and by 0.4 dB in a 10% packet loss rate (PLR) environment with medium and high motion sequences.

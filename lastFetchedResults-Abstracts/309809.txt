Objective:
To evaluate the role of non-conventional lipid risk factors like Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and Apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B-100) and other conventional lipid profile parameters in children and adolescents of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) patients in India; and thereby explain the highest occurrence of premature CAD in this population.
Methods:
Forty-five children and adolescents of premature CAD patients (cases, mean age 12.08 ± 3.71 years) and forty-five age and sex matched children and adolescents of healthy parents without any history or clinical evidence suggestive of CAD were studied (controls, mean age 12.14 ± 3.91 years).
Results:
We found a significant increase in mean levels of Lp(a), Apo B-100, Total cholesterol (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol(LDL-C) and Triglyceride (TG) in cases than controls. In contrast, Apo A-I and High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL-C) values decreased. Lipid Tetrad Index (LTI) and Atherogenic Index in Indian children and adolescents were also calculated. Kolmogorov D statistic and cumulative probability plot suggest that the new Lipid Pentad Index (LPI) defined by us is able to discriminate case and control populations more precisely than the existing LTI and Atherogenic Index.
Conclusions:
The new proposed LPI appears to be a better indicator of lipid risk factors in children and adolescents of premature CAD patients from India, than the prior LTI and Atherogenic Index.

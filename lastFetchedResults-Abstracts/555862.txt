Introduction & Objective: Dorema aucheri is from the piaceae family that exists in margins of Zagros mountains in Iran. In this study, the effect of 200 and 400 mg doses of Dorema aucheri extract on DMBA induced breast tumors in rats was investigated.
Materials & Methods: This experimental study, was conducted in Herbal Medicine Research Center of Yasuj University of Medical Sciences. Forty rats were allocated in experimental and control groups. In experimental groups, after receiving DMBA, Dorema aucheri alcoholic extract in doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg of body weight were used orally for 12 weeks. One group of control animals received DMBA only and the other group received 200 mg of Dorema aucheri extract. At the end of 12 weeks, the tumor mass was isolated and evaluated by hematoxylin eosin histology staining. The average tumor size, number of tumors, and histology of tumors in groups were compared. The gathered data were analyzed using SPSS version 18, using ANOVA and Paired T test.
Results: Mean of tumor number were significantly different in experimental and control groups. No tumor was seen in control group which received 200 mg of the extract while breast tumor was seen in other groups. Mean of tumor number in animals which received 400 mg of extract was significantly higher that the other groups (p<0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that the dose of 400 mg extract of Dorema aucheri increases the tumor size, causes weight loss, decreases longevity and durability of rats while dose of 200 mg of extract reduces the tumor growth and tumor necrosis in Sprague Dawley female rat's with breast tumor induced by DMBA

Companies and professionals are currently demanding increasingly more specialized profiles, and it is therefore desirable for future graduates to have obtained one or more international professional certificates in computing security and auditing, or to at least to have received the preparation required to obtain them. It is therefore of the utmost importance that new studies be focused on professional needs without losing the scientific rigor demanded in engineers. If this objective is to be achieved, it is fundamental that these new study plans be oriented toward facilitating the attainment of these professional certificates. In this paper we establish transversal guidelines for the implementation of content related to computing security in all the subjects, materials and modules of the new degree in Computer Engineering. This will fit perfectly with the material already being taught, will be an enriching element and will allow students to obtain the basic minimum knowledge on security required by any computer engineer from the beginning of their education. The security-related content that is required to be taught during the degree course will additionally be focused on industry and present-day society by means of existing professional security and auditing certificates that will provide future professionals with the knowledge and skills needed as regards security.

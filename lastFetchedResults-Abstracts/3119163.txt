Based on the data investigated into Red-crowned Crane nest-sites in the Zhalong National Nature Reserve in 1996 and the period from 2003 to 2007, the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the nest-sites were analyzed, and the topological index (Voronoi Diagram Area) was calculated. The statistics showed that the spatial distribution of Red-crowned Crane nest-sites featured in the form of spatial clustering. The objects include the nest-sites, residential area, national highways and railways in the Zhalong National Nature Reserve in 2006, and then constructed the Voronoi diagrams to analyze their influence each other. The findings indicated that human activities made a great impact on the spatial distribution of nest-sites and played an important role in protecting the habitat of Red-crowned Crane. It constituted an effective tool that combined spatial data to describe and analyse interactions while providing support for decisions makers. Similarly, an objective quantitative analysis provided a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat.

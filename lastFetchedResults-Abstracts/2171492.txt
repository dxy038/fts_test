The objective of this study was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of 1-butanol in rats. Pregnant rats were given drinking water containing 1-butanol at 0.2%, 1.0% or 5.0% (316, 1454 or 5654 mg/kg/day) on days 0â€“20 of pregnancy. A significant decrease in maternal body weight gain accompanied by reduced food and water consumption was found at 5.0%. No significant increase in the incidence of pre- and postimplantation embryonic loss was observed in any groups treated with 1-butanol. Fetal weight was significantly lowered at 5.0%. Although a significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with skeletal variations and decreased degree of ossification was found at 5.0%, no increase in the incidence of fetuses with external, skeletal and internal abnormalities was detected in any groups treated with 1-butanol. The data demonstrate that 1-butanol is developmental toxic only at maternal toxic doses. No evidence for teratogenicity of 1-butanol was noted in rats. Based on the significant decreases in maternal body weight gain and fetal weight, it is concluded that the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) of 1-butanol for both dams and fetuses are 1.0% (1454 mg/kg/day) in rats.

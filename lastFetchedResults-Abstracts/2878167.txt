The large majority of modern energy systems require multiple operating modes, each with a different control regime. This characteristic lends such systems well to the methods of hybrid control. The transition from relatively simple control systems to more sophisticated multi-mode systems is essential to maintain energy efficiency while keeping the operating costs low. This paper reviews the modelling and control of the hybrid control system and discusses the relationship between hybrid control methods and energy conversion and focuses on optimal control, multi-objective optimisation, modelling methods, control stability, control synthesis and practical application.

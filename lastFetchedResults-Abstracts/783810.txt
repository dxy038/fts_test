Objective The purpose of the study was to examine the
association of temporal factors, in particular days of the
week and seasons of the year and death from suicide in the
United States.
Method Data were pooled from the Multiple Cause of
Death Files. Hierarchical logistic regression models were
fitted to all deaths occurring in 2000 through 2004 by
suicide.
Results The incidence of suicide was significantly higher
on Wednesdays, compared to Sunday. Specifically, individuals
were 99% more likely to kill themselves on
Wednesday than on Sunday. Suicides were more prevalent
in the summer months, and they were less likely to occur in
winter. The state suicide rate significantly elevated individual
suicide risk. The results held even after controlling
for the potentially confounding effects of socio-economic
and demographic variables at both the individual and state
levels.
Conclusion It was concluded that the observed association
between seasonality and suicide cannot be discounted
as a mere coincidence. Future research ought to focus on
integrating individual level data and contextual variables
when testing for seasonality effects

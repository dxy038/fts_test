This paper discusses the modular multilevel cascade converter (MMCC) family based on cascade connection of multiple bidirectional chopper cells or single-phase full-bridge cells. The MMCC family is classified from circuit configuration as follows: the single-star bridge cells (SSBC); the single-delta bridge cells (SDBC); the double-star chopper cells (DSCC); and the double-star bridge cells (DSBC). The term MMCC corresponds to a family name in a person while, for example, the term SSBC corresponds to a given name. Therefore, the term &#8220;MMCC-SSBC&#8221; can identify the circuit configuration without any confusion. Among the four MMCC family members, the SSBC and DSCC are more practical in cost, performance, and market than the others although a distinct difference exists in application between the SSBC and DSCC. This paper presents application examples of the SSBC to a battery energy storage system (BESS), the SDBC to a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) for negative-sequence reactive-power control, and the DSCC to a motor drive for fans and blowers, along with their experimental results.

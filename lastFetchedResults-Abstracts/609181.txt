White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is an ancient traditional multipurpose crop in Ethiopia. However, its use as livestock feed and human food is limited due to its relatively high alkaloid content. With the objective of finding an alternative, low alkaloid annual lupin, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the adaptability and productivity of sweet lupins in four lupin growing locations of Ethiopia. Fourteen sweet lupin cultivars and two bitter cultivars including the Local Landrace (from white, blue and yellow lupin species) were tested in a randomized complete block design with three replications in the summer 2009. Except with yellow entry at Kossober-1 location, the Local Landrace either had similar (P ? 0.0513) or significantly higher (P ? 0.0316) forage yield than white, yellow and blue entries in the other three locations. Compared to blue and white group yellow lupin had higher (P ? 0.0316) forage yield at Kossober-1 but had similar (P ? 0.3635) forage yield in the other three locations. Compared to white group and yellow cultivar, blue cultivars had significantly higher (P ? 0.0350) seed yield across all locations. In terms of seed yield at Finoteselam the local cultivar out yielded (P ? 0.0008) all the sweet lupin groups. This study showed that there is a high potential to cultivate sweet annual lupins in the traditional lupin growing areas of Ethiopia. Sweet blue lupin cultivars can better adapt in both mid and high altitude lupin growing areas of Ethiopia.

This paper proposes a maximum exponential absolute value (MEAV) approach for robust state estimation of power system. We firstly formulate the robust state estimation issue as a maximization problem with an exponential absolute value objective function. Then we give the equivalent model of MEAV and the corresponding solution algorithm based on primal-dual interior point method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MEAV estimator is highly robust to large-scale system with gross errors in measurements. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has also shows good numerical stability and high efficiency in various trials.

Admission control for advanced reservation service in packet switched networks is a complex and challenging task. The task complexity is more critical when the admission control is addressed in optical networks, particularly when service duration are uncertain, priority are provided, and contention is visible. In this paper, we study the problem of admission control and resource management in optical networks. The objective is to maximize user satisfaction in terms of QoS guarantees, service continuity, and reservation cost reduction. At the end, we also propose a novel efficient scheme for advance reservation in optical network that copes with uncertainty, QoS assurance, and traffic priority.

(Background) To remove this doubt, the following question must be answered: what is the impact of media (the independent variable) on the internal structure of the Islamic revolution (the dependent variable)? (Question) Media that is one of the tools of the hegemony of political systems can prevent the instability of discursive subtleties and emergence of the state of dislocation which lead to instability, lack of validity and finally decline of the discourse of Revolution by rebuilding and constant purification of the delicacies and periods of times of the semantic discourse of the Islamic Revolution and protecting their structure around the central axis and contributing to  creating the state of sedimentation by applying the techniques of highlighting and marginalization. (Hypothesis) The authors seek to show that the stability of the internal structure of the Islamic revolution depends upon the continuity of the hegemonic position of its discursive system. (Objective) The present paper is theoretically based on the discourse theory of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe and the theory of hegemony of Antonio Gramsci and all conclusions will all be in this framework to the end of the paper. (Methodology) Discovering the nature of the role of media in strengthening the internal structure of the Islamic Revolution can be regarded as the main finding of the present article. (Findings)

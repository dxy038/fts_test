The problem of scheduling in flowshops with the objective of minimizing makespan, total flowtime and completion time variation is studied in this paper. A simple discrete version of particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is proposed for solving the set of benchmark flowshop scheduling problems proposed by Taillard (1993). The obtained results are better when compared with the results published in the literature.

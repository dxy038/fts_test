This paper presents the results of a high-efficiency high-power (5 kW) non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter. High efficiency, high stability and simplicity are the main goals, and no galvanic isolation is required. The proposed topology is a new BOOST converter with output filter where input and output inductors are coupled together which can be designed to be a minimum phase system. This topology provides therefore input and output current filtering, reducing noise and need of additional filters. Its bidirectionality reduces mass in many applications like in charge/discharge subsystems and lowers cost and component count. This converter is useful with any system that needs backup batteries and therefore has to charge and discharge them properly. It can be applied in space, automotive and telecom application

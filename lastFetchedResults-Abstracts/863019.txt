Qualitative input is encountered in many real decision-making domains. Often such do-
mains include tradeoffs among multiple attributes, and estimates of parameters are often
expressed with some degree of uncertainty. Grey related analysis has been proposed as a
means to use interval fuzzy representation of data. When dealing with multiple criteria
data, model parameters that can involve uncertainty include both performances of alter-
natives on attributes as well as attribute weights. DEA is proposed as an objective way to
derive weights. This paper presents a grey-related fuzzy set methodology incorporating
data envelopment analysis as a way to more objectively rank alternatives. The purpose is
to demonstrate the method. The focus is on identifying alternatives performing the most
efficiently with respect to the decision maker's preference. The method is demonstrated
on a multiattribute siting problem. Simulation is applied to validate model efficiency.

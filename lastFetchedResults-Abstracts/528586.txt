Objective

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a modified Atkins diet for intractable childhood epilepsy.

Materials & Methods

Twenty one children with medically intractable epilepsy were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were at least four seizures per month and a trial of at least three anticonvulsants without becoming seizure-free. The subjects received the diet over a 6-month period.

Results

Three months after diet initiation, 15 patients (71.4%) remained on the diet and 12 (57.1%) had  > 50% seizure reduction. Eleven patients (52.4%) completed the 6-month study and 8 (38.1%) chose to remain on the diet afterward. At 6 months, 9 patients (42.8%) had  > 50% seizure reduction. The diet was more effective in cryptogenic epilepsy (p=0.032). Most complications were transient and successfully managed by careful follow-up and conservative strategies.

Conclusion

The modified Atkins diet is an effective and well- tolerated therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy.

Over the past few years, digital technologies have been growing in such a way that a new generation of fully digital audio broadcasting systems can now become cost effective. For this purpose coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM), a new transmission technique designed in Europe, seems promising. To avoid the allocation of a new bandwidth in the United-States, some groups are proposing the use of power multiplexing to transmit two different signals over the same bandwidth. The objective of this work is to analyze the feasibility of this system taking into account the CD-like quality level of digital audio broadcasting systems (DAB)

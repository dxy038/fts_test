Objective
The prevalence of hypertension in individuals with diabetes mellitus is higher than that in individuals without diabetes mellitus. High fiber intake decreases blood glucose and lipids levels. This study investigated the effects of cereal fiber intake on systolic and diastolic blood pressures in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods

Thirty male Goto Kakizaki rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each group was fed a barley diet, a white rice diet, or cornstarch diet. The rats were pair fed for 16 wk. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured once every 4 wk by the photoelectric oscillometric tail-cuff method without anesthesia.
Results

The barley diet significantly decreased systolic blood pressure from week 12 and decreased the plasma levels of total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There were significant positive correlations between plasma lipids levels and systolic blood pressure.
Conclusions

High fiber intake has beneficial effects on systolic blood pressure and blood lipids levels and suggests that fiber intake should be increased in individuals who have diabetes mellitus to prevent complications.

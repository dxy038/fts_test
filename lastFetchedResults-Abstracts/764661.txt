Objective: The aim of thepresent study is to determine Reliability and Validity of Ultrasonic Wave
Arc Detector Device in Measurement of Lumbar Lordosis Angle Compared with the golden standard Xray
method.
Methodology: After making the device, Lumbar lordosis angle of 31 participants were measured by
three examiners three times in at least two hours intervals with the device for determining of its reliability,
and Lumbar lordosis angle of15 participants were measured through radiographic and proposed
techniques In order to measure the device validity. The participants were selected from available
individuals, and volunteers' people of Birjand city.
Findings: reliability ofthe first, secondand third examiners are 0.97, 0.98 and 0.98 respectively and
reliabilitybetweenexaminersperiods are 0.96, 0.97 and 0.95 respectively, the Correlation
betweentheproposed method andthe reference method is (r=0.95) and it was found to be significant
(p?0.05).
Discussionand conclusion: the high Reliability and validityoftheproposed methodcan be due tothe
least interference of examinerinmeasurement process and use of high-precisionengineering
andcomputationalmethods. So this method can be used for measurement of lumbar lordosis angle Along
with other non-invasive methods can be used as astableand reliablemethod.

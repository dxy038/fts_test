The 
uid 
ow through a bypass graft of 100% stenosed artery can substantially
in
uence the outcome of bypass surgery. To help improve our understanding of this and
related issues, unsteady 
ows for Newtonian/non-Newtonian 
uids using Carreau's shear
thinning model are numerically simulated in an arterial bypass system with complete
occluded host artery. The objective of this study is to deal with the in
uence of the
non-Newtonian property of 
uid, eect of dierent bypass-host artery angle , and 
ow
pulsatility on 
ow conguration, Wall Shear Stress (WSS), Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI),
and 
ow phenomena during the pulse cycle. Here we use  = 30, 45, 60 and 75 to
study the eect of geometry. It is found that  has strong in
uence on hemodynamic in
distal femoral artery anastomoses. Results show that a bypass femoral anastomosis with a
moderate , like  = 45, enhances its long-term performance. Also, signicant dierence
between the non-Newtonian and Newtonian pulsatile 
ows is revealed. This shows the
necessity of using non-Newtonian model rather than Newtonian model for such 
ows. The
unsteadiness of 
ow using the femoral pulse shows complex 
ow characteristics, and requires
the use of unsteady analysis

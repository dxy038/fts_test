The primary objective of this study was to compare the flow number (FN), dynamic modulus (DM), and uniaxial repeated load permanent deformation (RLPD) laboratory tests, used to characterize the HMA mix rutting resistance potential, and establish if they could be reasonably related to each other, and whether, based on these correlations, one test method can be satisfactorily used in lieu of the others. In addition, the concept of FN Index was introduced to quantify the rutting resistance of HMA mixes. Laboratory test results indicated that the FN Index, in contrast to the classical FN (cycles) parameter, exhibited a better correlation with results of both the DM and RLPD tests.

Alternaria spp. have been reported to be the most frequent fungal species invading tomatoes. Certain species, in particular the most common one, A. alternata, are capable of producing several mycotoxins in infected plants and in agricultural commodities. Alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), and tenuazonic acid (TA) are some of the main Alternaria mycotoxins that can be found as contaminants of food. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of water activity (aw, 0.904, 0.922, 0.954, and 0.982) and temperature (6, 15, 21 and 35 °C) on mycotoxin production on a synthetic tomato medium of a cocktail inoculum of five strains of A. alternata isolated from tomato fruits affected by Blackmould. The optimum AOH production occurred at 0.954 aw after 28 days of incubation at 21 °C. A temperature of 21 °C was the most favourable for AOH synthesis at all aw levels. The maximum concentration of AME was determined at 0.954 aw and 35 °C. The optimum conditions for TA accumulation were 0.982 aw and 21 °C. At the 0.904 aw no growth or germination was registered at 6 °C and 15 °C over the whole incubation period. At 21 °C and 35 °C growth occurred slowly but none of the toxins were detected at this aw level. In general, high aw levels were favourable for mycotoxin production. None of the other toxins was detected at quantifiable levels at 6 °C after the whole incubation period. A storage temperature of 6 °C or below could be considered as safe for tomato fruits and high moisture tomato products (aw &gt; 0.95), in relation with Alternaria toxins. The results obtained here could be extrapolated to evaluate the risk of spoilage in tomato fruits and tomato products caused by this pathogen.

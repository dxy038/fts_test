The objective of this study is to propose a model for planning course registration by using a data mining technique: Bayesian network. The proposed model can be used to predict the sequences of courses to be registered by undergraduate students whose majors are computer science or engineering. The data set was obtained from student enrollments and include GPA and grades in each subject for first and second year students from a private university in Thailand. Evaluations show that the predictive power of this model is acceptable. The implications from this studypsilas findings suggest that the model can be applied for advising students in planning courses to be registered in each semester. Further, the model appears to be useful for improving curriculum development in order to fit both studentspsila and university requirements.

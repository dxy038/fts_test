The main objective of this study is to explore the areas of state support towards regional co-operative manufacturing firms. A sample of 96 manufacturing and mining firms that were selected through proportional sampling plan, were provided with a designed questionnaire based on the theoretical concept of the context as well as pervious research in the domain. The findings of the study revealed that 78 percent of co-operative firms have no record of receiving support from state administration offices. A comparison between actual services delivered to the firms by national or local state offices with the expected supports as suggested by their top mangers is an indication of significant gap. On the basis of the research findings however, such a gap is not identical for the four different categories of physical facilities, commercial, technological, and training services that are recognized widely as supporting areas.

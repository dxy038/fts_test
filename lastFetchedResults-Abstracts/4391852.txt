Along this paper, it will be presented how the Electric Vehicle (EV) bidirectional chargers can help the Distribution Grid. In addition to the battery charge and the Vehicle-to-Grid functions (V2G), the reactive power can be compensated according to an established reactive power reference. A three-phase bidirectional inverter connected with a DC link to a DC/DC bidirectional converter is utilized in the topology. The different modifications that are needed in the control algorithm and in the power stage are determined. Simulation results are shown, which prove how the reactive power is being compensated and the saturation of the reactive current is used to keep the power under predefined limits.

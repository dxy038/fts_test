The finite element analysis of the sheet metal forming process involves various nonlinearities. To predict accurately the final geometry of the sheet blank and the distribution of strain and stress and control various forming defects, such as thinning, wrinkling and springback, etc., the accurate integration of the constitutive laws over the strain path is essential. Our objective in this paper is to develop an effective and accurate stress integration scheme for the analysis of three-dimensional sheet metal forming problems. The proposed algorithm is based on the explicit “substepping” schemes incorporating with the stress correction scheme. The proposed algorithms have been implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit via User Material Subroutine (VUMAT) interface platform. The algorithms are then employed to analyze a typical deep-cup drawing process and the accuracy of these algorithms has been compared with the implicit “return” algorithm and explicit forward algorithm. The results indicate that the explicit schemes with local truncation error control, together with a subsequent check of the consistency conditions, can achieve the same or even better level of accuracy as “return” algorithm does for integrating large plastic problems like sheet metal forming process.

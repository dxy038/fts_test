Current web application scanner reports contribute little to diagnosis and remediation when dealing with vulnerabilities that are related or vulnerability variants. We propose a quantitative framework that combines degree of confidence reports pre-computed from various scanners. The output is evaluated and mapped based on derived metrics to appropriate remediation for the detected vulnerabilities and vulnerability variants. The objective is to provide a trusted level of diagnosis and remediation that is appropriate. Examples based on commercial scanners and existing vulnerabilities and variants are used to demonstrate the frameworkÂ´s capability.

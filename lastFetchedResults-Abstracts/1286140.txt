1-(3,5-Diaryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-imidazole derivatives were synthesized and tested for their in vitro antifungal and antimycobacterial activities. These imidazole derivatives showed an excellent antifungal activity against a clinical strain of Candida albicans and an interesting antitubercular activity againstMycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv reference strain.

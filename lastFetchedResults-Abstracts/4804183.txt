Given the abundance and strategic importance of ring fiber-plants in metropolitan area networks, and the accelerating growth of Internet traffic, it is crucial to make use of recent advances in optical networking technologies such as WDM, ROADMs, OXCs and tunable transceivers in order to offer the most cost-efficient traffic transport. The objective of this paper is to present the metropolitan all-optical tuneable AWG-based R-OADM ring network implemented in the ADRENALINE testbed

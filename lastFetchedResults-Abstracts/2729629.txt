Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is considered as a promising measurement technique, in which reconstructing high quality images plays a crucial role in real applications. In this paper, a dynamic reconstruction model, which simultaneously utilizes the ECT measurement information and the dynamic evolution information of a dynamic object, is presented. Based on the image decomposition technique, a generalized objective functional that considers the ECT measurement information, the dynamic evolution information of a dynamic object, the spatial constraint and the temporal constraint is proposed, in which the evolution process of a dynamic object is considered as a sequence of images with different temporal sparse deviations from the background components. An iteration scheme that integrates the advantages of the alternating direction iteration optimization method, the split Bregman iteration technique and the homotopy algorithm is developed for solving the proposed objective functional. Numerical simulations are implemented to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. For the cases simulated in this paper, the accuracy of the images reconstructed by the proposed algorithm is improved and the artifacts in the reconstructed images can be removed effectively, which indicates that the proposed algorithm is successful in solving ECT inverse problems.

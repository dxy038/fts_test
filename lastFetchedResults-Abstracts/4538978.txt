This paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy hybrid force/position control scheme, which can force the end effector of robot manipulators to follow the contour of an object in lack of knowledge of the exact geometric shape. The control objective is to perform hybrid force/position control regardless of the existence of the manipulator dynamics. The control algorithm proposed can adaptively update the position trajectory command as well as fuzzy control rules, and consequently, guarantee the global stability and drive the tracking errors to a neighborhood of zero. The present work is applied to the control of a five degree-of-freedom (DOF) articulated robot manipulator. Simulation results show that the proposed control architecture is featured in fast algorithmic convergence

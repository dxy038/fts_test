The objective of this work was to increase the understanding of the adsorption competition between an odour compound, 2-methylisoborneol, and natural organic material (NOM). Part I describes the characterisation of six commercially available activated carbons, undertaken using nitrogen gas adsorption, surface titrations, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The natural organic material (NOM) from one raw water and four fractions obtained from an isolation and fractionation procedure undertaken on the same raw water, were characterised using 13C NMR, high-performance size exclusion chromatography, UV-visible absorbance and elemental analysis. Simultaneous adsorption of NOM and MIB indicated that the adsorption of the NOM was largely dependent on the pore volume distribution of the activated carbons, and less influenced by the variation in surface chemistry. Larger NOM molecules showed greater relative rates of adsorption where the access to the internal structure of the carbon was restricted by size exclusion, due to the shorter diffusion distances to adsorption sites travelled by the larger molecules. As the concentration of MIB was extremely low compared with that of the NOM in these experiments, no effect of MIB on NOM adsorption was seen. Part II reports the significant effect of the NOM solutions on the adsorption of MIB.

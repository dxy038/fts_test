Objective: This study investigated the effects of emotion induction on moral judgment. Method: Moral judgment of 144 volunteer students, which attributed randomly in 4 groups, was assessed by personal and impersonal moral dilemmas as pretest. Then each group was emotional induced by one of a 4-minute emotional film (Sad, Fearful, Disgusting, or Neutral). Then moral judgment of participants again was assessed by matched dilemmas as posttest. Results: The ANOVA with two within and one between- subjects did not confirmed significant differences between 4 groups in reaction times to moral judgment. However, the differences between RTs to personal and impersonal dilemmas apart from emotion induction was significant (P < 0/05). Also the RTs and type of responses to personal and impersonal dilemmas were significantly different before emotion induction relative to posttest. Conclusion: These findings indicate that there are not significant differences between emotions. It seems that emotions per se influence moral judgment and this effect is related to the kinds of moral judgment.

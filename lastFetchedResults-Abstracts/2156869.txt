Soluble particulate fillers can be incorporated into antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement in an effort to enhance antibiotic elution. Xylitol is a material that shows potential for use as a filler due to its high solubility and potential to inhibit biofilm formation. The objective of this work, therefore, was to investigate the usage of low concentrations of xylitol in a gentamicin-loaded cement. Five different cements were prepared with various xylitol loadings (0, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 g) per cement unit, and the resulting impact on the mechanical properties, cumulative antibiotic release, biofilm inhibition, and thermal characteristics were quantified. Xylitol significantly increased cement porosity and a sustained increase in gentamicin elution was observed in all samples containing xylitol with a maximum cumulative release of 41.3%. Xylitol had no significant inhibitory effect on biofilm formation. All measured mechanical properties tended to decrease with increasing xylitol concentration; however, these effects were not always significant. Polymerization characteristics were consistent among all groups with no significant differences found. The results from this study indicate that xylitol-modified bone cement may not be appropriate for implant fixation but could be used in instances where sustained, increased antibiotic elution is warranted, such as in cement spacers or beads.

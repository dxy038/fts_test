This paper presents a multi-objective performance index based on the size and location of distributed generation (DG) in power system with difference preference of weightages. The placement and sizing of DG are selected optimally by technique of optimization. The technique of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm has been studied to solve this problem. The algorithm is tested on standard IEEE 69 bus distribution system.

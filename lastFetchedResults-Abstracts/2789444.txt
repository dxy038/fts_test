In this paper an Economic Emission Dispatch (EED) problem is proposed to investigate the emission control. The current energy consumption is weighing heavily on fossil fuels which account for about 70-90% of total energy used. These fossil fuels produce harmful gaseous emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) which cause hazardous effects in the atmosphere. Therefore an EED problem which is a non linear bi-objective optimization problem is designed to deal with minimization of two conflicting objectives namely fuel cost and emission from thermal power plants. It is solved with Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) method that effectively handles coupled structures. To validate the effectiveness of proposed method it is tested upon six unit test system.

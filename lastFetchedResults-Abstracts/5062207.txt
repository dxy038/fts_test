This paper addresses QoS management for self-healing Web services. The objective is to provide a healing framework based on service monitoring and architectural-level repair actions. We address these topics in the context of the European project WS-DIAMOND. We implemented and assessed a connector-based healing layer capable of intercepting, analyzing and enhancing SOAP traffic and message contents with QoS data. Our framework supports Service Monitoring and dynamic run-time reconfiguration based on reflective programming.

Optimal capacity estimation of surface reservoir systems with control on reliability of meeting water demands us¬ing mathematical programming techniques has been in¬vestigated in this study. Having control on the reliability needs the use of binary variables, which makes formu¬lation of the required optimization model a mixed inte¬ger linear program (MILP). A hybrid genetic algorithm- linear programming (GA-LP) model has been proposed to deal with solving the MILP models, in which bi¬nary variables are the GA decision variables, while the remaining linear programs are solved by standard LP solvers for objective function evaluations. The model, with 420-840 binary variables, has been used in the op¬timum capacity estimation of the Chergh-Veis dam and compared with branch-and-bound and GA techniques. The results reveal the satisfactory and relative perfor¬mance of the proposed hybrid algorithm compared to its competitors, in terms of computational speed and quality of solutions. However, in a large-scale problem, generating a huge number of binary variables in GA may pose a significant computational burden on the proposed methodology to guide the generated solutions into the feasible space of the problem.

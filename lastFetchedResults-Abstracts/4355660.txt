For efficient and reliable operation of the full hybrid bus assembled with the novel power-train, we have developed a set of control strategy with multi-objective optimization. Based on the structural characteristics of the hybrid power-train, this paper presented the object of optimization, and described multi- constraint conditions. Furthermore, it put forwards the control process and realization method. The operation results of the hybrid buses indicate the feasibility of the control method and the reliability of the control system. The buses consequently show favorable fuel economy with optimization objects realization.

A new method is proposed in this paper to distribute the steady-state errors of the output voltages in a two-output forward converter. The cross regulation among the two output voltages are described in terms of the circuit parameters. An objective function is formed for each of the two dc outputs to track its reference within the specified error. The weighting feedback gains of the two output voltages and the duty cycle range can be determined by the presented control scheme which optimizes the objective function. The proposed method is especially suitable for a two-output system without a dominant load. Experiments on a prototype are performed to show that there exists a duty cycle range and a set of weighted feedback gains satisfying the defined objective function.

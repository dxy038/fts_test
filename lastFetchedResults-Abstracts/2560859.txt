This paper proposes a pseudo-spectral scheme for obtaining approximate optimal control and state. This computational scheme represents the solution of the optimal control problem (OCP) by an mth degree Lagrange interpolating polynomial, using Legendre nodes. Then, OCP of non-linear Volterra integral equation is transformed into an optimization problem. Directed tabu search (DTS) method is utilized to derive the solutions of the optimal control and state as well as the optimal value of the objective function. In the DTS method, two neighborhood-local search strategies based on Nelderâ€“Mead method and adaptive pattern search are applied. In addition, a tabu list with anti-cycling rules, the so-called tabu regions and semi-tabu regions are used. In addition, diversification and intensification search schemes are employed. DTS is able to converge to the global optimum solutions of a set of numerical examples. Therefore, some good balance between the diversification and intensification ensures a faster and efficient convergence to get quality solutions. Numerical examples are provided which confirm the reliability and efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, a comparison is made with optimal solutions obtained by the other numerical methods in the literature.

In this paper we will solve a closed-loop steady-state economic optimization problem for process operation by means of convex optimization techniques. The objective is the simultaneous optimization of controller parameters and steady-state operating condition maximizing the economic profit of the plant. The main point is, given the economic objective of the plant, to replace back-off selection by back-off optimization together with optimal tuning of controller parameters

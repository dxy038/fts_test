The paper seeks to find a grading method for the woven fabric softness. An objective method based on the multi-mechanical properties of the fabric is provided to substitute the subjective method at the beginning of the paper, and the Kawabata evaluation system of fabric (KES-F) is provided to test the mechanical properties of the fabrics. The rest result proved that the comprehensive value M based on the mechanical properties can be used to rank the softness of the fabrics. More sample fabrics are prepared for the grading, and the softness grades of the fabrics is defined by the M value as well as the handle feeling of those fabrics. At the end of the paper, some other fabrics with different softness are provided to evaluate their grades via the equation of M, and the test result proved that the equation is reliable for the softness grading.

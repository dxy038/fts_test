Background & Objective: Epidemiologic studies have shown that infectious agents such as chlamydia pneumonia and helicobacter pylori are linked to ischemic heart disease(IHD). Other studies believe that raised plasma fibrinogen level can be considered as a possible link between H.Pylori infection and IHD.
Method: This analytic cross-sectional study was conducted on 261 patients. 131 hospitalized patients were selected from CCU ward as a case group and 130 hospitalized patients from surgery and orthopedic wards of Iran university of medical sciences hospitals as a control group. HP infection, serum fibrinogen level and cardiovascular risk factors were determined in both case and control groups. T-test, chi-square test, general linear model and logistic regression model were used for data analysis.
Results: H.pylori infection was not in association with IHD and high fibrinogen level was not associated with IHD in cases with H.pylori infection.
Conclusion: Although there was not a link between H.pylori infection, fibrinogen level and IHO in this study, some authors believe that the probable mechanism of this association is that under stimulation by the bacterium mononuclear cells induce a tissue factor-like procoagulant activity that, through the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, converts fibrinogen to fibrin.

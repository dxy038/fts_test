WCDMA network planning decides on where to locate base stations (BS) and which configuration to select considering quality constraints and coverage constraints in order to maximize coverage and minimize costs. Classical approaches optimize these two objectives by combining them together in a single objective. In this paper a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on determined weight and sub-regional search is specialized to solve the problem. A specific encoding represents configuration parameters combination of a base station. Whether or not to coverage for each test point (TP) is determined by the location and the configuration of the BSs. We simplify the model by computing the transmitting power (mobile phone to base station) of mobile phone of each test point and the link power (base station to mobile phone). This reasonable simplicity is efficiently. A local search operator is designed for the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary components by providing a high quality set of alternative solutions.

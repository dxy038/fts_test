Teleophthalmology (TeleOph) is an electronic counterpart of today´s face-to-face, patient-to-specialist ophthalmology system. It enables one or more ophthalmologists to remotely examine a patient´s condition via a confidential and authentic communication channel. Specifically, TeleOph allows a trained nonspecialist in a primary clinic to screen the patients with digital instruments (e.g., camera, ophthalmoscope). The acquired medical data are delivered to the hospital where an ophthalmologist will review the data collected and, if required, provide further consultation for the patient through a real-time secure channel established over a public Internet network. If necessary, the ophthalmologist is able to further sample the images/video of the patient´s eyes remotely. In order to increase the productivity of the ophthalmologist in terms of number of patients reviewed, and to increase the efficiency of network resource, we manage the network bandwidth based on a Poisson model to estimate patient arrival at the clinics, and the rate of ophthalmologist consultation service for better overall system efficiency. The main objective of TeleOph is therefore to provide the remote patients with a cost-effective access to specialist´s eye checkups at primary healthcare clinics, and at the same time, minimize unnecessary face-to-face consultation at the hospital specialist´s center.

This paper presents a comprehensive method for obtaining urgently required critical interface delamination data of material pairings used in electronic packaging. The objective is to thereby enable rapid, inexpensive and accurate lifetime prediction for that failure mode. A new testing method is presented which allows large mode-angle range and enhanced throughput testing under multiple loading conditions, the coverage of which is usually a rather lengthy and resource-demanding procedure. The approach is specimen-centred in the sense that the accent is put on test-specimens which are easily manufacturable industrially, rather than having to adapt them to a special testing machine. The concept is also scalable, i.e. it has potential to work also for smaller samples cut from real devices. We show the first version of a newly developed test-stand and discuss first results for copper-molding compound interfaces and interpret them using simulations.

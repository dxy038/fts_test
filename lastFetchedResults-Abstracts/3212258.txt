Physical beauty ensnares hearts, capture minds, and attract attention. In 1992, Naomi Wolf [1] set aside centuries of speculation when she said that beauty as an objective and universal entity does not exist. Attempts to measure beauty quantitatively have been made by investigators in psychology, arts and image analysis, and more recently in oral and maxillo-facial surgery [4-5]. However, the publications related to analyzing facial attractiveness by computational intelligence are numbered. In this paper, we present an attempt to quantify facial attractiveness through the use of EEG response. This preliminary study aims at describing the data we obtained through questionnaire and EEG recording. The EEG response provides some encouraging differences which acts as a launching point towards the next step of more detailed EEG data analysis using computational intelligence.

Background and Objective: Injection of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin   often causes some local reactions such as  bruising, hematoma , and pain, directly related to inappropriate injection method . This study aimed at determining the effect of injection duration of  SubcutaneousEnoxaparin Sodium on the size of bruising and the severity of injection pain.
Material and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 36 patients medicated by subcutaneous Enoxaparin Sodium (60mg).   They were randomly divided into two groups.  The first group received routine method of subcutaneous anoxaparine injection (10 second duration injection technique) and in the second group in addition to routine method, “10 second waits” before removing needle was performed. Data collection was carried out by using a researcher-made check-list consisting of a section for demographic data and a section to record the extent of bruising and pain intensity.  The Extent of bruising was measured by using  a clear flexible ruler within 24,   48 and 72 hours and pain intensity by visual analog scale (VAS) ,immediately after injection .  We analyzed   the Data by   independent T test and Chi square.  
Results:  The  Results indicate   that  the mean  of pain intensity  in second group ( 3.05±1.71 )  is less than first group ( 3.86 ± 2.75 ) . There is no significant difference between two groups for the extent of bruising in 24,   48 and 72 hours (P > 0.05). 
Conclusion: with regard to  pain intensity and the size  of the bruising, the two groups are not significantly different.

We consider the uplink of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system with a large number of transmitters, where perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitters as well as at the receiver. It is assumed that a certain system throughput has to be achieved independent of the current channel realizations. The objective is to guarantee this throughput with an efficient and fair usage of the available power. We present iterative algorithms allowing the optimization of large systems with more than 100 nodes. This is of particular interest in the context of sensor networks, where many nodes transmit to a central access point and each nodeÂ´s lifetime depends on its energy consumption.

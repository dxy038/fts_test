Objective
Constitutive overexpression of nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK) is a key oncogenic event in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) that carry the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. Global proteomic analysis of NPM/ALK-positive ALCL would improve understanding of the disease pathogenesis and yield new candidate targets for novel treatment and diagnostic strategies.
Materials and Methods

To comprehensively determine the inventory of proteins from NPM/ALK-positive ALCL SUDHL-1 cells, the membrane, cytoplasm, and nuclear subcellular fractions were resolved by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The MS spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST to search the electronic UniProt protein database, and analyzed by ProteinProphet and INTERACT.
Results

A total of 623 proteins consisting of 210 membrane, 229 cytoplasm, and 184 nuclear proteins were identified with a â‰¤5% error rate. Extensive annotation and systematic examination of the literature for information on 209 representative proteins indicated that 19.9% were reported to be expressed in T cells and 44.7% were reported to have important function in cancers, while only 4.3% were reported to be involved in ALCL pathogenesis. Categorization of proteins into functional groups was performed using GOMiner. A subset of the identified proteins was confirmed by Western blots and immunohistochemistry of tissue samples.
Conclusion

We present an extensive catalog of proteins expressed by NPM/ALK-positive ALCL. This study illustrates the potential for novel pathogenetic discovery in NPM/ALK-positive ALCL and the utility of combining cellular subfractionation, 1D SDS-PAGE, and LC-MS/MS for the comprehensive protein analysis of lymphoma.

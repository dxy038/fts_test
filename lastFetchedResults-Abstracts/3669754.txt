As technology advances, interconnection wires are placed in closer proximity and circuits operate at higher frequencies. Consequently, reduction of crosstalk between interconnection wires becomes an important consideration in VLSI design. In this paper, we study the gridded channel routing problem with the objective of satisfying crosstalk constraints for the nets. We proposed a new approach to the problem which utilizes existing channel routing algorithms and improves upon the routing results by permuting the routing tracks. The permutation problem is proven to be NP-complete. A novel mixed ILP formulation and effective procedures for reducing the number of variables and constraints in the mixed ILP formulation are then presented. The new algorithm is tested on three large benchmark circuits as well as many randomly generated circuits. The experimental results are very promising

Recently, many Iranian organizations have adopted Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. This study examines the effective variables on ERP implementation success from the view point of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and Information System (IS) theory. The sample has included firms using ERP and Data has been collected by a questionnaire.  Data Analysis has performed with Anova Test, T Test, CFA and SEM. Results show that competitive pressure are positively related to user satisfaction and organizational performance. As the main objective of a firm is achieving competitive advantages, endurance of competitive pressure, as an aim, can affect user satisfaction as well as performance improvement. On the other hand, user satisfaction has significant effects on improvement of organizational performance. While perceived complexity, training and top management support are positively related with satisfaction of operational managers, they donâ€™t have any role in improving organizational performance. It seems that these variables just lead to increase of user satisfaction and then improvement of organizational performance.

In this study, we have considered the cooperative output synchronisation problem of non-linear multi-agent system. The dynamic of each agent in the network is a class of genuinely non-linear system, named as high-order power integrator that may be uncontrollable after linearisation around the origin. Disturbance is considered in the input channel of each agent as well. Combined Graph theory with the method of adding a power integrator, a distributed controller is designed recursively for each agent to achieve the control objective. The distributed controller of each agent has three parts: state feedback of itself, output information of its neighbours and an adaptive disturbance compensator. It is proved that when the undirected graph is connected, all agentsÂ´ outputs in the network can be synchronised, that is, cooperative output synchronisation is achieved. Simulation result is presented to verify its effectiveness.

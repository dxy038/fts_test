We study through simulation the performance of two swarm intelligence MANET routing algorithms in a realistic urban environment. The two algorithms, ANSI and AntHocNet, implement the swarm intelligence paradigm for routing in different ways: while ANSI applies a reactive approach in which ants are only sent out when no route is available between the source and destination of a communication session, AntHocNet integrates reactive and proactive mechanisms whereby the algorithm sends out ants at regular intervals during the entire duration of running sessions in order to continuously adapt and improve existing routes. The two swarm intelligence routing algorithms are compared to AODV, a state-of-the-art reactive algorithm, and OLSR, a state-of-the-art proactive algorithm. Our objective is to investigate the usefulness of the different approaches adopted by the algorithms when confronted with the peculiarities of urban environments and the requirements of real-world applications. At this aim we define a detailed and realistic simulation setup. We model node mobility by limiting node movements to the streets and open spaces of town, use a ray-tracing approach to model the propagation of radio waves, and investigate different kinds of interactive data traffic patterns, ranging from SMS messaging to VoIP communications.

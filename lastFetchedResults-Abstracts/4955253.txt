The high flexibility of ad hoc wireless networks plays an important role in the design of future wireless generation. In this work, we consider an ad hoc network with nodes communicating the one with each other using multi-hop. Nodes use signal level power control to adjust the amount of transmitted power. The objective of this work is to quantity the amount of interference generated in the network as a function of the relay selection scheme considered. The effectiveness of the power control in reducing the level of interference is also investigated.

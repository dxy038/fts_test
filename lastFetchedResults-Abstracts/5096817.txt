Objective: To study stability of chlorogenic acid (AC) of the Yinhuang Oral Liquid under different conditions. Methods: Ultraviolet spectrometric assay and classical constant temperature accelerated assay were used. Results: The impact of CA stability factors of the Yinhuang Oral Liquid in descending order was oxidant, temperature, sunlight and solvent and at 25 &#176;C, calculating the pure chlorogenic acid and chlorogenic acid of honeysuckle extract in the Yinhuang Oral Liquid, term of valid was 26.25d and 22.4d. Conclusion: factors of oxidant, temperature, sunlight, solvent and purity of chlorogenic acid should be noticed during trial-manufacture of Yinhuang Oral Liquid.

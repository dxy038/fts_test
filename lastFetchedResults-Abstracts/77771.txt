Historically, agricultural production has relied on practices designedto manage nutrients, water, weeds, and crop diseases. Precision agriculture and integrated pest management programs have gone one step further by recognizing the need to target inputs where they are required in the field. The major objective of these programs has been to minimize adverse environmental impacts of intensive agriculture practices and reduce per unit production costs. This review surveys the literature, examining the manipulation of microbial (primarily bacterial) populations as linked to agricultural production, and discusses new approaches that involve the precision management of microorganisms in the agro-ecosystem. It is proposed that our understanding of plant-soil interactions can be greatly refined through the development of "smart" field technology, where real-time, computer-controlled electronic diagnostic devices can be used to monitor rhizosphere and plant health. We submit that "smart field" generated information could be used to develop a prescription for timely and low-level production interventions that will avoid the traditional inundative approaches to crop maintenance and soil husbandry. Consequently, a lesser impact on the agricultural soil environment is envisioned. The maximization of production efficiencies will also involve the development of crop cultivars that are bred specifically to capitalize on beneficial plant-microbial associations.

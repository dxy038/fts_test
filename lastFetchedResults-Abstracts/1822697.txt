Objective
luate in vitro the effectiveness of different calcium-silicate (CS) cements specifically designed for dentine permeability reduction.

dentine discs were prepared from caries free human molars extracted for surgical reasons. The treatment consisted in applying two different experimental CS cements on dentine surface. Dentine discs treated only with EDTA served as negative control group. Treatment with D-Sense Crystal and Clearfil S3-Bond served as positive control groups. After treatment samples were immersed in artificial saliva. The quantitative changes in the hydraulic conductance (i.e. permeability) through dentinal tubules were quantified using a hydrostatic device working at 6.9 kPa. Dentine permeability was measured immediately after EDTA treatment, 10 min and 1 week after treatment application and immersion of dentine samples in artificial saliva. SEM/EDX analyses were performed to obtain qualitative information on dentine morphology and surface deposits.
s
perimental CS cements reduced dentine permeability immediately after application and also 10 min and 1 week after the immersion of the specimens in artificial saliva. D-Sense Crystal and Clearfil S3-Bond showed higher levels of dentine permeability after 1 week of immersion in artificial saliva.
sions
ents reduced dentine permeability in vitro even after immersion in artificial saliva, which makes them new valuable candidates for treatment of dentine hypersensitivity in vivo.

Legged robots are being the target of several studies and research. The idea is to develop machines that present characteristics approximate to the ones observed in biological living creatures. However this objective is still relatively far away and the development of prototypes for these studies is expensive and time consuming, which leads to the creation of models that allow the realization of the intended studies in software. These models should include the main characteristics of biological creatures relevant for locomotion studies. Given this, the presented work describes the development of a quadruped robot model in MATLAB/Simmechanics TM. This model is intended to be used in the development of gaits for legged robots based on Central Pattern Generators. With this purpose in mind, the model was developed in a way to accept different gaits by direct introduction of the angular positions of the knee and hip joints. Various parameters of the robot are also easily changed through a configuration file that accompanies the model. This paper presents the model of a robot with flexible body, its legs and its hip and knee joints. The model of a feet-ground interaction was also modelled using a theoretic model described in the literature.

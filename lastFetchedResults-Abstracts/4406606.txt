This paper describes a near unity power factor rectifier with low harmonics. Small size, low cost, high efficiency are the main features of this rectifier configuration. This configuration makes use of three active bidirectional switches to achieve power factor correction. The switches are rated at a small percentage of total power processed and is switched at a very low frequency. The analysis of this configuration is carried out in this paper with a design example and is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK and it demonstrates its high power factor and low harmonics. A simple SPWM inverter with a star connected R-L load is used as the load to the rectifier.

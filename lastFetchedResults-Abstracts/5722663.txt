The objective of this paper is to propose an improved sigma-delta (Sigma-Delta) modulation full-bridge inverter to drive the piezoelectric actuator for the vibration suppression system. The improved Sigma-Delta modulation strategy has the merit of circuit simplicity. Computer simulations and hardware experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed Sigma-Delta modulation. A 200 W prototype full-bridge inverter with the proposed Sigma-Delta modulation is built to drive the piezoelectric actuator for the vibration suppression system. Measured waveforms of the acceleration sensors show that the vibration of the platform can be reduced significant.

An event-driven simulation tool aimed at testing access control mechanisms in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) environment is presented. It is dedicated to the behavioural description of an ATM virtual circuit (VC) switch. The purpose is to test resource allocation and call admission control (CAC) strategies; so, only the relevant events for this objective are considered and some important functions (e.g., the switching element) for a complete description of an ATM switch are not explicitly modelled. Along with the description of the simulation tools; some resource allocation and CAC are also reported, and several simulation results are discussed, in order to assess their performance

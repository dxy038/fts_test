The multi-objective optimal problems are usually solved with linear weight method, but each weight factor is a constant in this method. It canÂ´t respond to the interaction effects to each sub-objective in the optimization process. After analyzing the similarity between closed-loop feedback control in the control systems and the dynamic progress of multi-objective optimization calculating, the paper develops a method of variable-weight and assessment functions. The method is based on closed-loop feedback control theory. At last, an example of multi-objective optimization is given to verify if the method is validity.

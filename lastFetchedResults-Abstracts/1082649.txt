Background and Objective: It is presumed that human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) is the necessary cause of all different forms of Kaposi’s sarcoma which is the most common neoplasm in HIV-infected persons. In this study, we wanted to determine the prevalence of HHV-8 infection in all the available Isfahan (Central of Iran) HIV positive individuals in comparison with healthy blood donors, and also investigating the risk factors of HIV infections in both groups.
Material and Methods: In this cross sectional study, the samples were consisted of 50 healthy HIV –negative blood donors and all the available Isfahan HIV positive individuals (55 persons). The selected people fulfilled a questionnaire about personal demographic information. The blood samples were examined using Biotrin kit to detect anti HHV-8 antibody (IgG).
Results: In HIV positive group, 10 persons (18.2%) tested positive for HHV-8, but none of the control group had positive test. We analyzed risk factors for AIDS and found, as expected, strong associations between HIV infection with addiction, being in prison, travelling out of Iran, low educational status and being single or having multiple sexual partner but there is no differences between HHV-8 positive and negative group.
Conclusion: The prevalence of HHV-8 in HIV positive persons is high in Isfahan and preventive care may be beneficial. A future study including a large population from different high risk groups and general population in Iran is needed in order to define seroepidemiology and risk factors associated with HHV-8 infection.

This paper proposes a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach to the multi-objective synthesis of switching Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) controller. The design objectives of the closed-loop system include the robustness performance w.r.t model uncertainties and bounded disturbance, the convergence speed, and the constraints on the control input. All objectives are derived from the Lyapunov approach and they are formulated as LMI conditions. Thus, controller design task amounts to solving a LMI optimization problem. The air system control problem of a turbocharged spark ignited (TCSI) engine is used to illustrate the validity of the proposed method..

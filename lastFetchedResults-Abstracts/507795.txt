The hub location problem appears in a variety of applications, including airline systems, cargo delivery systems and telecommunication network design. Hub location problems deal with finding the location of hub facilities and the allocation of demand nodes to these located hub facilities. In this paper, a new model for the capacitated single allocation hub covering location problem is presented. Instead of using capacity constraints to limit the amount of flow received by the hubs, the second objective function is introduced to minimize service times in the hubs. The service time in the hubs includes the waiting time of received flows in a queue and the time to get services. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, a new weight-based multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA) is designed to find near-optimal solutions. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the solutions obtained by the MOICA are compared by the exact solutions of the mathematical programming model.

Modern satellite telecommunications are moving toward the use of large capacity systems exploiting fade mitigation techniques such as reconfigurable on-board antenna systems to face channel attenuation. In this work we propose a new Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm (SOGA) able to optimize the spatial distribution of the radiated power, taking into account the effect of non-ideal antenna components. A preliminary analysis shows that the genetic algorithm, due to its flexibility, is more effective in handling the system non-ideality than standard optimization methods based on a deterministic approach.

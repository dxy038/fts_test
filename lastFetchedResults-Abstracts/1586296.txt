This paper presents a simulation framework incorporating traffic simulator with classical discrete event simulation model of internal transport systems. The objective behind this integration is to provide a simulation model in which traffic is captured in the internal haulage networks. For this purpose, the highly detailed microscopic traffic modelling approach is adopted. The developed simulator can reproduce the punctual trucks movementâ€™s in the haulage network between pickup and delivery stations. Furthermore the complex traffic behaviour of platoon formation and congestion propagation is accurately emulated. This traffic behaviour is widely uncounted and criticized in the outdoor and internal transport system such as in container terminals and in surface mines applications. Experiments are conducted in two typical surface mines transportation systems. Results demonstrate that when the dispatching and routing problem is solved based on such detailed simulation model; the real-time truck fleet management is enhanced and the inherent traffic in the internal transport system is controlled.

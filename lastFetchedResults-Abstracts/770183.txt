Since November 1997 the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG) has released 13 captive-bred black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata) into the Betampona reserve in eastern Madagascar. Five of the thirteen are currently surviving, including one male who has integrated into a wild group. Five of the released lemurs fell victim to predation by fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), one died of malnutrition, one disappeared from the reserve and one was withdrawn from the release programme. Ten of the released lemurs survived for more than one year post release, although all required varying levels of supplementary feeding. One pair bred twiceâ€”the first time the infants did not survive, but on the second occasion triplets were successfully raised beyond weaning. One of the triplets (male) is still surviving. One male has integrated into a wild group and sired a single infant in 2002 and a female released in 2001 gave birth to twins sired by a wild male also in 2002. The release programme has thus achieved a major objective of reinforcing the existing wild population. To date there is no significant difference in survival rates between animals born and raised in free-ranging environments and those raised in cages, between animals greater than or less than 5 years old at time of release, or between males and females.

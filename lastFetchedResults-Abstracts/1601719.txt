The objective of this paper is to solve differential algebraic equations using a multiquadric approximation scheme. Therefore, we present the notation and basic definitions of the Hessenberg forms of the differential algebraic equations. In addition, we present the properties of the proposed multiquadric approximation scheme and its advantages, which include using data points in arbitrary locations with arbitrary ordering. Moreover, error estimation and the run time of the method are also considered. Finally some experiments were performed to illustrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, even when the data points are scattered and have a closed metric.

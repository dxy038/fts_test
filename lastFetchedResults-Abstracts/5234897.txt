Product innovation is an important means to compete for markets for enterprises during the era of mass customization. Manufacturing enterprises pay more attention to the innovation ability in product design and development field. The objective of this research is to solve rapid innovation design questions of the large-scale valve through establishing rapid design process model based on product platform. At the same time, the model is used in the actual product innovation design process. Combining with actual circumstances of a large-scale valve enterprise in China, rapid design process model based on the platform strategy is proposed. It includes three parts: platform establishing process, configuration resources database constructing process and platform applying process. Platform establishing process accomplishes constructing process of product platform. Configuration resources database constructing process is to program platform´s product family according to platform configuration model of valve products and store correlative information of valve products. Platform applying process is a rapid design process according to the customers´ customized demands. Moreover, key technologies based on the rapid design process model are analyzed. Prototype system and factual application example is addressed.

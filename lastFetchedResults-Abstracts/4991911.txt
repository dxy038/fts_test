This summary introduces a new scheme of a three-phase power factor PWM rectifier with galvanic isolation, a single voltage control loop and a single switch. The association of three bidirectional flybacks working in the discontinuous current mode allows the attainment of a unity power factor. A step-down or step-up voltage operation and an appropriated transformer ratio makes it possible to obtain a large range of output voltage

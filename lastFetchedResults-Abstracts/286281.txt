Background:  The authors report a case of a 47-year-old woman who suffered a severe allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in the vulvar area after using Poise thin incontinency pads. She had a past history of ACD after the use of sculptured acrylic nails and after the installation of a dental crown. Objective: The aim of this report is to show the spectrum of (meth)acrylate allergy in one individual. Methods:  Patch testing of moistened inner and outer aspect of the pad was performed. We also patch tested with the North American Contact Dermatitis Group series of 50 allergens, the dentistry series, various catalysts and inhibitors used in acrylic resin systems, and some epoxy acrylates. Results: Positive ACD reaction occurred to both sides of the pad, with the inner aspect being stronger than the outer aspect. There were also multiple (meth)acrylate allergies. Conclusion: This case shows a new potential source of allergy to (meth)acrylates.

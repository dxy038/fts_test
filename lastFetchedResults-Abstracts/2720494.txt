Energy efficient power coefficients at the relay are derived in a closed-form expression for the green multi-input-multi-output relaying system in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, where the objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE), which is defined by the ratio of the spectral efficiency (SE) to total power consumption, with a minimum SE requirement under practical power consumption models. In particular, we derive closed-form solutions using the high SNR approximation, which turn out to be different from the water-filling solution. Simulation results show that the proposed solution nearly achieves the optimal EE in all SNR regimes.

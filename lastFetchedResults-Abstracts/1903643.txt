Setting down rules and regulations has vital role in supervision the
governments' space military activities on outer space. In the end of 1960s,
space activities hadn't any military value. However nowadays, at least
75% of space objects in order to eliminate military needs launch into
space. There is no place for doubt that space military activities increase
coming wars. In recent decades, some countries have begun militarization
of outer space to advance their national security strategy as a priority.
Nevertheless, this trend will threat international peace and security.
Existing legal norms failed to provide supervision upon placement and
application of unconventional space weapons. The main objective of
present research is to answer the following questions: What are
characteristics and position of space weapons in viewpoint of
international law? Are utilizing the conventional or defensive spacebased
weapons justified? Does space- based weapons application not
breach the so-called principle "peaceful uses of outer space"? Do existing
international law rules suffice for enforcement of outer space
disarmament? The results of present research show that the legal norms
for limitation of space- based weapons require revision and evolution.

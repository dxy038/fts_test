The final objective of the study is to provide correlations and models, which are able to describe axial compressor behaviour in some particular incidental or accidental conditions, such as stall. The present contribution consists to establish and begin to validate numerical simulations by comparison with representative experimental data on a planar static compressor cascade. Trio_U software is used to perform Large Eddy Simulations with a standard wall-function (SWF) or a two-layer approximate boundary conditions (TBLE). The results obtained show a good behaviour of the TBLE model compared to an open literature case of the gas turbine aircraft community. Sensitivity studies are performed on various parameters (solidity, angle of incidence) and take part of a database.

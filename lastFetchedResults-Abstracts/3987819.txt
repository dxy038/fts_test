The size and complexity of modern dependable computing systems has significantly compromised the ability to accurately measure system dependability attributes such as fault coverage and fault latency. Fault injection is one approach for the evaluation of dependability metrics. Unfortunately, fault injection techniques are difficult to apply because the size of the fault set is essentially infinite. Current techniques select faults randomly resulting in many fault injection experiments which do not yield any useful information. This research effort has developed a new deterministic, automated dependability evaluation technique using fault injection. The primary objective of this research effort was the development and implementation of algorithms which generate a fault set which fully exercises the fault detection and fault processing aspects of the system. The theory supporting the developed algorithms is presented first. Next, a conceptual overview of the developed algorithms is followed by the implementation details of the algorithms. The last section of this paper presents experimental results gathered via simulation-based fault injection of an Interlocking Control System (ICS). The end result is a deterministic, automated method for accurately evaluating complex dependable computing systems using fault injection

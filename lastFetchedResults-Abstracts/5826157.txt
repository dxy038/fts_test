A modification of Smith predictor for controlling the higher order processes with integral action &amp; long dead-time is proposed in this paper. The controller used in this Smith predictor is an Integral-Proportional Derivative controller, where the Integrator is in the forward path &amp; the Proportional and Derivative control are in the feedback, acting on the feedback signal. The main objective of this paper is to design a dead time compensator (DTC), which has minimum tuning parameters, simple controller tuning, robust performance of tuning formulae &amp; to obtain a critically damped system which is as fast as possible in its setpoint &amp; load disturbance rejection performance. The controller in this paper is tuned by an adaptive method. This paper also presents a survey of various dead time compensators and their performance analysis.

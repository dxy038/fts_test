A multipurpose optimization of deregulated distribution network is proposed in this paper. Enhancing system reliability and minimizing energy supply cost (ESC) are considered in the proposed objective function. The solution of the propose problem is based on reconfiguration technique, and using binary genetic algorithm (BGA). A typical test system in both traditional and deregulated environments are investigated to compare the obtained results. Finally, the validity of proposed solution method is demonstrated by developing an exhaustive search technique.

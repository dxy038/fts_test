In this paper a new discontinuous control scheme for uncertain nonminimum phase LTI SISO plants is presented. The proposed controller is based on the possibility of exploiting the capability of a model with a discontinuous pre-filter for tracking an implicit reference model given by the series of an all-pass filter and a first order system, as required in the nonminimum phase case. Moreover, the peculiar control structure ensures that the set of the admissible equivalent control signals contains the ideal bounded control which makes the model-following objective be attained

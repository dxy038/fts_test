The objective of this paper is to analyze the laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid, pressurized and sheared, through a two-dimensional channel with one sinusoidal wall. The motivation of this work is the investigation of shear flows in lubrication. The effects of Reynolds number and the geometrical dimensions on the velocity distributions and on the flow factors are studied numerically using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The results are verified with analytical and other numerical solutions.

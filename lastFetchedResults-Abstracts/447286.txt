PURPOE: To compare the effect of topical indomethacin 0.1% olution with the effect of topical dexamethaone 0.1% phophate olution on ign and ymptom of inflamed pterygium and pinguecula.

METHOD: Of 50 conecutive patient who had inflamed pterygia (n = 17) or pingueculae (n = 33), met the tudy criteria, and igned an informed conent, one eye of each patient wa evaluated in a comparative, propective, randomized, double-maked, controlled tudy. Objective ign (conjunctival congetion, redne and edema, and taining of cornea) and ubjective complaint (photophobia, pain, foreign-body enation, dicomfort, and tearing) were evaluated and cored. We alo evaluated “total ign,” “total ymptom,” and “total core.” Group 1 (n = 25) received topical indomethacin 0.1% olution, and group 2 (n = 25) received a topical dexamethaone phophate 0.1% olution ix time daily for 3 day, then four time daily over the following 11 day. Patient were examined before treatment, on day 3, 7, and 14 after the treatment wa initiated, and 2 and 4 week after the treatment wa dicontinued.

REULT: In both group, the core for “total ign,” “total ymptom,” and “total core” were ignificantly lower (P = .001) by day 14. There were no difference between group 1 and 2 for “total ign,” “total ymptom,” and “total core” at day 3, 7, and 14 (P = .07 to P = .88). After treatment wa dicontinued, the dexamethaone-treated group experienced a ignificantly greater recurrence of “total ign” (P = .023 at day 30, P = .02 at day 45), but there wa no tatitically ignificant difference in “total ymptom” and “total core.” Patient in group 2 reported more tinging after drop were adminitered than patient in group 1 (P = .002).

CONCLUION: Thi tudy indicate that topical indomethacin 0.1% olution i a effective a topical dexamethaone phophate 0.1% olution for the treatment of inflamed pterygium and pinguecula and, therefore, i uggeted a an effective treatment for thee condition.

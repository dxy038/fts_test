The main objective of this paper is to develop Fuzzy controller to analyse the performance of instantaneous real active and reactive current (id-iq) control strategy for extracting reference currents of shunt active filters under balanced and un-balanced voltage conditions. When the supply voltages are balanced and sinusoidal, then all control strategies converge to the same compensation characteristics. However, when the supply voltages are distorted and/or unbalanced sinusoidal, these control strategies result in different degrees of compensation in harmonics. The p-q control strategy unable to yield an adequate solution when source voltages are not ideal. Extensive simulations are carried out with Fuzzy controller for I<sub>d</sub>-I<sub>q</sub> control strategy under different main voltages. The 3-ph 4-wire shunt active filter (SHAF) system is also implemented on a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS Hardware) to further verify its effectiveness. The detailed simulation and RTDS Hardware results are included.

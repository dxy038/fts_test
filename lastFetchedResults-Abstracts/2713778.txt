In this paper, we present a communication protocol between a pair of biological nanomachines, i.e., a transmitter and a receiver, built upon molecular communications in an aqueous environment. In our proposal, the receiver, acting as a control node, sends a connection setup signal to the transmitter, which stokes molecules, to start molecule transmission. The molecules transmitted by the transmitter propagate in the environment and are absorbed by the receiver through its receptors. When the receiver absorbs the desired quantity of molecules, it releases a tear-down signal to notify the transmitter to stop the transmission. The proposed protocol implements a bidirectional communication by using a number of techniques originally designed for the TCP. In fact, the proposed protocol is connection-oriented and uses the TCP-like probing to find a suitable transmission rate between the transmitter and the receiver to avoid receiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not used since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large delay, which is a characteristic feature of molecular communications. Thus, the proposed protocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the receiver to throttle the transmission rate at the transmitter, i.e., explicit negative feedback. We also present the results of an extensive simulation campaign, used to validate the proposed protocol and to properly dimension the main protocol parameters.

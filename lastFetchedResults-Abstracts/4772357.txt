In this paper, we consider a MU-MISO system where users have highly accurate Channel State Information (CSI), while the Base Station (BS) has partial CSI consisting of an imperfect channel estimate and statistical knowledge of the CSI error. With the objective of maximizing the Average Sum Rate (ASR) subject to a power constraint, a special transmission scheme is considered where the BS transmits a common symbol in a multicast fashion, in addition to the conventional private symbols. This scheme is termed Joint Multicasting and Broadcasting (JMB). The ASR problem is transformed into an augmented Average Weighted Sum Mean Square Error (AWSMSE) problem which is solved using Alternating Optimization (AO). The enhanced rate performance accompanied with the incorporation of the multicast part is demonstrated through simulations.

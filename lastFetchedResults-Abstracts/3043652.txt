This paper introduces the authorsÂ´ recent research in control system processing. Although its final objective is to develop some cost-area-effective system-on-chip (SoC) solutions, the technique applied is a new concept for digital control. It shows that control laws can be efficiently implemented with 1-bit signals at both the input and output. At the same time, the silicon area can be significantly reduced when realising controllers on FPGAs.

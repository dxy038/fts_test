It is difficult to imagine the development of business processes in a complex environment like the telecommunication market without any form of modelling. Examples are structured texts, informal diagrams or models with more precise structures as formal models. The modelling objective in this case is, to clearly express the requirement of the development of business processes and provide a better base for the analysis of the required functionality. In this paper, the role and the importance of modelling in the development of business processes, in the areas of telecommunications were explored. Based on this research, a model of business processes in the area of telecommunication network has been suggested. The proposed model enables definition and description of a business process through multiple levels of abstraction. At the highest level of abstraction, the model describes the basic functionality and communication between management systems that participate in the realization of service activation. At lower levels of abstraction, the model defines details required for the specification of system support, which is needed for management of service implementation. Finally, the use of formal methods enables the simulation of business processes through the defined system support.

In this paper the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel characteristics of a typical office environment are with a 4&#215;4 MIMO channel sounder at 2.35GHz with 100MHz band-width. The objective of this work is to obtain a better assessment of the potentials of indoor communications by characterizing the wideband indoor channels. We focus on the characteristics of time dispersion and correlation with multiple polarized antennas. For different scenarios, the channel capacity is also analyzed. Finally, the reciprocity of delay spread and multipath is investigated.

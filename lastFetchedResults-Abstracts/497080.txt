This investigation examined transactional relations across contextual strain, parenting quality, and child adjustment in 209 mothers and children at 24, 42,
and 72 months of age. Independent ratings of mothers’ stressful life events, social support, and relationship quality provided an objective measure of
maternal contextual strain. Observers evaluated parenting quality during parent–child interactions at each time point. Child regulatory functioning during
laboratory tasks at 24 and 42 months was evaluated by independent observers based on both behavioral (e.g., noncompliance, distractibility) and
emotional (e.g., frustration, anger) indices. At 72 months, teachers reported on children’s externalizing behaviors, and children completed objective measures
of academic achievement. Nested path analyses were used to evaluate increasingly complex models of influence, including transactional relations
between child and parent, effects from contextual strain to parenting and child adaptation, and reciprocal effects from child and parent behavior to contextual
strain. Over and above stability within each domain and cross-sectional cross-domain covariation, significant paths emerged from maternal contextual
strain to subsequent child adjustment. Bidirectional relations between parenting and child adjustment were especially prominent among boys. These findings
counter unidirectional models of parent-mediated contextual effects by highlighting the direct influences of contextual strain and parent–child transactions
on early childhood behavioral and academic adjustment, respectively

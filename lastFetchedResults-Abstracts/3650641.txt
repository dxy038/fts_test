The temperature-sensitive magnetic semiconductor is one kind of ferrite which is called a temperature-sensitive magnetic core whose magnetic and electrical properties both exhibit a marked temperature dependence. The temperature-sensitive magnetic semiconductor can be regarded as a multi-ability magnetic semiconductor device, having the effect of adding a thermistor and a bidirectional diode to the temperature-sensitive magnetic core.

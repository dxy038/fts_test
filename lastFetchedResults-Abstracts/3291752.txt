This paper presents a three-to-three phase bidirectional partial resonant AC Link converter. The converter is modeled in MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The converter has three phase fixed input supplying a three phase load at variable voltage and variable frequency. The converter topology uses two bi-directional switches for each leg of the converter resulting in a total of 12 switches. The high frequency charging and discharging of the link inductor is the main criteria for power transfer from input to output. In each cycle a small interval is allocated for resonances which enables the switches for soft zero voltage turn on and turn off. The converter has the ability for buck and boost operation. Simulation and real-time results are shown for the verification of the proposed converter.

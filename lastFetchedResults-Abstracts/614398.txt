Introduction & Objective: Self-care is one of the most important factors in controlling diabetes.
Sometimes self-care is not possible due to certain barriers which inhibit the patientâ€™s role in
controlling the disease. This study aims to identify the barriers against self-care in diabetic
patients and to find their associations with diabetes control.
Materials & Methods: The subjects of our study were 225 patients with type II diabetes who
were selected randomly. Data gathering devices were demographic and self-care behavior
questionnaires with 34 questions about the barriers of self-care behavior scaling from low(1)
to high (5). All cases were tested for HbA1c before entering into the study.
Results: The findings of this study showed that there are different barriers against self-care
behavior including high costs of care/management, busy lifestyle, depressive effect of the
treatment, forgetfulness, unawareness of the self-care programs, having no tendency toward
the program, unawareness of blood glucose test interpretation and disbelief in self-care
results. Among the mentioned barriers, cost of management/care (r=0.24) and depression
(r=0.21) had significant associations with higher HbA1c levels.
Conclusion: The result of the study indicates that one of the important factors in successful
treatment of diabetic patients is to help them to be active in their self-care. Therefore health
care team not only should train them to do self-care properly but also they should guide the
patients to remove the barriers to reach the best results.

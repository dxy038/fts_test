We studied the presence and numbers of macrophages in the different compartments of the human menstrual corpus luteum (CL) in relation to the proliferative activity and apoptosis in luteal cells. Macrophages were recognized by immunohistochemical demonstration of the lysosome-associated glycoprotein CD68, and proliferating cells by immunohistochemical detection of the cell cycle-related protein Ki67 and by counting mitotic cells. In general, changes in the number of macrophages were parallel to the functional activity of the CL. Macrophage numbers increased up to the end of the early luteal phase, remained relatively unchanged during the midluteal phase, and decreased at the late luteal phase. Furthermore, macrophages showed prominent morphological changes during the cycle. They showed round or elongated cytoplasm during the early and late luteal phases, and dendritic features in the midluteal phase. Proliferating cells were very abundant on Days 15-16 and showed a significant decrease thereafter. Most proliferating cells corresponded to stromal (mainly vascular) cells. However, about 5% of granulosa-lutein cells and about 15% of theca-lutein cells were proliferating during the early and midluteal phases. Regression of the CL at the late luteal phase was associated with both a decrease in the number of proliferating cells and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, which were highly increased on Days 25-27 of the cycle. The number of macrophages was not related to cell proliferation nor to cell death during the luteal phase. The observed changes in both macrophage number and morphology suggest the existence of a bidirectional communication between macrophages and steroidogenic cells in the human CL, or regulation of both cell populations by similar mechanisms.

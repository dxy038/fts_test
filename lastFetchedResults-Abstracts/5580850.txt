In this paper we introduce a novel decoupled fuzzy sliding mode (DFSM) controller for swinging-up an inverted pendulum. In the proposed technique the control objective is decomposed into two sub-tasks: swing-up and stabilization. Accordingly, first a DFSM controller stabilizing the poles is synthesized. Next, a rule-based regulator dealing with the task of entering a stabilization zone is synthesized. Two different structures are proposed for the swing-up controller. In the first strategy the control action is obtained by a crisp approach, while in the second one the controller is based on fuzzy rules. Experimental tests show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for swinging-up an inverted pendulum with restricted cart travel and limited control action.

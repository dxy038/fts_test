A nondestructive measurement technique, which uses a four-wavelength bidirectional optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) to measure the chromatic dispersion distribution along a single-mode fiber, is compared with the destructive interferometric technique. The experimental results obtained by this technique are in good agreement with those obtained by the interferometric technique. In addition, a measurement procedure is proposed for a transmission line composed of different types of single-mode fiber. These results show that this technique is extremely useful for the design of wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) and finite difference multiplexer (FDM) optical communication systems

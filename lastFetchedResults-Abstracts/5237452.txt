The multi-objective fuzzy optimal method based on the fuzzified optimal solutions of single objectives need not list all non-inferior solution sets, which can optimize directly objectives in value area of variables. This method can reflect the interrelation between individual objective optimal solutions and multi-objective optimal solution. On the basis of fundamental principle of multi-objective fuzzy optimization and genetic algorithm, combing with the concept of objective relative subject degree, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization approach for the hydroelectric power system with contradictory objectives. The proposal method considers the satisfied degree of various characters and contradictory objectives and seeks an appropriate optimized solution to make each objective optimal as possible considering each objective comprehensively. The simulation results of example show that the fuzzy genetic algorithm is an effective method for multi-objective optimization problem in the cascaded hydroelectric plants

The objective of this study is to investigate the maximum strength and the fatigue strength of studs subjected to the alternating load as well as the pulsating load. First, in order to conduct a series of static and fatigue test of studs under both the load conditions, we devise a new specimen to which the alternating shear force can be applied easily by general fatigue testing machines. Employing the devised specimens, the shear forceâ€“slip behavior, the maximum strength and the fatigue strength of studs under the alternating load condition are investigated and are compared with those under the pulsating load condition.

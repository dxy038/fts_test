With more competition and ever changing consumer demands, manufacturers are frequently realizing to reengineer their facility to satisfy the needs of many product groups. In such cases simulation can be a useful tool when analyzing complex production systems to help sort through cause-and effect relationships and gain a better understanding of what is actually causing a particular problem in the system. Once problems are identified, changes for improvement can be made more intelligently and then verified using simulation. The paper presents modeling of juice production line using simulation as tool. Objective is to estimate the present production line utilization and the bottleneck. The subsequent objective is then to suggest and verify a solution to enhance production capacity and reduce the bottleneck which results in the fulfillment of current and future market long term demand. Arena simulation package is used to develop the model.

The applications of remote sensing and GIS technologies in land cover classification contribute to the objective and accurate reflections of land use information. This paper reviews the development of land cover classification methods in China, including man-dominant land cover classification method and computer-dominant land cover classification method. And then taking a case study, this paper compares man-computer interactive interpretation method and automatic computer classification method based on remote sensing and GIS technologies from four aspects. Based on that, this paper proposes the improvement and application assumption of land cover classification methods according to the possible future applications of remote sensing and GIS technologies. And the integration of remote sensing and GIS technologies in land cover classification will show the characteristics of gradual intellectualization.

We propose a new collaborative control strategy between time varying design parameters of the plant and the feedback controller. As the feedback control law we adopt the LMI based gain scheduling control scheme to guarantee the closed-loop L<sub>2</sub> gain performance against the variation of the time varying parameter of the control object. Under the gain scheduling control we propose a method for the adjustment of the time varying parameter using the theory of dissipative systems. The objective of the time varying parameter tuning is to obtain smaller L<sub>2</sub> norm of the controlled output. We refer to this control strategy as Active Gain Scheduling Control (AGSC) because the scheduling parameter is actively changed while the control system is working. We show that the tuning rule of the time varying design parameter becomes a bang-bang type in some cases.

Recent work has indicated that the common-depth-point method of seismic exploration may be scaled to obtain high quality estimates of compressional wave velocity in unconsolidated seafloor sediments. In this paper, a computer-aided analysis technique implemented to extract these velocity functions is described and its application illustrated. The objective sought in developing this analysis technique was to provide the capability of extracting independent velocity estimates from routinely obtained normal and oblique high resolution reflection data.

Musical pattern recognition is a challenging area of research as music is a combination of audio and speech; a signal of a particular music cannot be expressed through a linear expression only. For this reason musical pattern identification by mathematical expressions is critical. In this paper a new method is being proposed for cataloguing different melodious audio stream into some specific featured classes based on object oriented modeling. The classes should have some unique features to be specified and characterized; depending upon those properties of a particular piece of music it can be classified into different classes and subclasses. The concept is developed considering the non-trivial categorization problem due to vastness of Indian Classical Music (ICM). It can be expected that the novel concept can reduce the complication to the objective analysis of the classification problem of ICM as well as the world music.

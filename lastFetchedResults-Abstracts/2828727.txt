The main objective of this paper is to determine the capability of the machine to operate at nominal load when some stator coils bars that are cut. Finite element electromagnetic simulations were carried out on an existing hydro generator of 32.5 MVA, 13.2 kV, 60 Hz, 68 poles, 432 stator slots, operating at nominal load with bypassed stator coil. The obtained results in terms of flux density and currents are discussed in detail.

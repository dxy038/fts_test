Objective: Our goal was to determine whether chlamydia-infected women have a higher rate of febrile complications after postpartum tubal ligation.
Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of 1447 women tested for chlamydial infection within 2 weeks of delivery and who underwent postpartum tubal ligation was performed. Subjects were identified with the Regenstriet institute for Health Care database. Infected subjects were compared with uninfected subjects for incidence of fever not explained by nongynecologic sources.
Results: Women infected with Chlamydia trachomatis at delivery were more likely to experience febrile postoperative complications after tubal ligation (p<0.0001, relative risk 9.5, 95% confidence interval 4.5 to 20.1).
Conclusion: Women undergoing postpartum tubal ligation may benefit from prompt diagnosis and preoperative treatment of chlamydial infection

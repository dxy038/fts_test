This paper pertains to advanced automation of canning processes, with special application to fish canning. The automated system under consideration consists of three stages: portion control, filling, and post-filling inspection and compensation. The work presented deals particularly with portion control which involves cutting a set of objects into pieces by taking into account the weight distribution of each object (fish) and grouping the pieces into can-filling portions according to an optimality criterion. The objective of optimization would be to make each portion as close as possible to the target weight of can, within a tolerance, so that wastage associated with overfills, and also the regulatory violation and consumer dissatisfaction associated with under-fills would be minimized. An intelligent decision making system is used to match online measurements of object (fish) features to a corresponding model that has the necessary information for cutting the object

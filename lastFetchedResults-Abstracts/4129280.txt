The Defense Communications System (DCS) is described that provides long-haul, point-to-point, and switched network telecommunications for the US Department of Defense and other authorized government agencies. The DCS consists of a number of subsystems including circuit-switched voice and data, secure voice, packet data, and message processing networks. These networks utilize terrestrial, radio, and satellite transmission capabilities provided by both military and commercial carriers. The objectives of DCS system control are to provide maximum utilization of available DCS resources at all times; to maintain connectivity among critical users in all levels of stress; and to assist in reconfiguring and reconstituting the DCS whenever necessary. The discussion covers the current system; new requirements; the objective control structure; the operations support system; the approach used to integrate control of all subsystems; subregional control facilities; and implementation status.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

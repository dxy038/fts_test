Introduction: Health care services require nurses who are critical thinkers, with high-learning skills, who can solve problems for which there are no standard solutions. Therefore,a change in the way teachers teach merits considerations
Objective: With regard to above considerations, this research has been carried out to compare the effects of two teaching methods: Lecture and PBL on learning and retaining in nursing students in Shahid Behcshti Nursing and Midwifery Faculty in Rasht.
Materials and Methods: The sample of this semi-experimental study consisted of 29 students that were randomly divided into two groups; control (students under lecture method) and experimental (students under PBL method). The data collection instrument was a questionnaire, which included (1) demographic data and (2) multiple choice questions for knowledge assessment.
Results: The result of Paired T test showed that PBL strategy had positive effect on learning and retaining, but Lecture method had positive effect only on learning, without significant effect on retaining. There were no significant differences between the two methods on learning and retaining, however; there were more benefits in lecture group in terms of learning and in PBL group in terms of retaining.
Conclusion: Observation of higher mean score in expremental group compared with Control group can be indicator of appropriateness of P.B.L as a good replacement for lecture method.However, we need more researches for selecting appropriate methods.

The objective of every industrial crystallization process is to create crystals that meet specifications on size, shape, composition, and internal structure. This objective is achieved using a variety of methods and equipment configurations depending on the properties of the chemical system, the end-product specifications, and the production scale. This paper explain how crystallization is controlled in industrial processes and what challenges must be overcome to achieve better control

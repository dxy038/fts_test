In this paper, we introduce a power control algorithm for cooperative cellular networks consisting of multiple sources, multiple full-duplex amplify-and-forward relays, and a destination. The objective of this algorithm is to allocate the available power of each source so that it can achieve the required transmission quality. The full-duplex relays receive the signal amplified by themselves and re-amplify it sequentially. We derive the SINR and interference function, and then a simplified analysis of convergence is given by using a standard techniques. We evaluate the power controlled system in terms of the outage probability as well as the average power consumption, and compare it with the system without a relay and with half-duplex relays, respectively. The simulation results illustrates potential advantages of the power controlled system with full-duplex relays, the performance of which is limited by an isolation factor.

The present paper derives a fast recursive least squares algorithm for the design of impedance matching network to any complex termination. Starting from any non-zero initial values, and for any topology, the network components are derived iteratively in a manner that optimizes the network´s insertion loss characteristics. The strategy used is to minimize a weighted sum of the error between ideal time response and the network´s time response. The main feature of the proposed technique is its very quick convergence, as it involves time computation at very small number of points. Besides, the proposed method has the flexibility of incorporating any frequency domain characteristics in the objective function to he minimum

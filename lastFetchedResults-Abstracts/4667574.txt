This paper considers the transportation support system using multi-vehicleÂ´s formation. The objective of our research is to carry the load using four vehicles keeping the formation with information exchange among vehicles. The control law based on a Lyapunov function is proposed based on the virtual structure and the graph Laplacian. In the simulation and experiment, it is shown that four vehicles can reach the reference position by using four wheeled mobile vehicles.

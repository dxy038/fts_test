Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zinc and magnesium supplementation on glycemic control and serum insulin in type 2 diabetic patients. 
Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial 70 diabetic patients who referred to Yazd Diabetes Center were selected. Subjects received 500 mg/day magnesium oxide or 100 mg/day zinc sulfate randomly for 8 weeks. At the start and end of treatment period fasting blood sugar (FBS), 2 hour postprandial glucose (2-hpp), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting insulin level were measured.
Results: Magnesium and Zinc supplementation for 8 weeks cause significantly decrease in HbA1c (P=0.005, P=0.001).No significantly difference was observed after trial between magnesium and zinc groups in FBS (42.08 ±7.43 vs. 35.15 ± 6.52) (P=0.97), HbA1C (1.22±0.21 vs. 1.77±0.32) (P=0.07) and fasting serum insulin (39.81 ±7.03 vs.36.68±6.81) (P=0.83) respectively.
Conclusion: Results of this study showed that 500 mg/day magnesium oxide or 100 mg/day zinc sulfate administration for 8 weeks could improve HbA1C in type 2 diabetic patients and this effect is same in two groups. But more studies for evaluating effect of magnesium and zinc supplementation on type 2 diabetic patients were suggested.

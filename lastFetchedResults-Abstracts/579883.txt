There is a high potential for nurturing cold water fish and especially trout in Fars province. The objective of this study is to investigate the production condition of the individual trout nurturing farms in Fars province. To get the objective concepts of production function, efficiency and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) was applied. The concepts were evaluated by using data of 56 active farms during (1382-1387). The findings of the production function showed that the farms have experienced a constant return to scale during the selected period and the food has been the main production factor. Under variable return to scale, the technical, allocative and scale efficiency of the farms were obtained 0/963, 0/622 and 0/984 on average, respectively. The results showed increasing return to scale in the case of more than two-third of farms. It was also revealed that TFP of the farms has been increased by 16% during the selected period, coming from only technological progress and both part of technical efficiency including pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency has been decreased.

In many applications it is desirable to have the maximum radiation of an array directed normal to the axis of the array. In this paper, the broadside radiation patterns of three-ring Concentric Circular Antenna Arrays (CCAA) with central element feeding are reported. For each optimal synthesis, optimal current excitation weights and optimal radii of the rings are determined having the objective of maximum Side lobe Level (SLL) reduction. The optimization technique adopted is Craziness based Particle Swarm Optimization (CRPSO). The extensive computational results show that the particular CCAA containing 4, 6 and 8 number of elements in three successive rings along with central element feeding yields grand minimum SLL (-52.53 dB).

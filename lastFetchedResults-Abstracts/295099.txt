The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiologic features of pediatric burn injuries in western Tehran. Study subjects included all children up to the age of 15 years who were treated as inpatients at the Tohid Burn Center in Tehran between April 1995 and March 1998. Among the 3341 burns admitted to the Center over the 3-year study period, 1454 (43.5%) occurred in children less than 16 years of age. The overall case fatality rate for children was 16%, while the annual burn incidence rates ranged from 22.7 to 17.8 burns per 100 000 child-years. The overall gender ratio (boys/girls) was 2.6. Children less than 2 years of age had the highest burn incidence and burn mortality rates. These findings will be used as a basis for developing targeted preventive programs to protect Iranian children from burns.

The RAI Research Centre is developing studies to find a correlation between objective measures of video impairments and human perception. Such measures should replace subjective assessment, that is, they should allow the performance evaluation of a given system without consulting any of the users. This is a difficult problem to solve because compression systems introduce new kinds of impairments on the images, and measures used in conventional TV systems are no longer useful in this new scenario. The first step includes the development of new objective measures; the second involves the correlation of these measures with a set of subjective values, obtained from the same set of images. The preliminary results of two attempts at correlation between the objective measures and subjective assessment carried out are presented

Arcing and arc damage in an electrically energized cable is often recognized as a result of insulation failure of the cable and a possible cause for the ignition of a fire. However, the presence of arcing does not necessarily indicate the point of origin of a fire. It only implies that the cable was energized at the time of the fire. Typically, cables routed in an automobile are protected by a combination of fusible links, circuit breakers and fuses. The exception is the starter cable, which, due to the intrinsic nature of its application, is not protected by circuit breakers or fuses. In motor homes and RVs, the starter cable may be routed for a considerable length and pass through several openings in the chassis and/or body structure. Cable insulation failure can result in the energized conductor contacting the vehicle chassis, which may then result in a high-current, low resistance fault. The objective of this paper is to investigate the electrical characteristics of a commonly used starter cable during a low resistance fault between the energized cable and vehicle ground.

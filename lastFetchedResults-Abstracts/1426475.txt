Background
s known about the importance of social support for psychological health and general coping. While several measures exist to assess social support as a construct, less attention has been given to assessing the clinical and demographic factors associated with perceptions of low social support from multiple sources in clinically depressed patients.
s
n social support and depression history and severity were collected from a sample of 218 outpatients with major depression. Patients were assessed with clinical assessment interviews and self-report measures including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS).
s
han half of the patients sampled believed that a lack of social support was instrumental in maintaining their depressive condition. Perceptions of low social support, particularly that provided by the family, were significantly associated with objective markers of lifetime depression chronicity.
sion
ians interested in assisting patients' recovery cannot afford to overlook the potential role played by interpersonal factors in maintaining depression. Patients with more chronic lifetime depression histories require psychotherapeutic assistance for coping with interpersonal stressors and maintaining or building supportive relationships.

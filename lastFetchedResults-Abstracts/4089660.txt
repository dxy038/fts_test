To reduce the size and cost of a bidirectional optical module, a novel optical coupling technique has been developed using a new 155 Mbit/s transceiver chip. Since the chip is structured such that a pin-photodiode is monolithically integrated on a laser diode, bidirectional optical coupling is simply achieved by passively aligning an angle faceted singlemode fibre on the V-groove of a silicon optical bench. In a packaged size of 2.5&#215;1.3mm<sup>2</sup>, an output power of -7 to -10 dBm and responsivity of 0.45&#177;0.05 A/W can be obtained

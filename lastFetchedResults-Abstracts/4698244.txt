In order to reduce man-made mistakes and errors in the process of the evaluation of college teachers, this article applies the support vector machine theory to the evaluation system and sets the college teacher evaluation indicators according to some requirements by combining current college teacher evaluation indicators in colleges in accordance with related theories such as pedagogy. We divide the sample data into two parts with SVM principle and attain the training model through training the sample data in the evaluation system and take the intelligent evaluation and analysis on the prediction data with the training model. The experimentation and trial run showed that we can make the evaluation more accurate, reasonable and objective by taking the method based on SUM in evaluating the teacher evaluation data. So the prospect of the method is better.

We present a case study of applying multi-objective optimization techniques to the three dimensional design of a turbine blade in a gas turbine that is designed for use in a small business jet. We illustrate the iterative approach to the formulation of the fitness function that is characteristic for such a practical problem and show how the Pareto front accumulated in this process may serve to represent the knowledge on this problem that was collected in the complete optimization process

The educational methodology used at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the University of Brasilia for the last two years is presented. The main objective of this methodology was to introduce modern concepts of analysis and synthesis of microwave and millimeter-wave planar structures, and their applications in the design of passive devices, to the students as well as to help them develop the ´feeling´ which is required for designers. In this approach, analysis and synthesis tools for several different planar structures are developed from the theoretical fundamentals using modern computer-aided design techniques and thus forming a designer´s kit. Afterwards, the software performance is evaluated through realization of various prototypes, in a closed-loop learning fashion.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Hydro-Quebecâ€™s experience with polymer insulators
began in 1977. A sixteen km section of a 735 kV transmission line
near Quebec City was then re-insulated with 282 composite insulators
of three different makes in equal proportions. The objective was
to study them under real service conditions in order to evaluate their
performance and to assess the relative merits of each make. This
experimentation was later extended to some other lines and/or voltage
levels and has continued up to now. During all these years,
various methods of testing composite insulators in-service have
been experimented and early in the nineties, the first device developed
at IREQ for in-situ testing of porcelain insulators by the electric
field method was modified and adapted for use on composite
suspension insulators. This paper presents a few cases of insulators
having a particularly dangerous type of failure mode and found on
the lines by the use of the electric field method. Some background
information on the detection of defects by this method is also given
and some of the experiments done in the laboratory on composite
insulators to define the limits of the method are described.

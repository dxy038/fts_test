The research on supplier selection is abundant and the works usually only consider the critical success factors in the buyer–supplier relationship. However, the negative aspects of the buyer–supplier relationship must also be considered simultaneously. In this paper we propose a comprehensive model for ranking an arbitrary number of suppliers, selecting a number of them and allocating a quota of an order to them considering three objective functions: minimizing the net cost, minimizing the net rejected items and minimizing the net late deliveries. The two-stage logarithmic goal programming method for generating weights from interval comparison matrices (Wang et al. 2005) is used for ranking and selecting the suppliers. It is assumed that the suppliers give price discounts. A fuzzy multiobjective model is formulated in such a way as to consider imprecision of information. A numerical example is given to explain how the model is applied.

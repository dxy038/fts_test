This study proposes an expert system, which is called hybrid Kansei engineering system (HKES) based on
multiple affective responses (MARs), to facilitate the development of product form design. HKES is consists
of two sub-systems, namely forward Kansei engineering system (FKES) and backward Kansei engineering
system (BKES). FKES is utilized to generate product alternatives and BKES is utilized to predict
affective response of new product designs. Although the idea of HKES and similar hybrid systems have
already been applied in various fields, such as product design, engineering design, and system optimization,
most of existing methodologies are limited by searching optimal design solutions using singleobjective
optimization (SOO), instead of multi-objective optimization (MOO). Hence the applicability
of HKES is limited while adapting to real-world problems, such as product form design discussed in this
paper. To overcome this shortcoming, this study integrates the methodologies of support vector regression
(SVR) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) into the scheme of HEKS. BKES was constructed
by training SVR prediction model of every single affective response (SAR). The form features of these
product samples were treated as input data while the average utility scores obtained from all the consumers
were used as output values. FKES generates optimal design alternatives using the MOGA-based
searching method according to MARs specified by a product designer as the system supervisor. A case
study of mobile phone design was given to demonstrate the analysis results. The proposed HKES based
on MARs can be applied to a wide variety of product design problems, as well as other MOO problems
involving with subjective human perceptions.

Theoretical modelling of wear is a valuable aid for designing and optimizing tribological systems, in particular those involving unlubricated contacts. However, most of the existing models are empirical in nature, which limits their applicability and predictive power. In this communication, a generic, asperity-level, theoretical model for predicting wear evolution in a plain contact is presented. We extend a novel friction model, by elaborating it with energy-based, asperity-degradation/modification mechanisms, in the form of a local fatigue law: when the energy accumulation in an asperity, owing to repeated elasticâ€“plastic deformation exceeds a certain threshold, the asperity breaks off. The simulation results, using a set of arbitrary model parameters, in unidirectional as well bidirectional sliding, show qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Apart from the running-in phase, which the simulations show clearly, a linear trend between the wear volume and the energy dissipation is observed.

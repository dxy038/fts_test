The LEB ring magnet power system contains six subsystems, supervisory control, power supplies, regulation, DC bus, resonant cells, and fault sensing network. The system availability of the total LEB ring magnet power system (RMPS) is required to be 0.999. The LEB RMPS is used as an example to analyze the reliability allocation. The author allocates the overall LEB RMPS reliability requirement into reliability requirements for each of the subsystems and lower-tier items. The feasibility-of-objective technique combined with engineering experience is the key to the allocation. MIL-HDBK-217F was used to derate the key components, thyristors

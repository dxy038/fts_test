We seek efficient techniques to evaluate the performance of multistation production systems with limited interstation buffers and station breakdown. Our ultimate objective is to develop a practical computer implementation that can be used for analysis and design. A flexible decomposition framework is developed. This approach allows the analysis of multistation production systems with various structures including series arrangements, network topologies, and rework (feedback) systems. The efficient solution techniques for the subsystems developed in Part 1 are used at each iteration of the decomposition method. It is the generality and efficiency of the subsystem model as well as the flexibility and robustness of the decomposition approach that distinguish our study from earlier work.

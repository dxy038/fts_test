BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Corticosteroids has been used for pregnant women for fetal lung maturation but there are many controversies about their effect and side effect, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of bethamethasone on the serum marker of infection in women at high risk for preterm delivery. METHODS: This prospective study was performed on 50 pregnant women at risk for preterm labor between 28-34 weeks of gestation who were treated by betamethasone (12 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses) for enhancement of fetal lung maturation in Shahid Yahyanejad hospital in Babol. Blood test for WBC, ESR and CRP were drawn before Bethamethasone injection, 2 hours after injection and second and third days after injection. The data were compared. FINDINGS: Mean gestational age was 31.9±2.4 weeks. The mean WBC (396±81) (p=0.000), neutrophil (473±109) (p=0.000) and ESR (1.8±0.6) (p=0.008) after treatment was significantly higher than before treatment. But mean of lymphocyte before and after treatment showed no significant difference. CRP value was increased significantly after treatment (p=0.009).

CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that antenatal betamethasone therapy causes a transient increase in maternal serum indicators of infection but returns to basic level soon.

Considering the nonlinear behavior of conventional structures under strong ground motion, application of earthquake forces as an equivalent static force in the elastic region will not lead to an optimum application of materials in the structure.
Using an energy approach, the performance-based optimum design of concrete moment resisting frames is evaluated for so-called; operational, immediate occupancy, life safety and collapse prevention performance levels. Three objective criteria are identified for the performance-based seismic design, which include least structural weight, uniform ductility demand and, also, uniform earthquake energy, in all stories of the structure. To show the capability of the proposed analysis procedure, a three story concrete moment frame is utilized as an illustrative example and, also, the obtained results have been compared with the building nonlinear dynamic behavior.

The objective of this paper is to deal with a trajectory tracking of a Quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For the model uncertainty, the external disturbance and the coupling factor are considered, an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithm is introduced into the designing procedure. The aircraft dynamic model is proposed in this article, based on which the closed-loop control system is divided into four independent channels with the coupling factor compensated by the extended state observer (ESO). The nonlinear state error feedback (NLSEF) algorithm is designed in each channel to improve the closed-loop dynamics. In this article, the ADRC controller is expressed in the discrete form. And finally, the simulation results show that the proposed control algorithm achieves a favourable tracking performance.

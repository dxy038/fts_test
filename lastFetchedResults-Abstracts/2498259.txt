Objective: The aim of this study ‎was to investigate the possibility ‎of predicting psychological well-‎being based on spirituality and ‎religiousness‏.‏
Methods: A sample of 300 ‎participants was selected from ‎the whole entrants to Shiraz ‎University of Medical Sciences ‎and Shiraz University using a ‎random cluster sampling. The ‎tools of this study were the ‎Spiritual Scale of Ironson, the ‎Internal and External Orientations ‎of Allport and Ross, Spiritual ‎Religious Orientation of Betson ‎and Showinerdand and the ‎Psychological Well-Being Scale. ‎To analyze the results of this ‎study, we used the statistical ‎method of Pearson correlation ‎and we also performed the path ‎analysis. Multiple regressions ‎were used in a hierarchical ‎simultaneous way in accordance ‎with the stages of Barron and ‎Kenny‏.‏
Results: The following results ‎were obtained in this ‎study:1)Spirituality positively ‎predicted two religious ‎orientations (question and ‎internal) among which the ‎internal spirituality possessed a ‎higher degree of predictability; ‎‎2)Through intra-religious ‎orientation, and in a direct way, ‎spirituality predicted ‎psychological well-being; 3)The ‎internal orientation was the only ‎strong mediator in the ‎relationship between spirituality ‎and psychological well-being‏.‏
Conclusion: Spirituality and ‎religiosity were significant ‎determinants of mental health, ‎and they had more shares in ‎psychological well-being, and ‎made religious beliefs profound ‎and internalized them.‎

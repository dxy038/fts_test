Objective:  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of various heat treatments on the mechanical properties of gold alloys capable of age-hardening at intraoral temperature.

Methods: Dumbbell-shaped patterns (ISO 6871) were cast with three gold alloys (Sofard; NC Type-IV; Aurum Cast, NihombashiTokuriki Co.). The Sofard alloy is age-hardenable at intraoral temperature. The castings underwent various heat treatments [as-cast (AC); solution treatment (ST); high-temperature aging (HA); intraoral aging (IA)]. After these heat treatments, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), 0.2% offset yield strength (YS), and elongation (EL) were measured at a strain rate of 1.7×10−4/s. Fracture surfaces of the specimens after tensile testing were observed using SEM. Vickers hardness was also measured after heat treating.

Results: After IA, the hardness values of the Sofard alloy increased and reached values similar to the hardness of the Sofard specimens aged at high temperature (HA). The hardness values of the NC Type-IV and Aurum Cast specimens slightly increased after IA, but did not reach the values of the specimens after HA. All the Sofard, NC Type-IV and Aurum Cast specimens showed significantly (P<0.05) greater hardness values after HA, compared with the values after any other heat treatments (AC, ST and IA). The UTS and YS of the specimens indicated a tendency similar to the results obtained for hardness. The Sofard specimens with ST showed the greatest elongation compared to the corresponding NC Type-IV and Aurum Cast specimens. However, the elongation of the Sofard specimens was abruptly reduced after intraoral aging.

Conclusion: Intraoral aging significantly improved the mechanical properties and hardness of the Sofard alloy.

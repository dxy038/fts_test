Background and purpose: One of the factors affecting quality of life is health and illness. One
of the diseases that affect the quality of life is tuberculosis. This study was done to evaluate the quality of
life of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis during the course of treatment.
Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was done in 2011 on 50 patients with
pulmonary tuberculosis who were receiving treatments by health centers in Zahedan. The study was
performed during three stages of treatment (beginning of treatment, end of attack stage, and end of
maintenance phase). The samples were chosen to participate in the study by accessible sampling.
TBQOL-Version 2 questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data were then analyzed by correlation
coefficient, independent t, and ANOVA tests.
Results: The majority of subjects were female (68%) with the mean age of 58.60 Â± 17.50 years.
The Results showed that the mean of overall quality of life scores was 66.6 at the beginning of the
treatment which increased to 92.4 at the end of attack stage and 102.5 at the end of maintenance phase.
Significant increases were also seen in quality of life scores in physical, psychological, functional,
environmental and spiritual dimensions during three stages of treatment but no significant increases were
seen in the mean score of the social and family health dimensions.
Conclusion: Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis can promote quality of life of patients
especially in physical, psychological, functional, environmental and spiritual dimensions. Therefore, it is
important to complete the treatment of tuberculosis.

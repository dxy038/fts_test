Objective: To study the effect of hesperidin extracted from the peel of Gannan kumquat on cell proliferation and apoptosis of human poorly diferentiated nasopharyongeal carcinoma epithelial cell (CNE-2Z). Methods: Effect of hesperidin on proliferation of CNE-2Z cells was detected by the MTT method. Effect of hesperidin on apoptosis of CNE-2Z cells was utilized by the acridine orange / ethidium bromide staining method. Results: After being treated with different hesperidin for 24, 48 and 72 h respectively, the proliferation of CNE-2Z cells was inhibited in vitro; different time had high significant difference on the proliferation of CNE-2Z cells (F = 1898.865, P &lt;;; 0.001), different pharmacal concentration had had high significant difference on the proliferation of CNE-2Z cells (F = 5454.040, P &lt;;; 0.001). Time and pharmacal concentration had interaction on the proliferation of CNE-2Z cells (F = 118.909, P &lt;;; 0.001). During the concentration of 1&#956;mol/L-100&#956;mol/L, inhibition ratio of CNE-2Z cells increased gradually along with the increment of pharmacal concentration and the extension of time. When the concentration was higher than 100 &#956;mol/L, its inhibition no more reinforced accompanied with the increasement of pharmacal concentration (P&gt; 0.05) and presented the determinate saturability. The aggregation of cellular nuclear chromatin, karyopycnosis, karyorrhexis and apoptotic body was present in CNE-2Z cells detected by acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescent staining after the utilization of hesperidin. Conclusion : Hesperidin inhibited the cellular division growth and induced the cell apoptosis of CNE-2Z cells.

In this paper, voltage and reactive power control (VQC) of a system with load changes using a multi-objective optimization method is proposed. The objective is to minimize the transmission loss, voltage deviation, and manipulated variable using a multiple objective optimization Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this research, the simulation was carried out by using an excellent multi-objective optimization GA known as Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).

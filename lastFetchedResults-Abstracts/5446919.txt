Social networking services are presented as enablers in health and health care. This paper presents the idea of building social network system for educating breast cancer patients in Saudi Arabia. The system will blend the general features of social networks along with the power of semantic Web technologies to leverage the use of Web applications for educating breast cancer patients in Saudi Arabia. The potential objective of the system is to help breast cancer patients to have the ability to talk and communicate with each other and with the outer world as well as to create a platform to exchange information among patients to increase their awareness against breast cancer.

During the past five decades, there have been tremendous efforts to offer different methods for portfolio management. The primary objective of many of these methods is to provide a trade-off between risk and reward. The proposed study of this paper uses analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and grey relational analysis to offer a method for portfolio management. The proposed method of this paper uses a statistical sample consists of 16 firms whose shares were trading during the fiscal year of 2010 on Tehran Stock Exchange. The study uses AHP and gray relational analysis to assign weight to each firm. We also use a linear programming technique to model the resulted problem by considering some realistic constraints.

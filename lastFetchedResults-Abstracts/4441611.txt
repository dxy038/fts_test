Management systems which allow easy integration of microgrids into an existing electrical system are one of the major challenges of the new electricity generation era. One possible solution is a management system capable of, generating on-line adjustments to make microgrids transparent to the electrical system, allowing seamless integration as well as minimizing running cost. This work presents a new on-line dispatch algorithm for both electrical active power and heat to different microsources and heat generators in the same installation. Its objective is to minimize running cost, adjust the generation of active power at the point of demand (while in grid connected mode), as well as to cover heat demand (in cases of combined heat and power, CHP). The new algorithm uses a heuristic approach, based on electrical generation cost functions of microsources, to improve the results obtained using state-of-the-art nonlinear programming optimization methods (SQP). In addition, its low computational requirements make it possible to run the algorithm on-line using an off-the-shelf programmable logic controller or microcontroller, which further contributes to the penetration of microgrids.

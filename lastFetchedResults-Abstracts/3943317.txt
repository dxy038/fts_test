This paper presents a graduate course in the area of modeling and control of large-scale systems. The objective of the course is to study 1) model simplification techniques in the analysis and simulation of large-scale systems, 2) procedures in assessing systems behavior, and 3) decentralized and hierarchical control design methods. A unique feature of the course is the use of a number of interactive computer programs to assist students in studying in depth and understanding the particularities of large-scale system modeling and control design techniques. The paper describes course contents and the utilization of the interactive computer programs to enhance student comprehension of the concepts involved. Typical homework assignments are discussed to illustrate the utilization of the computer programs. The course is presently offered at West Virginia University.

Transmition of tuberculosis between man and livestock is quite common. In the world tuberculosis is described to be present in 20 million people, and every year 5 million people is added to this figure. People living in poorer areas are more in danger of the tuberculosis. Tuberculosis has been diagnosed in cows with dilapidated tubercles in various organs. In addition to the cow, man, goats and pigs are sensitive to bovine tuberculosis, sheep and horses show a kind of natural resistance.
Three types of Mycobacterium tubercule bacilli have been recognized among warm blooded animals , which human tuberculosis species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and bovine species (Mycobacterium bovis) are very similar to each other but a kind of chicken species is different.

Identification of different mycobacterial species with biochemical and phenotypic methods is time-consuming and difficult, and using these diagnostic methods created some problems to identify some of these species. Today rapid molecular diagnostic methods for mycobacterial species which infected human communities have important position in epidemiology and control of tuberculosis. Therefore, the recognition of the strain types in every region reveals the usefull information about the disease for every society. This issue in identifying all cases infected with the mycobacterial strains (Atypical and TB) is very important.
Recently some techniques such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and the use of specific probes in the diagnosis of mycobacterial strains have much efficiency. By using these methods one can easily take samples from suspicious humans or animals and in one mycobacterial infection and species identification can be performed. It is obvious that quick diagnosis of mycobacterial infections can help to reduce the disease in the country

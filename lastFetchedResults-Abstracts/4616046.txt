The objective of this study is to utilize the simulation model and geospatial platform of GIS for visualization of the unseen traffic noise impact into the visible one in virtual format. GIS system is used for this analysis and visualized presentation of noise impact in the form of 3D noise contour lines on the building and ground surface, where impact level can easily be seen and understood. Traffic noise simulation model of the studied motorway is input into GIS base via script programming in visual basic application. The locations of uniform grid point system are identified into the digital base map of vicinity area for ground surface and nearby building. The GIS program is then used to analyze traffic noise levels based on input data for these entire uniform grid points. This grid point system for the estimated noise level allows for plotting of color enhanced noise contour lines to be put into 3D GIS base. The final result can provide clear and sharp visualization of noise impact level from the studied motorway in colored noise contours on vicinity area and on building in 3D virtual format. The scene of this study area can be enlarged with the sharp and accurate image quality for detail engineering study without blurring problem. This scene can also be virtually rotated for animation display as the observer flying around the studied site. So it can provide the highly benefit to the full engineering investigation and assessment of motorway noise impact to the buildings and surrounding area in the vicinity of this motorway, and also provide the good and easy understanding presentation for public relation and public awareness of traffic noise impact on the study area to general people.

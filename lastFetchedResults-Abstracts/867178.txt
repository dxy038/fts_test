The main objective of this research was to investigate ergonomics, occupational health and safety problems of an oil industry in a developing country. Fifty-six industrial unit managers participated in the study. Forty-eight percent of the managers received worker complaints of back pain, 36% of fatigue, 32% of upper-body pain, 48% of stress and 46% of dissatisfaction. Fifty-seven percent of the managers reported a hot environment, 36% a noisy environment, and 41% a lack of resources and facilities. Sixty-two percent had no knowledge or access to ergonomics information, while 64% of the managers did not carry out an ergonomic assessment of their units. A significant correlation (p<0.01) was found among ergonomics and safety indicators and average injury rates. Lack of skills in ergonomics, communication and resources are believed to be some of the major factors contributing to the poor ergonomic conditions and consequent increase in health and safety problems in this industry.

The Grid Workflow scheduling is one of the most important issues in Workflow management because of its impact on the performance. Due to its importance, many scheduling approaches are proposed including static, dynamic and adaptive ones. Static approaches performance in Grid environment is questioned due to the continuous environment changes. The main objective of this paper is to introduce an adaptive scheduling approach in which the new Grid changes can be taken into consideration in order to achieve high performance and minimized makespan. The experimental results show that the proposed adaptive approach outperforms the static approaches in Grid environment.

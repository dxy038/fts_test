Geophysical methods have already shown their interest for the continuous characterisation of soils over landscapes, rapidly and, non-intrusively. But in bottomland areas, difficulties are encountered in relating geophysical properties to soil spatial distribution due to large variations in the depth, texture and/or water content of soils. Indeed, respective variations of these parameters can result in ambiguous geophysical responses. For example, a decrease in soil water content, which causes an increase in electrical resistivity, may be offset by an increase in soil clay content, inducing a decrease in resistivity. The objective of this study was to improve the continuous characterisation of soils affected by an excess of water by using a combination of geophysical techniques. Three techniques, the radio-magnetotelluric (RMT), the ground penetrating radar (GPR) and the electrostatic quadrupole (ESQP) were implemented along eight representative transects where soils were extensively described. The soil cover shows a succession from downslope to upslope consisting in fibric Fluvisols, gleyic Fluvisols, and Albefluvisols. None of the geophysical methods allows us to distinguish all soil limits and to estimate the geometry of soil horizons. The ESQP discriminates Fluvisols from Albefluvisols, whereas the RMT above all reveals differences in soil material thickness, which do not permit to discriminate between these soils. In complement, the GPR allows the estimation of the geometry of organic horizons and anthropic structures, such as ditches. Finally, the combination of these three techniques allows us to assess the main features of soil spatial distribution in bottomlands. To cite this article: V.Â Chaplot et al., C. R.

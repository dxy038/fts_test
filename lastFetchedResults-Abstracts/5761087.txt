The objective of this work is to test and verify a framework that aims to implement a set of resources for developing intelligent learning objects. For this purpose, a learning environment model was created. The model has an animated pedagogical agent (APA) that interacts with two specific Agents of the system. The framework architecture was developed by Gomes and proposes a learning environment model which has an animated character acting as a learning management system (LMS). The other agents of the environment have specific features of the intelligent learning objects (ILOs), as considered in this architecture. The results of this research prove that the learning environment, implemented according to this model, can be more flexible and adaptable. These results also show innumerable advantages in the proposed convergence between learning objects technology and multiagent systems paradigm.

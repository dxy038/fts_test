Based on the introduction of the simple selection sort algorithm, this paper analyzes in detail two bidirectional selection sort algorithm design ideas, gives individually the algorithm description in C, and corrects the oversights about the algorithm description in some reference papers. After analyzing comparatively the time complexity and space complexity of the three algorithms, the paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the two algorithm design methods, so as to giving a theoretical basis for the traditional simple selection sort algorithm optimization, and playing a guiding role in teaching the relevant chapters in &#8220;Data Structure&#8221; curriculum.

Applying sliding mode variable structure control to train neural networks is proposed in this paper, which can not only increases learning rate but also improves the stability of neural-network. Furthermore, this method helps to promote the generalization capacity of neural-network. In order to improve the generalization ability, two sliding mode objective functions are designed based on previous researches for a new neural-network learning algorithm. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed algorithm increases the generalization ability and robustness of neural-network, meanwhile, enhances the identification accuracy.

The objective of this paper is to analyze and implement a network management system (NMS) in wireless environment using simple network management protocol (SNMP). Wired network management technology is matured and effective in todayÂ´s complexity network tasks. But with the popularity of mobile devices, management of wireless network is becoming critical. Because of the significant differences between wireless network and traditional wired networks, a simple migration from the existing wired networks to wireless networks requires special design and implementation considerations. In this paper, we discuss how to enhance existing network management systems to meet wireless network requirements. We have developed a new system based on the widely adopted existing standard protocol SNMP. The new system provides following functions: (1) discover mobile devices automatically, (2) establish association among mobile devices and access point, (3) collect and monitor the wireless network performance, (4) control access to wireless network through AP, and (5) notify the changes of wireless network performance. We have tested our implementation on wireless media streaming platform and it conforms our design.

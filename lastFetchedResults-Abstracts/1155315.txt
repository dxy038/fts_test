This paper deals with optimal combination of squeeze cast process parameters, which pose a critical problem to the manufacturing companies. Experiments were conducted by varying squeeze pressure, die pre-heat temperature and pressure duration using L9 (34) orthogonal array of Taguchi method. The mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength and hardness of the components have been ascertained and a mathematical model has been developed using multi variable linear regression analysis. The proposed mathematical model is used to formulate the objective functions, which are the pre-requisite of genetic algorithm. The overall objective function is formulated by means of weighted sum approach. Thus, this algorithm is used to search for optimal squeeze cast process parameters to obtain better mechanical properties of the components.

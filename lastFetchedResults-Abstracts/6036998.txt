This paper presents experimental study whose objective is to show the dynamic performance of a variable gain PI controller (VGPI). Indeed, the PI, although very popular and mainly used in industry, present overshoots in the tracking trajectory mode. This major disadvantage can be eliminated by maintaining the traditional PI structure and introducing the variable proportional and integrator gains. The proposed regulator is used as speed control organ in vector control to an induction motor. The practical implementation is done on a hardware experimental platform equipped with a dSpace-DSP 1104 with Matlab-Simulink-DSpace system and Control-Desk software plugged in a standard personnel computer. The various tests demonstrate the great ability of the controller to remove the overshoots and also a precise trajectory tracking.

In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to optimize dimension parameters of U-shaped folded dipole antenna (UFDA) assumed to be used inside an USB dongle for WiMAX. By adopting effective formulations of two different objective functions to PSO, shapes of the ground plane and the antenna element are optimized respectively to achieve broadband characteristic of UFDA in each case.

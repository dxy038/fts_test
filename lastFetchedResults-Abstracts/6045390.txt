Reliability of SnAgCu solder joints under mechanical stress is not proven, in particular for Aeronautic and High Performance (AHP) products. They are subjected to high temperatures, severe mechanical stresses and long-term mission profiles. This work is comprehended within a larger study, which has as objective the characterization of the SnAgCu alloys mechanical behaviour at the solder joint scale and the influence of thermal ageing on it. The aim of this first work is to improve the understanding of the relationship between the microstructural and mechanical behaviour evolution of SnAgCu alloys under thermal ageing.

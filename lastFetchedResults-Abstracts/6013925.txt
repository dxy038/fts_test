In this paper, we consider reconfiguration of a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical mesh network. Traffic generated by the higher layers is dynamic. This necessitates reconfiguration of the virtual topology for efficient utilization of resources. We consider reconfiguration with the objective of minimizing congestion. The reconfiguration of the virtual topology requires addition and deletion of lightpaths. In our work, we assign priorities to the lightpaths based on the type of traffic carried by them. During reconfiguration, the priority level of the lightpath to be deleted is compared with that of the new lightpath to be set up. Deletion of a lightpath is carried out only if it is of lower priority. It is thus ensured that lightpaths carrying high priority traffic are not disrupted in the process of reconfiguration. The results for congestion with and without reconfiguration have been obtained

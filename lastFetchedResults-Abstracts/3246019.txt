This paper describes an application of a Hybrid Algorithm based on the Multi-Objective Simulated AnnealingTabu Search (MOSA-TS) to solve the dynamic Dial a Ride Problem (DRP). In fact, different versions of the dynamic Dial k Ride Problem are found in every day practice; transportation of people in low-density areas, transportation of the handicapped and elderly persons and parcel pick-up and delivery service in urban areas. The problem is to affect every new passenger request to one of the vehicles and to design a new route and schedule for this vehicle. This affectation must be done in real time. In this work, we offer our contribution to the study and to solve the dynamic DRP in the application using a multi agent system based on Hybrid Algorithm: Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing -Tabu Search (MOSA-TS).

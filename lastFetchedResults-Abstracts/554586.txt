This paper describes a new stochastic heuristic
algorithm in engineering problem optimization especially
in power system applications. An improved particle
swarm optimization (PSO), called Adaptive particle
swarm optimization (APSO), mixed with simulated
annealing (SA) that will be named APSO-SA is
introduced. This algorithm uses a novel PSO algorithm
(APSO) to increase convergence rate and incorporate the
ability of SA to avoid being trapped in local optimum.
The APSO-SA algorithm efficiency is verified using
some benchmark functions. This paper presents the
application of APSO-SA to find optimal location, type
and size of flexible AC transmission system devices. Two
types of FACTS devices, Thyristor Controlled Series
Capacitor (TCSC) and Static VAR Compensator (SVC)
are considered. The main objectives of presented method
are increasing the voltage stability index and over load
factor, decreasing the cost of investment and total real
power losses in the power system. In this regard, two
cases namely, single-type devices (same type of FACTS
devices) and multi-type devices (combination of TCSC,
SVC) are considered. Using the proposed method, the
locations, type and sizes of FACTS devices are obtained
for reaching the optimal objective function. APSO-SA is
used to solve the above nonâ€“linear programming problem
for better accuracy and fast convergence. The presented
method expands the search space, improves performance
and accelerates to the speed convergence, in comparison
with the standard PSO algorithm. The optimization
results are compared with standard PSO method. This
comparison confirms the efficiency and validity of the
proposed method. The proposed approach is examined
and tested on IEEE 14-bus systems by MATLAB soft
ware. Numerical results demonstrate that the APSO-SA is
fast and has much less computational cost.

Though the methodology of theology is of utmost importance and advantages few works have dealt with it bringing to light its hidden aspects. One can explain the methodology of such a science within the two stages of is and ought. The first studies and analyzes the existing methodologies whereas the second seeks to reach the necessitous methodology. On the other hand, theological methodology has to be sought in intellectual and traditional methodologies. The present article treats the second category of the first stage on the basis of the opinion of Ibn Maytham Bahrani, a prominent 7th century philosopher, theologian and traditionist. To reach its objective, it studies the two main articles of traditional theology â€“ that is the methodology of referring to traditions on beliefs and the methodology of understanding tradition in Bahranis thought. It also touches the theological outputs of these methodologies in different spheres of beliefs. Ibn Maythams methodology of referring to traditions on beliefs consists of verifying the content of traditions rather than evaluating their chain of reporters. His methodology of theological deduction consists of understanding the tradition in question on the basis of intra-textual standards (signification, eloquence etc.) and extra textual standards (Islamic proven principles, relevant texts, rational rules). These methodologies have left profound impact on his theological thoughts exles of which can be found in his ideological discussions.

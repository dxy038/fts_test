This paper presents, the impact of the pumped-storage (PS) unit on the static transmission network expansion planning problem (STNEP). The aim of this work is to minimize the total cost which is a summation of the transmission line cost, the fuel cost and the load curtailment cost. The load curtailment cost is included in the objective function to avoid the additional artificial generation. The proposed problem is tested on the IEEE 24-bus system and the gbest-guided artificial bee colony (GABC) optimization algorithm is applied to this problem. Also, in order to analyze the load variations on the proposed STNEP problem three different load levels are considered.

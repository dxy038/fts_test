Background and Objective: Depression is one of the most common and important psychological disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare depression in children of single parent and two-parent families and examine the convergence of Family Drawing test and Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) in diagnosing depression disorders. 
Materials and Methods: This study was of causal-descriptive type. Sample included 217 third grade students who were selected randomly. The research instrument was Children’s Depression Inventory (kovacs, 1992) and Draw-A-Family-test (Hall, 1951). Students completed Children’s Depression Inventory and then they were assessed using family drawing test. 
Results: Data were analyzed based on gender and family type (single parent and two-parent family) using descriptive methods, Pearson correlation and T test. Results from Pearson correlation indicated a significant correlation (R=0/328, p < 0/001) between two tests. The mean of depression of children with single parent in Children’s Depression Inventory and Family Drawing Test was significantly higher than the mean of depression of children with normal families. There was no difference in the mean of depression between girls and boys in Children’s Depression Inventory, but a significant difference was observed between two genders in terms of Family Drawing test. 
Conclusion: Separation from one of the parents is associated with high risk of depression in children. Both of the aforementioned tests have high analytic value in diagnosis of children’s depression.

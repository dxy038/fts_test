BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: When the sperm finds its final form at maturity, its antigen acts as a foreign cell against an immune system. With the sperm entrance into the blood vessel system, the immune system is exposed to antigens, and anti-sperm antibodies can be produced. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intraperitoneal sperm injection on rat testis tissue in second generation. 
METHODS: This experimental- laboratory study was performed on adult Albino rats of 3 months of age and weight approximately 250 to 300 grams.  Sperms obtained from 8 rats, were injected into 12 female rats, during 4 stages at one week interval. Then under coupling, the testes of male offspring born (24 rats of the second generation) were biopsied after reaching the age of maturity. Tissue slices were prepared and stained with H&E. Seminiferous tubule diameter, number of germ cells and leydig cells were measured by using the eyepiece and compared with control group.  
FINDINGS: Average number of germ cells in control and second generation was 9.5±0.9 and 8.2±1.1, respectively (p < 0.001). Average leydig cells were counted 7.63±2.74 in the control group and 6.55±2.21 in second generation rats (p < 0.001). Diameter of seminiferous tubules in the second generation (3.7±0.47) was significantly higher than the control group (1.62±0.025) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Intraperitoneal injection of sperm (antigens) in the body of the mother rats can cause changes including the increase in seminiferous tubule diameter and decrease in germ cells and leydig cells in their offspring.

An enhanced multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (EMODE) is proposed in this paper to solve environmental/economic dispatch (EED) problem by considering the minimal of fuel cost and emission effects synthetically. In the proposed algorithm, an elitist archive technique is adopted to retain the non-dominated solutions obtained during the evolutionary process, and the operators of DE are modified according to the characteristics of multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, in order to avoid premature convergence, a local random search (LRS) operator is integrated with the proposed method to improve the convergence performance. In view of the difficulties of handling the complicated constraints of EED problem, a new heuristic constraints handling method without any penalty factor settings is presented. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed EMODE method is demonstrated for a test power system. Compared with other methods, EMODE can get higher quality solutions by reducing the fuel cost and the emission effects synthetically.

A great number of electromagnetic (EM) problems, can be formulated in the form of L(J)=E, where L is a known linear operator, E is a known excitation function, and J is the unknown response function. L may be an integral operator or an integrodifferential operator depending on different EM problems. An appropriate tool, widely used to investigate EM problems, is the Green´s function technique. Once the Green´s function for a given EM problem is known, the above-mentioned equation for this EM problem takes an integral form with its relevant Green´s function as the integral kernel. The objective of the study is to efficiently solve J once L and E are specified

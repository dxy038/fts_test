The objective of this investigation is to explore potential designs and appropriate materials for a lightweight fieldable electromagnetic rail gun. Lessons learned from the previous launcher designs are reviewed and discussed from a mechanics point of view. Analyses are performed with a conceptually workable gun bore to illustrate the requirement of a fieldable gun construction. Both static and dynamic responses of the rail gun are discussed. The study provides a fundamental understanding for developing a fieldable rail gun in terms of mechanics and material requirement.

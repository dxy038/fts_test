The grain size is an important quality index of granular materials. The accurate measurement of it has a guiding significance for technical performances and application of subsequent processing. Currently most of particle detection are done by manual operation such as screening method, which causes many problems as time-consuming measurement and lengthy testing steps. The particle size detection technology in this paper can be obtained from artificial disturbance, and can get consistent, objective testing results, representing the development direction of particle detection.

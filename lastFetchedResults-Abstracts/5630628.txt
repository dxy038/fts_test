The field of program comprehension is characterized by both the continuing development of new tools and techniques and the adaptation of existing techniques to address program comprehension needs for new software development and maintenance scenarios. The adoption of these techniques and tools in industry requires proper experimentation to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each technique or tool and to let the practitioners choose the most suitable approach for a specific problem. The objective of this working session is to encourage researchers and practitioners working in the area of program comprehension to join forces to design and carry out studies related to program comprehension, including observational studies, controlled experiments, case studies, surveys, and contests, and to develop standards for describing and carrying out such studies in a way that facilitates replication of data and aggregation of the results of related studies.

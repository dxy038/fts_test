Objective: Ego defense mechanisms, defined by Freud as unconscious resources used by the ego to reduce conflict between the
id and superego, are a reflection of how an individual deals with conflict and stress. This study assesses the prevalence of various
ego defense mechanisms employed by Candidate patients for intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy. Methods: A
questionnaire was conducted on 53 Candidate from tow Clinic in Tehran. Ego defense mechanisms were assessed using the
Defense Style Questionnaire individually and as grouped under Mature, Immature, and Neurotic factors, the scale is purported to
measure the conscious derivatives of 20 defense mechanisms. Results: main results showed that there is a significant different
between Immature, Neurotic and mature defenses. Lower mean scores of immature defense mechanisms (5.26) were identified
than those for Neurotic (7.51) and Mature (9.84) mechanisms among Candidate patients for intensive short term dynamic
psychotherapy. Mature mechanisms were significantly higher in Candidate patients for intensive short term dynamic
psychotherapy. Conclusions: Immature defense mechanisms were less commonly and mature mechanisms were significantly
higher in Candidate patients for intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy. In this type of psychotherapy, patients should have
ego grown. These results confirm that the right candidates are selected.

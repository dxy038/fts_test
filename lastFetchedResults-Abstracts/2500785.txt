The objective of this study was to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting carcass traits on chromosome 1 in Japanese quail. The populations comprised of 422 progeny in 9 half-sib families. Phenotypic data on carcass weight, carcass parts, and the internal organs were collected on 422 progeny. Nine half-sib families were genotyped for 8 microsatellite markers covering chromosomes 1. Quantitative trait loci effects were estimated using interval mapping regression method Chromosome wide significant QTL were identified for the weight of bursa of fabricius at 24 cM (P  <  0.01), uropygial gland at 102 cM (P  <  0.05) and breast muscle at 199 cM (P  <  0.05) on chromosome 1. The detected QTL segregated in 7 out of the 9 half-sib families, and the size of QTL effect ranged from 0.68 to 25.1 in unit of the trait residual standard deviation. The current study adds significant new information for better understanding of the inheritance of carcass traits in Japanese quail.

A generalized nonlinear model is formulated for the dynamic analysis of suspension seats with passive, semi-active and active dampers. The model incorporates coulomb friction due to suspension linkages and bushings, forces arising from interactions with the elastic limit stops, a linear suspension spring and nonlinear damping force for passive, semi-active and active dampers, while the contribution due to biodynamics of the human operator is considered to be negligible. The semi-active and active dampers are characterized by force generators in accordance with the control laws based upon suspension mass velocity. Two different suspension seats are experimentally assessed in the laboratory under sinusoidal and random excitations arising from an urban bus, and the measured data is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed generalized model. The results showed reasonably good agreement between the model results and the measured data. Optimal model parameters are selected using the sequential unconstrained minimization technique with an objective to minimize the acceleration due to vibration transmitted to the occupant mass. The comfort and safety performance characteristics of the optimal suspension seat with semi-active and active dampers are evaluated under both the sinusoidal and random excitations based on the guidelines provided by ISO-2631. From these results, it is concluded that the comfort performance of a suspension seat with semi-active and active dampers can be considerably enhanced by 20â€“30%.

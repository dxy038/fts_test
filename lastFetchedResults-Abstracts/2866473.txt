Compressed multimedia transmission exhibit different error sensitivity in progressive bit streams causing channel errors in wireless channels. In this paper, the objective is to design and develop a robust coded modulation scheme for multimedia transmission in wireless channels. The scheme is proposed for additive white Gaussian noise and Rician fading as Line of Sight signal is strong dominant component present by using different unequal error protection methods in combination. Hierarchical modulation is coupled with packetization consisting of cyclic redundancy check with rate compatible punctured turbo codes. Optimal hierarchical parameters are combined with variable length packets on wireless networks. The proposed system is to outperform several existing schemes for realistic wireless channel and obtain Bit Error Rate characteristics and observe the analysis closer to the ShannonÂ´s Limit.

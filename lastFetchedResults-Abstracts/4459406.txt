The paper presents two approaches to determine the foundry fab manufacturing production plan. The two approaches are namely, the Cycle Time Oriented (CTO) method the WIP Energy Oriented (WEO) method. The objective of CTO method is to derive a model with the consideration in the aspects of the master production plan (MPP) and cycle time (CT). On the other hand, the WEO model explores the consideration of the WIP balancing and linear wafer out (or planned wafer out) to determine the amount of stage-moves demand. The concepts and models were built and applied over a period in SSMC and therefore, giving birth to a complete study for manufacturing production plan

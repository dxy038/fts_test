The specific mechanisms by which diabetes may affect the myocardial tissue response to ischemia are unclear. Our objective was to prospectively quantify the degree of myocardial edema in diabetics versus nondiabetics with ST elevation myocardial infarction using cardiac magnetic resonance. Fifty-two patients (16 diabetics and 36 nondiabetics) were enrolled after primary percutaneous coronary intervention and underwent cardiac magnetic resonance on a 1.5-T scanner at 48 hours and 6 months. Myocardial edema was quantified using a T2 mapping technique, and infarct size and microvascular obstruction size were assessed by way of a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted inversion recovery gradient-echo sequence. The infarct segment T2 was elevated in diabetics compared with nondiabetics (59.0 ± 8.0 vs 50.8 ± 3.1 ms, p &lt;0.001) at 48 hours. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diabetes (p &lt;0.001) and symptom-to-balloon time (p = 0.04) were independent predictors of the degree of acute myocardial edema. Infarct size was nonsignificantly higher in the diabetic group at 48 hours (26.9 ± 9.4% vs 20.1 ± 10.1% of myocardium, p = 0.07) and 6 months (17.1 ± 6.3% vs 13.4 ± 6.1% of myocardium, p = 0.09). Microvascular obstruction size was equivalent in both groups, and there was a trend toward lower myocardial salvage index in diabetics (34.2 ± 11.8 vs 49.6 ± 13.4, p = 0.08). In conclusion, diabetes is associated with increased myocardial edema in the acute phase after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Our results offer insight into the complex processes that characterize myocardial tissue response to injury in diabetic patients.

The objective of this study was to investigate epidemiological risk factors for porcine non-specific colitis (NSC). Forty-seven Scottish pig farms, with and without a clinical history of diarrhoea during the growing period (15â€“40 kg), were selected. The study included farm visits, clinical inspection of pigs, completion of farm management questionnaires, pathological tests into the cause of the diarrhoea and analysis of the non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) content of feeds. The results from 17 farms designated as NSC and 10 control farms suggest dietary associations with NSC. Farms with NSC fed diets with significantly higher levels of NSPs, especially containing the sugars glucose, arabinose and xylose. Few management factors were identified, although the high prevalence of infectious colitis reduced the power of the study.

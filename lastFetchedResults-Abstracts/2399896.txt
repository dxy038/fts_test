Objective
rpose of the study was the evaluation of the bond strength of a provisional resin to a polyetheretherketon (PEEK) using different surface treatments and conditioning methods.
s
isks were polished with 600 grit rotating silicon carbide papers. Plexiglas tubes were filled and bonded with a provisional resin (Luxatemp Fluorescence) to the PEEK disks which were air-abraded either with 110 μm alumina particles (Rocatec Pre) and conditioned with the primers Ecusit Composite Repair, Luxatemp Glaze &amp; Bond or Clearfil Ceramic Primer or they were tribochemically silica-coated (Rocatec Plus) and silanated with Espe Sil or Clearfil Ceramic Primer. Air-abraded PEEK disks without priming served as control. Subgroups of 8 specimens each were stored in distilled water at 37 °C either for 3 days without thermal cycling (TC) or for 150 days with additional 37,500 thermal cycles between 5 and 55 °C (dwell time 30 s). Following storage tensile bond strength (TBS) was tested at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min in a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was conducted with Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Wilcoxon rank sum test adjusted by Bonferroni–Holm.
s
3 days TBS ranged from 0 to 15.0 MPa. After artificial aging over 150 days TBS ranged from 0 to 12.9 MPa. Using air-abrasion and priming with Luxatemp Glaze &amp; Bond resulted in significantly higher TBS than all other methods, which was also durable over time.
sion
e of the methylmethacrylate containing primer Luxatemp Glaze &amp; Bond after air-abrasion of PEEK surfaces can be recommended clinically as promising bonding method to PEEK.

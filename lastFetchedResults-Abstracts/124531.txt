Frequent earthquakes with different magnitude yearly occur in the country especially in areas with high seismicity causing serious casualty and damage. Among those areas, Qazvin has experienced strong earthquakes like 1962 Boin -Zahra and 1990 Manjil in its history. The 'objective of this research is to seismically evaluate existing buildings in Qazvin, such that while studying the current situation and seismic evaluation of these building structures, general guidelines are investigated to improve existing conditions. In this paper with a short reference to geoseismology and seismically, after reviewing different methods for seismic evaluation of buildings, applying relevant modification, aria qualitative method was selected due to building systems in the area and field visits information. Then using the modified Aria method, seismic evaluation of visited building was discussed. Based on the obtained conclusions, most unreinforced masonry buildings particularly in No.1 municipality area and some steel & concrete structures are seriously vulnerable to damage during moderate and strong earthquakes, and thus need special attention for seismic retrofit.

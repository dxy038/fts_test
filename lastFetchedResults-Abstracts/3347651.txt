Examination of the pupil offers an objective evaluation of visual function as well as the vegetative pathways to the eye. In spite of technological advances and substantial progress in many areas, the routine pupil examination with a conventional light source has undergone no significant changes in the last 100 years. This work proposes the development of an effective and objective method and a portable device to test the direct and consensual pupillary reflex. The first results demonstrate the success of a new device construction and new methodology to record the reflex with differ stimulus, in a situation of complete seal of light.

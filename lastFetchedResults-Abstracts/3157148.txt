Traditionally, some common algorithms to optimize the integration of logistics resource are linear programming, dynamic programming, and etc., however, these algorithms canÂ´t well solve many complex optimization issues, especially nonlinear issues, because of the continuous growth of issue complexity. On the contrary, intelligent computing technology has many advantages in solving complex, nonlinear and multi-objective optimization issue. But, how to build intelligent logistics management system based on intelligent computing technology has become a challenge. This paper, focusing on the function and system structure of intelligent management platform, presents the design of intelligent logistics management system based on Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information System (GIS), and intelligent computing. Finally, a sample model of using quantum genetic intelligent algorithm to solve transportation problem in the intelligent logistics management system is given.

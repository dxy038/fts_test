In the past years due to extensive use of fuels, many problems have been raised for environment. It is very important to consider these problems in power expansion planning in a long term planning for power generation. In this paper a multi objective model for power expansion planning in a planning horizon is proposed. The proposed model studies a plan for a power expansion planning over a period of years for a country. The model involves five objectives: the total cost, the total CO2 emission of power units, the total consumption of energy carriers like oil, gas, etc. in units, the risk of changing in price of energy carriers and reliability of the power network over the planning horizon. All of objectives are to be minimized except the reliability function which is maximized. This model considers different areas and their demands for electricity with aim of satisfying these demands over the planning horizon. Also transmission lines and their properties, investment and generation constraints are considered. Results show in each area how much energy and with what technology should generate in the planning horizon in order to satisfy the demands of energy in different areas of planning area. Different possible generation units are considered in each area which includes renewable energy sources, conventional energy generation units and nuclear plants. For the presented model a solution method is proposed, the model solved through augmented ep-constraint (AUGMECON) method which is not applied yet in energy field. Using this method Pareto solutions are obtained, among these solutions the desired answer can be selected by decision makers. At the end of the study the numerical example is applied to this model and the results are discussed.

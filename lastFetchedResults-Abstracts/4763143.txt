This paper describes a new algorithm for document binarization, building upon recent work in energy-based segmentation methods. It uses the Laplacian operator to assess the local likelihood of foreground and background labels, Canny edge detection to identify likely discontinuities, and a graph cut implementation to efficiently find the minimum energy solution of an objective function combining these concepts. The results of this algorithm place it near the top on both the DIBCO-09 and H-DIBCO assessments.

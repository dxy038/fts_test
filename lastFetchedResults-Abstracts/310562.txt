Objective. To investigate the feasibility of using isokinetic dynamometry for measuring the dynamic strength of the fingers flexors.

Subjects. Sixteen healthy women aged 19â€“52.

Design. Flexion strength was measured isometrically using a Jamar dynamometer and isokinetically using a special attachment which was harnessed to a KinCom 125 dynamometer. In the series comprising the dynamic measurements, the elements of contraction mode (concentric vs eccentric), test velocity (low, medium and high) and isometric preactivation bias (low vs high) were incorporated.

Results. Dynamic strength parameters manifested expected physiological relationships both within their own frame of reference and with respect to the static measures.

Conclusion. Based on various facets of validity it is suggested that isokinetic dynamometry offers a valid venue for measuring fingers flexion strength. Furthermore, this study allows a selection of test parameters for the standardization of this measurement.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of mixed surfactants of centyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and polyoxyethylene
octyl phenol ether (OPEO10 or Triton X-100) for admicellar polymerization using a continuous stirred tank reactor to modify the
silica surface for rubber compounding application. The effects of the molar ratio of CTAB to OPEO10 and the surfactant adsorption structure
were investigated to relate them to the mechanical properties of the rubber compound. For any given structure of surfactant adsorption (monolayer
or bi-layer coverage), a mixed surfactant system having any molar ratio of CTAB to OPEO10 gave better mechanical properties of the rubber
compound than those of the pure surfactant system of CTAB or OPEO10. From the rubber testing results, the best mechanical properties of the
rubber compound were achieved at a 1:3 molar ratio of CTAB to OPEO10 with the monolayer coverage structure of surfactant adsorption. The use
of the mixed surfactants was found to provide better physical properties of the rubber compound as well as to reduce the significant amount of
surfactants required as compared to the pure CTAB system.

This paper presents a new approach for the synthesis of robust digital guidance. The resulting guidance laws achieve stable and accurate missile guidance despite parametric uncertainties in the missile flight control system dynamics, prescribed limits on missile acceleration, and digital implementation at possibly slow sampling rates. A robust continuous-time guidance law is first designed using mixed H-2/H-infinity minimization and pole placement such that the effect of noise and parametric uncertainties is attenuated. Second, with a fast-rate discretization of the CT guidance law used as a reference model, a multi-objective model-matching control problem is solved in discrete-time. The proposed synthesis includes consideration of the intersample behavior. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach

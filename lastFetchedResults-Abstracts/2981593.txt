In this paper we study the call admission control (CAC) and routing issue for ATM networks which carry integrated CBR/VBR and ABR traffic. The integration of CBR/VBR and ABR traffic is assumed to be based on the max-min fairness criterion. The CAC and routing task is formulated as a Markov decision problem (MDP) where the objective is to maximize the revenue from carried calls. The MDP is solved by the policy iteration procedure, after applying the standard link independence assumption. The numerical results show that the MDP routing method yields higher revenue than the least loaded path routing method

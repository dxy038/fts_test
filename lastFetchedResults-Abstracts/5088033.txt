The objective of the work reported in this paper was the development of an application that combined evolution and learning on a hardware platform. This was achieved on two different platforms: a COTS FPGA and a new device specifically designed for bio-inspired implementations, termed the POEtic chip. The learning process is based around a spiking neural network with Hebbian learning.

No-tillage (NT) is a method adopted to reduce erosion and particulate phosphorus (P) load from arable land to watercourses. However, it has been found to increase the loss of dissolved P with surface runoff, but the reasons for that have rarely been examined in detail. The objective of the present study was to determine the chemical factors explaining this response by investigating the impact of NT on the type and distribution of P reserves as well as on organic carbon (C) in the 0–35 cm topsoil layer of clay soil profiles (Vertic Cambisols). Soil samples were taken from two experimental fields (Jokioinen and Aurajoki) at 0–5, 5–20 and 20–35 cm depths in conventionally tilled (CT) and non-tilled (for 4–5 years) plots. The plots had been cultivated and fertilized according to the common field practices in Finland (15–18 kg P and 100–128 kg N ha−1 year−1).

Inorganic and organic P reserves characterized by a modified Chang and Jackson fractionation procedure were not significantly affected by the cultivation methods. However, in the uppermost soil layer (0–5 cm) in NT of the Jokioinen field, the labile P determined by water extraction (Pw) increased significantly, whereas the increase in P extracted with acid ammonium acetate (PAAC)

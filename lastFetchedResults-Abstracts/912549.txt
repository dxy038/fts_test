Due to the high cost of energy, desalination of saline waters by low-cost methods is important. Therefore, widespread investigations have taken place to achieve appropriate and low-cost solution. The objective of this study was then to determine the rate of sorption of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl- and HCO3- by bentonite (as inorganic sorbent) and almond shell (as organic sorbent) in raw, acid washed and base washed conditions. The results showed, maximum sorption of Ca2+ (7.8%), Cl- (9.8%) and HCO3- (66.9%) occurred by basic, raw and acidic almond shell respectively. Raw bentonite removed maximum content of Mg2+ (29%). Likewise, combination of acidic almond shell and basic bentonite as compared with single sorbent, increased sorption percent of Ca2+ and Mg2+. However, the increase in combination of cationic resin and mentioned modified sorbents was significantly more.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Control of hemorrhage after angiography is important and vital. Bleeding occurs due to ineffective homeostasis and topical homeostatic agents have an important role in controlling it. The purpose of this study was to compare bleeding control of Celox with usual dressing followed by angiography.
METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 100 patients candidate for angiography in cardiac ward of Shahid Beheshti hospital of Qom in two groups of case (receiving 2g Celox powder) and control (normal pressure dressings) were studied. Time to homeostasis, underlying disease, anticoagulant drugs, hematoma and angiography location pain intensity were recorded and evaluated (IRCT: 201202209084N1).
FINDINGS: The mean age of patients in Celox group was 58.06±7.78 years and in the dressing group, it was 62.90±11.82 years. Homeostasis time was shorter in cases than controls (380.94±206.87 seconds versus 546.88±258.318 seconds) (p=0.001). Four (8%) cases in Celox group and 6(12%) in dressing group had hematoma which the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant relationship between pain severity at the site of angiography in studied groups (p=0.000) but no relationship was found between the hematoma, homeostasis and history of anticoagulant drugs (p=0.370 and p=0.073 respectively). Bleeding controls with Celox and dressing had no significantly difference with anticoagulation history and hematoma at 1h and 6h after hemostasis (p=0.795 and p=0.510 respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results showed a significantly positive effect of Celox in bleeding control and reducing time to homeostasis of angiography location. So, it is recommended after coronary angiography.

Nowadays, medical informatics application combined with computer technology are vital for improvement in healthcare, medical education, and medical research field. The availability of large amount of resources has shown a big crisis in existing scenarios for collecting patientÂ´s history which need a great deal of many works to discover, select and analyze the information. The main objective of our research is to minimize the delay treatment and to optimize the Response Time while retrieving the data from the distributed database repository. This paper has presented a new software Agent-based Resource Broker policy to effectively improve the existing mechanism for fast info retrieval. The propose mechanism will ensure the quality of services (QoS) while satisfying the user needs and Response Time.

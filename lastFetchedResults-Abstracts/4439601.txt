Objective of this paper is to numerically simulate thermal fluid flow using Lattice Boltzmann´s method. D2Q9 model is used for simulation of 2D thermal fluid flow. Different thermal cases such as thermal Poisseuille flow, thermal couette flow are studied, along with conduction in metals with or without heat generation source within metal. Results produced from Lattice Boltzmann´s method are compared with analytical solutions or with some other CFD technique (Fluent) results. On comparison one can say that Lattice Boltzmann´s method is a remarkable tool for simulating and solving computational fluid dynamics problems.

In conclusion, plasma levels of the endothelialderived vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (but not those of other neurohormonal vasoconstrictor factors), measured during exercise correlated closely with objective variables of exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. These findings suggest that endothelin-1 may contribute to exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure, perhaps by limiting the ability of the peripheral vasculature to dilate during exercise.

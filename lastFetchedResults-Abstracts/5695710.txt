In this paper, a prototype of a telemetry system for battery-less biological implant is implemented, which demonstrates both wireless power delivery and duplex wireless data communication. BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulation is used for the data transmission from the external controller to the implant and LSK (Load Shift Keying) modulation is used for the reverse data transmission from the implant to the external controller. Power is being delivered wirelessly to the implant through the energy contained in the incoming BPSK data signal. This implant system contains a novel single chip realization of low power BPSK demodulator architecture, which provides considerable power savings compared to prior art. The demodulator occupies 0.1mm<sup>2</sup> area and consumes 5mW power from a 3.3V power supply. A sensitive board level LSK receiver for data transmitted from implant to the external reader has been proposed. External BPSK transmitter consists of a class-E power amplifier that serves the dual purpose of a data transmitter and wireless power delivery. In summary, a very low power bidirectional power and data telemetry system for biological implants based on BPSK and LSK signaling is proposed.

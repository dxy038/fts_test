In this paper modified simulated annealing (MSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques are proposed to minimize total losses in a network system with flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The problem is decomposed in two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is optimal placement of FACTS devices using line loss sensitivity index and the second sub-problem is the load flow with FACTS parameters using modified SA/PSO techniques. The main objective of this paper is to find out the more efficient approach for loss reduction in system network. Simulations are performed on modified IEEE 14-bus system. Results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

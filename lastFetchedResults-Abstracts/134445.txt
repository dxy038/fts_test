BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With regard to increasing of the mean age of human being, elderly population make an important group of society. In addition to dental problems and periodontal diseases that occur in the elderly, different diseases also affect on their oral mucosa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the most common oral mucosal lesions which occur in institutionalised elderly population.
METHODS: This descriptive and analytical study was done on 275 old people (over 65 years old) who lived in Kahrizak geriatric institute in 2000. Data was gathered by questionnaires and analysed by statistical chi-square test and SPSS soft ware.
FINDINGS: 84% of studied subjects had at least one oral mucosal lesion. The most common lesions were as follows: varicosity (44.7%), denture stomatitis (18.2%), varices (17.8%), hyperplasia in the maxilla induced by denture suction (13.8%). Oral mucosal lesions and prevalence of varicosity in males were more than females. Prevalence of denture stomatitis, hyperplasia in the maxilla induced by denture suction, epulis fissuratum and traumatic ulcers in females were more than males. Oral mucosal lesions in removable denture wearers were more and traumatic ulcer have been seen in removable denture wearers more than non wearers. Oral mucosal lesions, varicosity and varices in tobacco users were more common than non tobacco users ( p<0. 05%). Most of lesions were found in tongue (36.1%) and then in palate (I 9.4%).
CONCLUSION: Increasing of age, using tobacco for a long time and also poor oral hygiene which are related to inability of the elderly, cause some oral lesions to occur. It seems that pay attention to oral and dental problems of elderly people can decrease their oral lesions.

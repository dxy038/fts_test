Mobile device has fewer resources compare to desktop computers. Mobile application development is in the need of appropriate strategies in view of resource utilizations. Although some other design strategies are required for software development, programming paradigm is the core. The overall aim of this study is to formulate the programming paradigms whereby achieve the optimal resource utilizations by mobile applications. As a part of this objective, this paper aims to determine whether the improper use of programming paradigm concepts consume more memory and / or CPU time. Imperative programming paradigm concepts have been used as a sample for this study. Imperative programming concepts such as looping, branching and arrays have been experimented. The results of the experiments and case studies proved that, improper use of programming concepts lead to more memory consumptions and/ or take more time to response. In conclusion use of appropriate paradigms in mobile application design possibly will optimize the response time and memory utilization.

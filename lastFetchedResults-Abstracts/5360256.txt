A mathematical programming problem was developed in Soleimanipour et al. (1998) for resource allocation problems in wireless multimedia CDMA systems. Using a comprehensive wireless multimedia model, the resource allocation strategy is formulated to maximize the total profit gained by a service provider while supporting a wide range of multimedia applications and satisfying various service quality requirements. In the mathematical model, a nonlinear problem is to be solved for a large set of assignments. The objective of this paper is to provide an exact solution for the problem using a centralized algorithm. An equivalent linear programming problem is developed which convexifies the problem and removes local maxima. Using signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) per bit and handoff constraints, the set of feasible assignments is reduced to a computationally-reasonable size. The outcome of this research provides an estimate of the ideal performance of the network for further evaluation of practical solutions based on less computational complexity and reasonable approximations. For a single-cell system, however, efficient practical solutions are provided in this paper. The numerical results for different scenarios illustrate the capabilities of the model and the advantages of the resource allocation algorithm

Â Despite the numerous health effects of the dietary fibers, the amount of the fiber in the diet is generally lower than the recommended value. Therefore, increasing the fiber content of the foods particularly those of high consumption can compensate for the shortage of the fiber in the diet. However, it seems a difficult task since increasing the fiber content can have adverse effects on product acceptability. The main objective of this study was to include oat fiber in the cake recipe and to determine the physical and sensory properties of the resultant product. Therefore, oat fiber at different levels of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30% (w/w, flour basis) were added in the cake recipe. Increasing the level of oat fiber resulted in the increase in batter density and consistency and cake volume. In addition, cake crust and crumb became darker. Cake hardness and gumminess increased, while cohesiveness and springiness decreased as determined using a texture analyzer. Cakes containing no more than 20% oat fiber had acceptable sensory characteristics. In total, it was concluded that addition of maximum 20% oat fiber to cake can result in a product of acceptable sensory characteristics.

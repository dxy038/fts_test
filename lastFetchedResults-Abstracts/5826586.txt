This paper has three objectives. The discussion of reliability and Chaos in the general context of reliability theory, including the reliability of Wireless Sensors Network (WSN, e.g., a prognostics sensors network in a PHM system), constitutes the first objective of this paper. The second objective discusses the WSN reliability and survivability inspired by the analogical similarity between insect population and wireless sensor networks. The third objective of this paper is to suggest that it is possible to take advantages from Chaos dynamics, for enhancing the security of wireless sensor networks. This is based on the recent advances in Chaos synchronization, which provides a simple, deterministic and computationally lightweight, nonlinear encoding/decoding methodology.

In this paper we report on some of the current advances in the development of Hywacoss (Hyperspectral waterway control and security system). The objective of the Hywacoss project is to produce a real time small, light and easy to transport visible and near infrared hyperspectral detection and recognition system that autonomously monitors waterways, especially port and bay areas, and detects and classifies all the traffic, producing alerts when previously unknown objects or behavior patterns arise. Obviously, Hywacoss involves dedicated hardware and software modules, some of them based on computational intelligence methods. Here we will provide a global description of the system and a detailed analysis of some of its modules, in particular those related to hyperspectral image segmentation and the Artificial Neural Network based spectral-geometrical identification and profiling subsystems.

We provide a novel simulation-based control system for the purpose of minimizing an objective function, followed by similar research areas such as dynamic optimization and model predictive control. Our target processes have large nonlinearity, multi manipulated variables and multi control variables. Then the control system scheme and an optimization algorithm are provided. We also illustrate the results obtained from application of a depropanizer distillation column using a rigorous plant-wide dynamic simulator. In addition, our future controller design trend intended to attenuate the effect of disturbances are outlined in the final section.

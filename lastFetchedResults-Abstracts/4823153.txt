The objective of this article is to show how we can use models and methods generally used in the manufacturing area to treat the scheduling problem of batch systems. The approach is based on the representation of the system constraints using a p-time t-timed Petri net model and on a token player algorithm with a backtrack mechanism to find a feasible sequence consistent with the set of constraints.

Emergency medical service (EMS) providers continually seek ways to improve system performance particularly the response time to incidents. The demand for ambulances fluctuate throughout the week, depending on the day of week, and even the time of day, therefore EMS operators can improve system performance by dynamic relocation/redeployment of ambulances in response to fluctuating demand patters. The objective of the model is to determine the minimum number of ambulances and their locations for each time cluster in which significant changes in demand pattern occur while meeting coverage requirement with a predetermined reliability. The model is further enhanced by calculating ambulance specific busy probabilities and validated by a comprehensive simulation model. Computational results on experimental data sets and data from an EMS agency are provided.

We have shown that genetically programming game players, after having imbued the evolutionary process with human intelligence, produces human-competitive strategies for three games: backgammon, chess endgames, and robocode (tank-fight simulation). Evolved game players are able to hold their own - and often win - against human or human-based competitors. This paper has a twofold objective: first, to review our results of applying genetic programming in the domain of games; second, to formulate the merits of genetic programming in acting as a tool for developing strategies in general, and to discuss the possible design of a strategizing machine.

We presents a new scheduling solution for press shop and a new scheduling model based on constraints parallel machine for press shop. In this paper, the scheduling for press shop is divided into scheduling of one single press line and partitions among several lines. First, the job will be processed from the both terminals of the bidirectional press line and in the order of machines, in which procession the parallel processed jobs are under the constraints of operation number and machine capacity, then the constraints relative between operation and processing time are formulated. Further, the hybrid genetic algorithm with heuristic rules has been developed to solve the problem. Finally, the example of the minimum makespan and balance among press lines is used as the optimized object to validate this model and the scheduling results is obtained which possessed practical application value.

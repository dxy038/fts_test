There are many reasons for electric vehicles to assume a significant role in mobility. Due to the large number of national and EU funding programs as well as the high values of the capital investments of the German automotive industry, e-mobility will gain major relevance within the next decade. Furthermore, the achievement of objectives in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) strongly depends on the support of clean and sustainable mobility, which is independent of fossil fuels. One objective of this paper is to summarize the current state of economic and technological development in order to determine which effects have a dispersion of e-mobility on the political scale and how social development can be achieved. Based on these facts, this study provides an analysis of the economic and political aspects of e-mobility in Germany.

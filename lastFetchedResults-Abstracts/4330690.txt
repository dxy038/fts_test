Summary form only given. A self-consistent two-dimensional radio-frequency inductively coupled glow discharge model has been developed in cylindrical coordinates using a fluid model. The objective of the study is to provide insights to charged species dynamics and investigate their effects on plasma process for a non-reacting Ar and depositing methane discharges. The model includes continuity, momentum and energy equations for electron and ions. An electromagnetic model that considers electric field due to space charge within the plasma and due to inductive power coupling, is also incorporated. For methane discharge we expect to find higher flux to the cathode, and hence higher deposition rate. The independent control of ion energy to the cathode in an inductive discharge facilitates a control of quality of the deposited film. Swarm data as a function of electron energy are provided as input to the model. The model predicts electron density, ion density, and their fluxes and energies to the cathode. The role of electrons, and dominating ions in high density discharge are investigated. The neutral and radical densities in the discharge are calculated using a global model.

Objective: This study has done in order to provide a test to
examine the selec tion of grapheme kind and location on spelling
errors.
Materials & Methods: This study is a descri ptive and crosssec
tional and validity ass essment resea rch. The childre n were
selected from the 8th territory of ministry of education (two classes
from girlish school and two classes from boyish school) by nonprobability
sampling from sample of convenience. At the first grade the
words of Farsi book were analyzed based on the grapheme kind and
locat ion and some of them were selected. Different experts like speech
and language pathologist, linguists and teachers scored those words.
Finally 93 words were selected as words of test. They were dictated to
students at first grade by the tester during 2 stages separately in one
stage and the other stage the tester and the teacher do it for another group
during 2 stages separately. The dictation errors were determined and data
were analyzed by correlation coefficient and paired T test.
Results: Findings showed that there was no significant difference between
spelling test errors of first and second stage of test performance by the
tester neither in kind of grapheme selec tion (P= 0112), nor in location of
grapheme (P= 01l6) .
There was signifi cant difference between spelling test errors of tester and
teacher test performance in kind of grapheme selection (P<OIOI ), but no
significant difference was seen in location of grapheme (P= 0112).
Conclusion: These findings show that this test has intra rater reliability
either in kind of grapheme selection or location of grapheme, but it has
inter rater reliab ility just in location of grapheme

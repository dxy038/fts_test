This paper presents a new variant of multimodal compression scheme based on a spiral insertion function in the wavelet domain. The main idea consists of inserting a decomposed signal into a decomposed image prior to a joint SPIHT compression process. The insertion phase is achieved in the detail sub-bands of the wavelet decomposition. The evaluation is assessed on both natural and medical images using objective and subjective comparison criteria. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach to obtain significant gains in terms of reconstructed signal (PRD %) and image (PSNR).

Dual-polarized operation of satellite communications channels allows for an efficient use of the radio spectrum. A method for evaluating the availability of Ku- and Ka-band dual-polarized digital systems is described. It is based on long-term measurements of slant-path attenuation and depolarization caused by the troposphere and of their joint occurrence. The additional degradation of dual-polarized system availability performance with respect to single polarization operation is assessed, and its dependence on major link and system parameters is highlighted. It appears that satellite links characterized by high-frequency, low elevation angle, circular polarization, and high-level modulation schemes are particularly affected by the depolarization-induced interference. In that case, doubling their capacity by dual-polarization frequency reuse reduces dramatically their availability, assuming a fixed link margin, or alternatively requires prohibitive link margins to meet a given availability objective

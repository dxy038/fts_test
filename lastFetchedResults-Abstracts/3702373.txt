Systems science means many things to many people. This paper surveys various aspects of education labelled systems science. It reviews the literature in the field and reviews sample course and program offerings. Examination of this material indicates a lack of agreement among practitioners of systems science education and indeed casts doubt upon whether systems science is a unique science at all. The purpose of the paper is twofold: First, as a preliminary to a panel discussion among practitioners of systems science education it is meant to be provocative, and second, since it is clearly not the last word on the subject it is meant to be inspirational to more and better work in the future. This second objective is especially pertinent in light of the formation of a working group in the field.

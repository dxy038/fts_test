The objective of this paper is to present a model of microgrid applied on a farm that cultivates rice, based on concepts of Integrated Resource Planning and Energy, and Smart Grids. Some intermediate steps to achieve this goal such as the characterization of the demand and supply sides and sizing of demand and energy resources could not be part of this contribution and are available in reference [1]. Here are related the impacts and benefits, the model developed and its operation scenarios, concluding with an excerpt of the conditions of economic viability.

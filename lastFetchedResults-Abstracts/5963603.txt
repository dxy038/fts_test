Our researches works are interested on the application of the intertextual distance theory on the Arabic language as a tool for the classification of texts. This theory assumes the classification of texts according to criteria of lexical statistics, and it is based on the lexical connection approach. Our objective is to integrate this theory as a tool of classification of texts in Arabic language. It requires the integration of a metrics for the classification of texts using a database of lemmatized and identified corpus which can be considered as a literature reference for times, kinds, literary themes and authors and this in order to permit the classification of anonymous texts.

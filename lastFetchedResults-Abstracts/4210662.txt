The objective of this research is to quantify the relationship between the reaction of the brain function under emotional stimuli and the degree of the personality stability. And the other purpose is to investigate whether parents´ nurturing attitudes and the parents´ personality features are relevant to their child´s personality stability or not. We investigated the children´s personality stability and their parents´ mental status in the psychological way and measured electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) of the children under the emotional stimuli. We focused on the brain activities on occipital and temporal areas which were considered to play a critical role to process the outer emotional stimuli. The results showed that the personality stability of the infants was influenced by the parents´ nurturing attitudes, while that of the young adults was related to the parents´ personality features. The physiological findings showed that the brain functional activity in the occipital area of the child with stable personality under the pleasant stimuli was provoked, and the brain activity in temporal area of the child with unstable personality was provoked under the unpleasant stimuli. We conclude that the brain functional sensitivity under an emotional situation is related to the personality stability, and this event already appears in the infants.

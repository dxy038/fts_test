Organophosphate pesticides (OP) belong to the class of xenobiotics that are intentionally released to the environment. Toxicity of these compounds is mainly due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), but many authors postulate that OP in acute as well as in chronic intoxication disturb the redox processes, changing the activities of antioxidative enzymes and causing enhancement of lipid peroxidation in many organs. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relationship of certain human diseases with pesticide exposure and with changes in antioxidative enzymes. There is also evidence that oxidative stress is an important pathomechanism of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disorders and many others. The study objective was to investigate the activities of brain antioxidative enzymes and reduced glutathione level in rats subchronically intoxicated with chlorfenvinphos. In the rat brain the activities of such enzymes as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and reductase were found to increase, while reduced glutathione level decreased in chlorfenvinphos intoxication. Based on experimental findings of this study, it can be suggested that subchronic administration of chlorfenvinphos leads to a change in the brain oxidative status and that the change occurs at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day, i.e., twice smaller than LOAEL level for rats.

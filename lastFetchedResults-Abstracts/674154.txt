
Objective: Embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (e-CSF) has an important role in development of embryonic and adult brain. Proteomic analysis suggests that this fluid has many morphogenes
and
cytokines
that
alter
in
time
and
space
throughout
embryonic
life.
The
aim
of

this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
developmental
effect
of
embryonic
CSF
on
proliferation
and

differentiation
of neuroprogenitor cells in different
gestational age.
Materials and Methods: In this In this experimental study, we examined the role of eCSF
on
proliferation
and
differentiation
of
neuroprogenitor
cells
using
neurosphere
culture

method.
Neurospheres
size
analysis
and
MTT
assay
were
used
to
assess
cell
proliferation

after

four days in vitro. Glial differentiation study was carried out by immunocytochemistry.

Neurospheres size and percentage of glial fibrialy acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were measured by image analyzer (image J). The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey’s post hoc test. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM, and differences were considered significant when p < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001.
Results: Viability and proliferation of neuro progenitor cells in cultures conditioned with E16 CSF and E18 CSF were significantly increased compare to control group. A dramatic decrease in percentage of GFAP-positive cells was found following the application of CSF from E16 and E18 embryos, but not E20 CSF.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that, e-CSF altered proliferation and differentiation of neuro progenitor
cells
in
age
dependent
manner.
E16
and
E18
CSF
enhanced
proliferation
and
viability
of

neuro
progenitor
cells,
and
inhibited
differentiation
to
glial
fate
in
comparison
with
control
group.

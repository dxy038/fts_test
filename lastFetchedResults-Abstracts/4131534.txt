We present an enhanced visualization algorithm for hyperspectral images (HSIs). The visualization is based on the projection onto color matching functions of the human vision system. A contrast enhancement procedure is introduced by the fusion of the gradient information of the individual HSI bands. Both visualization and enhancement are combined into a multiresolution framework using wavelets. The HSI is transformed into a specific representation (HSI wavelet representation), in which the enhancement is performed at the level of the wavelet detail subbands, whereas the visualization is performed at the level of the low-resolution subbands. Specific objective quality measures are applied to demonstrate that the proposed procedure provides visualization results with a high contrast. Results are compared with state-of-the-art HSI visualization techniques and with the postprocessing enhancement.

This paper considers a berth allocation problem (BAP) which requires the determination of exact berthing times and positions of incoming ships in a container port. The problem is solved by optimizing the berth schedule so as to minimize concurrently the three objectives of make span, number of crossings, and waiting time. These objectives represent the interests of both port and ship operators. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) that incorporates the concept of Pareto optimality is proposed for solving the multi-objective BAP. The MOEA is equipped with a novel solution decoding scheme which is specifically designed to optimize the use of berth space. The MOEA is also able to function in a dynamic context which is of more relevance to a real-world situation.

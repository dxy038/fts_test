This paper presents a novel bidirectional-driven microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) light manipulation stage. The designed device consists of two actuators integrated with a lens to act as both tracking (in-plane) and focusing (out-of-plane) components for optical pickup head. The actuator is driven by thermal, as well as magnetic, means. According to a static-load deflection test, this device can achieve bidirection actuation with output displacement up to plusmn54.5 mum. In addition, this MEMS device has a very small form factor and provides an excellent response time and size reduction. It can be employed on the portable optical storage system

Space Vector Modulation (SVM), with its many advantages over classical Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques, is gaining popularity. Different Discontinuous-PWM with harmonic injections were developed during the past few years with the objective of reducing switching losses in power converters. However discontinuous modulation based on space vector calculations tends to be more complicated than injecting zero sequence voltage with the required phase angle. The proposed method extends the DPWM concept to tackle the temperature imbalance amongst the inverter legs and optimize switching losses for unbalanced loads. Switching losses also mean increased thermal stress on the power switches, which reduces the life of the power switches and requires an appropriate cooling system. A discontinuous auto-adjusting SVM technique intended for HEV oriented Electric-Drives is presented in this paper.

The goal of this project, funded under the NASA Summer Faculty Fellowship program, was to evaluate control methods utilizing fuzzy logic for applicability to control of flexible structures. This was done by applying these methods to control of the Control Structures Interaction Suitcase Demonstrator developed at Marshall Space Flight Center. The CSI Suitcase Demonstrator is a flexible beam, mounted at one end with springs and bearings, and with a single actuator capable of rotating the beam about a pin at the fixed end. The control objective is to return the tip of the free end to a zero error position (from a non-zero initial condition). It is neither completely controllable or completely observable. [1] Fuzzy logic control was demonstrated to successfully control the system and to exhibit desirable robustness properties compared to conventional control.

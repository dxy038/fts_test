Countries receptive to technology are those who absorb and adapt knowledge coming from developed countries. Their capability for assimilating technology depends on factors related with the availability of facilities, financial resources and even, cultural differences. In order to prevent adverse events in the usage of the technology, it is important to analyze and to evaluate these factors. The objective of this work was to identify and to analyze the elements involved in the performance and use of a PACS, and to provide a guideline for its implementation in healthcare systems of countries receptive to technology based on the use of PACS in Mexico.

The color of rice is an important indicator of rice grade, this article has provided an objective and accurate way to inspect the rice color based on image processing technique. It introduces the application of two popular kinds of color model, RGB model and HIS model, in the rice color inspection. The values of R, G, and B are represented by histograms of corresponding channels of RGB rice image. The RGB model is then converted to HSI model, based on which the values of H, S and I are calculated. The rice hue determined from chromaticity diagram is roughly the same as the actual.

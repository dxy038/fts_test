ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine energy use efficiency in corn silage production using a non-parametric production function. The data used in this study was obtained through a face to- face questionnaire method in the surveyed region â€“ Esfahan province of Iran. The total energy input and energy output were calculated to be 70972.01and 280000 MJha-1, respectively. The technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of farmers were calculated as 0.875, 0.916 and 0.955, respectively. Total optimum energy requirement was found to be 65070.70MJha-1; showing that 9.07% of input energy could be saved if the farmers follow the results recommended by this study. The maximum contribution to the total energy savings is 36% from machinery, followed by chemical fertilizer (32%) and diesel fuel (19%). The result of greenhouse gas analysis showed that optimization of energy decreases the CO2 emission by 8%. The machinery input has the highest impact on environmental pollution. This inefficient energy use pattern in this cultivation can create some environmental problems such as increase in global warming, CO2 emissions, and non-sustainability.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of the psychological empowerment of staff in the youth and sport offices based on structural equation modeling (SEM). 
Methodology: The statistical population included all staff of youth and sport offices in the north-west provinces of Iran (N=588) and 250 people were selected as the study sample based on Cochran's formula. Research data was gathered using Spritzer’s psychological empowerment questionnaire (1997), SeyedJavadein’s organizational trust questionnaire (2009), Bray?eld and Rothe's job satisfaction questionnaire (1951), Moody’s organizational commitment questionnaire (1979), Bardenz and Metzcas’s leadership style questionnaire (2000), and NanchiOn’s organizational culture questionnaire (1998). The reliability of the questionnaires was approved using Cronbach alpha coefficient. Pearson correlation and structural equation modeling were used to analysis data. 
Results: Research findings indicated that the organizational trust, culture and leadership were considered as antecedents and job satisfaction and organizational commitment were identified as outcomes of the psychological empowerment. The strongest correlation was observed between leadership and culture, and the weakest correlation was observed between culture and empowerment (p < 0.050). The psychological empowerment was correlated positively with job satisfaction and organizational commitment (p < 0.050).
Conclusion: It is concluded that leadership, culture and trust can improve the staff’s empowerment perception. Furthermore, the empowerment can promote the staff’s organizational commitment and their job satisfaction as well. Therefore, people with high degree of perception toward organizational leadership, culture and trust show more high level of empowerment in their workplace.

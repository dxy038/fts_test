The objective of this study was to evaluate the synchronic use of multi-enzyme and probiotic on broilers performance. This factorial experimental was conducted in a randomized complete design and included 480 Ross broiler chicks (Strain 308) which were divided into 6 treatments and each treatment into 4 replicates and 20 chicks in each replicate. The wheat and barley based diet was constant for all treatments. Multi-enzyme is used in three levels (zero, half level and suggested level (500 gram) ) and probiotic in two levels (zero and suggested level). At the end of experiment, all chicks are weighted.  then from each replicate 2 chicks were killed to measure carcass traits and characteristics of different parts of intestine. At the total of the experiment period (1-45 days), the results showed that the application of multi-enzyme (at suggested level) was caused further weight gain and improvement of feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in feed intake in application of only multi-enzyme or probiotic . Use of only probiotic and only multi-enzyme was decreased  FCR in total period (P < 0.05).carcass percentage was increased significantly in use of enzyme, probiotic and synchronic use of them (P < 0.05). Thigh and breast percent were not significant. Abdominal fat percent was decreased in use of synchronic enzyme and probiotic (P < 0.05).Percentage of liver, duodenum and jejunum length declined significantly in use of only enzyme (p < 0.05). use of only enzyme or only probiotic was advisable for Improvement of FCR. but the use of synchronic enzyme and probiotic doesnâ€™t have any additive effect on broiler performance.

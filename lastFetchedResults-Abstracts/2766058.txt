Automated calibration of microscopic traffic flow models is all but simple for a number of reasons, including the computational complexity of black-box optimization and the asymmetric importance of parameters in influencing model performances. The main objective of this paper is therefore to provide a robust methodology to simplify car-following models, that is, to reduce the number of parameters (to calibrate) without sensibly affecting the capability of reproducing reality. To this aim, variance-based sensitivity analysis is proposed and formulated in a &#8220;factor fixing&#8221; setting. Among the novel contributions are a robust design of the Monte Carlo framework that also includes, as an analysis factor, the main nonparametric input of car-following models, i.e., the leader´s trajectory, and a set of criteria for &#8220;data assimilation&#8221; in car-following models. The methodology was applied to the intelligent driver model (IDM) and to all the trajectories in the &#8220;reconstructed&#8221; Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) I80-1 data set. The analysis unveiled that the leader´s trajectory is considerably more important than the parameters in affecting the variability of model performances. Sensitivity analysis also returned the importance ranking of the IDM parameters. Basing on this, a simplified model version with three (out of six) parameters is proposed. After calibrations, the full model and the simplified model show comparable performances, in face of a sensibly faster convergence of the simplified version.

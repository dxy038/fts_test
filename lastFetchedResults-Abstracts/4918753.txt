The process of WIMAX radio network design and deployment is greatly affected by the nature of the customer premises equipment and the intended access service, which may be fixed, nomadic or indoor. This paper advances network design methodologies, traditionally used for fixed access, in the scope of hybrid fixed outdoor / indoor-nomadic networks. With the main objective being performance, time-to-market and cost optimisation, a dual layer outdoor / indoor coverage deployment is proposed which allows for co-existence and performance balancing of different customer profiles. By comparing to purely outdoor or indoor deployments, this approach provides benefits, both in terms of equipment reduction and spectrum usage and optimises the deployment costs, especially in the initial phases of the network. This approach is applicable both for OFDM and future OFDMA systems.

Commonly, data used in public authorities are statistical data about certain indicator. Such valid kind of data allows an objective observation about indicator developments over time. In case of a significant deviation from the normal indicator level, it is difficult to understand the reasons for upcoming problems. In our paper we present an approach that allows an enhanced information gathering through an improved information overview about the depending aspects to such an indicator by considering governmental data-sources that provide also other types of data than just statistics. Even more, our approach integrates a system that allows generating explanations for Open Government Data, especially to specific indicators, based on Linked-Open Data. This enables decision-makers to get hints for unexpected reasons of concrete problems that may influence an indicator.

Corrective control compensates the stable state specification of an asynchronous sequential machine so that the closed-loop system can imitate the behavior of a reference model. In this paper, we present a novel scheme of controlling two asynchronous sequential machines with one corrective controller. By virtue of structural characteristics of corrective controllers, we can combine two controllers designated for separate asynchronous machines into a combined controller, which still achieves the control objective. The existence condition for the corrective controller remains unchanged, but the size of the overall controller can be significantly reduced by the proposed scheme. We provide the design algorithm for the prosed combined controller and conduct a quantitative analysis on the size reduction of the controller.

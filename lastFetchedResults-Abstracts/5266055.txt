A formalism for modeling hybrid dynamical systems is presented. Unlike most work on hybrid dynamical systems where the objective of model construction is system analysis and controller synthesis, the objective here is to construct a formalism suited for modular model construction and simulation. This formalism is used in the open-source modeling and simulation software Scicos

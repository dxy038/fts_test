A 64-Mbit bidirectional data strobed, double-data-rate SDRAM achieves a peak bandwidth of 2.56 GByte/s on a 64-bit-channel, 256-MByte memory system at V<sub>cc</sub>=3.3 V and T=25&#176;C. The circuit features are: (1) a bidirectional data strobing scheme to eliminate the clock-related skews of I/O data in a multimodule system, (2) a low-power delay-locked loop having a wide range of locking frequency (40-160 MHz) with fast access time and minimal variations, and (3) a twisted data bussing architecture with minimized loading difference between I/O data paths and small chip-size overhead associated with the 2-bit prefetch operation

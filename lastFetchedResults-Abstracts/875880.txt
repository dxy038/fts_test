It is not a difficult task to find a weak Pareto or Pareto solution in a multiobjective linear programming
(MOLP) problem. The difficulty lies in finding all these solutions and representing their
structure. This paper develops an algorithm for solving this problem.We investigate the solutions and
their relationships in the objective space. The algorithm determines finite number of weights, each
of which corresponds to a weighted sum problems. By solving these problems, we further obtain
all weak Pareto and Pareto solutions of the MOLP and their structure in the constraint space. The
algorithm avoids the degeneration problem, which is a major hurdle of previous works, and presents
an easy and clear solution structure.

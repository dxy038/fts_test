The objective of this study was to determine the effect the source of added nitrite and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) had on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat (RTE) sliced ham. Use of 600 MPa HHP for 3 min resulted in an immediate 3.9â€“4.3 log CFU/g reduction in L. monocytogenes numbers, while use of 400 MPa HHP (3 min) provided less than 1 log CFU/g reduction. With the 600 MPa HHP treatment, sliced ham with a conventional concentration of sodium nitrite (200 ppm) was not different in L. monocytogenes growth from use with 50 or 100 ppm of sodium nitrite in pre-converted celery powder. Instrumental color values as well as residual nitrite and residual nitrate concentrations for cured (sodium nitrite and nitrite from celery powder) and uncured ham formulations are discussed.

As to the basic theoretical problem in intelligent transportation system (ITS), how to solve the problem of dynamic traffic assignment is one of the most crucial posers in the world. In this paper, the dynamic traffic assignment model for multi-origin and multi-destination road network is put-forward. Meanwhile, the equivalence is demonstrated that the dynamic user-optimal route choice problem can be converted to an optimal control problem with a defined objective function. Finally, a numerical example is presented indicating that the conclusion obtained in this paper yields realistic results.

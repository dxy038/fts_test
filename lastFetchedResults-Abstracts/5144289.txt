This article deals with a target tracking application for the disabled. The objective of this work is to track a wheelchair with a mobile platform and an embedded grasping arm (MANUS). We propose an approach based on an association of two Kalman filtering levels. The first level permits an estimation of the wheelchair configuration. The second is used to compute the mobile platform configuration in connection with its environment. The association of the two filtering process allows a robust tracking between two objects in movement.

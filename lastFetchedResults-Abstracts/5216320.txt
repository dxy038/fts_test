This paper concerns an approach for solving multi-objective analog circuit design problems, which is based on formulating the problem as a geometric program (GP). Multiple objectives are combined into a scalar objective thru certain convex functions and thus can be solved using GP. In contrast to single-objective optimization, simultaneous consideration of all objectives yields a compromising solution among objectives. By varying individual objectivepsilas weight factor, a Pareto (or tradeoff) curve can be constructed, providing designers with a useful decision-making information.

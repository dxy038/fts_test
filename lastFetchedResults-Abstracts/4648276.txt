This paper investigates a formulation of the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which aims to find the predictive optimal operational state of a low voltage smart grid. The optimization problem includes distributed generations (DG), distributed storage (DS), and smart buildings. Active and reactive power management is done through DG and DS control, and soft load shedding. It takes into account networks constraints, through a full AC power flow calculation. The low-voltage distribution network is modeled as a three-phased four-wire system. Several objective functions are described. Finally, a case study is solved using KNITRO [1], a robust and efficient solver for large, nonlinear and constrained problems, after being modeled in GAMS [2].

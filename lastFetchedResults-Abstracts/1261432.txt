Objective/Hypothesis Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used in the treatment of laryngeal disorders despite the absence of clear guidelines regarding their use. We sought to assess clinical practice patterns regarding GC use for various vocal fold diseases and to ascertain factors underlying the selection of particular GCs for different vocal fold pathology. Study Design Prospective, survey. Methods A web-based 20-question survey querying clinical indications for GC use and other factors influencing decision making in GC administration was distributed to 5280 otolaryngologists via e-mail using a commercially available database. Results The overall response rate for the survey was 4% (212/5280). Of the respondents, 99% reported GCs to be valuable in their practice. Previous experience/results, familiarity, and use in practice (68%, 54%, and 37%, respectively) were the most commonly cited reasons for choosing a particular GC; pharmacokinetic profile and academic literature were infrequently cited reasons. Fifty-four percent of respondents were more likely to prescribe GCs for vocal performers compared with other patients. Additionally, most respondents stated that the potential for side effects only occasionally prevented GC utilization. Conclusions

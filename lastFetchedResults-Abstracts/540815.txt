The objective of this retrospective study was to determine whether the occurrence of brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome (BAOS) varried according to the phylo¬genic origins of dogs. The analysis of our hospital database showed that the frequency of BAOS was higher in modern than ancient breeds. This confirmed the findings that boxers are not as susceptible to BAOS as many other brachycephalic dog breeds be¬longing to the same phylogenic cluster.

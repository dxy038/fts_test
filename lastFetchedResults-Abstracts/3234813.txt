This paper addresses the concept and application of Cyber-Physical System to the field of transportation where bidirectional communication between two cars is emergent. We emphasize the importance of four major components in CPS with which the usage of CPS become more distinct and cost-effective in order to mitigate potential car accidents. The role of a front car is magnified to prevent rear collision from a following car. That is, a passive avoidance mechanism is proposed instead of active methods OEMs have developed and implemented so far.

In this paper, a control scheme based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm optimization MOPSO is proposed, which is able to tune the PID controller parameters simultaneously in order to find the set of trade-off optimal solutions that is called Pareto-set optimization solution of the conflicting objective functions for DC motor drive system. Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO is implemented to tackle a number of conflicting goals that define the optimality problem. This paper deals with five conflicting objective functions. These conflicting functions are: 1. Minimize the maximum overshoot, 2. Minimize the rise time, 3. Minimize speed tracking error, 4. Minimize the steady state error, and 5. Minimize the settling time.

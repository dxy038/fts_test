In this paper, we present distortion modeling for inter-operation dependent video transcoding. To allocate bits more efficiently, the multidimensional factors including spatial. SNR, and temporal and their trade-offs are exploited in terms of the quality of content. The objective of the joint control for the multidimensional video transcoding is to determine the optimal combination of transcoding operations. Based on the statistical analysis of inter-operation dependent distortion, we propose an improved distortion model. In experiments, the effectiveness of our model is shown.

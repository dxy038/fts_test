Background: Wart is a common skin disease, and 8% of patients referred to dermatologists suffer from warts.
Objective:To compare the efficacy of intralesional injections of bleomycin with normal saline in treatment of common resistant warts on palms and dorsum of hands. Patients & Methods: This study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial on 34 patients with common warts on palms and dorsum of their hands. These patients were randomly divided into two groups: 18 patients were treated with intralesional injections of bleomycin and 16 patients were treated with intralesional injections of normal saline. After 3 weeks of treatment, patients were evaluated and in case of unresponsiveness the second injection with
the same medication was attempted. This group was visited again 3 weeks later and finally response to treatment and possible complications were evaluated.
Results: In bleomycin group 88.9% and in normal saline group 56.3% remitted ( Fisher's exact test, P.value <0.05).Conclusion: Intralesional bleomycin is an effective and low risk treatment of common resistant warts on palms and dorsum of hands.

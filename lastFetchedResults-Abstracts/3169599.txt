Multi-user detection based on quantum optimization algorithm has aroused intense interests recently. Quantum clone genetic algorithm has many shortcomings such as: low efficiency, poor population diversity, slow convergence speed, easy to trap in local minimums, blindness in global optimal searching direction and so on. An improved quantum clone genetic algorithm (IQCGA) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm have many merits: (1) Adopting nicking probability division initialization strategy, the population diversity is enhanced; (2) Introducing quantum whole interference crossover, the information is spread in the whole population, so it helps to avoid trapping in local minimums, and accelerates convergence speed; (3) Making use of adaptation strategy in quantum rotate gate updating, the searching speed for optimal solution is accelerated; (4) In order to avoid premature and evolution stagnation, the superior individual whole crossover quantum catastrophe strategy is adopted, which helps the population to search the objective solution in different directions. Simulation results prove that the multiuser detection based on given algorithm has lower bit error, rapider converge speed, better resisting MAI ability and better Near-far Resistance ability than other multi-user detections based on quantum clone genetic algorithm and classical genetic algorithms obviously.

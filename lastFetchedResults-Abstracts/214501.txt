Pain in neonates can be as ociated with various risks and it seems essential to find a simple
and acceptable method for relieving pain. Pharmacolog ic agents are not recommended in neonates for
pain relief in minor procedures but orally administered glucose solution is found to be effective. The
objective of this study was to assess the effic acy of oral 30% glucose during intramuscular injection in
term neonates. Sixty-four healthy term neonates were recruited for this study during 1 month. The
inclusion criteria were gestational age 37-42 weeks, birth weight 2500-4000 gr, and Apgar score> 7.
The int rvention con ists of administration of either 2 ml of oral 30"'{' glucose or 2ml of sterile water 2
minutes before injection. The primary out come measure was the cumulative Neonatal Infant Pain Scale
(NIPS) score at 3 minutes after injection. Thirty-two neonate' received 30% glucose and 32 neonates
received sterile water. The cumulative NIPS score at 3 minutes after injection for neonates given 30'%
glucose was significantly (P = 0.000) lower than to r neonates given sterile water. The heart rate
immediately after injection for neonates given 30% glucose was significantly (P = 0.002 ) lower than for
neonates given sterile water. Oral 30% glucose given 2 minutes before injection was effec tive in
reducing neonatal pain fo llowing injection. It is a simple, safe and fast acting analgesic and should bc
considered [or minor invasive procedures in term neonates.

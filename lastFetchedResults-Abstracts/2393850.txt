We have constructed an experiment to perform bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurements of laboratory samples, and have used the experiment to characterize a sample of JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant. Characterizations relied on in-plane BRDF measurements in visible and near-infrared (NIR) bandpasses. The optical properties of the simulant sample were found to be similar to those observed for bright, lunar highland regions. Reflectance models (Hapke 1981. Bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy 1.

However, the models were not found to extrapolate well to fixed, near-zero phase angle data at varying incidence angles, and no solutions were found that provided simultaneous, high quality fits to the two types of data sets. Except for the single-scattering albedo, the best-fit parameters of the fixed incidence angle data were statistically the same in the visible and NIR. Correlations between the reflectance model parameters were systematically examined, and strong correlations were found between single-scattering albedo and the two two-stream Henyey–Greenstein scattering parameters and, to a lesser extent, the small-scale mean surface roughness.

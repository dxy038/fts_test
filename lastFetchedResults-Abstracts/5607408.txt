A technique of conscious control of oneÂ´s EEG (electroencephalogram) resonance was tested for potential use as an indication of mental resource allocation. An experimental paradigm was developed which incorporated this technique and a number of tasks from the Criterion Task Set (CTS). The objective was to determine if the ability to consciously control EEG resonance varied in a systematic fashion based on the type of CTS task being performed (i.e. different mental resources being tapped). An experimental setup, including a lock-in amplifier system (LAS) and the CTS, was developed. Subjects were trained in loop-closure performance at chosen EEG frequencies. Trained subjects then attempted loop-closure while performing CTS tasks. Experimental methods and preliminary results are addressed

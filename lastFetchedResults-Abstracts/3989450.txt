This study proposes a distributed generation system managed by a power converter with reduced number of components. Such converter operates with the same characteristics of the full-bridge converter. The distributed generation system is constituted by an induction generator with a prime mover (PM), a single-phase utility grid and a photovoltaic panel. A wind, hydraulic or another controlled power source is adopted to drive the induction generator, operating as a pm. The advantages of the four-leg power converter are explored in this application, such as reduced number of switches, high performance and dc-link voltage equal to that of standard converter with five legs. In addition, the control system is able to operate with a controlled mechanical power, allowing a bidirectional power flow. Simulated and experimental results are presented.

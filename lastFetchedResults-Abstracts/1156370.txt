An approach to dealing with missing data, both during the design and normal operation of a neuro-fuzzy classifier is presented in this paper. Missing values are processed within a general fuzzy minâ€“max neural network architecture utilising hyperbox fuzzy sets as input data cluster prototypes. An emphasis is put on ways of quantifying the uncertainty which missing data might have caused. This takes a form of classification procedure whose primary objective is the reduction of a number of viable alternatives rather than attempting to produce one winning class without supporting evidence. If required, the ways of selecting the most probable class among the viable alternatives found during the primary classification step, which are based on utilising the data frequency information, are also proposed. The reliability of the classification and the completeness of information is communicated by producing upper and lower classification membership values similar in essence to plausibility and belief measures to be found in the theory of evidence or possibility and necessity values to be found in the fuzzy sets theory. Similarities and differences between the proposed method and various fuzzy, neuro-fuzzy and probabilistic algorithms are also discussed. A number of simulation results for well-known data sets are provided in order to illustrate the properties and performance of the proposed approach.

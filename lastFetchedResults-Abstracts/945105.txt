Background & Objective: Effective bedside care is the main objective of nursing education. Correct clinical evaluation of students has been one of the toughest tasks for clinical nursing lecturers. The objective of this study was the translation and psychometric evaluation of the clinical performance assessment scale among nursing students in Iran. 

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with the objective of validating the Iranian version of the nursing students’ performance scale within the clinical setting. The scale was translated from English into Persian by the backward and forward method. Its face and content validities were determined. 2 items was added in the content and face validity process. In order to determine the construct validity, exploratory factor analysis by convenience sampling method was carried out on 275 senior nursing students within clinical educational settings for 5 months. Evaluation was conducted according to this scale. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to measure internal consistency. 

Results: The mean and standard deviation of students’ scores was 63.98 ± 13.35. Factor analysis indicated the extraction of three factors: the nursing process (10 items, eigenvalue 8.99), professional behaviors (16 items, eigenvalue 7.97), and technical skills (2 items, eigenvalue 2.03). The reliability of the scale obtained by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.92. 

Conclusion: The results of psychometric evaluation of the clinical performance assessment scale vindicated the reliability and validity of this scale and the potential for using this instrument in the nursing education field in Iran. However, the inclusion of the technical skills factor would need further balancing and expansion.

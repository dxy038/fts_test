Study objective: To assess the effectiveness of an international emergency medical services (EMS) train-the-trainer program.

Participants: Seven bilingual Polish physicians attended a 350-hour US-based EMS training program. The physicians returned to Poland to train Polish-speaking EMS personnel.

Interventions: The Polish training was assessed by means of a pretest, a final examination, a series of skill stations, and a retrospective self-assessment instrument created by the authors. The retrospective self-assessment instrument, using a six-point Likert scale, measured the degree of self-reported competence before and after training in three areas: basic trauma, advanced medical, and basic medical.

Results: One hundred seventy-nine Polish students were assessed. Pretest scores ranged from 17% to 100% (mean, 74%±11%). Ninety-one percent passed the final examination (mean, 91%±4.0%; range, 74% to 99%). All students passed all skill stations. The before-and-after instrument indicated that the Polish students prior competence ranged from not competent (Likert score 1) to fully competent (Likert score 6). Mean scores were: basic trauma, 2.6±.4; advanced medical, 2.5±.7; and basic medical, 2.8±.7. After-course scores demonstrated improved competence. Before-and-after instrument score differences were significant for each area (P<.0001).

Conclusion: Despite differences in language, culture, technology, and resources, an international train-the-trainer program can be evaluated. In addition to standard testing, a retrospective before-and-after self-assessment instrument provides corroborative evidence of program succes

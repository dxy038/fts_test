The objective force is the ultimate goal of the U.S. Army to transform itself into a highly mobile ground force that will be the most rapidly deployable and tactically agile force capable of engaging "full-spectrum" operations. Advanced information and wireless communications capabilities are among key-enabling technologies that support a dominant feature of the objective force: rapid deployment. This paper describes and explain the technologies utilized in an experimental mobile test bed environment that has been deployed as a communications contingency during Y2K support to the Pentagon, although the main purpose of the test bed was to establish a platform for conducting research, development, and evaluation of emerging communications, networking, sensors, and information technologies that can improve strategic and tactical responsiveness of the U.S. ground force.

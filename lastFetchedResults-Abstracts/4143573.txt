In order to support connectivity requirements for today´s pervasive devices, a new type of wireless network is needed. The pervasive information network (PiNet) is a new wireless connectivity architecture designed to support access to organizational information using lightweight handheld devices. PiNet´s main objective is to support a mass-market-type application, where thousands of users can simultaneously have interactive access to a variety of organizational information sources while maintaining a short response time and using a simple, low-cost, power-limited pervasive device. This article summarizes the necessary characteristics of PiNet and presents a survey of the existing main technologies, explaining how they fall short of providing a total solution for pervasive wireless networks. In conclusion, this document indicates the direction that must be taken in order to design a solution that will provide a large number of users with a practical means of obtaining information in a timely manner

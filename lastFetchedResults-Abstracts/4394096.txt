This paper addresses the bi-objective optimization of continuous bio-dissimilation process of glycerol to 1, 3-propanediol. A bi-objective optimization model is firstly proposed to maximize the production rate of 1, 3-propanediol, simultaneously maximize the conversion rate of glycerol and ensure the bioprocess is operated under steady-state conditions. Then this bi-objective problem can be transformed into a sequence of single objective problems by using the weighted-sum and normal-boundary intersection methods respectively. Finally, these single objective problems are solved by an interior point method. The results show that the weighted-sum and normalboundary intersection methods can obtain the approximate Pareto-optimal set of the proposed bi-objective optimization problem.

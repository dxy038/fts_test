This paper proposes a train movement model with fixed runtime that can be employed to find feasible control strategies for a single train along an inter-city railway line. The objective of the model is to minimize arrival delays at each station along railway lines. However, train movement is a typical nonlinear problem for complex running environments and different requirements. A heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem in this paper and the simulation results show that the train could overcome the disturbance from train delay and coordinates the operation strategies to sure punctual arrival of trains at the destination. The developed algorithm can also be used to evaluate the running reliability of trains in scheduled timetables.

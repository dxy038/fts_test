Background: 
In vitro evidence shows that immune function is compromised in people with diabetes. Therefore,
infections are more common and infection-related mortality is higher in this group. Accurate information about the
prevalence of infectious diseases in diabetic patients can help in health care policy and support planning. We do not
know the spectrum of clinical infectious diseases in our patients .This study was conducted to determine the most
common infectious diseases in diabetic patients.
Patients and methods:
 In this cross-sectional study all diabetic patients who were admitted to our hospital in Zahedan
(Southeastern Iran) between 2001 and 2006, were evaluated. At first, we selected all of the patients with diabetes. Then all patients files were reviewed retrospectively for demographic factors and duration of diabetes, type of diabetes, cause of admission, prevalence of infectious diseases, duration of hospitalization and mortality rate.
Results: 
A total of 112 patients with diabetes (45 males and 67 females with an age range of 10 to 80) were evaluated.
Pneumonia, diabetic foot and tuberculosis were the most common infections. Seventy percent of cases had type 2
diabetes. Duration of hospitalization was between 1 to 20 days.
Conclusion: 
Upon the results emerged from this study, infection is the most frequent cause of hospitalization and death
in the diabetic patients. Control of the disease, good health care system and vaccination can decrease the rate of
infectious diseases.

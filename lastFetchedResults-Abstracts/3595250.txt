We propose to fuse the high spatial content of two 250-m spectral bands of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) into its five 500-m bands using wavelet-based multiresolution analysis. Our objective was to test the effectiveness of this technique to increase the accuracy of snow mapping in mountainous environments. To assess the performance of this approach, we took advantage of the simultaneity between the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) and MODIS sensors. With a 15-m spatial resolution, the ASTER sensor provided reference snow maps, which were then compared to MODIS-derived snow maps. The benefit of the method was assessed through the investigation of various metrics, which showed an improvement from 3% to 20%. Therefore, the enhanced snow map is of great benefit for environmental and hydrological applications in steep terrain.

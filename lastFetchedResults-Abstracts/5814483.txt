Requirement engineering is a crucial activity, which can affect the entire life cycle of software development project. The main objective of requirement engineering is to collect requirements from different viewpoints such as business requirements, customer requirements, user requirements, constraints, security requirements etc. Information is also one of the important requirements of requirement engineering process to develop quality and updated software. Typically, the specification of information requirements commences with observing and interviewing people at different levels. The collected information flows across the management spectrum in decision making for project development. In this paper, we discuss a noble approach for Information Requirement Engineering (IRE) that can assist to collect proper and valuable information for software development. Also, we examine the process of analyzing the obtained information at different level of management spectrum, which may lead to positive changes in an organisation.

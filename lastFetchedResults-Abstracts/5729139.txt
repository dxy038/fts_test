The main objective of automatic blood glucose concentration controllers is to avoid hypo- and hyper-glycemia, i.e. maintain the concentration levels between 60 and 120 mg/dL, by optimally manipulating the insulin infusion rates. In the medical literature, hypoglycemia is considered to be more harmful to an individualÂ´s health than hyperglycemia. In this work, a multiobjective controller that can take into account this asymmetry in the objective function and can be implemented with minimal computational effort, by using parametric programming techniques, is proposed. An alternative technique that gives higher priority to the satisfaction of constraints on hypoglycemia than on hyperglycemia is also presented. The performance of both the controllers is analyzed under meal disturbances.

Objective: The primary aim of this study was to report on the prevalence of perioperative complications associated with reconstructive pelvic surgery. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors predictive of perioperative complications in this population. Study Design: A retrospective chart review was performed of 100 consecutive cases of reconstructive pelvic surgery. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of perioperative complications was 46%, including 13 intraoperative complications and 33 postoperative complications. The readmission rate for complications was 15%. The number of procedures per patient was an independent risk factor for intraoperative blood loss (P< .0038). Intraoperative estimated blood loss in turn was an independent risk factor for perioperative complications (P< .0001). Conclusions: Perioperative complications associated with reconstructive pelvic surgery were increased relative to those associated with general gynecologic surgery. The number of procedures per patient and associated blood loss appeared to contribute to the increase in perioperative complications. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1355-60.)

The Rogowski coil is a simple and inexpensive device that can be adapted to measure high frequency currents such as those created by partial discharges in dielectrics. It has been demonstrated in previous works that the Rogowski coil can be self-integrating when used at high frequencies and can be tuned to measure partial discharges without the need of cumbersome electronic devices. The aim of this paper is to explore the possibilities of obtaining better measurements simply changing the electric parameters and hence, the geometry of the coil. In the process, the inductance, mutual inductance, resistance and capacitance are written in function of geometric variables. Then, a bode plot simulates the effect of changing some of these variables and the results are commented focused on the pursued objective.

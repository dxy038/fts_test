The fuel cell is one of the most important energy products in the 21st century, and most industrial-advanced countries in the world are placing high expectation on its development. The applications of fuel cells in Taiwan has spread broadly in many products and it takes high global market share, such as notebook computers, PDAs and digital cameras, along with items like automobiles, motorcycles and power generation equipment. In this study we introduce a multi-objective compromise optimization to solve the optimal strategic plans of fuel cell industry, which is emerging industry in Taiwan. In the first step, we introduce popular analytic hierarchy process with fuzzy set theory to establish the hierarchy system to determine the relative importance of evaluated criteria. Secondly, fuzzy geometric mean method was utilized to aggregate the performance score by individual judgment of evaluator, which scores express the measurement of strategic plan proposed by participated experts. Thirdly, the synthetic value of each strategic plan was integrated by criteria weights with performance score, and positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) were defined by MinkowskiÂ´s distance metric function. Fourthly, the optimal compromise solution will be derived which should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution as well as the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution. Along with the results of this research, we successfully demonstrate that the multi-objective compromise optimization is a good alternative for evaluation of multiple criteria decision making problems

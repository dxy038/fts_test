The objective of this study was therefore to improve heavy metals bioleaching efficiencies through introducing heterotrophic microorganism into the sulfur-based autotrophic sludge bioleaching system. An acid-tolerant strain Bacillus subtilis LJ86 was successfully isolated from the bioleached acidified sediments and it could grow well between pH 4.5 and 8.0, with optimum pH ~5.5. A marked improvement in the rate of sediment pH reduction was observed in the combined bioleaching experiment (co-inoculation of B. subtilis LJ86 and At. thiooxidans), resulting in the accelerated removals of Zn, Cu and Cr. Compared with 16 days required for maximum removal of various metals for the single bioleaching process (without inoculation of B. subtilis LJ86), the bioleaching period was greatly shorten to 10 days for the combined bioleaching process.

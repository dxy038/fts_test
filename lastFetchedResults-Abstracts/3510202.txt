The development of an IRCC (Integrated Real-time Closed-loop Controller) which performs the functions of Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) and Automatic Generation Control (AGC) as well as alleviates the system overloads is discussed. The objective of the IRCC is to adjust the system variables and Lagrange multipliers so as to satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of optimality, thereby steering the system to a new optimal operating state. The IRCC performs this task on a real-time basis using SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) measurements. The performance of the IRCC is tested under normal as well as contingency operation by simulating the long-term dynamics of a multi-area power system.

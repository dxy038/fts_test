In this memory the ASIC tool (Ambient of Interactive Development of the Controller) is introduced. The software has been realised with the objective to supply an instrument for the aided synthesis of complex control systems. It is based on the polynomial approach of the direct synthesis and takes advantage of a number of properties of a particular class of polynomials: the Lipatov´s polynomials. ASIC reduces the intrinsic complexity of a strategy like the direct synthesis, taking advantage of the potentialities of the MatLab<sup>&#8482;</sup> platform and using the rules of the Lipatov´s polynomials in order to offer a powerful and effective instrument also for who is not expert of innovative control strategies.

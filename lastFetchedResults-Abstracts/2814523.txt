Advances in aircraft navigation technology (i.e. Performance Based Navigation) have enabled the implementation of precise curved path approaches (i.e., RNP 0.3 w/ RF leg approach procedure) in the terminal airspace which improve flight efficiency and allows safe navigation near high terrain obstacles and airspace occupied by other flows of air traffic. However, the adoption of these technologies by airlines has been slow and haphazard due to uncertainties in the estimates of the benefits of these new approach procedures. This paper describes a methodology and results of an analysis of RNP approach for Runway 13C at MDW airport with the objective of quantifying its benefits from an airlines perspective. Surveillance track data for aircraft flying the approaches to MDW (including aircraft equipped to fly the RNP approach) was combined with meteorological data, operational data and an aircraft fuel burn performance model to estimate the total potential benefits of the RNP approach procedure. The results show the use of RNP approach on the MDW 13C has the potential of saving on average 17.6K gallons of fuel per year for arrivals at MDW by reducing the track distance while performing precise curved path RNP approaches when wind and ceiling/visibility conditions require using the ILS 13C. This corresponds to on average $98K savings in airline direct operation costs. The precise curved path RNP approaches also make the arrival operations to runway 13C at MDW independent from operations at ORD (neighboring airport). This has a potential for saving $38K for MDW arrivals from elimination of holding patterns. The implications of these results with respect to successful implementation of RNP approach at MDW have also been discussed.

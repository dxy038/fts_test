The nature-inspired optimization algorithm is implemented to solve the proposed static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP) problem. The STNEP problem is one of the major problems in the power sector. It helps to find out the new transmission facilities, which should be added to the transmission network, in order to fulfill the required demand of the network planner. The objective of the TNEP problem is to minimize the total system cost. The widely used direct current (DC) power flow mathematical model is adopted in this paper to simulate the STNEP problem. The proposed problem is solved for without considering generation rescheduling and with considering generation rescheduling case. The four standard IEEE test systems such as 6-bus, 24-bus, 46-bus and 93-bus are considered in this paper to simulate the proposed problem. The results obtained are compared with the previously published results in literature.

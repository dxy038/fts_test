OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the incidence of adverse cardiovacular effects of terbutaline sulfate when administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion in women with arrested pretrem labor.
STUDY DESIGN: Over a 6-year period records from 8709 women prescribed this therapy for preterm labor that had preivously been arrested with other intravenous tocolytics were reviewed. These women were assessed daily for cardiovascular complaints and tolerance of the medication, while either in the hospital or at the home (by telephone). The main outcomes studies were the occurrence of pulmonary edema, sustained cardiac arrhythmias, chest pain, or myocardial ischemia. Any maternal death regardless of cause was also reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 8709 subjects, 47 (0.54%) had one or more cardiopulmonary problems. Pulmonary edema developed in 28 patients (0.32%) while receiving continuous subcutaneous infusion of terbutaline, 5 at home and 23 in the hospital. Of the total, 17 women were being treated concurrently with large amounts of intravenous fluids and one to three other tocolytic agents. In the 11 remaining subjects, 4 were diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension and/or multiple gestation. Nineteen patients experienced other adverse cardiovascular effects, including electrocardiogram changes, irregular heart rate, chest pain, or shrotness of breath.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous terbutaline infusion for women with stabilized preterm labor is associated with much fewer adverse effects than previous literature regarding intravenous Î²-adrenergic agonist therapy would suggest.

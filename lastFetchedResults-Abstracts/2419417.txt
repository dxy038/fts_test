A multi-objective chaotic particle swarm optimization (MOCPSO) method has been developed to solve the environmental/economic dipatch (EED) problems considering both economic and environmental issues. The proposed MOCPSO method has been applied in two test power systems. Compared with the conventional multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) method, for the compromising minimum fuel cost and emission case, the fuel cost and pollutant emission obtained from MOCPSO method can be reduced about 50.08 $/h and 2.95 kg/h, respectively, in test system 1, about 0.02 $/h and 1.11 kg/h, respectively, in test system 2. The MOCPSO method also results in higher quality solutions for the minimum fuel cost case and the minimum emission case in both of the test power systems. Hence, MOCPSO method can result in great environmental and economic effects. For EED problems, the MOCPSO method is more feasible and more effective alternative approach than the conventional MOPSO method.

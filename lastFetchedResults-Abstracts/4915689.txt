The quality of business process is on one hand determined by the structure of business process chain, and on the other hand the configuration of resources and organization. This paper mainly discusses how to appropriately assign resources according to the historical information of resources in the execution of activities so as to ensure the high performances of business processes. The quality of resource assignment is described by the average approximation degree to the ideal resource assignment based on the TOPSIS method and the uniformity degree of resource assignment based on the concept of information entropy, which can be regarded as the predictive quality of business process. The multi-objective evaluation-combined optimization models of business processes have been developed of intra- and inter-enterprise business processes. The mixed non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimization problem.

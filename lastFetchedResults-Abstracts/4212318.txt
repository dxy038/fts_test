In the monitoring optical system, it is hope as possible as large field of view. Fish-eye lens can gaze hemisphere and super-hemisphere airspace; meanwhile, because of small size, low power consumption, low cost, can provide an objective real-time images. In the paper using geometric aberration theory and reading kinds of patents. The paper designs a novel fish-eye lens. The field of view (FOV) can be 200 degree and F/3.75. It is composed of 12 spherical lens element. The fish-eye lens operates simultaneously in the visible wavelength regions. It is can be applied to monitoring system that expand field of view. To avoid blind section and enlarge monitoring field.

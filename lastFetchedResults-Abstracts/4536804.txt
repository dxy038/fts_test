We study the voltage and current behavior of Gate Oxide Short faults due to pinholes in the gate oxide. Our objective is to give a detailed analysis of the behavior of the GOS defect taking into account random parameters such as the GOS resistance, the GOS location and the GOS size. To facilitate an accurate analysis, we use a bi-dimensional array, and, since a complete analysis is desired, we derive characteristics of the GOS as a function of its resistance, location and size. Finally, we validate the model has been validated through measurements of GOS intentionally injected into a designed and manufactured circuit

We present a generalization of the supervisory control problem proposed by Ramadge and Wonham. The objective of that problem is to synthesize a controller, which constrains a systemÂ´s behavior according to a given specification, ensuring controllability and co-accessibility. By introducing a new representation of the solution using systems of /spl mu/-calculus equations we are able to handle these two conditions separately and thus to exchange the co-accessibility requirement by any /spl mu/-calculus expression. Well-known results on the complexity of /spl mu/-calculus model checking allow us to easily assess the computational complexity of any generalization. As an example we solve the synthesis problem under consideration of fairness constraints.

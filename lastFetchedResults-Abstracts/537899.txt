The objective of the study was to establish efficacy of antihistamine fexofenadine in atopic dogs. Thirty atopic dogs over the age of 6 months, of different breeds and sex were randomized into two groups with 15 dogs each. The group F received fexofenadine orally; the group M received methylprednisolone for the period of 6 weeks. CADESI and pruritus score were measured three times during the study (at the baseline, after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks of treatment). Statistically significant discrepancies in CADESI score in comparison with baseline were observed in both groups, namely for 3rd (P=0,007 for group M and P=0,019 for group F) and 6th treatment week (P<0,001 for group M and P<0,001 for group F). Between the groups statistically significant difference in CADESI score for the 6th week of treatment was observed in favour of group F (P=0,012). Statistically significant lowering of strengths of itching score at week 3 (P=0,002) and week 6 (P=0,004) were observed in group M compared to baseline. The difference in strength of itching score in group F was not statistically significant at week 3 of treatment (P=0,215) but was at week 6 of treatment (P=0,002). Between the groups the difference was statistically significant at baseline (P=0,048), although not at week 3 and 6 of treatment. The results of the study are showing comparable improvement of clinical signs for fexofenadine treatment versus methylprednisolone treatment, nevertheless fexofenadine needed longer period of time to reach efficacy endpoint.

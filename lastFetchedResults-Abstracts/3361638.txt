This paper proposes a new topology for a three-phase open-delta connection ac&#8211;ac converter based on the switched capacitor principle. The topology employs only capacitors and switches in the power stage, which can provide high efficiency and power density. It operates in open loop with constant values for the gain, duty cycle, and frequency. The converter is bidirectional and thus it can step-down or step-up the output voltages. A 3.5-kW prototype was built, tested and used to verify the theoretical analysis for resistive, inductive, and nonlinear loads. The efficiency of the topology is around 93% in nominal load and the power density is 1.178 kW/kg.

An EPRI project with the objective of developing an optimized 345 kV paper-polypropylene-paper pipe cable system is discussed. Highlights of the design and manufacture of the new reduced-wall cable are detailed. Pertinent aspects of a major corollary development, establishing a US domestic supplier of PPP, are described. Laboratory qualification tests suggest that reasonable cable optimization is achieved. An optimized PPP joint design is described. The economic advantages and versatility of this new cable system are summarized

Background and objective: The mesolimbic dopaminergic system that projects
from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has a
major role in the the stress responses. In this study, the effect of ethanol
administration in the VTA unilaterally on response to stress was assessed in the
rat Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats (250-300 gr) were cannulated
unilaterally. After 5-7 days, they transferred to the lab and electrical foot shock
stress was applied to them for 7 days. Every day, 20 minutes before each stress
sessions, animals received either sterile Saline (0.5 μl / rat) as the control group or
Ethanol 25% (0.25 μl / rat) as the experimental group. On days 1, 3 and 7 of the
experiments, blood samples were taken from retro-orbital sinus for corticosterone
measurements. For Anorexia response, after 30 minutes of foot shock, the delay
of eating was measured. Result: The anorexia in the Ethanol group was
significantly more than Saline group. Conclusion: It s probable that high
concentration of Ethanol stimulate GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
of the brain) receptors by increasing CL- ion channels conductance in neurons, so
anorexia decreased in the group that received Ethanol in the VTA

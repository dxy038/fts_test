In this paper, we focus on the asymptotic cross layer analysis of multi-antenna systems with transmit MMSE (Tx- MMSE) beamforming, near orthogonal scheduling and outdated CSIT. To capture the effect of the potential packet outage, we introduce the average system goodput, which measures the average b/s/Hz delivered to the mobiles successfully, as the system performance objective. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal power and rate allocations as well as a low complexity near orthogonal user scheduling (NEOUS) algorithm to solve the cross-layer optimization problem.We derive the asymptotic order of growth in system goodput for general CSIT error variance sigma<sup>2</sup> and found that for sufficiently large n<sub>T</sub> (number of antennas at the base station) and K (number of users) where K = g<sup>-1</sup>(n<sub>T</sub> ) for some strictly increasing function g(x) = o(x), the the system goodput grows in the order of n<sub>T</sub> log[(1- sigma<sup>2</sup> ) logK] when sigma<sup>2</sup> &lt; 1. This is the same order of growth as the optimal order of growth in broadcast channels with perfect CSIT and hence, the NEOUS is order-optimal. On the other hand, we need exponentially larger K to compensate for the penalty in multiuser diversity gain due to CSIT errors.

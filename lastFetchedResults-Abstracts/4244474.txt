This paper studies the reliable multi-objective decentralized controller design for linear systems. A simultaneous mixed LQG/H<sup>&#8734;</sup> control with regional pole constraint approach is proposed for designing decentralized controllers. The LMI approach is not applicable for the considered problem. Therefore, based on the barrier method, we solve an auxiliary minimization problem to obtain an approximate solution of the considered problem. For illustration, the obtained results are applied to the design of reliable controller for full car active suspension systems with considering possible sensors and actuators failures. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

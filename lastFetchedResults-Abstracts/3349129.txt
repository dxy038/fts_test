This paper presents a numerically attractive approach to design reduced-order multi-objective &#8459;<sub>2</sub>/&#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> controllers for discrete-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. The proposed controller synthesis approach relies on an a priori computed polynomially parameter-dependent full-order LPV controller that stabilizes the LPV system for all possible parameter trajectories. This full-order controller is subsequently used in a sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem for reduced-order &#8459;<sub>2</sub>/&#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> LPV synthesis. Po&#769;lya relaxations are used to obtain tractable LMI formulations, and a simplicial subdivision of the parameter domain is applied to relieve the numerical burden. Experimental validations on a lab-scale overhead crane with varying cable length illustrate the practical viability of the approach.

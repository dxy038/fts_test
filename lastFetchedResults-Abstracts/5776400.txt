Objective: Nonylphenol(NP) is NPnEOs of recalcitrant compound and classified as an endocrine disrupting chemical(EDC). The reproductive toxicity of Nonylphenol has been extensively studied in mammals. In this study, To explore the toxic effects of nonylphenol on human embryo Liver L-02 Cells. Methods Human embryo Liver L-02 Cells were exposed to different concentration of NP(1, 10, 50, 100&#956;mol/L). Survival rate was measured by MTT, apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry, level of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Maleic Dialdehyde(MDA), Glutathione Peroxidase(GSH-PX) were measured by Typical reagent kits. Results L-02 Cells survival rate decreased as the concentration of NP increased, and prolongation of culture time (50&#956;mol/L NP for 0, 1h, 4h, 24h) decreased. Apoptosis rate increased as the NP concentration, Compared with the normal control group, the MDA content of the middle and high dose of NP group increased obviously (p&lt;;0.05). The GSH-PX activity of high dose of NP group was also higher than the normal control group(p&lt;;0.05). The SOD activity of all dose of NP groups were all obviously lower than the normal control group(p&lt;;0.05). Three kinds of measurement of the positive control group were all significantly change than the normal control group (p&lt;;0.05). Conclusion NP has cytotoxic effect and oxidative damage to L-02 Cells, and induce L-02 Cells apoptosis.

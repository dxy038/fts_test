In this paper, we present a new scheme for sub-band allocation in multiuser downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with partial channel quality information (CQI). Our objective is to maximize the total throughput of the system under the constraints of transmit power. In previous methods, each user in a cell transmits CQI of its all sub-bands to the base station, which requires extremely high feedback overhead. Thus, we propose an efficient sub-band allocation algorithm in which each user transmits partial CQI and one additional information to reduce the amount of feedback. Simulation results show that we can greatly reduce the amount of feedback than full feedback system

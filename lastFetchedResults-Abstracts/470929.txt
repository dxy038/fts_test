Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the severity of anal incontinence and its impact on quality of life and sexual function in women after anal sphincteroplasty.
Study design
Eighty-six women who underwent anal sphincteroplasty during the years 1993 to 2004 were mailed validated survey instruments to evaluate continence status, health-related quality of life, and sexual functioning. Demographic and perioperative data were obtained from patient charts.
Results
At a mean follow-up time of 5.6 Â± 3.0 years, 6 women (11%) were totally continent; 8 women (15%) were incontinent of flatus only, and 41 women (75%) were incontinent of liquid and/or solid stool. Sexual function scores were not correlated with continence scores; 24% vs 4% of subjects who had undergone an overlapping sphincteroplasty versus an end-to-end sphincteroplasty reported pain during intercourse (P = .04).
Conclusion
Anal continence rates 5 years after anal sphincteroplasty are disappointing, adversely impact quality of life, yet do not appear to relate to sexual function.

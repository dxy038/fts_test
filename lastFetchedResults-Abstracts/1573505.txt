Objective: To evaluate the effect of Low Level laser Therapy on foot ulcers in diabetic type II based on photographic assessment. 
Background data: Researchers have been used low level lasers to enhance wound healing. Ulcers in diabetic patients are in risk of compromised healing, due to reduced microcirculation and the other disorders that may affect wound healing.
Material and Methods: Thirty diabetic type 2 patients, with grade II and III diabetic foot ulcers were treated by low level laser therapy. The mean duration of diabetes was 14.3 years and ulcers were present since average 3.4 months ago. Treatment sessions were performed every other day for 10-15 sessions and then continued two times a week until complete healing or achieving grade 1. 
Results: Mean of wounds surface was 43.5 cm2 (range 0.09- 62.5) before treatment, and was 0.3 cm2 (range 0- 1.7) after about 18 treatment sessions (range 8-46), P < 0.001. There was no relapse or other problem with ulcers during three months of follow-up. There were no reported side-effects by the patients. 
Conclusion: Low level laser therapy could be a safe and effective method for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Clinical trials with higher sample size are proposed to evaluate more details about low level laser therapy effectiveness on diabetic wound healing process.

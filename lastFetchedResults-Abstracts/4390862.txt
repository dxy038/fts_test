Design rule is an important interface between design and manufacturing. It becomes more complex as the process advances to 16-nm and beyond. Current approaches to generate design rules are empirical shrink and lithographic simulation. However, it is time-consuming and costly to revise design rules for performance boost and yield improvement after design rules are frozen. Early performance gains in early design rule development without cost increase and yield loss will benefit semiconductor industry. In this work, we for the first time consider 16-nm bulk FinFET standard cell performance, yield, area, and layout style simultaneously to optimize design rules to meet ITRS by using geometric programming. Optical proximity correction, and electromagnetic field and circuit simulations are performed for objective function evaluation. The result achieves more than 100%-delay and 50%-yield improvement without area change by this systematic and statistical approach.

A walking mechanism of bionic biped water-walking robot is designed, the equations of the location, velocity, acceleration and dynamics of the two are deduced by kinematics analysis. To simulate the foot trajectory of basilisk lizard´s, taking the foot rod and the horizontal plane angle curve as the objective optimization function, the influences of the foot rod bar length change on the Influence of the horizontal plane angle have done. The walking mechanism is optimized by analyzing the influential factors of sensitivity. Finally the optimized mechanism is simulated, the simulation results show that the movement of this bionic walking mechanism can meet the basilisk lizards´ foot trajectory.

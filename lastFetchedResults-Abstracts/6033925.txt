Depth image-based rendering (DIBR) techniques are advanced tools in 3-D video (3DV) applications that are used to synthesize a number of additional views in a multiview-video-plus-depth (MVD) representation. The MVD format consists of video and depth sequences for a limited number of original camera views of the same scene. An inherent problem of the view synthesis concept is given by image information that is occluded in the original views and becomes visible, in the extrapolated views. To handle these disoc-clussions, we propose a DIBR algorithm with advanced inpainting methods. Our renderer enhances visual experience by taking spatial and temporal texture consistency problems into account. In order to compensate the global motion in a sequence, image registration is incorporated into the framework. The proposed method shows objective and subjective gains compared to the state-of-the-art.

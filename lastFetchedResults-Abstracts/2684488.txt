Brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG) has substantial benefits, which make it an attractive alternative as a wind turbine generator. However, it suffers from lower efficiency and larger dimensions in comparison to DFIG. Hence, optimizing the BDFIG structure is necessary for enhancing its situation commercially. In previous studies, a simple model has been used in BDFIG design procedure that is insufficiently accurate. Furthermore, magnetic saturation and iron loss are not considered because of difficulties in determination of flux density distributions. The aim of this paper is to establish an accurate yet computationally fast model suitable for BDFIG design studies. The proposed approach combines three equivalent circuits including electric, magnetic and thermal models. Utilizing electric equivalent circuit makes it possible to apply static form of magnetic equivalent circuit, because the elapsed time to reach steady-state results in the dynamic form is too long for using in population-based design studies. The operating characteristics, which are necessary for evaluating the objective function and constraints values of the optimization problem, can be calculated using the presented approach considering iron loss, saturation, and geometrical details. The simulation results of a D-180 prototype BDFIG are compared with measured data in order to validate the developed model.

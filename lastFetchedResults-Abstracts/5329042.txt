Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) provides a standard to facilitate interoperability among medical devices from the perspective of hardware and software. Though DICOM is widely adopted by medical device manufacturers, it does not specify risk management details in developing medical device software. This paper hypothesizes that this shortage of DICOM can be complemented by the risk management process area of CMMI<sup>&#174;</sup> at maturity level 3. The objective of this research is to integrate DICOM information model with risk management process area of CMMI<sup>&#174;</sup> for radiotherapy application. This research will enable the developers of radiotherapy applications to define and mitigate risks effectively.

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the attachment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-degrading bacteria can promote desorption of PAHs from humin, thereby increasing their bioavailability. Biodegradation of humin-bound phenanthrene (PHE) – a model compound for PAHs – was investigated using two PHE-degrading bacteria, Sphingobium sp. PHE3 and Micrococcus sp. PHE9, respectively. Sorption data of PHE to humin fitted well into the modified Freundlich equation. Further, a new sorption band appeared at 1262 cm−1, demonstrating intermolecular interactions between PHE and humin. Interestingly, approximately 65.3% of humin-bound PHE was degraded by both strains, although only about 17.8% of PHE could be desorbed from humin by Tenax extraction. Furthermore, both strains grew well in mineral medium and also attached to humin surfaces for substrate uptake. It is proposed that the attached bacteria could possibly consume PHE on the humin via interactions between bacterial surfaces and humin, thereby overcoming the low PHE bioavailability and resulting in enhanced degradation.

The mining environment presents a challenging prospect for stereo vision. Our objective is to produce a stereo vision sensor suited to close-range scenes consisting mostly of rocks. This sensor should produce a dense depth map within real-time constraints. Speed and robustness are of foremost importance for this application. This paper compares a number of stereo matching algorithms in terms of robustness and suitability to fast implementation. These include traditional area-based algorithms, and algorithms based on non-parametric transforms, notably the rank and census transforms. Our experimental results show that the rank and census transforms are robust with respect to radiometric distortion and introduce less computational complexity than conventional area-based matching techniques.

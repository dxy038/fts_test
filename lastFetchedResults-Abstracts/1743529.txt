Computer-based simulation for interventional radiology training has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its potential to train remotely from patients and to provide objective assessment of proficiency. Yet developing a high fidelity simulator with realistic tactile feedback requires accurate knowledge of forces exerted on medical devices during interventional radiology procedures. This paper presents the development and validation of a force sensor for the measurement of axial forces generated during needle, and combined cannula/trocar, puncture procedures in patients. In order to assess the performance of this sensor, in vitro measurements were obtained using needle penetration of porcine liver, kidney and muscle. The results were compared with forces measured by means of a tensile tester.

ation results showed that the force sensor has high sensitivity and linearity. Comparison of the force profiles obtained from the sensor and the tensile tester shows that good agreement was achieved in the in vitro studies for all the tissues tested.

inary clinical force measurements during arterial puncture and liver biopsy procedures have been performed in patients. An example of force recording for each procedure type is presented.

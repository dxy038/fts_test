Background: Despite the recent advances in medicine, still many people suffer from longstanding
tuberculosis. Delay in the diagnosis may result in further mortality and morbidity.
Because of the importance of delay in the diagnosis, we decided to study and evaluate the patient
delay and physician delay.
Methods: A descriptive analytical study was done on 97 patients referred to the National
Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Tehran from September 2002 through
March 2003. Those individuals who fulfilled the inclusion criteria underwent a face to face
interview. The questionnaires were filled out. The interval between the first appearance of the
clinical manifestation and the first visit to the physician was calculated (patient delay). Also, the
period between the patient's first visit to the physician and the final diagnosis was worked out.
Results: The mean patient delay time was 15 ± 13 days with a median of 13 days. The mean
physician delay time was 93 ± 72 days with a median of 75 days. The mean total delay time was
108 ± 71 days with a median of 96 days.
Conclusion: The patient delay in our country is at an acceptable level compared with other
countries, but our physician delay time has not been shortened during the last eight years.
Improving and upgrading the mycobacteriological courses for general physicians and specialists
during their academic years should be accompanied by short-term teaching courses after the
graduation.

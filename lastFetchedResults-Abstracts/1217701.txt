Background and Objective: Kidney transplantation is considered as selective and the most effective alternative way in treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease. Transplantation may improve patients' life quality, but it can also lead patients to face new challenges and concerns. Since there is little information about coping process of patients with renal transplantation, understanding how they cope with transplanted kidney may help health care providers to plan and implement appropriate and holistic care programs. The aim of this study was to explain the coping process in renal transplant recipients.
Materials and Methods: A qualitative method with grounded theory approach was used to explain renal transplantation coping process. First, participants were selected based on purposive sampling and among renal transplant recipients.this process continued gradually by theoretical sampling. 11 renal transplant recipients in Afzalipour hospital, Kerman, Iran, and 3 family members were interviewed (n = 14) during 2011-2012. Data analyzing was done followed guidelines proposed by Strauss and Corbin (1998).  
Results: Three categories emerged from data analysis including "perceive reality of transplantation", "contrastive strategies" and "learning challenging life". Results demonstrated transplanted kidney coping was a slow and steady process with special characteristics in each step. The main theme emerged from the text was continuous and purposive struggling to reach calmness in new life.
Conclusion: Understanding the reality of transplantation and its challenges had either temporarily or permanently effects on patientâ€™s life. In this process, nurses as important members of health care team can provide appropriate educational programs and supportive care in order to assist patients to learn how to cope with transplanted kidney and its challenges.

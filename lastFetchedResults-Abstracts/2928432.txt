We present a new algorithm to find motion vectors of B frames (bidirectional frames) in the MPEG encoding scheme which significantly reduces the computations required compared with the conventional method. We interpolate the motion vectors for each macro block in the B frame using the motion vector of the next P frame (predictive frame) and do a small search to final a better matching. The number of computations is reduced by factor of 5~20, but the matching stays comparable with that of exhaustive search

The objective of this study was to evaluate the nonlinear optical microscopy techniques of multiphoton autofluorescence microscopy (MPAM) and second harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM) for noninvasive imaging of oral epithelial carcinogenesis. In vivo imaging was performed in a hamster model for oral carcinogenesis to characterize optical and morphometric alterations during neoplastic transformation. Data is presented showing alterations in morphometry and collagen density during the precancerous phase of neoplastic transformation.

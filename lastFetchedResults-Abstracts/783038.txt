Objective The aim of this study was to examine
psychosocial factors associated with military fitness
class, classified as capability of service, vs. temporary
or permanent exemption from service. Method
Participants were 2,340 (80% of the original sample)
Finnish 18-year-old men at call-up for obligatory military
service who filled in the Young Adult Self-Report
(YASR) questionnaire. Results Temporary exemption
from military service was independently associated
with the YASR total problem score, externalizing and internalizing
problems, excessive alcohol use, drug use,
problems with peers and family, and mental health service
use.Permanent exemption was independently associated
with problems with peers and family. Conclusion
The YASR is a potential selection tool to be used at callup.
Temporary exemption was more strongly associated
with psychosocial problems than permanent exemption.
Because of the high level of psychological problems
among those temporarily exempted, the call-up situation
offers a unique opportunity to identify those with
problem behaviour and risk of marginalization.

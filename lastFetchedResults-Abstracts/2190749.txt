Background: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before twenty weeks of gestation. It is caused by a variety of genetics and non-genetics factors. Thyroid autoimmunity could associate with pregnancy loss.
Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of Levothyroxine in treatment of RPL in women with high auto-thyroid antibodies.
Materials and Methods: In this observational cross sectional study, 900 women who had a history of recurrent pregnancy loss were studied. All women with high anti-TPO antibody without any other problems entered in this study. Levothyroxine was given to them two months before pregnancy till the end of pregnancy. The doses of levothyroxine were depended on the anti-TPO levels, which were decided by endocrinologist. Women followed for the results of pregnancies.
Results: The success rate of pregnancy in women with abnormal anti-TPO with Levothyroxine therapy was 82.85%. Mean of anti-TPO in women with treatment before taking medication was 488.35 and after that it was 123.35 UI/ml. This difference was significant (p < 0.05). The mean of the antibodies was not significantly different in women without treatment.
Conclusion: This study showed that Levothyroxine reduces the incidence of spontaneous abortions in women with high Anti-TPO antibody.  It decreased anti-TPO antibody levels after 2-3 months treatment.

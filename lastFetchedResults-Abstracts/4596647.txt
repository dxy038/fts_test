The objective of this paper is to generate supercontinuum (SC) spectrums for dental optical coherence tomography (OCT) using proposed highly nonlinear dispersion flattened photonic crystal fiber (HNDF-PCF) as a propagating media of picosecond pulse easily produced by less expensive commercially available laser sources. This proposed HNDF-PCF has a very flat dispersion at 1.31 &#181;m wavelength and by doping germanium (Ge) inside the core, nonlinear coefficient of the proposed HNDF-PCF is increased as large as 58.7 W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>km<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Simulation results show that the proposed HNDF-PCF offers efficient SC light for dental OCT at 1.31 &#181;m wavelength. Coherent length of the generated SC light is found 9.1 &#181;m and spatial resolutions in the depth direction for dental OCT are found 5.5 &#181;m for enamel and 5.9 &#181;m for dentin.

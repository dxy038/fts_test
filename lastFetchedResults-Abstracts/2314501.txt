The objective of this research was to simulate dynamic effects of ice-shedding on overhead transmission lines using a numerical model. A computer model was developed using a nonlinear finite element analysis software (ADINA) to calculate the static and dynamic effects of ice-shedding on a two-span line section. A total of 21 ice-shedding scenarios is studied with variables including: ice thickness, span length, difference in elevation between end and suspension points, number of spans per line section, presence of unequal spans and partial ice-shedding on sub-spans. The effects of each of these parameters are discussed.

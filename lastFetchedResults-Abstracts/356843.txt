Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the appearance of the intraluminal surface after Palmaz-Schatz stent implantation by using coronary angioscopy. Methods and Results:  Coronary angioscopy was performed immediately after stenting and at 1, 3, and 6 months later in 43 patients with 45 lesions. The presence or absence of red thrombus and/or dissection and the extent of neointimal coverage of the stent struts were analyzed. Immediately after stenting, red thrombus and dissection were observed in 9 (41%) and 12 (56%) of 22 lesions, respectively, and these rates decreased with time. Complete coverage of the stent struts by smooth white neointima was observed in 55% of 11 lesions at 1 month and in 80% of 21 lesions at 3 months. However, incomplete neointimal coverage was seen in 3 lesions at both 3 and 6 months. Conclusions: In human coronary arteries, neointimal coverage of an implanted Palmaz-Schatz stent may take as long as 6 months or more. (Am Heart J 1999;138:962-7.)

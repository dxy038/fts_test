The influence of lactate/phosphate enhancement on meat color and lipid oxidation stability, tenderness, protein degradation, and protein aggregation of early postmortem beef muscles packaged in a high oxygen modified atmosphere packaging (HiOx-MAP; 80% O2, 20% CO2) were studied. At 24 hr postmortem, three bovine muscles (longissimus, semimembranosus, and adductor; n = 10, respectively) were enhanced (10% injection rate) with either lactate (2.5%)/phosphate (0.3%) solution or water, packaged in HiOx-MAP, stored 9 days at 1 °C, and then displayed for 7 days at 1 °C. The lactate/phosphate injection significantly improved color stability (higher a* values) of all three bovine muscles throughout display period. Accumulation of lipid oxidation determined by 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances values was also decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the lactate/phosphate injection compared to the water treatment during storage and display periods. The objective tenderness values of longissimus and semimembranosus were also improved (P &lt; 0.05) by the lactate/phosphate enhancement treatment compared to the water treatment based on star probe measurement. There were no significant differences found in desmin and troponin-T degradation, or oxidative cross-linking of myosin between treatments. The results suggest that lactate/phosphate enhancement has beneficial effects on color and lipid oxidation stability, and tenderness development of beef cuts under HiOx-MAP conditions.

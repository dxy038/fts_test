This paper discusses bi-objective optimization algorithms for energy efficient traffic grooming in a bandwidth constraint IP over WDM network. If the maximum network throughput is required for traffic grooming, the algorithms use the priori method to maximize the network throughput, and then to minimize the energy consumption afterwards. If the maximum network throughput is not required, the minimum energy consumption can be further reduced by blocking more connection requests. Simulation results show that the bi-objective algorithms can save more than five times of average energy consumption by blocking one IP connection request.

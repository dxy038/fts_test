This study develops a fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) model for solving the multi-objective no-wait flow shop scheduling problem in a fuzzy environment. The proposed model attempts to simultaneously minimize the weighted mean completion time and the weighted mean earliness. A numerical example demonstrates the feasibility of applying the proposed model to no-wait flow shop scheduling problem. The proposed model yields a compromised solution and the decision maker's overall levels of satisfaction.

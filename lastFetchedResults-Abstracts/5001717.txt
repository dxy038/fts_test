In this paper, we propose a slip-ratio control of ABS using sliding mode control. The main control objective of ABS is to increase wheel tractive forces, which is conventionally done by controlling the wheel slip ratio around the peak of the &#956;-&#955; curve of the tractive forces during ABS maneuvers. Difficulties in designing an ABS controller are due to the nonlinear characteristics, the time-varying nature of the system components, and the unknown environmental parameters. In this paper, we apply a sliding mode control scheme to the ABS because it can give a robustness by invariance characteristic and order reduction, and the control scheme is verified through the several numerical simulations with Matlab/Simulink

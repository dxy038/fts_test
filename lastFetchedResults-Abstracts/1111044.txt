The objective of this work is to characterise the deformation modes when Ti–6Al–4 V alloy with α′ martensitic structure is subjected to oligocyclic fatigue at various strain amplitudes. It is believed that, unlike pure titanium single crystals at room temperature, {11̄01} twinning occurs in the α′ martensitic microstructure, because of the factors, such as the prior existence of dislocations or α′/α′ interfaces, which may reduce the activation energy required for the nucleation of {101̄1} twins.

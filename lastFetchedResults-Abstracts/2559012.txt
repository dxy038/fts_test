Abstract

Objective

There have been contradictory findings on the relationship between Socioeconomic Status (SES) and child development although SES is associated with child development outcomes. The present study intended to define the relationship between SES and child development in Tehran kindergartens, Iran.

Materials & Methods

This cross-sectional survey studied 1036 children aged 36-60 month, in different kindergartens in Tehran City, Iran, in 2014-2015.

The principal factor analysis (PFA) model was employed to construct SES indices. The constructed SES variable was employed as an independent variable in logistic regression model to evaluate its role in developmental delay as a dependent variable.

Results

The relationship between SES and developmental delay was significant at P=0.003. SES proved to have a significant (P < 0.05) impact on developmental delay, both as an independent variable and after controlling risk factors.

Conclusion

There should be more emphasis on developmental monitoring and appropriate intervention programs for children to give them higher chance of having a more productive life.

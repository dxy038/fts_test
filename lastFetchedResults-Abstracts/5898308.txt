Oppurtunistic Information Fusion (OIF) is introduced to enable the same sensors to provide data for multiple applications. Sensor location plays a crucial rule to get the maximum amount of useful information. This paper examines the optimal placement of cameras for a Networked Sensing Systems (NSS) that are designed to monitor a pre defined region to have as much coverage as possible with the purpose of serving multiple applications. This can be rephrased as a camera location optimization problem with multiple objective functions. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) is used with camera coverage as the two objective functions to be maximised

The authors consider the synthesis problem of a traffic control scheme based on conservation laws. They derive a conservation law for cell loss probabilities, for an ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) node with a finite buffer size and correlated arrival processes. Based on this law, they develop a buffer allocation (i.e., pushout) algorithm that meets a prespecified cell loss objective, if it can be satisfied, or treats the traffic classes &#8220;fairly&#8221;, if it cannot. The algorithm is dynamic and requires no knowledge of arrival statistics

Soil salinity is one of the most important problems of arid and semi-arid regions in the world. Based on Food and Agriculture Organization report, more than 40% of Iran's under Irrigation lands, are against secondary salinity. Nowadays biological methods are widely used to confront, soil salinity problems. However, significant achievement will take place when plant reserve resources having desired genetically changes, be available. Various resistances against salinity are due to plant genetically variations and selection for just one factor will not be a suitable criteria in measurement of this experimental property. To choose resistant varieties, it is necessary to notice to a set of indexes to create changes in physiology, anatomy, and morphology of plant species. The study of salinity stress on three range plant species of Chenopodiaceae family was the main objective of this experiment. The study conducted in completely random design with factorial experiment and four replications. Experimental treatments were three Salsola species and seven levels of salty water solution containing pure sodium chloride with concentration of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mM. Results of the experiment showed that salinity affected the plants morphological and anatomical characteristics. With increasing salinity rates, some morphological changes such as; leaves falling, chlorosis and succulence were observed. Anatomical changes such as accumulation of crystal salt in mesophyll cells and increasing of trichomes for evapotranspiration decrease and salt exclusion were also observed in the species under study.

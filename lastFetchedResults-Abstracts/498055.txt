Background and objective: Dyslipidemia has become a common problem in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, especially in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. We investigated the prevalence of dyslipidemia and metabolic abnormalities in 2 groups of HIV -infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and antiretroviral-naive patients.

Material and methods: 40 HIV infected patients treated by HAART as a case group(6 female 34 male) mean age of 40.1± 10 and 15 HIV naive , as a control group (2 female and 13 male) mean age of 38.40 ± 8.3 enrolled in this study. The two groups were well balanced with respect to age, sex, CD4 cell counts. A standardized questionnaire with epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic data was completed by physicians. Blood samples were obtained for metabolic measurements. CD4 cell count was measured by flow cytometry.

Results: Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and lactate were elevated in 24%, 37%, and 25% of patients, respectively. The prevalence of elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels was significantly higher among patients receiving antiretroviral therapy than it was among those who were not receiving treatment. Fasting hyperglycemia was noted in 11% of patients overall, but this was not significantly associated with antiretroviral treatment group. Low HDL levels were noted in 44.4% of patients overall, and this finding did not vary by treatment group. We found significant difference regarding total cholesterol, LDL between each treated group and controls. P<0.05 No significant difference was observed in mean of HDL, Lactate, fasting blood sugar levels between each treated group and controls.

Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients taking antiretroviral therapy in Iran. We conclude that the prevalence of dyslipidemia and metabolic abnormalities in HIV-infected Iranian patients are similar to those reported for Western and Asian studies.

Background and objective: Laser hair removal application in dermatology has been a conventional method for many years. Many research projects have been performed for assessment and qualification of best results. We investigated the influence of long term follow up on therapeutic response rate.
Methods: At a prospective study, 29 women referred to dermatologic clinic of Rasol Akram Hospital during 2002-2009, were enrolled. All of them were treated by a Long-pulsed 1064 nm ND:YAG laser. Clinical responses (hair reduction) were evaluated by a blinded dermatologist with comparing of before and after obtaining photographs according to visual analogue scale (VAS),
Results: Mean age of patients was 30.6± 8.5 years. Minimum and maximum sessions were 4 and 16. Mean of treatment sessions was 8.5 ± 2.8. Mean improvement at final treatment sessions and end of follow up were 72.3± 18.8 percent and 72.2 ± 22 percent, respectively. There was statistically significant correlation between first and final therapeutic response (p=0.001) and indicated final response at a long duration follow up (p=0.002).
Conclusion: Our results showed that primary responses of hair removal by long pulsed Nd:YAG laser was an indicator for long term response rate.

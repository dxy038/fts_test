In this paper, we present an improved quantization scheme for the redundancy data of a forward error correction (FEC) technique proposed for the transmission of code-excited linear prediction (CELP)-coded speech over erasure channels. The use of a FEC-based error protection scheme is motivated by the well-known fact that, after a frame erasure, the previous excitation is not available and a desynchronization between the encoder and the decoder long-term prediction (LTP) filters appears, causing an additional distortion which is propagated to subsequent frames. LTP synchronization can be recovered by means of a single-pulse representation of the previous excitation. No additional delay is introduced by this technique which only requires a small transmission bandwidth increase. In this paper, we focus on the efficient encoding of this pulse. Thus, an optimization procedure, which takes into account the overall synthesis error, is proposed in order to provide better pulse-position and pulse-amplitude quantization codebooks. Moreover, by extending the previous procedure, an efficient joint position-amplitude quantization can be obtained. Objective quality tests applied to our proposal show that, by means of the proposed codebooks, the number of bits required to represent the resynchronization pulse is effectively reduced. In addition, a discontinuous transmission mechanism is derived from the cost functional used during joint position-amplitude quantization, further reducing the bit-rate.

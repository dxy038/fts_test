In order to improve the missile penetration probability, the impact angle and time of a missile should be coordinated. This paper introduces the Gauss pseudo-spectral method to the trajectory planning of a missile, and multi-objective optimal planning. Based on the mass point model of missile, the optimal trajectory planning problem, which have the constraints of terminal constraint, overload and no-fly zone constraints, is transformed to find the solution of a nonlinear programming problem by the pseudo-spectral method. The cost function was improved, according to the principle of more important target has a higher satisfaction-degree at different time, based on the optimization of the fuzzy, by adjusting the parameters to obtain the requirements of optimization and the importance rating of the optimal trajectory at the same time, realize the control of direction and time, and managed to bypass the no-fly zone, and the minimum energy consumption. Finally, missiles coordinated attack conditions are simulated. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and reference value for engineering practice.

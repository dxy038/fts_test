With greater efforts to increase science popularization of new energy, it has become an urgent need to evaluate the level of science popularization of new energy. Based on the grey relational analysis, an interval evaluation method for the level of science popularization of new energy is presented in this paper which is against the background of incomplete index weights. On the basis of constructing the evaluation system of a science popularization level, the ranges of index weight are expressed as interval numbers. Firstly, single-objective optimization model is established and the index weight vector that makes the largest grey relational grade among different science bases is acquired. Then, the optimal index weights are achieved after adjustment, so that grey relational grades between all bases of science popularization become as large as possible. To verify the effectiveness of this method, operational data from five science popularization bases of new energy are collected and the ranking of science popularization level is obtained.

The objective of this paper is to control the real and reactive power feed to a grid from a solid-oxide fuel cell plant independently. The modification in the thermal dynamic model of the solid-oxide fuel cell is carried out to include the simulation time step. The controller performance analysis is done on a fuel-cell model developed in Matlab/Simulink platform. It is found from simulation that the control scheme proposed is quite capable of controlling the real and reactive power flow from the fuel cell to the grid independently.

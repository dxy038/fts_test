This paper aims to model, using the software ATP (Alternative Transient Program), and investigate the use of zigzag autotransformer (ADZ), with control of voltage module and phase shift made independently, as a filter for harmonic currents, specifically in 24-pulse converters. Objective is to preserve the quality of supply in terms of the harmonic distortion. Furthermore, the systematic focus here reduces the financial cost involved based on the use of conventional transformers. Common situations in the electrical system, featuring loss of power quality, were selected for the performance study of 24-pulse rectifier with special transformer ADZ.

An optimal learning scheme is proposed for a class of bidirectional associative memories (BAMs). This scheme, based on the perceptron learning algorithm, is motivated by the inadequacies/incompleteness of the weighted learning by global optimization, as derived by Wang et al. (1993). It is shown that the new scheme has superior properties: (1) Convergence to the correct solution, when it exists; and (2) A larger basin of attraction for the given set of patterns.

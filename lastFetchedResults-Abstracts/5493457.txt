In this paper, in the light of three features of the human pulse signal, a non-contact-type detection system is designed, which can be used to detect pulse signals. The signal processing system suitable for the pulse signals is set up. The power spectra of the four kinds of pulse signals are obtained by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the power-spectral characteristics are analyzed and compared. Several important conclusions drawn in this paper may be of great value in the objective study of the pulse-condition and in the noninvasive diagnosis of the cardiovascular system

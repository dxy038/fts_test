We propose a technique for downlink beam steering in GSM, i.e transmission with multiple antennas at the base station. The objective is to reduce the downlink interference level and thereby enable capacity and quality enhancements. The simulation results indicates that the proposed technique generates less than 0.9 dB more interference (defined as the total amount of transmitted power given a certain power at the desired mobile), than the theoretical minimum, provided that the mean uplink C/I is better than -8 dB, and frequency hopping is applied

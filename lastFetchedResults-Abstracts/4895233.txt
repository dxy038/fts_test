Summary form only given. In this paper we report the small-signal modulation characteristics of quantum dot lasers wherein electrons are injected into the quantum dots by phonon assisted tunneling. The quantum dot laser heterostructure is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and conduction band profile and low-temperature PL data are reported. Our objective was to reduce the energy difference /spl Delta/E between the bound state in the injector layer and the quantum dot ground state to approximately 32 meV, so that electrons can be injected into the dot ground state, and not the excited state, by phonon assisted tunneling.

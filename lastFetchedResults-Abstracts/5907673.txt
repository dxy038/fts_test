Maximum permissible exposure levels in terms of incident electromagnetic-field strength corresponding to ankle SAR of 25 W/kg, basic limits for extremities have been applied to a case where a human body has not been isolated from the ground plane. Because these limits were determined by considering worst-case exposure conditions, they can sometimes be too stringent. To relax the limit for nonisolated conditions, additional limits in terms of induced foot current, are introduced. The objective of this study is therefore to clarify the relationship between the ankle SAR and the induced foot-current i.e., the effective cross section.

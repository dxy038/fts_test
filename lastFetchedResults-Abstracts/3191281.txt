This paper proposes a method to determine the location of sectionalizing switches in presence of stochastic renewable resources. Particle swarm optimization is used for placement of sectionalizing switches with considering an objective function. The proposed objective function is composed of two terms: minimizing of cost of sectionalizing switches and maximization of reliability benefit. Monte Carlo simulation is used to reliability assessment. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed by a real distribution network.

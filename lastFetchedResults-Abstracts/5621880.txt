A novel solution for last generation power MOSFETs is proposed for the first time to reduce commutation losses and easy the voltage and current control during hard switching commutations. The proposed structure is easily applicable to any driver topology and it is devoted to the realization of an hard-switched PWM inverter leg based on two power mosfets. The bidirectional conduction capability of unipolar-channel-based power components has been always considered ideal to reduce the conduction losses in inverter-leg structure, particularly when the maximum mosfets conduction losses is less than the body-diode one. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are given to prove the feasibility of the proposed structure.

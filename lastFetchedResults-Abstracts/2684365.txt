Existing approaches to template-based visual tracking, in which the objective is to continuously estimate the spatial transformation parameters of an object template over video frames, have primarily been based on deterministic optimization, which as is well-known can result in convergence to local optima. To overcome this limitation of the deterministic optimization approach, in this paper we present a novel particle filtering approach to template-based visual tracking. We formulate the problem as a particle filtering problem on matrix Lie groups, specifically the three-dimensional Special Linear group SL(3) and the two-dimensional affine group Aff(2). Computational performance and robustness are enhanced through a number of features: (i) Gaussian importance functions on the groups are iteratively constructed via local linearization; (ii) the inverse formulation of the Jacobian calculation is used; (iii) template resizing is performed; and (iv) parent-child particles are developed and used. Extensive experimental results using challenging video sequences demonstrate the enhanced performance and robustness of our particle filtering-based approach to template-based visual tracking. We also show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art template-based visual tracking methods via experiments using the publicly available benchmark data set.

In this study, directly observed short course therapy (DOTS) was implemented to control tuberculosis in a camp in Iran. First, one study had been conducted in 1996 (before DOTS implementation) as active case finding then DOTS have been implemented in 1997. Another study was carried out in 2004 for evaluation of the effects of DOTS. In the first study, 16 patients with pulmonary TB (50% smear positive) were detected. During the years of DOTS implementation, the number of TB cases decreased significantly. In the second study, no pulmonary TB was detected. Our experience showed that DOTS significantly and effectively decreases TB in refugees and leads to a high cure rate and prevents death.

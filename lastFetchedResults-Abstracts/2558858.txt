Background: Nowadays, science tries to find a way to control the pathogens in public place and health centers. The use of medicinal smokes is common in Iranian traditional medicine to improve air quality and purify air.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Herbal fume, contain frankincense, clove, sandalwood and camel grass against a variety of microorganisms.
Methods: Herbal smoke include, sandalwood (Santalum album), camel grass (Cymbopogon schoenanthus), condor (Boswellia sacra) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum), against microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, was investigated.
Results: Sandalwood and camel grass fumes could inhibit C. albicans completely both in 7 minutes and inhibit B. subtilis in turn in 9 minute and 11 minute. Also they could inhibit E. coli and S. aureus in turn in 10 and 9 minute. Frankincense and clove fume had no significant effects. Mixing two plants, sandalwood and camel grass in the ratio 1:1, will enhanced the antimicrobial effects of these smoke and the inhibition time come shorter.
Conclusion: According to this research, Sandalwood and camel grass smoke have significant effect. Microbes and fungi showed great sensitivity against herbal fume and the smoke expressed the possibility of industrial usage. Further research is required to identify the chemical composition of these plant smokes.

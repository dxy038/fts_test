Background and Objectives: Modelling and specifying mathematical equations to predict and estimate a bioprocess is one of the important applications of bioengineering. Objective of this study was to identify proper and exact equations to describe various changes in biodegradation of heavy fuel oil through investigating kinetic models and third parametric equation of Ch. 
Materials and Methods: To submit an exact and perfect enough statement, two different experimental conditions were used in which  isolated indigenous bacteria from environment were employed. Experiments were carried out during ten days and microbial growth, mazut concentration, pH, and electric potential curves were drawn. Fitting data onto kinetic models and Ch equation resulted accuracy and their constants.   
Results: We found that kinetic models were not capable to present an accurate and appropriate statement under different conditions. On the other hand, Ch equation by extending very accurate equations could satisfyingly illustrate mazut, pH, and electric potential changes based on time and microbial growth.
Conclusion: Ch equation by reason of using two variables for computation of third variable and correctly selecting variables could describe various changes in mazut biodegradation under different conditions via mathematical statements. Moreover,  it is possible that this equation can be used to study other various phenomena in future.

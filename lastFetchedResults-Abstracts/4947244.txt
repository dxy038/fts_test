This paper proposes a method to generate an optimal trajectory of nonlinear dynamical system and concurrently optimize multiple performance criteria. As the dimensionality of system increases, it is difficult to find values of cost/reward function of conventional optimal controllers. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method employs iterative linear quadratic regulator and multi-objective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm to generate various optimal trajectories that satisfy multiple performance criteria. Fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral are also employed for global evaluation by integrating the partial evaluation of each solution over criteria with respect to userÂ´s degree of consideration for each criterion. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulation carried out for the problem of stabilizing two-link inverted pendulum model.

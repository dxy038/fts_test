The coding scheme is currently the most commonly used process of compressing image data. However, this process often results in very serious distortion in the decoded image if the bit-stream suffers from damages. In order to address this drawback, this letter aims to develop a new error concealment technique based on edge-oriented interpolation for still image or intra-frame correction. The first step involves finding the edge direction of a lost block by using one-dimensional matching techniques from two boundaries of neighboring blocks. Then, the error pixels are recovered by weighting linear interpolation along the estimated edge direction. Afterwards, the median filter is used to recover residual damaged-pixels. Simulations demonstrate that the important edge information can be significantly recovered, and also prove that this method performs better compared to other methods that use both subjective and objective measures.

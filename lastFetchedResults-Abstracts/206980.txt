The Main objective from this project is to choose the best economical process to remove the cation Pb2+ from water bodies such as industrial waste water.
Adsorbtion using activated Carbon has been chosen for this study. The results showed that this method have high adsorption and also was economical.
The method was studied to be efficient to remove Pb+2.Then other factors such as adsorbtion time) temperature, pH and ... have been examined.
The results showed that this method could remove than ninety percent (90%) of Pb2+ by granol activated carbon from solution time.
The best condition to eliminate this heavy metal is to decrease the temperature because the exothermic reaction the adsorption, and the best pH for this reaction was 7(neutral).

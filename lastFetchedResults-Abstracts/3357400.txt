Economic emission dispatch problem (EED) has gained attention of power system researchers for many years. With the deregulation of electricity market and strict environmental norms and regulations, there exists a further scope to revisit the problem. Actually the Economic emission dispatch minimizes both the fuel cost as well as emission from fossil fuel fired power plants under several equality and inequality constraints. A Modified Imperialistic Competition Algorithm (MICA) technique is proposed for solving EED problem and a fuzzy set theory approach is implemented for selecting the best compromise solution out of a set of non-dominated Pareto solutions. Proposed approach is verified on the standard 30-bus 6-generator test system. Equality constraints on power balance and inequality constraints on generation capacity limit are taken into consideration. The quality of solution by proposed algorithm is found to be superior to many other multi-objective techniques.

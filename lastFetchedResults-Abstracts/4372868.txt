The paper addresses predictive control for polytopic discrete-time systems subject to input and state constraints. The objective is to optimize nominal performance while guaranteeing robust stability and constraint satisfaction. The latter goal is achieved by exploiting robust invariant sets under linear and nonlinear control laws. The feasibility domain is evaluated for open-loop and closed-loop input optimization

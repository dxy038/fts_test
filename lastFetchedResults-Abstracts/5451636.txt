As a type of layout which can bring the material transport high flexibility, unidirectional loop layout is widely used in modern workshop layout. This paper deploys research around how to apply a unidirectional loop layout to optimize the facility layout in workshop. Firstly, it establishes a mathematic model of the optimization problem according to optimization objective and restriction condition. Secondly, in order to make a solution of this unidirectional loop facility layout problem, it puts forward an improved genetic algorithm based on multipoint crossover operator of parent and child competition. Finally, through the analysis of practical example of optimizing facility layout in blade workshop, it has verified the feasibility and validity of the method applied in the paper, and also proved the good results of using the improved genetic algorithm put forward in the paper to solve the facility layout problem.

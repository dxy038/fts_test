<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of urinary and fecal incontinence and their determinants in pre-menopausal and menopausal women in Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> This one-year cross-sectional study was performed on 304 women aged 40-55 who were admitted to women's clinic at Imam Khomeini Hospital. Symptoms of urinary, gas, and fecal incontinence and pelvic organs prolapse were diagnosed by a specialist through examination and a questionnaire. Patients were divided into two groups of with and without (urinary, gas, and fecal) incontinence symptoms. The probable risk factors of these disorders were studied and registered in the questionnaire and compared using t-test, chi-squared test, and regression of quantitative and qualitative variables.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Generally, 129 (42%) out of 304 women had pelvic floor dysfunction (urinary and fecal incontinence, and pelvic organs prolapse). Risk factors including menopause, hormone therapy, history of hysterectomy, inactivity, age, BMI, and first child's birth weight were compared between the two groups using chi-squared and t tests. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.000) as risk factors were more frequently observed in women with incontinence symptoms.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Some risk factors of pelvic floor dysfunction are menopause, hormone therapy, history of hysterectomy, inactivity, age, BMI, and first child's birth weight. Therefore, some strategies should be included in women's health education programs to prevent the above-mentioned risk factors.</p><p>Â </p>

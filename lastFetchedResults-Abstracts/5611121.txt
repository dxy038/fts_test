This work aims to solve a routing problem in order to cover a region where a set of areas should be revisited as soon as possible, denominated critical areas. The objective is to find an efficient route that minimizes the maximum time that these areas remain uncovered. To solve the problem we propose an interactive approach that considers both human and automated interference in the process. The results of this work can be applied in disaster management where critical actions and monitoring are required. Search and rescue and airspace surveillance systems are other examples of applications where this work can be deployed.

With an aim to extract the structural information from the table of contents (TOC) to help develop a digital document library, the requirement of identifying/segmenting the TOC page is obvious. The objective to create a digital document library is to provide a non-labour intensive, cheap and flexible way of storing, representing and managing the paper document in electronic form to facilitate indexing, viewing, printing and extracting the intended portions. Information from the TOC pages is to be extracted for use in a document database for effective retrieval of the required pages. We present a fully automatic identification and segmentation of a table of contents (TOC) page from a scanned document.

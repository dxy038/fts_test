Objective: 
Neck pain is the second common musculoskeletal disorders in societies. According to studies, personal characteristics and school bags  are predisposing factors for musculoskeletal problems in students. Due to the risk of neck pain, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risk factors on high school students.
Methods and Materials:
This study was carried out on 1000 high school students of Babol, Iran in 2012 and 2013. Students were chosen randomly. Student profiles and school bag characteristics and other information were collected by questionnaire. The VAS was used to assess pain intensity. Results were analyzed by SPSS software.

Results:
The mean age of students was 15.96±1.13. Average bag weight and average bag weight to body weight ratio were 2.76±0.97kg and 4.47±1.87%, respectively. Students with neck pain had lower age (P<0.001), lower height (P<0.001), lower weight (P=0.002), and more bag weight to body weight ratio (P=0.001) than normal students. Use of backpacks was significantly more than other bag types in the students experiencing neck pain (P=0.002).

Conclusion:
The results showed that the prevalence of neck pain was greater in students who had smaller physical dimensions. School bag characteristics can also be effective in causing neck pain. Given the importance of students as future adults, detailed investigation into the causes of neck pain prevalence in this age group is necessary. This study can  also provide area for appropriate treatment.

This paper presents a spatial error concealment algorithm for recovering the lost packets in still images or Intra-coded frames in video. The idea is based on the work proposed by Hsia [1], where a 1-D boundary matching is applied to recover the lost areas while preserving the edge information. However, we modify Hsia´s algorithm in several aspects to improve its performance in terms of subjective and objective quality, i.e., smoothing operation by an averaging filter, adaptive searching range expansion, and matching direction crossing removing. Simulation results shows superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with Hsia´s algorithm and some other state-of-the-art algorithms.

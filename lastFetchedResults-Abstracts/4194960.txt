In this paper, a convex-optimization based design method is proposed to solve the near-field wideband beam former design problem with frequency invariant response. The objective is to find the weight vectors required for a uniform circular array capable of forming a beam with a pre defined side lobe attenuation level with desired frequency invariant response over a frequency band of interest against a particular target frequency for an arbitrary focal point within a given scanning area. Design examples have been provided for simulated results.

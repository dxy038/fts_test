Introduction: Scientometrics studies with Assessing priorities, perspectives and capacities help policymakers and managers of universities and heads of research centers in appropriation budget, balance between budget and cost, appointment, promotion researchers, leading to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their covered settings.
Objective: this study investigates the scientific outputs of Guilan University of medical sciences (GUMS) indexed in Scopus database based on scientometrics indicators in 2014.
Materials and Methods: this is a cross-sectional study in scientometric field that assesses GUMS Scientific outputs indexed in scopus database Since the establishment up to the end of 2014. Data from Scopus database and documents and citation from the time of establishment of this university were collected. scientometrics indicators in 3 domains of quantity, quality and hybrid were calculated.
Results: overall, 845 scientific outputs with 3078 citations with the affiliation of this university were indexed in Scopus. Ratio of document to authors was 5.28, document to faculty members was 2.28 and ratio of citation of document was 3.64. H Index, g Index, e Index and M-Quotient of this university were respectively 23, 32, 18.11 and 1.35.
Conclusion: The publication trend of GUMS scientific outputs is growing. In addition, almost half of scientific outputs of this university were without at least one citation and also combined indices donâ€™t have the appropriate level due to the low citations. To increase scientific outputs, providing appropriate platform to facilitate research among different parts of university and improve qualitative performance with quantitative expansion of them, was recommended.

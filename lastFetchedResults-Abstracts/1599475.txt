The objective of this work is to present a numerical study of contaminant migration in saturated porous media. For this purpose, the advectionâ€“diffusion equation describing the evolution of contaminant plumes in a 2D horizontal aquifer (Atlantic margin, Rharb Basin of Morocco) is discretized employing a Total Variation Diminishing method (TVD), which provides an efficient way to eliminate spurious numerical oscillations. The stationary velocity field is computed by the ModFlow code using the finite difference method discretization. The initial concentration needed to determine the solution was specified using data from well samples. Numerical examples showing the implementation of the algorithm to describe groundwater contamination by the chloride in the aquifer are presented.

igh accuracy method (TVD) constitutes an approach in the water management and allows us to envisage risks of pollution and to manage the groundwater resource from the durable development perspective.

Introduction & Objective: One of the important problems in modern society is people's sedentary life style. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with regular physical activity among college students based on BASNEF model.
Materials & Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study carried out on 400 students in Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. Based on the assignment among different schools, classified sampling method was chosen for data gathering using a questionnaire in three parts including: demographic information, constructs of BASNEF model, and standard international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). Data were analyzed by SPSS-13, and using appropriate statistical tests (Chi-square, T-test and regression). 
Results: Based on the results, 271 students(67.8 %) had low, 124 (31%) moderate ,and 5 (1.2%) vigorous physical activity. There was a significant relationship (c2=6.739, df= 1, 
P= 0.034) between their residence and physical activity and students living in dormitory were reported to have higher level of physical activity. Behavioral intention and enabling factors from the constructs of BASNEF model were the best predictors for having physical activity in students (OR=1.215, P = 0.000) and (OR=1.119, P= 0.000) respectively.
Conclusion: With regard to the fact that majority of the students did not engage in enough physical activity and enabling factors were the most effective predictors for having regular physical activity in them, it seems that providing sports facilities can promote physical activity among the students.

In this paper, a novel 6-DOF magnetic levitation (Maglev) system is proposed. As a result of using the cylindrical solenoid and rectangular coils as actuators, we thought analysis of magnetic forces inside the both kinds of coil form the main basis of designing our system. In this system, both new mechanical structure and adaptive control algorithm are developed. Structurally, totally there are eight permanent magnets (PMS) attached to the carrier, whereas there are eight coils respectively mounted on a fixed base. After analyzing the magnetic force characteristics between permanent magnets and coils, a detailed study of the general model of this system with full 6DOFs is therefore derived and analyzed. Next, an adaptive controller is developed for such a system to deal with the unknown parameters with the objective of precision positioning. From the experimental results, satisfactory performances including regulation accuracy and control stiffness have been demonstrated.

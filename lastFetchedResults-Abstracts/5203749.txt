Many IGBT models have been published but none using VHDL-AMS language. The paper objective is to detail the electro-thermal simulation of IGBT and the coupling between electrical and thermal models using VHDL-AMS as a simulation language. This technique uses an electric circuit simulator and is based on a power IGBT model with temperature-dependent characteristics. Particular attention will be given to the extraction of model parameters. A novel electro-thermal coupling simulation is proposed. The simulation results using electrical and electro-thermal model show good agreements with measurement results. The compact thermal model is validated by a comparison to measured temperature transient responses.

Knowledge management systems, or KMS, have been widely adopted in businesses, and little research exists on the integration of these systems in the field of higher education. Knowledge management systems were developed to support and enhance the organizational processes in agreement with the strategy of the organization. Our objective is to shed light on the consequences of knowledge management systems on the performance of the university. The dynamics and complexity of KMS led us to propose its modeling through a systemic approach based on the use of the APTE (Application of Technology Engineering) and FAST (Function Analysis System Technique) methods. Based on the results of a functional analysis, some appropriate suggestions are made as references for the evaluation and implementation of such a system in the Algerian universities. Our findings may help academics and managers in developing a strategic knowledge management program to achieve greater innovation, efficiency and effectiveness.

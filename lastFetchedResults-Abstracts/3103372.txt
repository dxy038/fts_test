A number of integral impellers are used in many new kinds of jet. The parts count of jet decreases remarkably, the jet engine weight lightens much, and the thrust, service life and the safety coefficient have increased greatly. Based on the structure features and the processing difficulties of the integral impeller with big-twisted blades, electrochemical contour evolution machining is promoted, the shaping law is analyzed and studied, the dispersed data of the big-twisted blades are processing, the multi-axis linkage movement feed tracks are designed optimum by the shaping law and the tests. The combined cathode with the reasonable flowing fields is designed, there is an eccentric between the cathode sole plate and cathode body, the bidirectional feeds method is adopted, result in the short circuit and electro discharged sparks are eliminated. Adopting less cathode right wall thickness and the less incline angle, the extra electrochemical corrosion can be avoided. The redundant rests in blades back is removed by adding wobbly feeds. Machining tests are carried out. The blades satisfying precision are produced.

Enhanced genetic algorithms (GA) applied in space-time block coding (STBC) multiuser detection (MUD) systems in Rayleigh flat-fading channels are reported in this paper. Firstly, an improved objective function, which is designed to help speed up the search for the optimal solution, is introduced. Secondly, a decorrelating detector (DD) and a minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector have been added to the GA STBC MUD receiver to create the seed chromosome in the initial population. This operation has improved the receiver performance further because some signal information has been intentionally embedded in the initial population. Simulation results show that the receiver employing the improved objective function and the DD of MMSE detector can converge faster with the same bit error rate performance than the receiver with the initial population chosen randomly. The total signal-to-noise ratio improvement contributed by these two modifications can reach 6dB. Hence the proposed GA receiver is a promising solution of the STBC MUD problem.

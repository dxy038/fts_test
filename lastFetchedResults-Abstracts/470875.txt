Objective
This study was undertaken to compare teaching quality between obstetrics/gynecology resident and faculty preceptors in ambulatory gynecology as determined by medical student evaluation.
Study design
A prospective assessment of medical student evaluations of resident and faculty preceptors in ambulatory gynecology was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Forty-eight third-year medical students evaluated preceptors on 15 teaching quality items and recorded their clinical experience during their obstetrics/gynecology clerkship from July 2004 to June 2005 for a total of 138 evaluations.
Results
Faculty scores were statistically higher than resident scores on 4 of the 15 teaching quality items; acting as an appropriate clinical role model, emphasizing evidence-based learning, being enthusiastic about teaching and patient care (P< .05). Students performed significantly more Papanicolaou tests and pelvic and breast examinations during ambulatory sessions with residents than with faculty (P< .001).
Conclusion
Residents and faculty contribute important and different aspects of teaching experiences for medical students in ambulatory gynecology.

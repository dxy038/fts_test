The objective of this paper is to discuss the potentials of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of power system emergency control. We start by reviewing present day emergency control strategies and their foreseeable future shape. Then, we review the potential of existing intelligent techniques, mainly in this context. Finally, we provide a short review of published research work and real-life applications of intelligent systems to emergency control problems

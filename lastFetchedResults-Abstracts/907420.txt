The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Parental Body Mass Index is associated with overweight/obesity in a sample of Greek adolescents, taking into consideration dietary and lifestyle habits. The Vyronas study is a cross-sectional health and nutrition survey. During 2004/2005, 2008 schoolchildren were selected. BMI was calculated for both parents and adolescents. A semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire was applied. Results demonstrated that there is a strong positive association between the parental overweight/obesity status and their offspring's BMI. Some dietary and lifestyle habits seem to affect boys and girls BMI in relation to parental status differently.

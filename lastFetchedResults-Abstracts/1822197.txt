Objective
cisors of the mammalian dental arch develop from tissues arising from separated facial prominences. These primordial craniofacial structures undergo complex morphogenetic processes as they merge and fuse in a time and space dependent fashion. However, local contributions of precursor facial prominences to the incisors that develop subsequently remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the development of all three deciduous upper rostral teeth in the pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) for the identification of the likely facial prominence contributions to the incisors based on normal and pathological developmental relationships.

nic minipigs were collected between gestational days 20–36 (E20–36), processed for histological analysis and subjected to computerized 3D modelling. The location and morphology of the incisors (i) in these specimens were characterized and compared between developmental stages. A second set of neonatal minipigs displaying cleft lip and/or cleft palate defects were also obtained and incisor locations and eruption patterns were morphologically examined.
s
 formation begins during the third week of gestation (E20) in the minipig with ossification of the premaxilla initiating soon afterwards (E24). The third incisor (i3) develops caudally to the contact seam formed by the fusion of the primary and secondary palates in normal embryos. All cleft animals displayed normal i3 and canine, on other hand, development of i1 and i2 was often disrupted similar to human.
sions
servations suggest a dual embryonic origin of the incisors in minipigs with the first and second incisors originating from the frontonasal prominence whilst the third incisor forms from tissues derived from the maxillary prominence.

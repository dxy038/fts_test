The objective of this research was to identify and describe the different Ecological Species Groups (vegetation types) present in the Rural Heritage Museum of Guilan. The study area was approximately 260 ha, which is located in the Saravan Forest Park in Guilan province, north of Iran. Sampling procedure was performed with a systematic random technique. A total of 89 plots were sampled. Classification of vegetation carried out using the Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) method showed that there were five ecological species groups in three layers; three groups in the shrub layer, nine groups in the herb layer and six ecological species groups in the regeneration layer. The results suggest improved protection and management of this area and that it can be proposed as a protected area on the basis of the numerous important species. The information obtained from the current study about this forest is useful for the design and management of this site because of its aesthetic values.

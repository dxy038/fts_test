Wireless sensor networks face information disclosure, information tampering, replay attacks and other threats. For wireless sensor networks in the objective conditions, this paper proposes a wireless injection attack based on the TinyOS operating system comparable to Man-in-the-middle attack, and designs a set of schemes on injection attack by hardware node platform and TinyOS platform. The results show that it successfully injects false data into the normal wireless communications in wireless sensor networks, resulting in terminal receives fake data.

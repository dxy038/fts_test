In this letter, we develop an algorithm for the design of allpass variable fractional delay filter with powers-of-two coefficients as a means of achieving low complexity and efficient hardware implementation. The algorithm includes an efficient procedure to obtain the objective function in the neighborhood of a search point, which significantly reduces the complexity associated with the global optimization approach. Design examples show that significant improvement is obtained by using the proposed method over existing methods.

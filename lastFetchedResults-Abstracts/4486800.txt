The ideal power system operation is achieved when various objectives like cost of generation, system transmission losses, environmental pollution etc. are simultaneously attained with minimum values. These cannot be handled by single objective techniques as the above three objectives may be conflicting in nature in certain domain. Therefore, multiobjective programming techniques have to be employed as these are capable of minimizing more than one objective simultaneously. In this paper, three objectives of multiobjective optimal power flow (MOPF) problem - cost of generation, system transmission losses, environmental pollution are considered and MOPF problem is attempted sequentially using sequential goal programming (SGP). Six strategies have been developed for IEEE 5, 14 and 30 bus systems. The optimal strategy has been identified by the power systems operator using regret analysis

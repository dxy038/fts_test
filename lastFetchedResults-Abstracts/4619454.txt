Two kind of methods using the spectroscopic information of the materials and the dependence of ultrasonic velocity-change on temperature were investigated to indentify the distribution of objective material in the biological tissue. Experimental results showed the possibility that the biological tissue could be characterized using the optically assisted ultrasonic velocity-change imaging method.

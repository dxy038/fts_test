The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that a wing with segmented control surfaces can redistribute its load, inboard or outboard, in order to perform active shape control while still maintaining level flight. Methods will be presented for controlling the plunge deflections of an aircraft wing structure. One possible solution to improving the flight envelope is a wing design with multiple segmented control surfaces all along its span. This will give an aircraft far more control over its lift distribution in comparison to a typical wing. In order to construct a wing with segmented trailing edges, it must first be shown that deflections under lift loads can be controlled. This paper introduces the research performed by the Structures, Propulsion, and Controls Engineering (SPACE) Center using a Fiber-Optic Strain-Sensing (FOSS) system that is currently implemented on the Odyssey UAV. The research will use a set of strain-based Displacement Transfer Functions (DTF) and the FOSS System both of which were developed at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC). Aerodynamic loads are obtained through the use of the software Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL). In addition, structural modeling is carried out with the use of finite element software. The results indicate that the shape of a wing structure can be controlled through the manipulation of segmented control surfaces to re-distribute lifting loads.

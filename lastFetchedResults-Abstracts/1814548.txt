In this research, the Charged System Search (CSS) and Enhanced Charged System Search (ECSS) algorithm are used to obtain the optimum design of irregular grillage systems with different spacing and various boundary conditions. The cross-sectional properties of the beams are selected as the design variables and the weight of structure is used as the objective function. The displacement limitations and permissible stress constraints are employed from LRFD-AISC and are considered in the formulation of the design problem. Furthermore, in obtaining the response of the grillage systems, the effect of warping is also taken into account. The comparison of the results shows that warping changes the beam spacing, and different boundary conditions have substantial effects on the optimum design of irregular grillage systems

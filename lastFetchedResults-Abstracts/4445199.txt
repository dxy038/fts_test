This paper introduces a multiplicative iterative (MI) algorithm for image reconstructions in tomography. This algorithm can accommodate objective functions deduced from different probability models for measurements. Poisson and Gaussian (for both emission and transmission scans), or shifted Poisson (for precorrected PET and X-ray CT), are examples of such measurement probability models. This MI algorithm is very easy to implement and respects the positivity constraint. Furthermore, an exact or approximate line search step can be easily incorporated into this algorithm so that the objective functions are guaranteed to increase during the iterations.

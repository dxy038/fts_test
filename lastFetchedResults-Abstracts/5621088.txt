When user chooses route, the travel time and travel time reliability are the most important factors under demand and supply uncertainty. It supposes travel time and travel demand following the normal distribution, setups the bi-objective bilevel programming model of travel time and travel time reliability considering travel demand variation and link capacity degradable. As the lower level problem bases on stochastic user equilibrium model and the upper level decision variant is discrete, it gives the genetic algorithm combining with the simulation technique to solve urban road transportation discrete network design problem. The optimization results demonstrate the model is valid and the solution algorithm is feasible and some conclusions are drawn.

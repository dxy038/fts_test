Citrate and other organic acids play an important role in the rhizosphere and pedogenic processes. Although secreting citrate from roots in response to Al and heavy metal stress has been recognized as a central mechanism for plants to avoid toxicity, the efficiency of root citrate on metal detoxification is still contradictory in acid soil with abundant oxide minerals that serve as a potential sorption site for citrate. The objective of this study was to investigate sorption and biodegradation of citrate in subtropical acid soils with different mineralogical properties. A batch experiment was conducted to assess the possible fates (adsorption and biodegradation) of citrate in the three acid soils (Cecil, Creedmoor and Norfolk) under microbial-active and inactive conditions. Citrate adsorption isotherms for all soils were adequately described by the Freundlich equation with the R2 value being over 0.90. The Cecil soil had the highest affinity for citrate adsorption among the soils with 99% adsorption observed throughout the citrate concentration range, which was due primarily to the abundant Al and Fe oxides. Citrate sorption to the mineral phase significantly reduced its biodegradation by 56%, 65% and 99% for the Creedmoor, Norfolk and Cecil soils, respectively. The results suggest the efficiency of rhizosphere processes for Al detoxification by root-secreted citrate would be significantly reduced in acid soil with abundant Al and Fe oxides.

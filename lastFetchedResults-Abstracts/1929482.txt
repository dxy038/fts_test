The objective of the present study is to develop an optimized heat pipe exchanger used to improve the energy efficiency in building ventilation systems. The optimized design is based on a validated model used inside a numerical plan built on a design of experiments statistical procedure. The numerical model, built using the open-source package OpenFOAM, is validated through experimental measurements done on a small scale heat pipe industrial exchanger. The results from the open source model are also compared to the numerical predictions obtained from a commercial code. Modelling results show good agreement with experiment measurements, thus showing the great potential of the model as a tool for heat pipe engineering design. The results are analysed in terms of efficiency for different configurations.

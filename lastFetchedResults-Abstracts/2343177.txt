The objective of this paper is the modeling of kinematics of precision contour grinding and resulting workpiece topography. Changes within the contact zone of grinding wheel and workpiece as well as speed ratios are analyzed and evaluated. The generated surface patterns caused by the runout of the grinding wheel are simulated. In the kinematic-geometrical model single grains on the peripheral surface of a grinding wheel, which interact with the workpiece, are considered. After describing the kinematics of the contour grinding process, changes in feed speeds and rotational speed ratios are examined and their effects on generated surfaces are simulated and compared with ground surfaces.

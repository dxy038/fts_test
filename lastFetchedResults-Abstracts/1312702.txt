The objective of this paper is to study evaporation and drift losses (EDLs) with two types of sprinklers: rotating spray plate sprinklers (RSPS) and fixed spray plate sprinklers (FSPS), both installed at two different heights (1 and 2.5 m above the ground). A field test was carried out during three seasons at an irrigated plot with a centre pivot, in Albacete (Spain). The results show that EDLs were significantly higher with the FSPS placed 2.5 m above the ground (FSPS 2.5) than with the RSPS placed 1 m above the ground (RSPS 1). The EDLs obtained for the FSPS 2.5 combination were 8% for night irrigation events and 13.7% for daytime irrigation events. The lowest EDL values were registered with RSPS 1, ranging from 3.3 to 8.2% under night and day operation conditions, respectively. These results were obtained for an average wind speed of 1.3 m/s at night and 3.5 m/s during the day, and were normally below 5 m/s.

The objective of water distribution control is to provide an adequate level of service at all points in the system economically under varying conditions of loading. With the increase in size and complexity of water distribution systems, the need for economic and reliable operation makes it necessary to use digital computers for data acquisition and supervisory control. This paper considers the application of mathematical models for simulation and optimization of the distribution system operation. With these models, it is possible to analyze the system data to perform operations planning and system load management.

Background and Objective: The use of household water filter systems has been widely increasing in recent years because of water pollution.&nbsp; In water filter systems, bacterial biofilm forms on the surface of the membranes, thereby increasing the possibility of transferring antibiotic resistance among bacteria and allowing their entry into the human body. This study analyzed the types of bacteria that grow in the membranes of water filter systems and their antibiotic resistance.

Materials and Methods: For this study, samples were collected from 80 membranes of household water filter systems. Bacteria grown on these membranes were identified using biochemical and molecular methods. Resistance against antibiotics including penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamycin, cephalexin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was evaluated by disk diffusion method.

Results: The detected bacteria included Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Bacillus, Sphingomonas, Zymomonas, Aeromonas, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Drexia and Achromobacter. Majority of the isolates were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiogram test showed that most of these bacteria exhibited multi-drug resistance (MDR). Maximum resistance was observed toward cephalexin and the least resistance was toward gentamicin.

Conclusion: The results revealed that membranes of household water filter systems were suitable environments for the growth of bacteria. In these conditions, MDR bacteria presumably could transfer antibiotic resistance genes to bacteria and microflora of the human body through water. Therefore, membranes should be designed in such a manner that not only they can remove the bacteria from water but also kill them.

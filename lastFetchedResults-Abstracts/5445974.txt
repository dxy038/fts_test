A planar multi-ring monopole antenna for ultra wide band applications is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna is designed using concentric rings of width 1.3 mm which leads to improved band width, radiation efficiency and reduced size. The proposed antenna size is 30*30*1.6 mm<sup>3</sup> which operates over a frequency range of 2.6 to 13.5 GHz. The radiation pattern is consistent in UWB range which is bidirectional in elevation plane and omnidirectional in azimuth plane. The radiation efficiency of the proposed antenna is 94.6%.

To find a proper assignment of weapons to targets with the objective of maximizing the damage of the target group, the cooperative dynamic weapon target assignment (CDWTA) problem of multimissiles formation is studied. By using the information shared by networks, the dominance matrix is modeled based on the relationship between the missiles and targets. Then, to obtain the dynamic weapon target assignment (DWTA) result of the individual missile in the desired time, the simple and effective auction algorithm around a circle and its improved algorithm based on tabu search (TS) are presented. Finally, the DWTA results of all missiles in the formation are considered by sharing the information, and the CDWTA result of the missiles formation can be obtained under the majority rule. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This paper proposes a model to solve an integrated green supplier selection and order allocation multi-period problem. The model consists of three stages; first stage uses fuzzy TOPSIS to rank and assign preference weights to a set of traditional and green criteria. Moreover, in the second stage, the criteria are grouped into two subsets, traditional and green, and then AHP is used to assign importance weights to each subset. The outputs of the first and second stage are used as an input for a bi-objective optimization model. The model assumes a deterministic demand. It also allows for shortage while ensuring that total demand will be satisfied at the end of the planning horizon even if with some delay. Comprehensive Criterion Method (CCM) is adopted to solve the bi-objective optimization and LINGO software is used to find the optimal solution.

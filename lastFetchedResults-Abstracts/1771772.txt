Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) represent an attractive cell population for bone tissue engineering. Their special immunological characteristics suggest that MPCs may be used in allogenic applications. The objective of this study was to compare the regenerative potential of autologous vs. allogenic MPCs in an ovine critical size segmental defect model. Ovine MPCs were isolated from bone marrow aspirates, expanded and cultured with osteogenic medium for 2 weeks before implantation. Autologous and allogenic transplantation was performed using the cell-seeded scaffolds and unloaded scaffolds, while the application of autologous bone grafts served as a control group (n = 6). Bone healing was assessed 12 weeks after surgery by radiology, microcomputed tomography, biomechanical testing and histology. Radiology, biomechanical testing and histology revealed no significant differences in bone formation between the autologous and allogenic groups. Both cell groups showed more bone formation than the scaffold alone, whereas the biomechanical data showed no significant differences between the cell groups and the unloaded scaffolds. The results of the study suggest that scaffold-based bone tissue engineering using allogenic cells offers the potential for an off-the-shelf product. Thus the results of this study serve as an important baseline for translation of the assessed concepts into clinical applications.

The objective of this study was the application of polymerase chain reaction in detection of bovine herpesvirus 1 in clinical samples. Twenty samples of bovine nasal swabs were separately inoculated in Vero cells. Laboratory strain TN 41 of bovine herpesvirus 1 served as a control in the experiment. The cytopathic effects were recovered in the cell line previously inoculated with a sample of bovine nasal swab, as well as in cells inoculated with the laboratory strain TN 41 of the bovine herpesvirus 1 after a period of incubation of 24h, 36h and 48h. Identification of the isolated strains of the virus was done by the virus - neutralization test with specific immune sera against BHV 1, with a titre of 1:16. Comparative analysis of DNA fragments of the laboratory strain of BHV1 and isolated strain obtained by polymerase chain reaction with primers for viral gB glycoprotein and thymidine-kinase coding region, confirmed that the isolated strain of the virus belongs to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1).

The International Space University (ISU) was created to train professionals for the global space community through its unique international, interdisciplinary and intercultural character - the so-called ´3Is´ - that are present in its organization, its classes and its programs. After a very brief outline of our various courses, we focus attention on some team projects undertaken by students to assess the usefulness of space systems in the fields of disaster management. The Asian tsunami of 26 December 2004 is a huge example of the kind of disaster whose human and economic impact can be reduced through more effective international use of space assets. Our objective is to draw attention to space-based disaster management possibilities as seen by working groups of highly-motivated young people from many specialties and many cultures.

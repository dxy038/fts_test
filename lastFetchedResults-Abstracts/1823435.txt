Objective
ococcus mutans, an oral pathogen associated with infective endocarditis (IE), possesses two genes encoding collagen-binding proteins, namely cnm and cbm. In this study, we used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of S. mutans with the cbm gene.

five S. mutans strains including 15 strains with the cnm gene, 15 strains with the cbm gene, and 15 strains without these two genes were analysed by MLST. In addition, the collagen-binding properties as well as the abilities to adhere to and invade human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were also evaluated for all strains.
s
 groups of cnm-positive and cbm-positive strains, all properties, including collagen binding, adhesion, and invasion were significantly greater than those of the cnmâ€“cbm-negative group. Moreover, MLST revealed three clonal complexes of S. mutans possessing the cbm gene. These three clones showed no close relatedness with clones of strains containing the cnm gene. Among three clones harbouring the cbm gene, two clones belong to serotype k, and appeared to be associated with the pathogenesis of IE due to their strong collagen binding and relatively enhanced abilities to adhere to and invade endothelial cells. However, such properties were relatively weak in the other non-serotype k clone possessing the cbm gene.
sions
ndicated a difference in evolution between S. mutans strains with the cbm gene and those with the cnm gene. In addition, this technique also suggested the importance of cbm-positive S. mutans clones relative to the pathogenesis of IE.

This work analyses the availability of bidirectional self-healing ring with four fibers using the multiplex section protection. As the nodes in the ring can be connected by optical links with double fiber pairs, their availability is analysed. A special point of this analysis is the availability of different restoration paths with regard to the failure place in the ring. The analysis also shows that all the restoration paths actually reduce to one path which remains when all the links along the working path fail.

The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires pursuing rigorous mathematical modeling of the system’s behavior as a function of a set of design variables to achieve goal-oriented design. Despite the success of current knee implants, the limited life span remains the main concern of this complex system. The mismatch between the properties of engineered biomaterials and those of biological materials leads to insufficient bonding with bone, stress shielding effects and wear problems (i.e. aseptic loosening). The use of a functionally graded material (FGM) for the femoral component of knee implants is attractive because the properties can be designed to vary in a certain pattern to meet the desired requirements at different regions in the knee joint system, thereby decreasing loosening problem. However, matching the properties does not necessarily guarantee the best functionality of the knee implant and there is a need for developing the optimal design of an FGM femoral component that is longer lasting. In this study, therefore, a multi-objective design optimization of a FGM femoral component is carried out using finite element analysis (FEA) and response surface methodology (RSM). The results of using optimized FGM are then compared with the use of standard Co–Cr alloy in a femoral component knee implant to demonstrate relative performance.

Regulatory regimes for opportunistic usage is being discussed in many countries for the so called TV White Space channels. The key objective of the regulators is to ensure that opportunistic systems can coexist with incumbent systems without causing harmful interference. However, they do not specify how these opportunistic systems must be designed to guarantee these requirements and to exploit White Spaces in an optimal way. This paper gathers key regulatory rules for opportunistic usage in the TV bands, and illustrates how these rules are turned into technical requirements within the framework of the European FP7 QoSMOS project.

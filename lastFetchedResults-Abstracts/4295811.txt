This system was operated in a four-stage based tidal flow pattern. Initially, the overall performance of the system was obtained with high removal efficiencies for COD with 89%, BOD with 86%, TN with 79%, SS with 92%, especially PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>3-</sup> -P with 96%. Therefore, the performance of individual stages was investigated. The results showed that he first stage of the systems is the leading stage to remove the pollutants of both carbonaceous and PO^\´-P substrates and the remaining stages appeared to play an equal rol- e in the further reduction of pollutants. Finally, changes of molecular weight distribution (MWD) of each stage were discussed by HPSEC analysis, reflecting the higher purification capacity for organic waste in this reed bed. According to these results, it can be concluded that dewatered WTR utilised can be considered as a potential filtration media for pollutants removal in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment.

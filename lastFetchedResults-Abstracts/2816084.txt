The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has initiated a microsatellite initiative which provides a more systematic implementation with an objective of sustainability. Concepts where selected through a whole-of-government approach where stakeholders were invited to support candidate microsatellite missions that best fit their interests. This has led to five concepts being retained for feasibility assessment: Canadian Atmospheric Tomography System (CATS), Canadian Wildland Fire Monitoring System (CWFMS), Quantum EncrYption and Science SATellite (QEYSSAT), Thin Ice Clouds in the Far InfraRed Experiment (TICFIRE) and Canadian Coastal and Inland Waters (WaterSat). These mission concepts support CanadaÂ´s domestic needs in areas such as safety, security, atmospheric monitoring, forest fire surveillance, satellite communications and water quality monitoring. This paper briefly presents the mission concepts. Each feasibility study is to provide the business case in support for the selection of the first microsatellite due for launch in 2020.

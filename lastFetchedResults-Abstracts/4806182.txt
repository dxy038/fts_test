It is commonly regarded by the spacecraft (SC) passive infrared (IR) sensor acquisition community that the SC passive IR sensor (SPASS) can not measure a range to a missile. Because of that IR ray from the missile to the SPASS lacks an IR propagation time component. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present the innovative idea to use the SC velocity (Earth center angular rate arch, BL), to form a triangle, and to derive the range equation applying the trigonometric triangle sign equation to the formed triangle, SPASS and GPS integrated angular rate positioning system (GARS) transform the measured range into the missile 3-dimensional (3-D) position and identifier data. Then, they provide those data to the SPASS operation center in real time

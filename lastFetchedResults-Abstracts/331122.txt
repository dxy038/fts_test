Objective
To ascertain the efficacy of polymerization of self-etching dental adhesives in different solvent evaporation conditions.
Material and methods

Four self-etching adhesive systems were studied. Two of them are classified as mild two-step self-etching adhesives (Clearfil SE Bond, Protect Bond) and the other two are strong one-step systems (Xeno III, ADP-Prompt-L-Pop). The influence of temperature and duration of the air-drying period on photo-polymerization was followed by: gravimetry, 1H solid-state NMR spectroscopy and stray-field MRI. The evolution of proton magnetization with irradiation time was recorded and correlated with volumetric polymerization shrinkage and extent of reaction; evaporation and hardening effects were identified.
Results

Main variables determining water-solvent evaporation of the tested adhesives are: (1) water/HEMA relative concentration, (2) presence of photoinitiator compounds in the primer (SEB) and (3) presence of ethanol (XENO). SEB shows the highest extent of photo-polymerization of the tested adhesives. The lowest volumetric contraction was obtained for APLP and XENO and the attempt to remove the solvents did not increase the extent of polymerization significantly.
Conclusions

Temperature increase following photo-polymerization reaction is dominant towards the effect of the drying step for solvent evaporation in self-etching systems. Attempts to remove the solvents did not increase the extent of polymerization, so other problems are impairing the polymerization of one-step adhesives.
Clinical significance

The use of tested one-step adhesives is discouraged as the attained low extent of polymerization may lead to low bond strength, high susceptibility to degradation and also will favor a continuing etching effect on the underlying dentin.

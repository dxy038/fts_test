This paper presents an implementation of a DTCNN, programmed entirely in LEGO Mindstorms NXT robot to, together with perceptron, guide a robot avoiding obstacles. The map will be processed DTCNN obtained from ultrasonic and infrared sensors. The main objective of this implementation is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing these and other applications of the CNN with Minstorm LEGO NXT.

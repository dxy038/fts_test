This study was performed to assess the clopidogrel activity in inhibition of platelet aggregation in suspected angina patients on a daily dosag of 75 mg of clopidogrel for at least 7 days. 
This clinical trial was conducted in the outpatients department of Cardiology, Post graduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from 15th October 2007 to 20th December 2007. We included 105 suspected angina patients and measured their platelet aggregation using the WBA aggregometer provided by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company. these patient were then given seven 75 mg clopidogrel tablets for one week for a once daily regimen and were asked to come for follow up after one week. Of 133 patients, 105 completed the follow up process and platelet aggregation were measured. Both readings were noted on specially designed farms prepared in accordance with the objective of the study. Patients who were on any other anti-platelet like aspirin warfarine, heparin, etc were excluded from the study. 
A total of 105 patients with 28 males (52.83%) and 25 females (47.16%) were included in the study. According to age, the patients were in the range of 35 to 75 years with mean agebeing 55.79+8.74 years. Mean systolic blood pressure was 136.61+18.24 mmHg and mean diastolic blood pressure was 87.80+11.26 mmHg. Standard error of sampling for type A and type B drugs were 0.128 and 0.120, respectively. the platelet aggregation readings after follow up were zero in 73 patients (69.52%), 1-3 ohms in 26 (24.76%), and 4-6 ohms in 6 (5.71%). As a whole, clopidogrel reduced the platelet aggregation readings to below 3 ohms in 99/105 (94.28%), while in 6 (5.71%), there was some expected resistance to clopidogrel, and readings above 3 ohms were recorded. Clopidogrel has a major role in inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients with CAD. But, the activity of clopidogrel and the dose required to inhibit platelet aggregation may depend upon the individuals. Resistance to clopidogrel, especially in low doses, is expected.

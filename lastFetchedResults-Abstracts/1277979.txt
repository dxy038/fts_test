The objective of this study was to compare the effect of cholesterol feeding of rats and rabbits. The levels of lipid peroxidation products and oxysterols in the plasma of the two species plus the antioxidant enzyme activities in the liver and erythrocytes were measured to explain their different susceptibilities to atherosclerosis. Our study showed that rats are less susceptible than are rabbits to the atherogenic effect of a cholesterol-rich diet because of differences in lipid peroxidation products as well as antioxidant enzymes activities in their livers. In rabbits, cholesterol feeding produced severe hypercholesterolemia (43-fold increase) and increased plasma and liver lipid peroxidation. Total as well as the individual oxysterol contents of 7α-, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, α-epoxy, β-epoxycholesterol, cholestanetriol, 7-keto, and 27-hydroxycholesterol significantly increased in the plasma of hypercholesterolemic (HC) rabbits. Erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity significantly decreased whereas catalase activity significantly increased in HC rabbits. In rats cholesterol feeding increased the plasma cholesterol only twofold and had no effect on plasma or liver lipid peroxidation. Only 7α- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol increased and no change was observed in any of the antioxidant enzymes activity in the erythrocytes. Although cholesterol feeding caused a 10-fold increase of liver cholesterol as ester in both rats and rabbits, the antioxidant enzyme GSH-Px and catalase activities in the liver significantly increased in rats but significantly decreased in rabbits. The increase of GSH-Px and catalase activities in the liver of cholesterol fed rats could have a protective role against oxidation, thus preventing the formation of lipid peroxidation and oxysterols.

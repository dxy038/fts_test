Concept-based multi-objective path planning, involves search and optimization of conceptual path plans by way of their particular solutions. The method, which has been recently introduced by the authors in the context of interactive path planning, is considered here using the epsiv-Pareto notion. Using this approach the decision maker may explore the decision space for concepts that have performances within a user-defined distance from the Pareto-front. In particular the paper discusses applications such as interactive path planning and re-planning. A simple "safe vs. fast" example is employed to demonstrate the proposed approach. Finally, a short discussion is given to relate the ideas presented here with A-life.

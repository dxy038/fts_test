An improved predictive current control technique for a zero current switched (ZCS) buck-boost series resonant inverter (SRI) is proposed to overcome the inherent disadvantages such as the uncontrollable large overshoot and the large current ripple. Using the proposed technique, the four quadrant operation of the output voltage and current for an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) application is guaranteed and the buck-boost operation can also be obtained without an additional bidirectional switch

The authors present a novel approach for modeling hot-electron-induced change in drain current for both forward and reverse modes of operation. The change in drain current, Delta I/sub D/, is implemented as an asymmetrical voltage-controlled current source. The authors first present the physical basis of the model and derive the analytical model equations. the implementation scheme for the analytical Delta I/sub D/ model in the BERT (Berkeley Reliability Tool) simulator and a detailed evaluation of the model as a function of different device and circuit parameters are also given. Simulation results of unidirectional and bidirectional circuits based on the new model are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

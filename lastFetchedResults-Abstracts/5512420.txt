In this paper, an approach to modeling and identifying a truck diesel engine is presented. In the context of enhanced drive train simulation and management strategy development, a simple but realistic dynamic model of a diesel engine is introduced. Since this work is part of an industry cooperation project, the adaptability of the model is a major development objective. The major benefit of the proposed approach is that all model data can be identified while the engine remains in the truck, without the use of an engine test bench. Thanks to standardized communication of electrical systems via CAN bus inside a modern truck, all necessary measurement data can be read from the CAN bus. An identification setup to generate the desired measurement data is introduced and a Matlab based tool has been developed to automatically calculate the corresponding model data. As shown, the proposed engine model simulation results and measurement data from a test truck agree quite well.

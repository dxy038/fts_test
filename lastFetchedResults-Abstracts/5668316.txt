The industrial structure is closely associated with the efficiency of resource utilization and the externality of environment. With the same condition of economic output, an appropriate structure can greatly reduce the resource consumption and environmental damage. With the accelerated economic development, the industrial structural adjustment is arising rapidly in China. Taking advantage of that golden opportunity, the optimal allocation of water resources in different industries is particularly important to enhance the utilization ratio of water resources. Input-output analysis is used in this paper to study the relationship between the industrial structural adjustment and water consumption, and then a clean and water-saving industrial structure is given. Multi-objective analysis model is employed to predict the future economic development and water demand of China. The harmonized results indicated a scheme that claims substantial reduction of water demand while closely keeping the economic growth rate as planned. It will greatly reduce the stress of water shortage and improve the quality of water environment in China, which is beneficial to the sustainable development of economy, resource and environment.

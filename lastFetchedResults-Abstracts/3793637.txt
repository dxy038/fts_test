Determining the appropriate response to multiple transmission line overloads is considered from the viewpoint of allocating the generation ramping. The formulation, called the rate allocation problem, has the objective of maximizing a weighted sum of the rates at which the individual overloads are reduced. The weight coefficients are chosen to reflect the relative urgency of alleviating the overloads. An algorithm is proposed for solving the problem, some properties useful for on-line applications are discussed, and the concepts are illustrated with an example.

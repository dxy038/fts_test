Approximately 30, 000 tibia and femur fractures require external fixation costing the medical industry $75.6 million. Monitoring fracture healing via X-rays is one of the major costs associated with post-operative recovery. Fracture Track is designed to provide a more objective method of measuring a boneÂ´s ability to tolerate full, unsupported weight and reduce the need for periodic X-rays. This non-invasive device utilizes a sensor secured to an external fixator and will ultimately reduce costs by $50.4 million annually.

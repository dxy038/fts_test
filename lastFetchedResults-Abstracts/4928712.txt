Broadcasting is a basic data dissemination technique, which has a number of applications such as address resolution and route discovery. While data broadcasting has many advantages, it introduces some problems known as broadcast storm problems, which causing a lot of contention, redundant retransmission and collision. In this paper our objective is to reduce the number of retransmission as well as to obtain less number of collisions. A good probabilistic broadcast protocol can achieve high save rebroadcast and low collision. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach that calculates the rebroadcast probability according to the number of neighbourÂ´s nodes when nodes move according to random way point mobility model and compare it with simple flooding, adjusted probabilistic flooding [4,7] and dynamic probabilistic flooding [14] schemes. Simulation results show our improved approach performs better than simple flooding, adjusted probabilistic flooding [4,7] and dynamic probabilistic flooding [14].

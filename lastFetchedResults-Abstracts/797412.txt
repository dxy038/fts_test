The objective of the present study is to model carbon dioxide emission data with a system of differential equations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are one of the key attributable variables in GLOBAL WARMING along with atmospheric temperature. We develop a differential equation for each of six attributable variables that constitute CO2 emissions and a differential system of the sum of the variables. We are using real historical data on the subject phenomenon to develop the analytical form of the equations. We evaluate the quality of the developed model by utilizing a retrofitting process. Having such an analytical system we can obtain good estimates of the rate of change of CO2 emissions, individually and cumulatively as a function of time for near and far target times. Such information is quite useful in strategic planning of the subject matter.

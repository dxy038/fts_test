Multi-task learning has proven to be useful to boost the learning of multiple related but different tasks. Meanwhile, latent semantic models such as LSA and LDA are popular and effective methods to extract discriminative semantic features of high dimensional dyadic data. In this paper, we present a method to combine these two techniques together by introducing a new matrix tri-factorization based formulation for semi-supervised latent semantic learning, which can incorporate labeled information into traditional unsupervised learning of latent semantics. Our inspiration for multi-task semantic feature learning comes from two facts, i.e., 1) multiple tasks generally share a set of common latent semantics, and 2) a semantic usually has a stable indication of categories no matter which task it is from. Thus to make multiple tasks learn from each other we wish to share the associations between categories and those common semantics among tasks. Along this line, we propose a novel joint Nonnegative matrix tri-factorization framework with the aforesaid associations shared among tasks in the form of a semantic-category relation matrix. Our new formulation for multi-task learning can simultaneously learn (1) discriminative semantic features of each task, (2) predictive structure and categories of unlabeled data in each task, (3) common semantics shared among tasks and specific semantics exclusive to each task. We give alternating iterative algorithm to optimize our objective and theoretically show its convergence. Finally extensive experiments on text data along with the comparison with various baselines and three state-of-the-art multi-task learning algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

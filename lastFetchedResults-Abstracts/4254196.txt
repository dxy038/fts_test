The fast liner implosion program on the 8-module pulsed power facility "Angara5-1" with output power 9 TW, electrical pulse rise time 90 ns and load peak current 4 MA is under development at TRINITI. The main program objective is directed on high intensity soft X-ray source creation for ICF and basic research. Double liner concept has been suggested as a promising way to provide a dynamic hohlraum for pellet irradiation. As a more achievable way to get pulsed power generator with multi tens megampere current a joint team of scientists from TRINITI, D.V. Efremov, Tomsk, Ekaterinburg and another laboratory have developed the concept of Super Angara facility, tentatively named as Baikal. The design is based on using of the tokamak T-14 power supply facility and infrastructure that are existing in TRINITI.

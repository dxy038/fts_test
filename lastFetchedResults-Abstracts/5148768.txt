This paper presents a new subspace-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation method based on the concept of well known propagator method (PM) and its noise subspace being invariant to power of the sources. With the objective of increasing the resolution, this paper introduces a new matrix on which partitioning is done and PM is employed. The proposed method has higher resolution capabilities than the conventional PM and the modified PM. The numerical results verify that the proposed method performance in RMSE and resolution is superior to the conventional PM, modified PM.

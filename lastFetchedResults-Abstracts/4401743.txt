The objective of this paper is to further investigate various applications of information Nonanticipative Rate Distortion Function (NRDF) by discussing two working examples, the Binary Symmetric Markov Source with parameter p (BSMS(p)) with Hamming distance distortion, and the multidimensional partially observed Gaussian-Markov source. For the BSMS(p), we give the solution to the NRDF, and we use it to compute the Rate Loss (RL) of causal codes with respect to noncausal codes. For the multidimensional Gaussian-Markov source, we give the solution to the NRDF, we show its operational meaning via joint source-channel matching over a vector of parallel Gaussian channels, and we compute the RL of causal and zero-delay codes with respect to noncausal codes.

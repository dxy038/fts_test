Ground Water quality change is due to mismanagement in use of groundwater resources. Main objective of this research was to investigate spatial variability of chemical properties of ground water. In this research chemical properties such as cation, anion, sulphate and carbonate were studied. Normality of data investigated based on Kolmogeraph- Smirnov test. Then, variogeraphy analysis was done in geostatistical methods. Accuracy assessment was investigated based on mean absolute error (MAE), residual mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R). Results showed that geostatistical methods have more accuracy than determinestic methods. However, global polynomial interpolation was the best method for mapping cation. In addition, for the most parameters, Cokriging method was the best method for interpolation.

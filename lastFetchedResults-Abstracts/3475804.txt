A linear program model is developed to represent the problem of real-time control of traffic in an overloaded circuit-switched network. Circuit groups and exchanges are modeled approximately as saturating devices. Circuit groups saturate with respect to carried traffic, and exchanges saturate with respect to the rate of attempts served. A linear objective function is chosen. Methods for the size of the linear program model are introduced, and techniques for computing its solution are described. The solution of the linear program is in the form of quotas for all the streams of call attempts entering the network. Detailed call-by-call routing decisions are devolved to individual nodes or regional network management centers

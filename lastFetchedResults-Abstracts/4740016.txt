MTSP included two categories: the first, distributed visit cities (points) number to every salesman, the distribution required balanced cities number. Second distributed MTSP walking distance to every salesman, it required balanced path length. For the MTSP which balance route, designed the hybrid algorithm, it based on genetic algorithms and 2-opt algorithm. The coding method, algorithm steps and the MTSP object function is given. Coefficient k in objective function is given, which adjust the ratio of proportionality and route. In order to split MTSP into single TSP, bring up virtual point concept, and set them. In order to minimize the total journey length, salesman always chooses point near center point, the corresponding sample and experiment results are given.

Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the effect of menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on incontinence quality of life (I-QOL) score improvement in women with moderate-to-severe stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after nonsurgical, transurethral radiofrequency energy (RF) tissue micro-remodeling.
Study design
Retrospective review of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Women with moderate-to-severe SUI were analyzed by menopausal status and HRT use for 10-point or greater I-QOL score improvement (an increase associated with subjective and objective SUI improvement).
Results
RF micro-remodeling resulted in 81% of subjects achieving 10-point or greater I-QOL score improvement versus 49% of sham subjects at 12 months (P = .04). Outcomes did not differ statistically when premenopausal (85%), postmenopausal using HRT (70%), and postmenopausal not using HRT (71%) groups were compared.
Conclusion
Menopausal status and HRT demonstrated no impact on the quality of life improvement experienced by women with moderate-to-severe SUI who underwent RF tissue micro-remodeling.

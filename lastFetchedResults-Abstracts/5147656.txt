Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) provides a comprehensive, life cycle approach, to equipment management that minimizes equipment failures, production defects and accidents. It involves everyone in the organization from top level management to production mechanics and production support groups to outside suppliers. The objective is to continuously improve the availability and prevent the degradation of equipment to achieve maximum effectiveness. These objectives require strong management support as well as continuous use of work teams and small group activities to achieve incremental improvements. TPM is not a radically new idea; it is simply the next step in the evolution of good maintenance practices. The case study was carried out to check for the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of Different diesel generator-sets in the one of the Institutions Power Houses. On the basis of collected data and we calculated OEE of the four power house. We find out Availability, Performance efficiency, Quality rate. By using this data we calculated OEE of the four power house and compared. a) In Power House 1 - Generator 1 has an OEE of 85.12%, Generator 2 has an OEE of 84.61%, Generator 3 has an OEE of 84.44%, and Generator 4 has an OEE of 84.73%, b) In Power House 2 - Generator 1 has an OEE of 87.25%, Generator 2 has an OEE of 87.31%, c) Power House 3- Generator has an OEE of 88.63%, d) Power House 4 - Generator has an OEE of 85.06 %, we have to achieve 90% OEE.

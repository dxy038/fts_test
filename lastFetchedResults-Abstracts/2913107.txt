The authors present a study whose main objective is to specify a test-bench which would be useful to design, evaluate, and test devices in an ATM environment, in particular new switching structures. Because of real traffic modelling complexity they focus this study on simple source models whose parameters may be set by having information about the bursty characteristics of traffic cell streams. A mechanism for measuring these characteristics is proposed, and different strategies for the model parameter assignment are tested and compared

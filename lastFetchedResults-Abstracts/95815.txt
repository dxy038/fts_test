We propose a fundamentally new concept to the treatment of material instabilities and localization phenomena based on energy minimization principles in a strainsoftening elastic–plastic bar. The basis is a recently developed incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response for generalized standard media. It provides a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential that is obtained from a local minimization of the incremental energy density with respect to the internal variables. The existence of this variational formulation induces the definition of the material stability of inelastic solids based on convexity properties in analogy to treatments in elasticity. Furthermore, localization phenomena are understood as micro-structure development associated with a non-convex incremental stress potential in analogy to phase decomposition problems in elasticity. For the one-dimensional bar considered the two-phase micro-structure can analytically be resolved by the construction of a sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous energy functional that envelops the not well-posed original problem. This relaxation procedure requires the solution of a local energy minimization problem with two variables which define the one-dimensional micro-structure developing: the volume fraction and the intensity of the microbifurcation. The relaxation analysis yields a well-posed boundary-value problem for an objective post-critical localization analysis. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated for different discretizations of the elastic–plastic bar which document on the mesh-independence of the results.

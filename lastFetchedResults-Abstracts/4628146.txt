This paper presents the configuration for a hexapod robot named MYRMEX and has as its major objective to determine the main sensor points to be found on its structure for an optimal redistribution of forces. During the robotÂ´s (electronic and mechanical) developmental phase, we were able to determine knots with increasing levels of tension and compression, in order to send signals to the strain gauges, and to indirectly measure contact forces between the legs and the terrain. This study allowed us to theoretically allocate a group of strain gauges on the optimal positions in the mechanical structure so that they can accomplish the dynamic control of the robot. The strain gauges were subjected to experiments that allowed us to assess their performance and calibration. At the end of the paper, we discuss a definition for optimal redistribution of forces by proposing the optimization of a functional equation wherein the numeric values defined on the first part of the paper are utilized as parameters.

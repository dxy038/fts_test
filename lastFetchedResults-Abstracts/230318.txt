Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used in combination with the steady state nodal core simulator
PRESTO-B to create a system for the optimization of reload patterns for Boiling Water Reac-
tors (BWR). The system uses the basic GA operators, crossover, mutation and selection over
the loading pattern (LP) represented by a combination of fresh and burned fuel assemblies, as
well as an objective function taking into account cycle length and radial peaking factor, to
obtain improved loading patterns compared with real BWR loadings. The system takes
advantage of the e¬Åcient quarter core two dimensional (2D) calculations, using the Haling
technique to perform thousands of LPs evaluations and obtain the better candidates in a rea-
sonably computer processor (CPU) time

Given the proliferation of review content, and the fact that reviews are highly diverse and often unnecessarily verbose, users frequently face the problem of selecting the appropriate reviews to consume. Micro-reviews are emerging as a new type of online review content in the social media. Micro-reviews are posted by users of check-in services such as Foursquare. They are concise (up to 200 characters long) and highly focused, in contrast to the comprehensive and verbose reviews. In this paper, we propose a novel mining problem, which brings together these two disparate sources of review content. Specifically, we use coverage of micro-reviews as an objective for selecting a set of reviews that cover efficiently the salient aspects of an entity. Our approach consists of a two-step process: matching review sentences to micro-reviews, and selecting a small set of reviews that cover as many micro-reviews as possible, with few sentences. We formulate this objective as a combinatorial optimization problem, and show how to derive an optimal solution using Integer Linear Programming. We also propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that approximates the optimal solution. Finally, we perform a detailed evaluation of all the steps of our methodology using data collected from Foursquare and Yelp.

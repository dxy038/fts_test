The objective of our study was to evaluate the influence of prolonged artificial ageing on oxidation resistance and the subsequent wear behaviour of vitamin E-stabilized, in comparison to standard and highly cross-linked remelted polyethylene (XLPE), and the degradation effect of third-body particles on highly cross-linked remelted polyethylene inlays in total hip arthroplasty. Hip wear simulation was performed with three different polyethylene inlay materials (standard: γ-irradiation 30 kGy, N2; highly cross-linked and remelted: γ-irradiation 75 kGy, EO; highly cross-linked and vitamin E (0.1%) blended: electron beam 80 kGy, EO) machined from GUR 1020 in articulation with ceramic and cobalt–chromium heads. All polyethylene inserts beneath the virgin references were subjected to prolonged artificial ageing (70 °C, pure oxygen at 5 bar) with a duration of 2, 4, 5 or 6 weeks. In conclusion, after 2 weeks of artificial ageing, standard polyethylene shows substantially increased wear due to oxidative degradation, whereas highly cross-linked remelted polyethylene has a higher oxidation resistance. However, after enhanced artificial ageing for 5 weeks, remelted XLPE also starts oxidate, in correlation with increased wear. Vitamin E-stabilized polyethylene is effective in preventing oxidation after irradiation cross-linking even under prolonged artificial ageing for up to 6 weeks, resulting in a constant wear behaviour.

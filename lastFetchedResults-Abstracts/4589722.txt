This paper presents the architecture, some specific supporting functions and an experimental validation of a new functional plane, namely the service plane, for realizing an added-value service provisioning (e.g., grid connectivity) for telecommunication operators. First, it is shown as the service plane can be a viable solution for decoupling service and transport development, by masking the transport-related implementation details from the abstract request of a service by a customer or by a qualified application. To this purpose, the service plane exports a high-level interface for supporting application-initiated invocation of QoS-enabled virtual private networks (VPN) or connection-less services. As a significant use case for a grid user, a VPN set-up through the service plane is experimentally demonstrated. Second, some of the main functions that the service plane should support are presented in detail and experimentally assessed, namely a centralized topology discovery service (C-TDS) and path computation service (PCS). As an example, from a grid user perspective, the C-TDS can provide up-to-date information on the grid topology according to various levels of abstraction (physical topology, MPLS topology, and logical topology). Several techniques for the grid topology discovery and various update policies are investigated. PCS elaborates upon the logical topology obtained by TDS and runs linear programming (LP) formulations to identify optimal traffic engineering solutions according to specific objective functions. The combination of C-TDS and PCS represents an an enhanced level of network- awareness in the (network) middleware supporting global grid computing (i.e., grid computing in wide area networks). Experiments performed on IP/MPLS metropolitan network based on commercial routers exhibit a topology delivery performance within a time span in the order of a few seconds and a PCS operation in the order of ten seconds.

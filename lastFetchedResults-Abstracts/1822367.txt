Objective
sion of osteoclasts in osteopetrotic (op/op) mice is substantially reduced by the absence of functional macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). However, it has been reported that osteoclasts do gradually appear in the bones of op/op mice and spontaneously correct the osteopetrosis.

lated production of osteoclasts and the changes of serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and receptor activator for nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) in op/op mice were examined.
s
mber of femoral osteoclasts, and the serum levels of VEGF, both gradually increased in op/op mice after birth and reached a peak in 120- and 60-day-old mice, respectively. However, the serum levels of RANKL showed an inverse relationship to osteoclast number.
sions
findings suggest that the appearance of osteoclasts may be influenced by the serum levels of VEGF and that the serum levels of RANKL may be influenced by the appearance of osteoclasts.

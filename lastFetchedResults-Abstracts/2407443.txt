Introduction: The concentrations of aminothiols in plasma and red blood cells (RBC) are used as an oxidative stress and health markers, respectively. The level of physical activity is an important factor affecting individual health by changing the power of antioxidant defense system.
Objective: This study was designed to compare the role of different levels of physical activities on plasma and RBCs reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), cysteine (CYS) to cystine (CYSS) ratio in in male adults. 
Materials and Methods: Thirty voluntary male subjects with high-level (HL), moderate- level (ML) and low-level (LL) of physical activity were randomly divided into three groups in this cross-sectional study. The levels of GSH, GSSG in plasma and RBCs, and (CYS), (CYSS) in plasma and also serum level of creatine kinase (CK) were measured.
Results: The highest plasma and RBCs levels of GSH/GSSG and also plasma level of CYS/CYSS were detected in ML group. The RBCs level of GSH/GSSG in the men from HL group was lower than that in ML group. The serum levels of creatin kinase did not show any significant difference between groups. 
Conclusion: According to the results, the level of physical activity of individuals determines the redox status of plasma and RBCs. Individuals with moderate level of physical activity showed high level of redox status, however, the high and low level of physical activity showed poor level of redox. This study suggests that both groups of individuals with high and low level of physical activity lifestyle might be predisposed to diseases due to increased stress oxidative.

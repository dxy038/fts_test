In this paper, we present the performance evaluation of high speedy data transmission on HFC (hybrid fiber coax) network. The proposed performance modeling methods simultaneously evaluate both high speedy data transmission system and DOCSIS 2.0 system. The evaluation conducts FTP file service based on TCP/IP protocol for digital broadcasting system. The result displays the downloaded file using Window Media Player. For the objective evaluation, we use the IXIA traffic generator and analyzer.

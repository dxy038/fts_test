The development of an analytical model to predict the inelastic seismic response of reinforced concrete shear-wall buildings, including both the flexural and shear failure modes is presented. The use of shear-wall buildings is quite common in a number of seismic countries as a result of their successful seismic behavior during past severe earthquakes. The objective of this study has been to develop a computer model capable of predicting the seismic behavior of shear-wall buildings. Such model would allow better estimations to be obtained of both the ultimate lateral strength of these buildings as well as their inelastic deformation demand under severe ground motions. Such information may be used in the implementation of performance-based design procedures, and to improve present code design procedures. To fulfill this objective, a shear failure mode model based on experimental results has been added to the computer program larz. This paper discusses the most relevant problems and solutions devised during the development of this model. Validation of the model proposed to predict the inelastic seismic response of shear-wall structures was carried out by comparing its results with the actual response of two real buildings during the March 3, 1985 Chilean earthquake. In spite of the fact that the model is two-dimensional and, hence, it ignores the torsional response, the results obtained are satisfactory.

The objective of the study is to provide a comprehensive capacity analysis for the CDMA system. In order to conduct the analysis, a simulator was developed. Key parameters to calculate the CDMA forward and reverse link capacity are discussed. The impacts of these parameters on the system capacity, based on simulation results, are discussed in depth. The CDMA capacity simulator is capable to calculate the capacity of a CDMA system under different system and environmental parameters. In this paper, baseline parameter values and capacity is first defined, then the impact on capacity by varying the values of the parameters is then derived

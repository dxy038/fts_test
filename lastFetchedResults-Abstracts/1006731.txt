In this paper, the optimisation of pipe network with hot water is presented. The mathematical model, consisting of the nonlinear objective function and system of nonlinear equations for the hydraulics limitations is developed. On its basis, the computer program for determination optimal tree path with the use of simplex method was solved. For economic estimation the capitalised value method, which consider all costs of investment and operation was used. The results are presented for real case study network with 24 nodes and 33 pipe sectors.

The main objective of the present study is to examine whether “simple” turbulence models (i.e., models requiring two partial differential equations or less for turbulent transport) are suitable for use under conditions of forced flow of gas at low Reynolds numbers in tubes with intense heating, leading to large variations of fluid properties and considerable modification of turbulence. Eleven representative models are considered. The ability of such models to handle such flows was assessed by means of computational simulations of the carefully designed experiments of Shehata and McEligot (IJHMT 41 (1998) 4297) at heating rates of q+in≈0.0018, 0.0035 and 0.0045, yielding flows ranging from essentially turbulent to laminarized. The resulting comparisons of computational results with experiments showed that the model by Launder and Sharma (Lett. Heat Transfer 1 (1974) 131) performed best in predicting axial wall temperature profiles. Overall, agreement between the measured velocity and temperature distributions and those calculated using the Launder–Sharma model is good, which gives confidence in the values forecast for the turbulence quantities produced. These have been used to assist in arriving at a better understanding of the influences of intense heating, and hence strong variation of fluid properties, on turbulent flow in tubes.

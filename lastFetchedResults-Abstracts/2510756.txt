Introduction: Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene and Xylene are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with similar physical and chemical characteristics. Benzene and ethyl benzene are known carcinogen as well as they affect the circulatory, nervous, and reproductive and respiratory systems. Toluene and xylene also damage the nervous and reproductive systems. The most important objective of this study was to determine the risk of occupational exposure to benzene and toluene compounds among gas stations workers,selected randomly in Kerman and also calculate the quantitative rate of cancer and non-cancer risk of these compounds. 
Methods: In this empirical and analysis study, 54 workers in six gas stations (of the suburbs and downtown) were selected randomly. The qualify of the air that the workers breathed were collected at three times; in the morning at, noon and night at which at one of three times,in each gas stations, the fuel was discharged from the tanker to the station tank.Air samples were gathered based on standard of NIOSH 3800 by sampling pump manufactured by SKC Co. England with a flow rate of 0.5 liters per minute. These samples transported to the laboratory and analyzed by gas chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detector (FID). 
Results: The cancer risk for workers exposed to benzene was calculated in the range of 1.11×10- 2 – 8.22×10- 4 and 1.30×10- 3 - 2.75×10- 5 and a quantitative non-cancer risk values for Toluene were also calculated in the range of 0.699- 0.217. 
Conclusion: occupational exposure of workers at gas station to Benzene, Toluene compounds might increase the risk of cancer in them.

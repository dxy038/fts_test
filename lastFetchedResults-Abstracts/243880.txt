The objective of Canada's energy efficiency regulations is to eliminate the most energy-inefficient energy-using products from the Canadian market by establishing minimum efficiency standards for certain energy-using equipment. Under the Energy Efficiency Act, regulations have been developed for a wide range of equipment. The Energy Efficiency Regulations, which came into effect in February 1995, apply to equipment imported into Canada and equipment manufactured in Canada and shipped from one province to another. Canada's energy efficiency regulatory process differs significantly from that of the United States in a number of ways. The Canadian regulations, for example, have different verification, reporting, and importing requirements. Important distinctions also exist with respect to the legislative authority for the Canadian regulatory program. Nevertheless, despite the differences in approaches, processes, climate, energy prices and policy objectives, Canadian regulations are still greatly influenced by regulatory activities and trends in the United States. The North American equipment market is an integrated one, with a constant two-way flow of products across the Canada-US border. As a result, the market domination by US equipment manufacturers has a strong impact on energy-efficiency levels in Canada. One of the key future thrusts of Canadian regulators will be to pursue greater harmonization of regulatory requirements within Canada and among Canada, the United States, and Mexico, as well as globally. The goal is to establish an effective, comprehensive, and consistent energy-efficiency regulatory regime that will contribute to the achievement of economic and environmental objectives around the world.

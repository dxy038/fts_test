Purpoe
To invetigate the efficacy of optokinetic nytagmu (OKN) uppreion and induction method for the objective etimation of viual acuitie in patient with variou ocular dieae.
Deign
Propective, decriptive tudy.
Method
One hundred eventy-three eye of 89 patient aged between 27 and 75 year who regitered at our intitution from January to December 2004 were propectively enrolled onto thi tudy. Ocular dieae included generalized retinal dieae (47 eye), media opacity (32 eye), refractive error (31 eye), glaucoma (27 eye), maculopathie (26 eye), and optic neuropathie (10 eye). Horizontal optokinetic timuli were preented on a 17-inch monitor creen at a ditance of 40 cm from the ubject in a dark room. Horizontal eye movement were recorded in each eye eparately by infrared oculography. Objective viual acuitie meaured by uing OKN uppreion or induction method were compared with ubjective viual acuity aement. The logarithm of minimal angle of reolution viual acuity wa 1.03, and ranged from âˆ’0.08 to hand movement.
Reult
Linear regreion identified minimum tripe timuli required to induce OKN by uing the OKN induction method, and the minimum dot ize required to uppre OKN wa found to be correlated with ubjective viual acuity (P < .01). The induction method wa ueful in patient with viual acuitie of 20/60 or wore, and the uppreion method wa ueful in patient with viual acuitie of 20/200 or better.
Concluion
Combined ue of the OKN induction and uppreion method provide a atifactory mean of determining objective viual acuity.

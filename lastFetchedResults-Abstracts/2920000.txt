Various names are given to describe the principle of vector control, e.g. field orientation, flux vector and transvector. Each scheme employs a slightly different method of control but all share the same objective-generating optimal torque in the rotor by maintaining the magnetising and torque producing components of flux at 90 degrees. The authors show how the vector control of an AC induction motor has been practically and successfully implemented

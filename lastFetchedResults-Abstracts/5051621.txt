This papers reports our contribution to the design of an eddy current sensor. The objective of this study is to conceive an Eddy current electromagnetic sensor in the area of the Nondestructive Testing. The sensor is integrated in a CMOS technology with an operational amplifier in the same substrate. A microsystem integrates the CMOS eddy current sensor that is used to detect cracks and irregularities of metallic targets to make a fast and reliable internal inspection

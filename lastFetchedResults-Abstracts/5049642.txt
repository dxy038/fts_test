A micromachined electrostatically suspended gyroscope (MESG), with a wheel-like rotor housed by stator electrodes, using LIGA-type microfabrication technology, was presented. Based on two capacitive detecting schemes, where common electrodes are used as signal pickoff and excitation, respectively, a unified multi-objective optimization design model of the structural parameters of the MESG is established. Employing goal attainment method, two optimization design examples using UV-LIGA and x-LIGA technology are given. An initial prototype of the designed microgyroscope was fabricated using UV-LIGA technology.

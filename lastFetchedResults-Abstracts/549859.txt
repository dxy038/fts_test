Objective of this survey was study on activity and serum levels of hepatic enzymes including: aspar-
tate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Iron
in infected cattle with Theileria in Golestan province. A total of 120 blood samples (60 infected and
60 non-infected cattle to Theileria annulata) were collected from different cities of Golestan province
(including: Gorgan, Gonbade Kavoos, Agh Ghala, Gomishan, Bandare Torkaman & Azad Shahr) and
were studied for protozoa after staining. Also rate of hepatic enzymes and iron were estimated with
commercial kits and results were compared with statistical analysis.
Results showed that levels of some of hepatic enzymes including: aspartate amino transferase (AST),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Iron in infected cattle were more than control group, signi!cantly. But,
there was no signi!cant difference in level of alanine amino transferase (ALT) in infected and non-
infected animals.
Our !ndings showed that hepatic lesions and anemia have important roles in pathogenesis of theilerio-
sis.

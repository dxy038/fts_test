This paper proposes an image quality evaluation model, in which the image distortion is analyzed quantificationally in wavelet domain. Properties of human visual system are incorporated into this model. Besides objective assessment, it simulates some visual perception features: visual nonlinear, band-pass visual sensitivity and visual multi-channels. It has simple structure and easy-to-use, experimental results show that the proposed model reflects image visual quality accurately and objectively.

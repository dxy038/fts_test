A new shield - double partiality shield is introduced. Shield structure is optimized according to genetic algorithm. The partiality radius, length and diameter of hydraulic cylinders are all important parameters for shield structure. The author established multi-objective and multi-constraint genetic algorithm, coded with the real number. She also established fitness functions, accounted with Matlab genetic algorithm toolbox and gained parameters.

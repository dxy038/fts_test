We propose a novel scheme of Rayleigh backscattering noise-eliminated, long-reach, single-fiber, full-duplex, centralized wavelength-division multiplexed passive optical network with differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DPSK) downstream and remodulated upstream using an optical carrier-suppressed subcarrier-modulation (OCS-SCM) technique and optical interleaver. The error-free transmissions of 10-Gb/s downstream and 2.5-Gb/s upstream signals are experimentally demonstrated over 115-km single-fiber bidirectional SMF-28 with less than 0.5 and 1.9 dB power penalties, respectively.

The objective of this work is to provide the link between the fatigue behaviour of pre-strained aluminium alloys and the scaling properties of damage induced on the fracture surface. Fatigue tests performed on pre-strained aluminium alloys revealed a large difference in their residual fatigue resistance linked to the material: the Al–Cu alloy demonstrated a sharp decrease of HCF life-time due to the pre-straining whereas the insensitivity of the Al–Mg alloy was clear. For the Al–Cu alloy, the investigations made at a ‘mechanical’ scale allow us to associate the strain energy absorbed during the prior loading with the aspect of the surface and the residual HCF life-time. The statistical characterization of the fatigue damaged zone was done from the measurement of the surface roughness. Scaling properties were established that allowed the conclusion of the universality of HCF damage kinetics as the mechanism controlling the sensitivity of Al–Cu alloy whatever the pre-straining history.

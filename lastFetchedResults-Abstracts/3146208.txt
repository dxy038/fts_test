The importance of evaluating the lean production has been recognized as an ever-increasing trend in today´s firms which implemented lean production. To overcome these existing shortcomings of the evaluation criteria which had applied evaluation index system to evaluate lean production at the present stage, management entropy has been introduced in this paper. The management entropy is introduced to analysis the most evaluation criteria in the firm which implemented lean production, the firm´s specialized objective evaluation criteria are screened out, and then computational results are obtained by using DEA method. It is proved that this new presented approach can evaluate the firm which implements lean production exactly and objectively, and improve the applicability and practicability of the lean production.

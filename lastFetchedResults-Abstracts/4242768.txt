We propose personal data backbone (PDB) to provide universal profile services over peer-to-peer networks. The main objective is to bring the control of personal data back to their owners. By using peer-to-peer technology, people can collaborate with one another to establish the services without resorting to a centralized mechanism or corporation, thereby removing concerns such as privacy, security, and monopoly. The peer-to-peer technology also achieves better trust, availability, accountability, and reliability, as compared to the centralized ones.

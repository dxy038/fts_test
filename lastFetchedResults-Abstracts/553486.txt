One of the most fundamental features of digital image and the basic steps in image processing, analysis, pattern recognition and computer vision is the edge of an image where the preciseness and reliability of its results will affect directly on the comprehension machine system  made  objective world. Several edge detectors have been developed in the past decades, although no single edge detectors have been developed satisfactorily enough for all application. In this paper, a new edge detection technique was proposed based on the BP neural network. Here, the edge patterns of a quad-pixel in binary images were classified into 16 possible types of visual patterns. In the following,  after training  the  pre-defined  edge  patterns,  the  BP neural network  was applied to correspond any type of edges  with their related visual patterns. Compared with traditional edge detection techniques, the results demonstrate that the new proposed technique, improved the computations mass and mathematical complexity, turns out better.

Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the cerebral, circulatory, and metabolic responses of the ovine fetus near term to umbilical cord compression with variable-type fetal heart rate decelerations.
Study Design: Nine fetal sheep, at 0.9 of gestation, were studied before, during, and after umbilical cord occlusion for 1-minute and again after repetitive 1-minute cord occlusions every 5 minutes for 1 hour, with resultant fetal heart rate decelerations of  90 beats/min. Brachiocephalic arterial and sagittal venous blood was analyzed for oxygen content, blood gases and pH, glucose, and lactate. Cerebral and upper body blood flow was measured with the microsphere technique.
Results: Umbilical cord occlusion with moderate to severe variable-type fetal heart rate deceleration resulted in an immediate drop in arterial Po2 by  7 torr, an increase in Pco2 by  9 torr, and a small but significant increase in lactate levels. Cerebral oxidative metabolism was well maintained but required an increase in fractional oxygen extraction because the variable change in cerebral blood flow was insufficient to maintain oxygen delivery. A redistribution of upper body blood flow was evident, with that to the brain and heart variably maintained or increased whereas that to muscle tissue was markedly decreased. Repetitive umbilical cord occlusion over 1 hour resulted in a significant drop in fetal arterial pH, with the acidemia mixed as Pco2 increased  6 torr, whereas lactate levels increased almost fourfold.
Conclusion: Although cerebral oxidative metabolism appears to be well maintained during moderate to severe variable-type fetal heart rate decelerations with umbilical cord occlusion, the need to increase fractional oxygen extraction and the redistribution of blood flow from carcass tissues may contribute to an accumulation of lactic acid both within the brain and systemically when such an insult occurs repeatedly.

No-Wait flow shops characterized as the continuity of job in processing, once it begins, subsequent processing must be carried out with no delay in the passage of the job from machine to machine. Addressing the problem with objective of makespan, a constructive heuristic algorithm was proposed in this article that based on the properties of the Crucial Machine and the job insertion method. Computational results and comparisons based on benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

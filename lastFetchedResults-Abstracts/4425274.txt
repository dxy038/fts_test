Security for Android smartphone platforms is a challenge arising in part from their openness. We analyse the security objectives of two distinct envisioned public safety and security mobile network systems utilising the Android platform. The analysis is based on an industrial risk analysis activity. In addition, we propose initial heuristics for security objective decomposition aimed at security metrics definition. Systematically defined and applied security metrics can be used for informed risk-driven security decision-making, enabling higher security effectiveness.

In this paper, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) based approach is presented for distribution system reconfiguration. In contrast to the conventional GA based methods, the proposed approach does not require weighting factors for conversion of multi-objective function into an equivalent single objective function. In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed method, 33-bus and 69-bus distribution networks have been employed which have led to the desired results.

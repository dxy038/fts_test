In ship operation, the consequence of roll and pitching motion can seriously degrade the performance of mechanical and personnel effectiveness. So many studies for the roll stabilization and trimming control system design have been performed and good results have been achieved where the stabilizing fins, tanks, rudders and flaps are used by Y. Koike et. al, (1994). However the ultimate objective of such approach must be focused on improving the boarding sensitivity. But there exist many weak points, for examples, increasing of navigation resistance, ship control performance degradation and increasing of system complexity. And, the achieved control performance could not give us enough comfortable boarding sense. The residual rolling and pitching motion are main drawbacks. To get rid of these disadvantages, the main hull control systems design approach by W. J. Hsueh (1998) has been considered using semiactive absorber. In this system, dampers, spring, dynamic dampers and control system with sensors are incorporated. In our system considered in this study, just two motors and control system with sensors are used for the anti-seasickness bed. In other word, the control system can be installed on each bed. So, we can control every bed on the specified control objective respectively. Above all, the good advantages of this system are the facts followed from simple idea and usefulness. Of course the structural modifications can be easily performed if we need such that some useful performance would be achieved. Based on considerable experimental conditions like sea state etc, we design control system and verify the usefulness of developed system from the experimental study

An intelligent control system for use with a robot arm and an attached Stanford JPL hand is being developed. This project includes the design of a robot arm for a Stanford JPL hand. The arm has 4 degrees of freedom and consists of a shoulder, an elbow, and a wrist. The fingers of the Stanford hand each have 4 motors attached to the &#8220;tendons&#8221; which are used to control the movements of the three links of the three finger. The two neural networks used in this intelligent control system are the bidirectional associative memory and adaptive resonance theory (ART 2)

Microgas chromatography separation columns typically employ channels with fixed cross sections. In this paper, we demonstrate a new class of unidirectional microfabricated width-modulated columns (&#956;WMC) that afford improved chromatographic efficiency, resolution, and retention times compared with corresponding constant width (120 &#956;m) bidirectional columns. Two new &#956;WMCs architectures are introduced: a linearly variable column (LVC) and a stepgradient column (SGC). The width of a 1-m long, 250-&#956;m-deep LVC is gradually reduced from 120 to 20 &#956;m at 1 &#956;m/cm. While that of a 1-m-long SGC is modulated in five steps (120, 95, 70, 45, and 20 &#956;m) each with a length of 20 cm. The effect of inlet selection (120 or 20 &#956;m) on chromatographic performance is also evaluated. Moreover, with our improved fabrication process, multiple serially connected devices are simultaneously coated for the first time with highly stable silica nanoparticles utilizing layer-by-layer technique enabling constant film thickness.

This paper proposes a novel planning algorithm for image based visual servoing (IBVS). IBVS is conceptually simple but prone to fail in case of large displacements. Hence, the objective is to provide paths for reference points in the image plane, such that the camera is steered from initial position to desired position. The novel scheme guarantees that the camera is always oriented such that the object of interest is in the field of view and that any reference point set corresponds indeed to a feasible camera pose. No camera calibration is necessary. As a novelty, this work is planning a camera motion, hence yielding compact paths in robot work space. The proposed planner is compared to others by experiments.

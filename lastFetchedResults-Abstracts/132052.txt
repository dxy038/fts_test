Introduction: GABA is a inhibitor). neurotransmitter in CNS that plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose. There have been reports that GABA-A receptors might cause a induction in the concentration of blood glucose by increasing the insulin plasma and decreasing the glucagon and somatostatine
Objective: This study was carried wig to compare the effects of interaperitoneal and iutracerebellar ventricle injection of Picrotoxin and Biccuculine on regulation of blood glucose concentration in mice.
Materials and methods: In this experimental study, male albino mice weighing. 20-30 grams were used. Serial blood collection from each animal was done by nitro- orbital sinus puncture. and glucose concentration was measured using O-toluidin. In this experiment, the effect of different doses (1P and ICV) injection of Picrotoxin and Biccuculine on blood glucose was studied_ One way variance analysis and t-lest were adopted in statistical analysis of the collected data.
Results: The results indicated that IP and ICY injection of Picrotoxiu and Biccuculine induce significant. increase of blood. glucose concentration in two groups (p<0.05). Another point is that increased blood glucose concentration n observed until 45-th minim; in alt doses but after this is me, blood glucose almost according to similar pattern is reduced and in 90 minutes_ it will reach ins minimal level.
Conclusion: Therefore. it seems that GA.3A- A receptors have an inhibiting role in regulation of Hood glucose. Further research seems inevitable since the effects of GABA-A receptors on blood glucose concentration is a complex phenomenon.

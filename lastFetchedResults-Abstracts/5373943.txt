The channel assignment problem in cellular radio networks is an NP-complete optimization problem. Classical approaches in solving it do not allow an efficient planning of the available frequencies reuse because they do not consider the cumulative effect of interferers. The objective of this paper is to present a spectrum efficient method of channel assignment using a genetic algorithm yielding better results in terms of blocking probability and computing time.

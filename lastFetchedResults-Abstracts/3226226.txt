The implementation of power converter for wind generator controlled by digital signal processor is presented in this paper. The proposed system is composed of a wind generator, lead-acid batteries, a three phase ac/dc full-bridge semi-controlled boost rectifier, a dc/dc single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC), a bi-directional converter and a full-bridge inverter. The wind generator is used as the main power source, and lead-acid batteries as the auxiliary power source. The proposed system adopts power factor correction to achieve unit power factor and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to implement available maximum power, thus to improve the overall system performance. In addition, the bidirectional converter provides charging and discharging compensation to dc bus by controlling the duty cycle of switches. Finally, the full-bridge inverter produces a stable ac output with feedback.

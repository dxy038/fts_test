This paper deals with the calculation of the electromagnetic fields radiated by a conformal array on a either singly or doubly-curved surface. A computer program (RESCONF) has been developed to allow rapid and accurate evaluation of the performances of this type of antennas. The objective of this tool based on a systematic approach is to be used in systems design studies, especially for airborne radar. The main properties of conformal arrays are reviewed, with particular emphasis on polarisation aspects

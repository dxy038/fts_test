The combination of data from different weather radar is now operational in some regions or countries in the world. The main objective of a weather radar networking and composition system is to overcome the range restriction of a single weather radar and satisfy the requirements of regional synoptic analysis. With the development of both networking techniques and signal processing methods, updates on digital weather radar networking and composition systems are necessary. In this paper we show the new research results on run-length and reversible integer wavelet transform techniques for the compression of weather radar data, weather radar error analysis for radar parameters calibration and artificial neural network based rainfall estimation with radar and rain gauge measurements. Experimental results show that the updates are efficient for a new weather radar network and composition system

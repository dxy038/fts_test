Objective (s): Dental caries is one of the most common infectious diseases and is high in developing countries such as Iran.  Since women with pregnancy are considered to a high-risk group for dental caries, this study aimed to investigate about oral health among this population.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. A sample of 340 women with pregnancy was selected with random sampling method from health centers in Arak, Iran. Data were collected by a checklist including information on DMFT.
Results: The mean age of pregnant women was 28.2±3.7 years and the mean DMFT was 5.4±2.83. There were no significant association between insurance coverage and DMFT (P=0.411). The results obtained from multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age, income and brushing behavior were predictors of oral health status among pregnant women.
Conclusion: The present study indicated that in general oral health was poor in pregnant of women. It seems social and behavioral issues play important role in oral health among this population.

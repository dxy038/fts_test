Objective: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation using umbilical cord blood
(UCB) has improved during the last decade. Because of cell limitations, several studies focused
on the ex vivo expansion of HSCs. Numerous investigations were performed to introduce
the best cytokine cocktails for HSC expansion The majority used the Fms-related
tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3-L) as a critical component. According to FLT3-L biology, in
this study we have investigated the hypothesis that FLT3-L only effectively induces HSCs
expansion in the presence of a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) feeder.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, HSCs and MSCs were isolated from
UCB and placenta, respectively. HSCs were cultured in different culture conditions in the
presence and absence of MSC feeder and cytokines. After ten days of culture, total nucleated
cell count (TNC), cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) cell count, colony forming
unit assay (CFU), long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC), homeobox protein B4 (HoxB4)
mRNA and surface CD49d expression were evaluated. The fold increase for some culture
conditions was compared by the t test.
Results: HSCs expanded in the presence of cytokines and MSCs feeder. The rate of expansion
in the co-culture condition was two-fold more than culture with cytokines (P < 0.05).
FLT3-L could expand HSCs in the co-culture condition at a level of 20-fold equal to the
presence of stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and FLT3-L without feeder cells.
The number of extracted colonies from LTC-IC and CD49d expression compared with a
cytokine cocktail condition meaningfully increased (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: FLT3-L co-culture with MSCs can induce high yield expansion of HSCs and
be a substitute for the universal cocktail of SCF, TPO and FLT3-L in feeder-free culture.

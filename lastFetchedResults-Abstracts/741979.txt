Objective: To evaluate the effect on cardiac hemodynamic parameters of valsartan in patients with chronic stable congestive heart failure previously untreated with ACE inhibitors. Methods: After a 2 to 4 week run-in period, 116 adult outpatients were randomized to receive valsartan 40, 80 or 160 mg twice daily, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 5/10 mg once daily, or placebo. At baseline and after 28 days of treatment, cardiac hemodynamic parameters were measured. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events and by any changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, body weight, heart rate, and routine laboratory parameters. Results: For the 12 hour time point (trough), all doses of valsartan reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (statistically significant for valsartan 40 mg and 160 mg), decreased systemic vascular resistance (statistically significant for all three valsartan doses and for lisinopril at peak and trough), and increased cardiac output (statistically significant for all three valsartan doses at peak, and for 80 and 160 mg at trough). There were no clinically relevant effects on any safety parameters. Conclusions: Valsartan has beneficial effects on cardiac hemodynamics, and is generally well tolerated in patients with congestive heart failure not taking ACE inhibitors.

Objective
m of the present study was to compare between two osteoporotic treatments in prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

adult male Wistar rats with an average weight of 150â€“200 g were randomized into 4 groups, control, glucocorticoid administration, glucocorticoid administration with concomitant administration of calcitonin or alendronate. After 60 days, the rats were sacrificed. The mandibles were examined histologically, histomorphometrically, radiographically and ultrastructurally.
s
athologically the glucocorticoid group showed irregular bone trabeculae with wide and abundant medullary cavities. These marrow cavities were reduced in the other prophylactic groups (III and IV). Histomorphometric analysis showed significant reduction in area percentage of alveolar bone trabeculae in glucocorticoid group (p = 0.0025), while group IV showed significant increase in the area percentage of bone compared to the group I (p = 0.0003). Radiographic analysis showed significant decrease in the alveolar bone density of group II at line 1 when compared to group I (p = 0.0009). Moreover, significant reduction in bone density was detected in both groups II and III at line 2 when compared to the group I (p = 0.007, 0.0273). Ultrastructurally, disorganized wide osteocyte lacunae and Haversian canals were observed in group II. However, group IV showed almost complete obliteration of Haversian canals as well as osteocytic lacunae.
sions
at model the administration of anti-osteoporotic drugs prevents the bone loss caused by the administration of glucocorticoids.

Toward go green, the main aim of this paper is presentation of a proposal for the integration and implementation of photovoltaic(PV) technologies in buildings considering aesthetic effects, particularized for the Iran through a case study. Our main objective is the selection of the most appropriate technical solution (PV and thermal) for the integration of renewable energy in buildings and electricity grid interconnection in near future. The proposed energy system is employed for energy supply in a residential building for different end uses such as hot water and electricity, a major part of electricity required for lighting, domestic appliances (elevator and electric garage door) that is generated through a PV system. Both the solar thermal and PV systems are installed on the building roof.

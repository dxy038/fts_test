Abstract 
Introduction: Industrial wastewater containing heavy metals, is one of the important sources of environmental pollution. As a heavy metal, hexavalent chromium exists in electroplating wastewater and is harmful for human health and environment
Objective: The research was carried out to investigate the photocatalytic removal of hexavalent chromium from aquatic solution using zinc Oxide (ZnO)nanoparticle in aerobic and anaerobic conditions in batch system.
Materials and Methods: At first, a reactor was designed and made. Effects of solution pH, contact time and initial Cr(VI) concentration on the purging of oxygen and nitrogen gas were investigated,  with ZnO dosage equal to 1g/L. Cr(VI) residual concentration was analyzed by the 1,5-diphenylcar-bazide method using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-160A), at a wavelength of 540 nm. 
Results: The results showed that removal efficiency of chromium in constant conditionwas decreased from57.65% to 30.63%and 79.5% to 68.67% by increasing of pH from 4 to 8 in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Also, by increasing of initial chromium concentration from 10 to 50 mg/L,removal efficiency was decreased from 79.34% to 30.56% in aerobic condition and 98.98% to 40.46% in anaerobic condition. Removal efficiency in the presence of nitrogen gas was more than that of oxygen gas. The reduction pattern was better described by the first-order kinetic model.
Conclusion: Overall, the results of this study show that the studied methodology in this research can be used as an effective method in the removal of hexavalent chromium from aquatic solution. Finally, dissolved oxygen shows a greater inhibition effect on the reduction of Cr(VI) than the nitrogen gas which exhibits a noticeable reduction.

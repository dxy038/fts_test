Objective of the work: To study the properties of rubberized plain pervious concrete in terms of the mechanical properties and the permeability.

als and methods: Three types of rubber were used in the production of rubberized plain pervious concrete mixtures which obtained by partially replacing the aggregate with rubber. One water-cement (w/c) ratio, one moist curing period, and four designated rubber contents by total aggregate volume were considered as experimental parameters. The results compared with non-rubberized pervious concrete (control) mixture.

s: The use of rubber significantly aggravated the pervious concrete mechanical properties and its permeability but in different degrees according to the rate and type of rubber used. However, replacement of natural aggregate with rubber particles resulted in a significant increase of toughness and ductility of concrete as well as better damping capacity.

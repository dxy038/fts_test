A 79-GHz fully-integrated bidirectional pulse radar system with injection-regenerative receiver is demonstrated in 65 nm CMOS. The novel design for the impedance transformation of PA/LNA improves the TX efficiency and RX noise figure significantly in comparison with the traditional RF switch. The injection-regenerative oscillator is proposed to increase the receiver gain as well as the system efficiency. The measured TX peak P<sub>out</sub> and RX conversion gain are 9.2 dBm and 42 dB, respectively. Using an 8&#215;8 patch antenna array with on board matching network to compensate bonding wire effect, the TX EIRP is 25 dBm with the beamwidth of 11.5&#176; and 10&#176; in E and H plane, respectively. The distance measurement for 0.3~1.5 m with the maximum error of less than 7.2 mm. The overall dc consumption is only 107 mW from a single 1.2 V supply under pulse modulation with 0.1% duty cycle.

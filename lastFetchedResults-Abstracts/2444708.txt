While many studies have been conducted in regard to the
analysis and risk assessment in the insurance, less attention has been
paid to cognitive and objective aspects of uncertainty concept. The role of
insurance companies to cover existing uncertainty can be manifested in
the framework of legal contracts. Thus, the measurement unit of dealings
between the insurer and the insured is transaction. Imperfect and
asymmetric information, in the form of bounded rationality, contributes
the most to the creation of transaction costs due to adverse selection and
moral hazard. In this paper, the transaction cost economics approach has
been implemented, which is based on the new institutional economics;
we use this approach in attempt to explain and analyze the means to
reduce transaction costs (due to formal and informal institutions) and
consequently the associated risks. There is sufficient evidence implying
that through deep understanding of transaction cost concept and
institutional factors, much of the ensuing risks can be identified, controlled
and managed. In addition, the role of government in risk management,
as an institution and in terms of Sovereign duties, Legislation and Policy,
in reducing transaction costs in downstream entities is of fundamental
importance. Therefore, focusing on transaction cost economics, and
considering the implications of standard risk assessment system, the risk
management structure can be designed and organized in an improved
way.

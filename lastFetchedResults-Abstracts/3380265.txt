The analysis problems arising from a digital packet switched speech network are outlined in a wide statistical environment. The statistical models assumed are discussed with respect to practical applications. Particular attention is devoted to a formal description of the influence of the packet voice receiver on the system behavior in terms of the delay pdf. The optimization of the system performance, in order to obtain the best voice quality, is stated as an optimal control problem, and the analysis results play a central role in the construction of the objective functions. The problem is solved in a particular analytical environment. The outlined analytical results are supported by critical comments on their comparison with practical implementations, allowing the designer a better capability in handling any problems.

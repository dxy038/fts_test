This paper shows a comparison between two different control strategies to the bidirectional rectifier with high power factor. The same hardware was applied during the tests for both control techniques and with the controllers implemented on Texas TMS320F2812 DSP. Besides the techniques, this paper will focus on the differences to carry out the controllers and in the results for each applied methodology.

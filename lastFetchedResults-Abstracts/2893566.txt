This paper proposed a new ZCS single phase ac-ac matrix converter for the traction applications. The proposed soft switching matrix converter is enhanced with an auxiliary resonant circuit in order to achieve the zero current switching for main bidirectional switches of the matrix converter. The main advantage of this proposed topology is soft switching of matrix converter to achieve switching loses limitation. This paper describes the operation of the proposed matrix converter, simulation analysis and experimental validation of the prototype for 50V-16.7Hz-100W-400Hz.

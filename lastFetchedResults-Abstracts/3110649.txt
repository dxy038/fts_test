Integrated Communication and Control Systems (ICCS) introduce distributed and randomly varying delays within individual control and decision loops. With the objective of mitigating the detrimental effects of these network-induced delays, a predictor-controller algorithm has been formulated in the first part [1] of this-two-part paper. This second part addresses the implementation and verification of the delay-compensation algorithm. The delay compensator has been experimentally verified at an IEEE 802.4 network testbed for velocity control of a DC servomotor. Performance of the delay compensation algorithm was also examined by combined discrete-event and continuous-time simulation of the flight control system of an advanced aircraft, that uses the SAE linear token passing bus for data communications.

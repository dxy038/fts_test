We consider the identical parallel machine problem with makespan minimization subject to minimum total
'owtime. First, we develop an optimal algorithm to the identical parallel machine problem with the objective
of minimizing makespan. To improve the computational e3ciency, two implementation techniques, the lower
bound calculation and the job replacement rule, are applied. Based on the algorithm, an optimal algorithm,
using new lower bounds, to the considered problem is developed. The result of this study can also be used
to solve the bicriteria problem of minimizing the weighted sum of makespan and mean 'owtime. Computational
experiments are conducted up to six machines and 1000 jobs. Although the proposed algorithm has an
exponential time complexity, the computational results show that it is e3cient to 8nd the optimal solution.

In this paper, we introduce a new index for evaluating the interpretability of Mamdani fuzzy rule-based systems (MFRBSs). The index takes both the rule base complexity and the data base integrity into account. We discuss the use of this index in the multi-objective evolutionary generation of MFRBSs with different trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. The rule base and the membership function parameters of the MFRBSs are learnt concurrently by exploiting an appropriate chromosome coding and purposely-defined genetic operators. Results on a real-world regression problem are shown and discussed.

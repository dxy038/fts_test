Objective
This study was undertaken to determine incidence and risk factors for uterine rupture in women attempting vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) in a wide range of hospital settings.
Study design
We performed a case-control study nested within a cohort of women who have had a prior cesarean to determine the incidence and risk factors for uterine rupture in women attempting VBAC.
Results
The incidence rate of uterine rupture in those who attempt VBAC was 9.8 per 1000. A prior vaginal delivery was associated with a lower risk of uterine rupture (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.81). Although prostaglandins alone were not associated with uterine rupture, sequential use of prostaglandin and pitocin was associated with uterine rupture (adjusted OR = 3.07, 95% CI 0.98-9.88).
Conclusion
Women with a prior cesarean should be offered VBAC, and women with a prior cesarean and prior vaginal delivery should be encouraged to VBAC. Although other studies have suggested that prostaglandins should be avoided, we suggest that inductions requiring sequential agents be avoided.

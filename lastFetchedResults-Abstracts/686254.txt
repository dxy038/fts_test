The NOAA Buoy model is currently used to estimate the airâ€“sea transfer rates of highly soluble gases over coastal water bodies, such as Tampa Bay, using offshore meteorological measurements. Since a goal of the BRACE study was to improve estimates of nitrogen deposition over Tampa Bay, our objective was to investigate if the model accurately predicts gas transfer when shoreline input data are used in lieu of offshore measurements. To accomplish this objective, we compared over-water measurements of sensible heat with NOAA Buoy model predictions using both offshore and shoreline meteorology. In the summer months, the apparent daytime influence of land surface heating on air temperature produces a higher air than water temperature at the shoreline. For the NOAA Buoy model, this yields stable atmospheric conditions and thus under-predicts the over-water exchange rates for a shallow estuary. If the data records are removed from the model for periods when air temperature is 4.8 K greater than the water temperature, the shoreline and over-water transfer rates are in reasonable agreement.

The main objective of this paper is to describe a technique for optimize the capturing and processing of voltage and current signals at various points of the power system. The FPGA enables parallel processing of multiple signals. We present preliminary results with FPGA-based embedded system architecture for six-processing signals. A second objective is use of Precision Time Protocol to Synchronise Sampled Value with high precision. Therefore, we use a Software Based IEEE 1588-2008 for synchronization of the captures of event for Power Quality measurements.

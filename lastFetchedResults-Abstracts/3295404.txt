Expansion of the electricity sector and liberalized electricity market leads to more jobs challenging the designer of the transmission network. In order to match with the load growth and generation patterns schemes optimal transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) has to be done. It will find out where, when and how many new transmission lines should be added in the network. From the recent past, renewable energy resources are becoming major attraction part to the power sector. Large scale integration of distributed generation (DG) affects the electrical industry and as well as the strategy of the transmission network expansion. In this paper the impact of distributed generation (DG) in transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) is presented. The objective of TNEP is to minimize the transmission line investment cost required to meet the growing load and the added constraints. Static TNEP problem is modeled by using DC power flow model and to solve this problem a population search based algorithm named, Gbest Artificial Bee Colony (GABC) optimization algorithm is proposed. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is evaluated on GarverÂ´s 6-bus network, and IEEE 24-bus test system. Results obtained are compared with the previous published literature.

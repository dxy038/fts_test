A modeling technique that allows the use of the relevant information from a transistor-level interconnection database to drive a logic simulator or a fast hardware accelerator is introduced. A bidirectional element is split into two unidirectional elements tied together with the help of bus elements. Transmission gate and bus models which use the device and node strength information are presented. Realistic examples are used to illustrate that the method leads to a correct simulation

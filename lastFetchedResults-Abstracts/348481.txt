Objective
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ulnar nerve is being increasingly employed in the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). Our aims were to: (i) assess the sensitivity of MRI in diagnosing UNE, especially in cases where neurophysiologic studies were non-localizing, (ii) determine the spectrum of MRI abnormalities in patients presenting with symptoms and signs of ulnar neuropathy, (iii) assess whether MRI findings differ between grades of UNE severity, and (iv) to see if MRI findings give an input into the pathological mechanisms of UNE.
Methods
Clinical, neurophysiologic, and radiologic (MRI) records were reviewed in 52 patients with symptoms and signs of ulnar neuropathy. Ulnar nerve MRI studies were assessed by an unblinded observer.
Results
The sensitivity of MRI at diagnosing UNE was higher than conventional nerve conduction studies, 90 versus 65%, respectively. In patients with non-localizing neurophysiologic studies (n=19), MRI disclosed changes consistent with UNE in 16 (84%) cases. The most frequent MRI findings included a combination of high signal intensity and nerve enlargement (63%), followed by nerve compression (27%) and isolated high signal intensity (23%), and isolated nerve enlargement (2%). There was no significant difference between patients with localizing and non-localizing neurophysiologic testing. Lastly, there were no differences between different grades of UNE, suggesting that UNE may be a neurophysiologically heterogeneous disorder.
Conclusions
MRI studies proved to be more sensitive than conventional nerve conduction studies at diagnosing UNE. In addition, the MRI studies were highly sensitive in patients with non-localizing UNE.
Significance
Our study shows that MRI of the ulnar nerve should be used in patients with clinical features of UNE especially in those with non-localizing neurophysiologic testing.

Our final objective is to develop a multi-functional touch sensor imitating the human hand, that recognizes material properties and contact condition adapting to ambient temperature-humidity change. In this study, we investigated a sensing method to obtain the temperature-humidity information by measuring some capacitances of a simple-structure capacitive touch sensor at the different measurement frequencies. Some experimental results showed possibility of sensing functions about the temperature and the humidity by using capacitance changes of the sensor.

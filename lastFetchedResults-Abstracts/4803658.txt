This paper examines the possibility of remote detection of defective disc insulators on overhead transmission lines. Application of infrared thermal imaging systems is studied in relation to the very small temperature differentials between sound and faulty discs, and the many influencing factors that significantly reduce sensitivity. The application of corona detection techniques appears to present a complementary approach. The objective is to understand the mechanisms involved in order to develop more cost-effective diagnostic techniques for this class of equipment

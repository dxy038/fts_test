One of the key components in computational mechanics procedures using global/local methods is the
specification of the global/local interface. Global/local interfaces are usually specified by visually examining
some measure of response such as colour-coded contour plots of stresses or strain energy. However, when
both global and local domains are modelled in three dimensions, such a specification is not as obvious, and it
lacks objectivity and uniqueness. An Objective Search Method (OSM)is presented to specify the global/
local interface in three dimensions in a precise, repeatable and automated manner. The OSM performs the
search incrementally in all directions in three dimensions radiating from a location of interest until certain
generalized guidelines are satisfied and the global/local interface is identified. The OSM is suited to
problems where localized phenomena exist but where their domains are not known a priori. The generalized
guidelines for the OSM require the identification of nodes lying on the external surfaces of the model. As an
important component of the OSM, a unique method to identify surface nodes has been developed and is
also presented. Finally, the uniqueness, sensitivity and versatility of the OSM is illustrated using two
example problems and the computational effort involved with the OSM is discussed in the context of a
third example problem

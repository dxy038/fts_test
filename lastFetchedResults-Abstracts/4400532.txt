A novel algorithm for Virtual View Synthesis based on Non-Local Means Filtering is presented in this paper. Apart from using the video frames from the nearby cameras and the corresponding per-pixel depth map, this algorithm also makes use of the previously synthesized frame. Simple and efficient, the algorithm can synthesize video at any given virtual viewpoint at a faster rate. In the process, the quality of the synthesized frame is not compromised. Experimental results prove the above mentioned claim. The subjective and objective quality of the synthesized frames are comparable to the existing algorithms.

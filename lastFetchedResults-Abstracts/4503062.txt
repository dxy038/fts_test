The objective of this paper is to address a typical efficiency analysis problem, in which interval inputs/outputs are considered. This paper firstly discusses the main weakness of the existing model in dealing with imprecise data, that different DMUs (decision making units) are rated under different production frontier, which makes the efficiency comparisons concise and meaningless. In order to evaluate DMUs (Decision making units) more rationally and effectively, the current paper develops a centralized DEA approach to deal with interval data. Since we can obtain all exact values of interval inputs and outputs at the same time via the proposed model, all DMUs can be measured under the same production frontier. A Chinese city case is employed to illustrate the proposed model.

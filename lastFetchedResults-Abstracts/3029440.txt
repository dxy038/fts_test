The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility of incorporating the Knowledge Management (KM) paradigm in healthcare. We discuss whether it would be beneficial for healthcare organisations to adopt the KM paradigm so as to facilitate effective decision-making in the context of healthcare delivery. Alternative healthcare management concepts with respect to their ability in providing a solution to the above mentioned issue are reviewed. This paper concludes that the KM paradigm can transform the healthcare sector. Based on empirical data and a long-term healthcare case study, a preliminary conceptual analysis of alternative healthcare management concepts is presented. The results reveal that KM can assist healthcare institutions (His) in making healthcare processes more effective.

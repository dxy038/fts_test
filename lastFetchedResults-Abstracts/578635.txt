: The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of organic fertilizer and biostimulant on the growth and biomass in the dill umbel number per plant, dry weight of plant and seed weight per plant. The experiment was carried out at the Hamand Research Station in Damavand in 2011. Organic fertilizer contain Vermicompost (0, 4, 8 and 12 ton/ha) and biostimulant, mixture of Azotobacter chroococcum and Azospirillum lipoferum (non-inoculated, inoculated seeds and inoculated seeds + spray on the plant base at stem elongation stage) were used as the effecting parameters. The present results have shown that the highest umbel number per plant and seed weight per plant were obtained after applying 8 ton/ha vermicompost. The maximum dry weight of plant were obtained after applying 12 ton/ha vermicompost. Biostimulant also showed significant effects on dry weight of plant and seed weight per plant. The maximum dry weight of plant and seed weight per plant were obtained by using the biostimulant twice.

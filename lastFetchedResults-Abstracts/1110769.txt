The development or selection of a material to meet given design requirements generally requires that a compromise be struck between several, usually conflicting, objectives. The ways in which multi-objective optimization methods can be adapted to address this problem are explored. It is found that trade-off surfaces give a way of visualizing the alternative compromises, and that value functions (or “utility” functions) identify the part of the surface on which optimal solutions lie. The method is illustrated with examples.

The concept of Logical Service Provision Number (LSPN) is proposed to evaluate the service provision capacity in multicast and unicast integrated multiclass service cellular networks. The tradeoff between call blocking probability and LSPN is investigated and an objective function of maximizing LSPN is proposed. To solve the optimal problem, the system is modeled as a 2K-dimensional Markov process with following features. The multiclass service system can provide multiple service classes using either multicast traffic or unicast traffic and each service class has call level QoS requirements. A static channel allocation model is adopted as the multicast traffic integration scheme. By solving the objective function, an optimal proportion of multicast traffic to unicast traffic can be identified to maximize the service provision capacity while satisfying QoS constraints.

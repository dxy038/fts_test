The objective of this study was to investigate the efficiency of two treatments for poly( -lactic acid) (PLLA) surface modification with chitosan, via entrapment and coupling by using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The properties of original PLLA films, chitosan-entrapped and coupled PLLA films were investigated by water contact angle measurement and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The contact angle indicated the change in hydrophilicity and the ESCA data suggested that the modified PLLA films became enriched with nitrogen atoms. The cytocompatibility of modified PLLA films might be improved. Therefore, the attachment and proliferation of bovine articular chondrocyte seeded on modified PLLA films and control one were examined. A whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cell ELISA) that detects the BrdU incorporation during DNA synthesis and collagen type II secretion was applied to evaluate the chondrocytes on different PLLA films and tissue culture plates. Cell viability was estimated by the MTT assay and cell function were assessed by measuring sulfated glycosaminoglycan secreted by chondrocytes. These results implied that chitosan used to modify PLLA surface through entrapment and coupling could enhance the chondrocyte adhesion, proliferation and function.

Core bypass flow in block type very high temperature reactor (VHTR) occurs due to the inevitable gaps between the hexagonal core blocks for the block installation and refueling. Since the core bypass flow affects the reactor safety and efficiency, it should be minimized to enhance the core thermal margin. In this regard, the core bypass flow reduction method applying the labyrinth seal mechanism was developed and optimized by using the single-objective shape optimization method. Response surface approximation (RSA) method was adopted as the optimization method. Side wall of the replaceable reflector block was redesigned and response surface approximate model was adopted to optimize the shape of the reflector wall. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were carried out not only to assess the limitation of existing method of bypass flow reduction, but also to optimize the design of a newly developed reduction method. The experiment with Seoul National University (SNU) multi-block experimental facility was performed to demonstrate the performance of the reduction method. It was found that the effect of the existing bypass flow reduction method by sealing the bypass gap exit was restricted nearby the lower region of the core. However, the flow resistance factor of the bypass gap increased from 18.04 to 26.24 by the optimized reduction method. The results of the performance test showed that the bypass flow distribution was reduced throughout the entire core regions. The bypass flow ratios at the inlet and the outlet were reduced by 36.19% and 14.66%, respectively. In conclusion, it is expected that the core thermal margin and efficiency of VHTR reactor cooling can be enhanced by applying the developed bypass flow reduction method.

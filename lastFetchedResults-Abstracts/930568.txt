This study investigated the use of an on-line monitoring and display system in a beef slaughtering plant. The objective was to determine what information was possible and what benefits could be forthcoming that would assist compliance with HACCP requirements. The system was to be low tech, user friendly and economical. The study was carried out over eleven days, spread over 13 weeks; 75 cattle were observed each day for visible faecal, rumen and ingesta contamination over six sites per carcass side. Spinal cord presence in the exposed spinal channel was also observed. Over the course of the study the number of carcasses with visible contaminated was reduced from 76% to 33.33%; visible contamination attributed to dehiding operations was reduced from 54.67% to 24.00%, visible contamination attributed to evisceration operations was reduced from 44% to 16.67%. A significant reduction in the magnitude of visible contamination per carcass was also observed. Spinal cord presence was reduced from 6% to 0%. The system facilitated the identification of the most probable causative process stages, the implementation of on-line real time immediate and long term corrective action and the establishment of a single process CCP.

Security engineering with patterns is currently a very active area of research. Security patterns - an adaptation of Design Patterns to security - capture expertsÂ´ experience in order to solve recurrent security problems in a structured and reusable way. In this paper, our objective is to describe an engineering process, called SCRIP (SeCurity patteRn Integration Process), which provides guidelines for integrating security patterns into component-based models. SCRIP defines activities and products to integrate security patterns in the whole development process, from UML component modeling until aspect code generation. The definition of SCRIP has been made using the OMG standard Software and System Process Engineering Meta-model (SPEM). We are developing a CASE tool to support that process.

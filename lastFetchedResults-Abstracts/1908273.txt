Objective
estigate the impact of 2 months of neoadjuvant and 2 months of concurrent hormonal therapy on the acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities associated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for prostate adenocarcinoma.
s
udy cohort consisted of 80 men who underwent 3D-CRT with (n = 40) or without (n = 40) neoadjuvant and concurrent hormonal therapy. Computerized tomography-based planning occurred after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. All patients completed a previously validated, quality-of-life self-assessment tool on 7 GI symptoms, including diarrhea, urgency, pain, rectal bleeding, cramping, mucus, and tenesmus, at baseline and weekly during radiation therapy.
s
ts who received hormonal therapy were more likely to have T2b, T2c, T3a, or T3b (P &lt; 0.001) or Gleason score 7, 8, or 9 (P = 0.02) disease compared to those that did not. The dose delivered to the planning target volume was 70 Gy for both groups. Median radiation treatment volume was numerically smaller for the hormone group but not to a statistically significant degree (949 vs. 1043 cc, P = 0.30). Patients who received hormonal therapy had less rectal pain (P &lt; 0.01) and tenesmus (P = 0.02) but more rectal mucus (P = 0.03) compared to those who did not.
sions
te gland volume reduction after androgen suppression therapy may reduce patient-reported acute GI toxicities associated with 3D-CRT for prostate cancer.

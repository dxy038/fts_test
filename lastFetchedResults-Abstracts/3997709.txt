Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is extensively used in modern digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB) systems, such as the OFDM based Digital Video Broadcasting for Handheld (DVB-H) system, to support high performance bandwidth-efficient multimedia services. As a special format of multiple input multiple output (MIMO), multiple-antenna diversity reception can be used to improve the signal quality of the multiple-antenna reception OFDM based DVB-H systems. The same as the single-in single-out (SISO) OFDM systems, the MIMO-OFDM systems are sensitive to the power amplifier distortion at the transmitter and the channel estimation errors at the receiver. The objective of this paper is to research and analyze the compositive effects of power amplifier distortion and channel estimation errors on the performance of the DVB-H system with multiple-antenna receiver under multipath fading channel. Both the nonlinearities and the memory effects are used to model the power amplifier behavior. A closed form of symbol error probability is derived for the DVB-H system with multiple-antenna receiver in the presence of power amplifier distortion and channel estimation errors under multipath fading channel. Theoretical results show closely matching with those obtained by simulations for the DVB-H system with multiple-antenna receiver in the presence of power amplifier distortion and channel estimation errors under multipath fading channel.

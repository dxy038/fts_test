Optical mm-wave signal generation and up-conversion using external modulation of an optical carrier by means of LiNbO<sub>3</sub> Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulators have proven to be reliable approaches due to the frequency range, excellent system stability, and high spectral purity of the generated signal. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of different up-conversion strategies in terms of complexity, stability and robustness against dispersion. The comparative study presented here considers practical impairments such as the finite extinction ratio of Mach-Zehnder modulators and the noise added by optical amplifiers.

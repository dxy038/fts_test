Pareto borders are used to represent the best compromise, for a component or a system, between the objectives in multi-objective optimization. This paper presents also a method which will allow determining the global Pareto border of the system by integrating those of components in function of global parameters. Our approach uses the Pareto border as an intermediate between the component´s design phase and the system´s one. We apply this method to a particular system with the objectives: minimizing the system weight and maximizing the system efficiency

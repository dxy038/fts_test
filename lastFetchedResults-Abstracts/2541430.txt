The paper aims at describing verbal tense system in the dialect of Adkan, a village in Khorasane Shomali Province in the northeast of Iran. It seems that this dialect is one of the Tati Dialects in the area. Since the main objective was to collect the oldest dialect, the data was gathered by interviewing some educated and uneducated old and middleaged speakers. This study which is the first systematic study on Adkan Dialect shows that it has a verbal tense system different from that of Standard Persian. This dialect lacks some of the tenses used in Standard Persian  besides, there are some verbal endings which are not common in Standard Persian.

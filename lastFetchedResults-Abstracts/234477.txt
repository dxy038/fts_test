Studies on the use of rainwater and greywater to promote potable water savings have been performed in different countries. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the potential for potable water savings by using rainwater and greywater in a multi-storey residential building composed of three blocks, located in Florian√≥polis, southern Brazil. Water end-uses were estimated by applying questionnaires and measuring water flow rates. An economic analysis was performed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of using rainwater and greywater either separately or together. Results show that the average potential for potable water savings range from 39.2% to 42.7% amongst the three blocks, considering that water for toilet flushing, clothes washing and cleaning does not need to be potable. By using rainwater, the potable water savings would actually range from 14.7% to 17.7%. When greywater is considered alone, potable water savings are higher, i.e., ranging from 28.7% to 34.8%. As for the use of rainwater and greywater combined, the potable water savings range from 36.7% to 42.0%. The main conclusion that can be made from the research is that the three systems that were investigated are cost effective as the payback periods were lower than 8 years, but the greywater system was the most cost effective one, followed closely by the rainwater one.

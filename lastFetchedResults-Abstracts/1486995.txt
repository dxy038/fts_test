This paper presents a critical review on “Comprehensive chemometrics. Chemical and biochemical data analysis”, Steven D. Brown, Romà Tauler, Beata Walczak (Eds.), Elsevier, ISBN: 978-0-444-52702-8, Hardcover, 2.200pp, March 2009, € 1360, which is a four-volume set written by about 160 authors from 20 countries. Book evaluation is presented in two forms. The first one is a traditional subjective opinion of the reviewers after a careful study of the whole book set. The second approach is an attempt to employ objective multivariate analysis to the presented material and connect it with the state of the art of modern chemometrics in periodical publications. Objective explorative analysis confirms our personal impression that this book gives an adequate presentation of the modern chemometrics and should find a merited place on bookshelves alongside its predecessors.

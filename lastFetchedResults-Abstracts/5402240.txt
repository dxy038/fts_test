A novel two end-nodes initiating restoration scheme for optical networks is proposed to further reduce the restoration time, which focuses on the defect resulted by only single end-node initiating restoration in the most of current restoration schemes. Under the proposed scheme using pre-computed route, the fault indication messages trigger the source and the destination respectively, and then initiates bidirectional restoration to establish the backup path. Finally the restoration traffic is switched to the backup path from work path after an offset time. The theoretical analysis and computer simulation show that the restoration speed of the proposed scheme is much faster than the current schemes in most cases. Under the best situation, it can almost improve the restoration speed up to 85%, realizing rapid restoration in the optical network.

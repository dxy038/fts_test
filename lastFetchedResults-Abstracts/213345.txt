Background: The basis of spermatogenesis is the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs).
The concentration of SSCs is very small. However, a system that supports the
proliferation and maintenance of SSCs in vitro could be used to preserve and expand
SSCs numbers as well as increase success in transplantation. It is a new avenue to
restore spermatogenesis in azoospermia subjects.
Objective: Proliferation and enhancement of frozen-thawed SSCs numbers during in vitro
culture.
Materials and Methods: Both Sertoli and spermatogonial cells were isolated from
adult mouse testes. Frozen-thawed spermatogonial cells were cultured in two groups: simple
culture (Experimental 1) and co culture with Sertoli cells (Experimental 2). Also, Fresh cells
were considered as control groups: simple culture (controlI) and co culture with Sertoli cells
(control 2).Assay of the spermatogonial-cell-derived colonies was carried out at the end
of each week.
Results: Results indicated that the viability rate of the frozen cells after thawing
(68.4± I 0.2%) was influenced by cryopreservation procedure significantly (p ::::0.00 I). In
addition, the number of the colonies and their diameters in the co-culture system with
fresh cells (25.1±5.2 and 205 .8±50 urn, respectively) were more than other groups and
the differences were significant (p<O.OOl). Number of the colonies and their diameters
in experimental l(9.5±4.3 and 124±35.9 urn, respectively), experimental 2 (l5.6±3.5
and 157 .6±41.9~m, respectively) groups were better than control I group (3.1±2.2 and
87.5±30.6J.lm, respectively) and the differences were significant (p<O.OOl).
Conclusion: We demonstrated that co-culture system with Sertoli cells can increase in
vitro colony formation of adult fresh and frozen-thawed spermatogonial cells in mouse.

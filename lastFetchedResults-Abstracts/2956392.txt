This paper investigates the adaptive dynamic rate controlled video transmission for robust video communication under packet wireless environment. The video coder comprises of a wavelet transform (WT), multi-resolution motion estimation (MRME) and a robust zero tree coder. The robust zero tree coder is a modification of the basic coder proposed by Shapiro (1992) to adopt coefficient level partitioning so as to slice out erroneous parts at the receiver and use the rest effectively. The adaptive dynamic rate control is required to adapt the video communication to the channel conditions so as to provide higher channel protection when the channel is severe and, improve the source rate and provide better performance when the conditions are favorable. The system evaluation is carried out under narrowband and broadband channel conditions. Both objective and subjective results are shown at 64 Kbps

Â  Skeletal tuberculosis is an unusual disease involving bone and joints and it may have different manifestations. This report introduces a 25-year-old woman suffering from chronic knee pain without any response to conservative treatments for one year. X-ray was normal but CT-scan and MRI indicated a small lesion in medial condyle of the femur. The patient underwent percutaneous CT-guided biopsy. Following an evaluation of the obtained sample, tuberculous osteomyelitis was detected. After resection of the femoral mass and starting anti TB medical treatment, symptoms dramatically eliminated.

Background and Objective: Biological activity of hydrogen sulphide in smooth muscle of vessel and non-vessel tissue are contradictory. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of hydrogen sulphide on smooth activity of muscle mice jejunum.
Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed on mice jejunum and motor activity was recorded from in vitro segments of jejunum ~ 4 cm in length, jejunal segments were mounted horizontally in separate perfusion chamber. Furthermore, using vanilloid receptor 1 deficient mice (VR 1-/-) we tested hypothesis that extrinsic sensory nerves mediated alterations, in motor activity responses in the presence different concentration of of hydrogen sulphide (100-3000 MM).
Results: Serosal application of NaHS (as hydrogen sulphide donor) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of motor activity that are not significantly different between VR 1 -/- and VR 1 +/+ mice. In the presence of TTX (IjiM) NaHS (300jiM) caused a reduction in basal tone (19.5%, p<0.05, n=5) and inhibited the contraction evoked by 30^M bethanechol by 55% (n=5, p<0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that hydrogen sulphide is an important motor activity inhibitor in mice jejunum.

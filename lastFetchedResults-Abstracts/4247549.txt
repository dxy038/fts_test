Three methods to overcome local optima in the optimization of electrical circuits are introduced. Criteria for the selection of one of the three methods are given: they depend on the behavior of the objective function around the local optimum. The three strategies are based on a deterministic search along the positive gradient direction and on two Monte-Carlo-based statistical methods. Three optimizations of ICs demonstrate the performance of the new method

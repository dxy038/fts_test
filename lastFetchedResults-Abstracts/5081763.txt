This paper deals with the growing demand in educators in Engineering and more especially in the field of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EE) to answer to the growing demand of Engineers in this field. It is well known that the world economical evolution will need in the field of high technology less and less poorly educated employees and more and more engineers or doctors. The problematic is now how to enhance the number of high educated people more especially in the EE field. It is always accepted that the educators in the high education system who have teaching and research activities are mainly doctors. One of the main objective is thus to increase the number of doctors. As director of a large French doctoral school in the EE field, but also as President of the French University National Council (CNU) also in this field, the author has many data that highlight this evolution, in France. After a presentation of the French Education system in Electrical Engineering and from analyses of data, the paper arrives to some suggestions to reverse the present tendency.

Distributing computation among multiple processors is one approach to reducing simulation time for large VLSI circuit designs. However, parallel simulation introduces the problem of how to partition the logic gates and system behaviors of the circuit among the available processors in order to obtain maximum speedup. A complicating factor that is often ignored is the effect of the time-synchronization protocol (conservative or optimistic). Inherent in the partitioning problem is the question of how to effectively measure the relative quality of a partition. This paper describes an objective cost function for measuring the relative quality of a task partition that includes a synchronization factor for a conservative NULL-message protocol. A graph-based partitioning tool based on this cost function is used to perform the static task allocation for parallel simulation of a structural VHDL circuit. Results for two 1000-4000 gate circuits demonstrate that the additional consideration of the synchronization protocol in the cost function generates partitions that exhibit improved speedup

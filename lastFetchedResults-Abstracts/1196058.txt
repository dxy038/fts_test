Objective: The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R; Foa et al.,
2002) was translated into Urdu to measure symptoms of OCD within Pakistan.
Method: Its psychometric properties were examined against Self Reporting
Questionnaire (SRQ; Harding et. al., 1980) and Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI;
Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) on a 120 rural community sample of Mandra,
Pakistan. Alpha reliability was 0.87. Results: OCI-R Urdu version showed an
overall reliability of .87. About 51% and 59% of the participants were identified
as cases using SRQ and OCI-R, respectively. High level of OCD symptoms were
significantly associated with age (18-25 years), marital status (single),
occupational status (student) and being an only child. Parental overprotection and
parental care demonstrated a significant positive and inverse correlation with
OCD symptoms respectively. Conclusion: The results indicate that OCI-R is a
psychometrically sound instrument and it may be used for community sample in
identifying potential OCD cases in Pakistan.

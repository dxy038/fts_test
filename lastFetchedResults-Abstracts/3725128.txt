A simple, open and honest approach to process improvement applied consistently can help in taking the first steps away from fire-fighting towards a more structured methodology. The objective is to build a little faith that the process can actually be improved, extinguish one or two of the worst fires, and lay the foundation for more sophisticated methodologies in the future. In this paper, the author explains the process of changing the way businesses work in a practical and pragmatic way. Ownership by those actually doing the process on a day-to-day basis is the key to making changes stick. Support from senior management also creates enough space for the team to operate in pressured environment. External facilitation and guidance support can help, but most impose solutions in the internal team.

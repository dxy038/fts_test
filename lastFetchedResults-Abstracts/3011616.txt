This paper explores the utility of designing pointwise nonlinear transforms for simple objective speech quality measures using polynomial regression analysis. A method for the design and evaluation of these nonlinearities is presented and the performance of the resulting measures is discussed. The results of this study indicate that polynomial regression can produce objective measures which are comparable with those obtained using frequency variant or time classified design methodologies.

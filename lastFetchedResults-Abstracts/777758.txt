Abstract
Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease due to demyelination of
the central nervous system. It is believed that cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MS.
The interleukin-2 (IL2) gene is powerful functional candidate that is involved in immune regulation
and
operation.
In
this
study,
for
the
first
time,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
-475
A/T
and
-631

G/A
IL2 polymorphisms
on MS disease in Iranian patients.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 100 MS patients (mean age: 32.95
± 6.51 years, age range: 20-42 years) selected according to McDonald criteria, and
100 ethnically, sex and age matched healthy controls (mean age: 29 ± 7.8 years,
age range: 20-52 years) with no personal or family history of autoimmune diseases
were studied. The restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction
(RFLP-PCR)
method
was
applied
to
define
different
alleles
and
genotypes
of
IL2

promoter
single nucleotide polymorphism -475
A/T
as well as -631
G/A
among individuals.

 was calculated and Fisher’s exact test was applied to analyze the obtained
data. The value of p  < 0.05 was considered significantly.

Results: Evaluation of the -475 IL2 revealed that T allele and A/T genotype are present
in 2% and 4% of MS patients, respectively, whereas T allele was absent in control
samples. The comparison between alleles and genotypes in MS patients and healthy
controls was not significant (p=0.1). For the -631 position, 1% and 2% of MS patients
carried A allele and A/G heterozygote genotypes, respectively. All control samples had
G allele and G/G genotype. The differences between patients and controls were not
significant (p=0.4). Moreover, our results showed a very low frequency of T at -475 and
A at -631 IL2 position in each of the two groups. 
Conclusion: Both -475 and -631 IL2 polymorphisms were higher in MS patients as compared
to
controls,
but
the
frequency
differences
were
not
significant.

Based
on
these
data,
it
is

suggested
that the
-475
and -631
IL2
polymorphisms as functional promoter position may be

involved
in IL2
expression and regulation.
To
find
out
the
exact
effect
of
the
mentioned
SNPs

on
susceptibility to MS, study on a larger sample size is suggested.

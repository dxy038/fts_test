The design of a switching power supply (buck DC-DC converter) with regulated output voltage for a wide range of current consumption is considered. The control objective is to regulate the output voltage despite the existence of current load variations with bounded time derivative. A variable-structure technique is used to design a continuous time controller. A discrete and an analog version of the same controller are compared. Laboratory experiences are performed to obtain conclusions about the real performance of the proposed controller with satisfactory results

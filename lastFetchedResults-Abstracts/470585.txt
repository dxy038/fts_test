Objective
The goal of our study was to compare the impact of 3 suture materials on perineal pain and on resumption of sexual intercourse.
Study design
This randomized, controlled trial compared 3 types of suture materials (chromic catgut, polyglactin 910, fast-absorbing polyglactin 910) for second-degree perineal laceration or uncomplicated episiotomy. Patients were enrolled in early labor and assigned randomly to 1 of the 3 suture materials. Pain was evaluated at 48 hours, 6 weeks, and 3 months. The study subjects were questioned about residual perineal pain, resumption of sexual activity, and pain-free sexual intercourse. Logistic regression analyses were undertaken.
Results
Of the 192 patients who were assigned randomly to groups, 66 patients had their perineal laceration repaired with chromic catgut; 60 patients had repair with polyglactin 910, and 66 patients had repair with fast-absorbing polyglactin 910. At 48 hours, there was no significant difference according to the pain measurement scores, but the median consumption of analgesics was significantly lower with fast-absorbing polyglactin 910 than with standard polyglactin 910. There was no difference in the resumption of sexual intercourse at 6 weeks after the delivery between chromic catgut (42%) compared with standard polyglactin 910 group (56%; P = .23). However, it was more frequent for women in the fast-absorbing polyglactin 910 group (66%; P = .02). After adjustment for confounding variables, perineal repair with fast-absorbing polyglactin 910 was associated with a higher rate of sexual intercourse (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.07-6.10) and a higher rate of pain-free sexual intercourse (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.03-6.10) at 6 weeks after delivery.
Conclusion
Fast-absorbing polyglactin 910 for perineal repair is associated with earlier resumption of sexual intercourse when compared with chromic catgut.

Objective: This study examined the mediating effect of achievement emotions on the relationship between academic selfefficacy and deep and surface learning approaches among female students. Method: On a sle consisting of 300 university students were administrated the achievement emotions questionnaire learningrelated emotions (Pekrun, Goetz  Perry, 2005), the academic selfefficacy beliefs questionnaire (Zajacova, Lynch  Espenshade, 2005) and the Revised twofactor Study Process Questionnaire (Biggs, Kember  Leung, 2001). Structural equation modeling was used to assess the mediating effects model of achievement emotions on the relationship between academic selfefficacy and learning approaches among female students. Results: The results of structural equation modeling revealed that the mediating model of achievement emotions on the relationship between academic selfefficacy and learning approaches had a good fit to the data. All of the regression weights in both models were statistically significant and in the mediating model of positive emotions, model#039  predictors accounted for 48 and 19 of the variance in deep and surface learning approaches respectively and in the mediating model of negative emotions, model#039  predictors accounted for 19 and 24 of the variance in deep and surface learning approaches. Conclusion: These findings show that among students when encountering to demands of academic life, difference in scores of deep and surface learning approaches among them, accounted for by difference in degree of positive and negative achievement emotions.

The authors examine resource allocation aspects in an ISDN (integrated services digital network) or in a computer network where more than one packet class is distinguished in cases of random contention for <e1>M</e1> identical resources from two or more statistically different packet types. Particular attention is focused on sharing bandwidth among voice and data virtual circuits, and sharing buffer before a multiserver system. Generally speaking the problem is to determine the optimal policy for accepting or rejecting a call when the type of the requesting packet is known. The optimal choice of buffer size and bandwidth is involved in the design of the service facility as well as the rules for sharing resources among users. The objective of this study is to develop analytical models and computational algorithms for the determination of the state subset with better performance for slotted time systems, with call traffic modeled as stationary independent arrival processes and with service time modeled as a general discrete time distribution. The parameters optimized are throughput, utilization, and blocking of the system

Objective: the study sought the point of view, attitude and risk factors of domestic violence against women who have experienced it.
Method: for the purpose of the study a qualitative method was chosen and two focus group discussions were held by attending 9-10 women from south easterns of Tehran in each session. Data were noted and taped, then coded and results were extracted. Findings: women mentioned three aspects of spouse abuse (sexual, emotional, and physical) and reported that emotional aspect is the most important one. They mentioned that majority of women who experienced spouse abuse have low self-esteem, no family and social support, or they fear facing problems after divorce. They claimed that courts are the most important sources of support for women which now is not acting strong enough.
Conclusion: spouse abuse has different aspects and this problem needs multidimensional studies, however the best solution seems to be revising laws in support of women.

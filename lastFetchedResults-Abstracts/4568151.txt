Reasonably selecting the capacity of different types of DGs is the key element to guarantee that microgrid system can operate economically and reliably. Firstly a grid-connected hybrid wind/solar/storage micro-grid system is constructed and the output models of various distributed generations are built. On the basis of correction of wind speed and atmospheric density, the power of wind turbine is predicted by linear interpolation. The output of the photovoltaic generation system is calculated by using the Hay, Davies, Klucher and Reindl model(HDKR model). In order to determine the amount of energy that can be absorbed by or withdrawn from the battery bank each time step, this paper uses the Kinetic battery model. Then considering tax collection of greenhouse gas emission and reliability of the system, an optimal configuration design method is proposed, taking minimizing the whole life cycle cost of the system as the optimization objective. Finally, based on the weather conditions in Yantai city, a simulation analysis is performed, the optimal configuration scheme meeting the load is given. According to Chinese meteorological conditions, a sensitivity analysis of the wind speed and solar resource is given and optimal results are obtained on different conditions. The results are conducive to Chinese planning and design work of the micro-grid.

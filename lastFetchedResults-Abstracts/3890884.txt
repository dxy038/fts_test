A fuzzy satisfaction-maximizing decision approach is presented to solve the bi-objective power dispatch problem regarding both minimum fuel cost and minimum environmental impact of NO<sub>x</sub> emission. Based on the fuzzy utility functions of system operators and a fuzzy satisfaction-maximizing scheme, a set of noninferior solutions are obtained. For each noninferior solution achieved, the associated marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is then calculated to help the operators more rationally determine the weight factors of the objectives considered and hence the final best compromise solution. Numerical results of the IEEE 30-bus 6-generator test systems are presented to demonstrate the proposed fuzzy satisfaction-maximizing decision approach

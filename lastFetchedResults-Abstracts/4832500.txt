Scenario planning is used in preliminary forecasting, especially in corporate and military strategy planning. Its purpose is to define the possible directions future may evolve regarding a specific phenomenon. We applied scenario planning to mobile peer-to-peer service usage in Finland during 2008-2012. Our objective was to understand the most relevant factors affecting mobile peer-to-peer service usage. Based on a literature study and a questionnaire study among subject experts, we determined stakeholders, trends and uncertainties relevant to mobile peer-to-peer, and developed scenarios summarizing mobile peer-to-peer service usage.

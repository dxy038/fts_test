The main objective of this work is to develop a framework for supporting the development of applications for logistic companies that transport perishable goods (food and medicines). Reducing the amount of lost and damaged perishable goods during transportation and storage represents a substantial global challenge, which imply the implementation of cold chain monitoring at all levels of the supply chains. The framework contains several components that enable: (1) the real-time monitoring of goods during transportation; (2) forecast the temperatures of parcels; (3) generate real-time alerts/early warning when the product are not stored according to the acceptance criteria.

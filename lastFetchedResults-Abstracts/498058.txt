Background and objective: Urinary tract infection is a common bacterial disease in childhood. Lack of early diagnosis could result in chronic renal failure. Its necessary to know about the antibiotic resistance patterns in order to choose the antibiotic. This study was designed to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern of urinary tract bacterial agents in Babol.

Material and methods: This cross-sectional and descriptive study was performed on 270 files of UTI cases who admitted in Shafiezadeh hospital during 2002-2005. From all cases, 160 had antibiogram, so the others were excluded from study. By the antibiograms, the resistance to 8 types of antibiotics was studied.

Results: Among 160 patients, 73% were female and 27% were male. There was a significant correlation between gender and infection (p< 0.05).The most common causes were as follows: Ecoli (70%), Entrobacter (11.9%), and Pseudomonas (6.3%). The rate of total resistance without consideration of different types of bacteria was as follows: Ampicillin (93.1%), Co-Trimoxazol (68.1%), Cephalexin ( 63.8%) and Amikacin (9.4%).

Ecoli as the most resistance to Ampicillin (94.6%) and the least resistance to Amikacin (6.3%). In evaluation of the relationship between gender and rate of resistance, bacterial types showed the most resistance to Ampicillin in both male and female. The least resistance in female and male were recognized as Amikacin.

Conclusion: According to obtained results, the prevalence of Ecoli in UTI was high. Bacterial agents showed the most resistance to Ampicillin and the least resistance to Amikacin.

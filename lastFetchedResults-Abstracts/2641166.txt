Objective: The aim of this study was the efficiency measurement of Iranian men's volleyball teams in the premier league.
Methodology: The research population consists of teams attending the men's premier volleyball league (2010-2011). Because of limitation in amount of population, the sample size was considered equal to the population size (N=16). The study is descriptive-analytical and the field one. To analyze data, the descriptive and inferential statistics (mean, the Kendall and Pearson coefficient) and the operation research (DEA and AHP) were used.
 Results: At the first step, 21 criteria (financial, sport, human resources, available facilities) were determined according to the expertsâ€™ consensus (Kendall's w = 0.761). At the next step, the criteria were prioritized. Finally, there was not any correlation in the priority of the teams based on the efficiency point and the place of team in the ranking. There was significant difference between the efficiency points of the efficient teams and inefficient teams.
Conclusion: Results indicated that in addition to ranking the teams based on obtained scores, several other factors are effective in determining the amount of team effectiveness or ineffectiveness.

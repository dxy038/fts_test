We have developed a variable focal lengths image fiber based microscope system for biomedical application. The objective lens of the proposed system comprises lens of variable focal lengths and is prepared on micro glass slide by spin coating technique. The position of each lens is aligned in precision along the optical axis of system by employing high resolution xyz stage. The performance of the system is verified by imaging fluorescent microspheres of size ~ 1&#956;m. The proposed system can be employed in real-time fiber based high resolution imaging for biological specimens.

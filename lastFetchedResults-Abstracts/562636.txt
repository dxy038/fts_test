Determining the cervical dilatation, as one of labor's progress criterion, has been considered an attempt for inventing different tools for this purpose. But, unfortunately, none of the tools has become clinically widespread and applicable yet. Therefore, this study has been done with the purpose of producing a simple and clinically useful tool for objective determining of cervical dilatation. Reviewing other pervious practices for inventing or improving objective cervical dilatation methods has shown that the available tools using advanced technologies such as Laser or pressure sensors are not cost-effective or even cause discomfort for patients, so they had not been clinically applicable. Cervical dilatometer is a new small size device with a simple mechanism; it will be sterile, single-used and designed for converting examiner's subjective estimate to an objective and measurable criterion; it can reduce the number of examinations– that are carried out by different examiners– and can be useful as a training tool for midwifery and medical students and clinical research, too.

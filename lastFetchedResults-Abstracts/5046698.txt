The authors present a sensitive objective function to discriminate between steady-state and non-steady-state responses of nonlinear switched-capacitor networks (SCNs) with possibly incommensurable signal and switching frequencies. The function is based on certain periodicity properties of two sets of output samples of such a network. This function is particularly suitable as a steady-state discriminator for strongly nonlinear switched networks with slow settling behavior. It is shown that the objective function can be coupled with a minimization algorithm to accelerate the steady-state analysis of such networks

Wireless sensor networks is an emerging paradigm of computing and networking where a node may be selfpowered, and have sensing, computing, and communication capabilities. They have been proposed for use in a wide variety of applications. The objective of this article is to describe a wireless sensor network for monitoring of the health of aircraft engines. We describe the architecture of the wireless sensor network along with how it fits into the general area of wireless sensor networks.

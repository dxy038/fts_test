This letter addresses the problem of designing sparse linear arrays with multiple constraints. The constraints could include the minimum and maximum distance between two adjacent elements, the total array length, the sidelobe level suppression in specified angular intervals, the main-lobe beamwidth, and the predefined number of elements. Our design method is based on differential evolution (DE) with strategy adaptation. We apply a DE algorithm (SaDE) that uses previous experience in both trial vector generation strategies and control parameter tuning. Design cases found in the literature are compared to those found by SaDE and other DE algorithms. The results show that fewer objective-function evaluations are required than those reported in the literature to obtain better designs. SaDE also outperforms the other DE algorithms in terms of statistical results.

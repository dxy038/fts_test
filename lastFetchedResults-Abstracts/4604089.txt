In this paper, the best moment to replace to the damaged element in a fault-tolerant induction motor drive working with a open-loop and closed-loop control is presented, a previous stage of fault-diagnostic to detect a short-circuit or open-circuit failure in the power device is considered. The technique is based on the connection of bidirectional switches to electrically isolate the damaged element by mean of fuse blown corresponding and to replace only the damaged device by another healthful one at the most suitable moment, the main issue is to diminish the tracking error of the motor current during the fault transient. Experimental and simulation results are obtained in order to validate the technique proposed.

This work is only a part of the research carried out in the project: "Prediction, measurement and analysis of composite electromagnetic field of artificial sources of radiation" which is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Republic of Srpska. The main objective of the project is prediction, measurement and analysis of composite EM field of artificial radiation sources in real terms, as the basic assumptions of finding ways to create the basic concepts scheme monitoring network for continuous monitoring and field level recordings of EM non-ionising radiation in the center of Banja Luka. For this purpose the pedestrian zone, areas and routes for the highest frequency in the population flow were treated. This paper gives a brief description of the research EM radiation level at one of the seven treated routes in the frequency range from 50MHz to 3GHz.

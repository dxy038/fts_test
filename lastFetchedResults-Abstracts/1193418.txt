Chemical shock of cement based materials leads to significant degradation of their physical properties. A typical scenario is a calcium leaching due to water (water with very low pH compared with that of pore fluid). The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the evolution of microstructure induced by leaching of a cementitious composite using synchrotron X-ray micro tomography, mainly from an experimental point of view. In this particular case, it was possible to identify cracking induced by leaching. After a description of the degradation mechanism and the X-ray synchrotron microtomographic analysis, numerical simulations are performed in order to show that cracking is induced by an initial pre-stressing of the composite, coupled with decalcification shrinkage and dramatic decrease in tensile strength during leaching. X-ray microtomography analysis allowed to make evidence of an induced microcracking in cementitious material submitted to leaching.

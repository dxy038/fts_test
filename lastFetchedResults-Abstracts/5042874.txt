A hybrid wind park concept which contains both constant speed wind turbine and variable speed wind turbine is proposed in this paper, as it can provide similar power quality and similar low voltage ride through capability with relatively low investment. The objective is to optimize the configuration of a hybrid wind park which has low levelised production cost, high power quality, high reliability and high low voltage ride through capability. This multi-criteria multi-objective optimization problem is solved by a design approach ldquoProgressive Design Methodologyrdquo, which is divided into three stages. The final solution has the lowest levelised production cost with acceptable flicker level and LVRT capability.

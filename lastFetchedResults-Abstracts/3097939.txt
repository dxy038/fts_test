The objective of this paper is to realize the real-time visualization of hydroelectric project. Based on the object-oriented graphics modeling technology, we construct the three kinds of graphics models sorted by hierarchy---unit model, process model, scene model in the four-dimensional coordinates. With these models, the modeling method of visualization of hydroelectric project is proposed. And in this visualization system, the construction simulation system is employed to simulate the real-time behaviors of the construction, the object-oriented graphics rendering engine (OGRE) which organizes and updates the virtual environment is integrated, the interaction system which responds to the user-initiated events and the user exploration for the simulation results in real-time is designed. So, the interactive dynamic visualization system of hydroelectric project is developed. Eventually, the effectiveness and capabilities of the system are showed through the application examples in China.

We have developed methods for localizing and imaging cardiac activation within the three-dimensional (3D) myocardium by means of a heart-excitation-model. The site of origin and sequence of myocardial activation are estimated by minimizing multiple objective functions of the measured and the heart-model-generated body surface potential maps (BSPMs). Computer simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the developed 3D localization and imaging approach, using a pacing protocol. A pilot experimental study was also conducted to assess the performance of the localization procedure in localizing the site of origin of ventricular activation. Our promising results suggest that the developed method may become an alternative in mapping cardiac activation.

These resulted in heavy emissions of pollutants which have seriously affected the urban ecological environment and infrastructures; which in turn threatened the quality of life particularly in urban areas. In the objective of this research is therefore, environmental planning and design strategies of urban landscape ecological infrastructures. The AWOP approach: Aggregate with outlier Principle was used to examine the Tehran city, Urban district No. 2 capabilities for a better and efficient environmental design of its ecological infrastructure and thus to enhance the quality of life of citizens. Several urban structures and land-uses were analyzed and discussed according to AWOP approach. Then field study and observations were used to identify the most critical ecosystems and structures. Then environmental planning and design strategies were formulated in the framework ecological design in the areas of ecological protection, rehabilitation and restoration of the five major ecological zones.

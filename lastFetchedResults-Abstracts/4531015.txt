This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to perform a multi-objective priority based routing and wavelength assignment for dynamic WDM optical networks (EA-MOPRWA). The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the number of accepted communication requests subjected to a limited number of wavelength channels. A novel approach is adopted which considers the relation between path type and traffic volume to resolve the priority of connection requests, and also incorporates the network state into routing/wavelength scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal can achieve a superior blocking performance and utilization of the optical network resources.

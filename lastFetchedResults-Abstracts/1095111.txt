The various cities in the table-land of Iran, considering their context and the natural and geographical conditions, benefited from the water resources in various ways. Among all these cities, Bukhara has owned one of the most advanced water systems which the physical remnant of its elements still role as one of the most important basis of urban landscape in the Bukhara old city.
The underlying objective of this essay is to independently recognize the various facets of the physical connection between the water system and the Bukhara city structure by deconstructing the structure of the city and its water system. Although, in the earlier times, the Bukhara water network adopted as the water system for irrigating the rabaz, but by expanding the city out of the sharestan it showed the complete interaction with the structure of the city. The main point that made the Bukhara water network different from the other cities in the table-land of Iran and maintained it as one of the most considerable elements of Bukhara urban landscape, is referred to the frame work that governed the existence of the water system in the city of Bukhara for over ten centuries. This framework considered in two domains; in visual and physical- spatial aesthetics rules in the components of the system and in their locating among the city, which caused the multilayered connection between the water system and the spatial, functional and activity structure of the Bukhara. This multilayered alliance between the water network and the spatial and functional structure of the city caused the implicit and unconscious rehabilitation of the water system during the restoration program of Bukhara old city, notably in the decades of 1990, considering its aesthetical common language in obtain the main role in the urban landscape of the city and common memories and perceptions of the citizens and the tourists, even though in the time only 8 hauze (among more than 100) remained and the restoration program only focused on the restoration of the monuments and important buildings.

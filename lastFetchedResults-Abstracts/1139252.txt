Economic interest in xylitol production can be enhanced if the needed xylose solutions can be obtained from the hydrolysis of low-cost lignocellulosic wastes. Sugar cane bagasse is a renewable, cheap and widely available waste in tropical countries. The hydrolysis of sugar cane bagasse to obtain xylose solutions has a double consequence, the elimination of a waste and the generation of a value-added product. The objective of this work was to study the xylose production from sugar cane bagasse by sulphuric acid hydrolysis at several temperatures (100, 122 and 128 °C) and concentrations of acid (2%, 4% and 6%). Kinetic models were developed to explain the variation with time of xylose, glucose, acetic acid and furfural generated in the hydrolysis. Optimal conditions found were 2% H2SO4 at 122 °C for 24 min, which yielded a solution with 21.6 g xylose/l, 3 g glucose/l, 0.5 g furfural/l and 3.65 g acetic acid/l. In these conditions, ≈90% of the hemicelluloses was hydrolysed.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether oral analgesia with oxycodone-acetaminophen or a patient-controlled analgesia device with morphine provides superior analgesia after cesarean delivery.
Study design
Ninety-three patients with scheduled cesarean delivery were assigned randomly to receive either oral analgesia with oxycodone-acetaminophen or a morphine patient-controlled analgesia device. At 6 and 24 hours after the procedure, pain was assessed on a visual analog pain scale of 0 to 10. Nausea, sedation, pruritus, ambulation, emesis, and oral fluid intake were also assessed.
Results
Patients who used oral analgesia without a patient-controlled analgesia device experienced less pain at 6 and 24 hours after cesarean delivery. They also had less nausea and drowsiness at 6 hours but slightly more nausea at 24 hours.
Conclusion
Oral analgesia with oxycodone-acetaminophen may offer superior pain control after cesarean delivery with fewer side-effects as compared with morphine patient-controlled analgesia. Consideration should be given to expanding the use of oral analgesia in patients immediately after cesarean delivery.

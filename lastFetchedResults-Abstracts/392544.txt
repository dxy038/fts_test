Objective: Papillary thyroid carcinomas often metastasize to regional lymph nodes, but the significance of lymph node metastasis as a prognostic factor has not been established. This study was conducted to determine the survival rate in patients with and without large lymph node metastasis greater than 3 cm in the maximum diameter, which are N2 or N3 for other head and neck cancers. Methods: The survival rate was determined by using Kaplanâ€“Meier method in 67 patients with previously untreated papillary thyroid carcinoma who underwent radical surgery at the Department of Otolaryngology, Toyooka Hospital, between 1993 and 2000. Results: The prognosis was significantly poor (P=0.004) in patients with large lymph node metastasis greater than 3 cm in the maximum diameter. No significant difference was noted in the prevalence of large lymph node metastasis greater than 3 cm in the maximum diameter between different T groups. Conclusion: Large lymph node metastasis was considered to be a poor prognostic factor of papillary thyroid carcinoma independent of the T classification.

This work studies the effects of the prefilter bandwidth in four sequential symbol synchronizers. We consider three prefilter bandwidths namely B1=&#8734;, B2=2.tx and B3=1.tx, where tx is the bit rate. The synchronizer has two variants one synchronous by both transitions at rate and other asynchronous by both transitions at rate. Each variant has two versions namely the manual and the automatic. The objective is to study the prefilter with the four synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

In authors programming course, students create animations as programming practice because this type of practice will make students interested in learning programming. This type of animation creation practice is well received by students. For the animation creation, we provide students with material such as fundamentals for creating basic animation, explanations of graphics functions, basic animation creation method, its application and its programming example in printed form (black and white). However, it is difficult for students to see the actual color or motion in printed material, because some of the animation is only shown on the screen and it is difficult for the students to actually reproduce the motion or examine the source codes by themselves. In order to overcome those problems, we have developed teaching material on the Web and actually used them in programming course. As a result it is clear that this material contributes to the increase in LOC, FP and the volume of animation created. In this paper, we give the general description of programming course, the objective of developing teaching material on the Web and guidelines for it, a general description of material, its effectiveness and problems we may see in the future.

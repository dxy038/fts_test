Improving the utilization of resources and service qualities, and reducing the system energy consumption are two important goals of dynamic virtual machine management in cloud computing. Nevertheless, the reduction of energy consumption is inconsistent with the improvement of resource utilization. In order to get the balance, a new multi-objective decision-making method of virtual machine placement based on gray correlation degree is proposed, three factors like the energy consumption, Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and server load are used as the evaluation indexes, and corresponding evaluation functions are biut for them, finally the multi-objective decision-making model of the virtual machine placement based on gray correlation degree is established. Evaluations via experiments show that the proposed method of virtual machine placement can achieve good results under most virtual machine selection policies.

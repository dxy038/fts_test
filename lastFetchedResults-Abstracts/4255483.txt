Using BergeronÂ´s method, two bidirectional pulse generators of external pulse injection type with energy transfer efficiency of 100% are analytically obtained. One of the generators was constructed and tested, and the principle of the pulse generator was confirmed. However, the pulse waveform obtained experimentally was far from ideal, that is, the rise time was too long and the flat-top was not constant. From simulation results, the cause was attributed to the inductance and resistance of the main trigatron switch. Therefore, to improve the pulse waveform, a laser-triggered switch was investigated. As a result, it is shown that the laser-triggered vacuum and/or gas filled switches are appropriate for operation in parallel and they have the potential to improve the output waveform.

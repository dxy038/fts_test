The fusion of artificial fish algorithm and genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the flight scheduling of two-runway in large airport in which the problems are difficult, inefficient and serious flight delays. First, in this paper, the shortcomings of artificial fish algorithm and genetic algorithm are analyzed, and combing the advantages of two algorithms, optimization algorithm is proposed based on the fusion of artificial fish swarm algorithm and genetic algorithm; Secondly, the objective function model of the total of time-consuming which is minimum about dual runway is established; Finally, the simulation results show that the fusion algorithm in operating efficiency, the reduction of flight delays and other aspects is better than first-come, first-served (FCFS), artificial fish algorithm and genetic algorithm, and can get better convergence results.

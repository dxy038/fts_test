A reasonable layout of the logistics distribution system can significantly reduce business operating costs and improve logistics system operating efficiency. The operation characteristics and physical resources of third-party logistics and distribution system focused in this article, the key parameters of the distribution system operation efficiently and stably get summarized. Through simulation and optimization method, a optimization model is built. To minimize customer churn rates and operating costs is taken as the optimization objective, meanwhile the system configuration parameters as decision-making variables. Ultimately a logistics company is taken as a research example to verify the scientific decision-making model and effectiveness.

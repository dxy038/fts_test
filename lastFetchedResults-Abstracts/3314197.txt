In the existing researches, switching users for load balancing often leads to aggressive handovers, which may take up plenty of resource in target cells, leading to higher Call Drop and Block Ratio (CDBR). In order to overcome this issue, our objective was to minimize the CDBR of the network and to achieve load balancing among neighboring cells. First we formulated the load balancing as an optimization problem and the objective was to minimize the CDBR of the network. Then a practical algorithm was proposed, which included handover conditions through analyzing the handover gain for switching users and call admission control. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in CDBR and system resources occupation.

This article presents objective and subjective testing results that assess the performance of the Quality-Oriented Adaptation Scheme (QOAS) when used for high quality multimedia streaming over local broadband IP networks. Results of objective tests using a QOAS simulation model show very efficient adaptation in terms of end-user perceived quality, loss rate, and bandwidth utilization, compared to existing adaptive streaming schemes such as LDA+, and TFRCP. Subjective tests confirm these results by showing high end-user perceived quality of the QOAS under various network conditions.

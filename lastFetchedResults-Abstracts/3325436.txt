In this paper, an optimal basic speed controller for switched reluctance motor (SRM) based on Elitist-Mutated Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (EM-MOPSO) with good accuracies, and performances is presented. The control mechanism is composed of a Proportion-Integration (PI) speed controller and a hysteresis current controller. Because of nonlinear characteristics of a SRM, EM-MOPSO is used to tune coefficients of PI speed controller, turn on and turn off angles along with maximum value of the phase current by applying a multi-objective function, including both Integrals Squared Error (ISE) of speed and torque ripple. This EM-MOPSO based controller simulated in SIMULINK/MATLAB software for a four phases, 4-kw SRM. The performances of the EM-MOPSO and PSO algorithm in tuning the controller parameters are compared with each other. Simulation results show that the EM-MOPSO based controller can better improve SRM performance such as torque ripple, dynamic response and copper losses.

This paper investigates that human tend to percept of humanness and individuality to what features of human motion. We analyze from experiments based on test subjects how recognize of individuality by comparing a developed own self motion with other motion made by motion capture using Kinect sensor. The results showed except for the subjects could not perform the movement extremely distinctive, many subjects to recognize the movement of their own. In addition, the respondents also recognized with a video camera an objective of its own motion, the subjects of some of their own and do not match the image of the inside of me. It is difficult to percept humanness based on less-accurate expression of human motion.

Simulation components are semantically composable if the newly composed model is meaningful in terms of expressed behaviors, and achieves the desired objective. The validation of semantic composability is challenging because reused simulation components are heterogeneous in nature and validation must consider various aspects including logical, temporal, and formal. In this paper, we propose a new time-based formal approach for semantic composability validation. Our validation process provides a formal composition validation guarantee by establishing the behavioral equivalence between the composed model and a perfect model. Next, composition behaviors are compared through time using semantically related composition states. We evaluate our formal approach using time complexity and experimental analysis using the CADP analyzer.

Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) can be increased after hormonal stimulations. The changes of CRP might affect the success of in-vitro fertilization (IVF).
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the possible relationship between the serum CRP level and outcome of controlled ovarian stimulation, and pregnancy rate in patients undergoing IVF or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
Materials and Methods: This prospective cross sectional study was performed in Avicenna Infertility Clinic on 70 consecutive infertile patients (Jan 2008-Aug 2009) who were candidate for IVF/ICSI, using standard long GnRH agonist protocol. Blood was drawn 4 times during the cycle, on first day of stimulation, the day of HCG injection, the day of ovum pick up, and the day of embryo transfer.
Results: In 82.2% of cases, the serum CRP level was higher in day of HCG injection than first day of stimulation and also the day of ovum pick up than the day of HCG injection. The ratio of CRP level in the day of transfer to the day of ovum pick up, was significantly higher (ratio ?1.23) in patients who became pregnant after ICSI (p =0001). All patients with less than this Ratio have not been pregnant.
Conclusion: Controlled ovarian hyper stimulation and puncture of ovaries can potentiate systemic stimulation. Increasing serum CRP level in day of embryo transfer rather than ovum pick up can predict the success in patients undergoing IVF/ICSI.

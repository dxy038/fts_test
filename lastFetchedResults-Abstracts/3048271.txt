This paper presents the lateral acceleration control design of non-linear missile model using the multiple single objective Pareto sampling method. The interpolated controller design for the uncertain plants is carried out by minimizing gain and phase margins, tracking and actuator rate limit frequency domain based performance objectives. An ad-hoc approach is taken to the controller interpolation. The controllerÂ´s trade-offs are analyzed using the obtained Pareto optimal solutions (corresponding to a given set of weight vectors). The non-linear simulation results show that the selected interpolated controller is a robust tracking controller for all perturbation vertices.

The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is widely used in wind energy. This paper proposes a model-based predictive controller for a power control of DFIG. The control law is derived by optimization of an objective function that considers the control effort and the difference between the predicted outputs (active and reactive power) and the references. The prediction was calculated using a linearized state-space model of DFIG. As the generator leakage inductance and resistance information were required for this control method, the influence of the estimation errors for these parameters was also investigated. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed controller.

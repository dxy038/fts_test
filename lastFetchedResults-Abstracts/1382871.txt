Two algorithms, the objective function method (OFM) and the eigenvector algorithm (EVA), of the inverse filter estimation are applied to extract the impulsive impacting signals. Both algorithms maximize the estimation of the cumulants with observed data only. The resolution of the reconstructed signals are improved from the observed (measured) signals. Therefore, the “clean” impacting signals can be compared to the known impacting phenomena to determine their origin. The performance of both algorithms are investigated and these appear to perform well.

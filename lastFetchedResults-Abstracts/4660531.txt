The paper presents an optimization model of daily generation scheduling for reducing unit regulating frequency and an improved multi-population genetic algorithm (IMPGA) for solving the model based on load curve segmentation. Generating units are categorized into four classes and incorporated into the objective function or constraints in terms of regulating requirements. Load points on the load curve are aggregated to form equivalent multiple-level load curve representation. The global optimization is reached with coordination between the multiple-level load model and multi-population strategy of GA. The effectiveness of the presented model and algorithm is demonstrated using the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus standard systems.

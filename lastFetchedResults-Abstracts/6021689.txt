There have issues of the subjectivity model and the hardly optimization decision due to the process of distribution design is still on qualitative analysis stage. The paper applies the life cycle cost management to establish a new model for the distribution design through analyzing the mapping relationship between the differences of different design scheme and the substation LCC. This model takes the unit cost of land as the sole variable and the LCC of substation which influenced by the design as objective function. Then it founds a LCC calculation model on distribution selection by fully considering the life match and analyzing by interval. Using a substation project combined with typical 220 kV substation project design scheme and comparing with the model based on the whole process cost management proves the new model scientific and practical. And the new model is of great significance to substation project design.

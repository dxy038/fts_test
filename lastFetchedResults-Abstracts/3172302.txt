In this paper, multi-objective control problem of uncertain continuous Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems is considered. Aiming at the uncertain continuous T-S fuzzy systems which have more generalized uncertainty structure, based on Lyapunov stability theory, the problems of regional pole assignment under passive performance constraint is studied. By solving a feasible problem of LMIs, sufficient conditions on the existence of state-feedback controllers which satisfy the multi-objective requirements are given. Furthermore, the specific forms of the controllers are given. The obtained controllers can guarantee that for all uncertainties, the poles of the closed system are in expectation region, and the closed system satisfies the given performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method can be shown by the simulation example.

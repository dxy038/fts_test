The objective of this contribution is to present some results of an evaluation on the local conditions at the site that were considered in order to propose that the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional, Tonantzintla, (OAN-Tonantzintla) become a National Facility for Astronomy Education. The evaluation included a quantitative diagnostic (CCD photometry) on the quality of the local sky. The attributes of the 1-m telescope, the current instrumentation and a well planned upgrading that includes new instrumentation is considered at the basis for a successful transition maintaining the attractiveness of the site for astronomy education. A 3-year upgrading program actually in progress at UNAM is providing funding for that purpose. Physics and astronomy programs at college and graduated levels at UNAM will benefit from this, yielding clear connections among astronomy researchers and educators and students at various levels. Although the OAN-Tonantzintla faces the danger of deteriorating its sky conditions, we are maintaining awareness of the night sky characteristics in long-term monitoring campaigns and encouraging the local authorities to find alternative solutions to this problem.

In order to design the congestion control scheme in the routers, an Active Queue Management (AQM) is proposed. This is used to control congestion at the router, where packets are dropped before queue becomes full. A new framework of AQM, namely NEWQUE with Per-flow Scheduling (PerNEWQUE) active queue management algorithm supporting explicit congestion notification (ECN), is proposed by extending scheduling nature in NEWQUE AQM. It is developed with the aim of strengthen the robustness of Internet against unresponsive flows. The objective of the new algorithm is to detect and penalize the unresponsive flows like UDP flows from responsive flows like TCP flows. The PerNEWQUE AQM is implemented with help of ns2 simulator. The simulation shows that the proposed design outperforms other AQM methods in terms of reducing throughput, link utilization and increasing percentage packet loss of unresponsive flows.

Todays, selecting effective and efficient project is of vital importance in any organization. In this respect, the project plays a critical role in organization's future more than any other factor and involves any parts of company, such as marketing, finance-, etc. The selection of projects and work programs are key functions of both public and private sector organizations. In addition, the accurate predictions of future cash flows are faced with difficulties. Various objectives are usually taken into account when projects are analyzed, including economic desirability, technical issues, and environmental, and social factors. As the decision maker tries to maximize or minimize outcomes associated with each objective depending on its nature, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem arises. Also, choosing a simple, comprehensive technique, which is simultaneously able to compare the ranking of alternatives and then be compared with the virtual alternative, make this complexity too compounded. In fact, adopting a simple technique which ranks the alternatives and compares them to a virtual alternative might be hard especially in fuzzy environment.
Then, in this research, the fuzziness of the investment is presented. Fuzzy rate of return analysis, fuzzy B/C ratio, fuzzy payback period techniques and fuzzy project risk-performed in this article- are fuzzy investment analysis techniques. 
Two scales including eleven points and five ones of linguistic descriptions use to convert fuzzy numbers into crisp ones and then by applying them, 10 assumed projects rank.
Thus, Fuzzy Moora used in this research has several advantages. First and foremost, this method can rate 10 projects with interval characteristic and linguistic scale. Needless to say, it can also determine the relative distance from the ideal (the positive point) and anti-ideal alternative (the negative point).

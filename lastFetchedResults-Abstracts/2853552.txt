In order to reduce the great number of parking incidences and other collisions in low speed scenarios, an obstacle avoidance algorithm is proposed. Since collision avoidance can be achieved by sole braking when driving slowly this algorithm´s objective is a comfort orientated braking routine. Therefore, an optimization problem is formulated leading to jerk and time optimal trajectories for braking. In addition to that, based on the prediction of the future vehicle motion, this algorithm compensates for a significant actuator time delay. Using an occupancy grid for representing the static vehicle environment and the current driving state, possible collision points are determined not only for the vehicle front or rear, but also for both vehicle sides, where no sensors are located. The algorithm´s performance is demonstrated in a real-world scenario.

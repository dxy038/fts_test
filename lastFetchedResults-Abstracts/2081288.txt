Objective
m of this study was to investigate the manufacture and characterisation of different compositions of fluorcanasite glass–ceramics with reduced fluorine content and to assess their mechanical and physical properties.
s
compositional variations (S80, S81 and S82) of a fluorcanasite glass were investigated. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified crystallisation temperatures and phases. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) determined the element composition in the glass–ceramics. Different heat treatments [2 h nucleation and either 2 or 4 h crystallisation] were used for the glasses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examined the microstructure of the cerammed glass. The chemical solubility, biaxial flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness and brittleness index of S81 and S82 fluorcanasite were investigated with lithium disilicate (e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) as a commercial comparison. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison tests (P &lt; 0.05). Weibull analysis was employed to examine the reliability of the strength data.
s
mpositions successfully produced glasses. XRD analysis confirmed fluorcanasite formation with the S81 and S82 compositions, with the S82 (2 + 2 h) showing the most prominent crystal structure. The chemical solubility of the glass–ceramics was significantly different, varying from 2565 ± 507 μg/cm2 for the S81 (2 + 2 h) to 722 ± 177 μg/cm2 for the S82 (2 + 2 h) to 37.4 ± 25.2 μg/cm2 for the lithium disilicate. BFS values were highest for the S82 (2 + 2 h) composition (250 ± 26 MPa) and lithium disilicate (266 ± 37 MPa) glass–ceramics. The fracture toughness was higher for the S82 compositions, with the S82 (2 + 2 h) attaining the highest value of 4.2 ± 0.3 MPa m1/2(P = 0.01). The S82 (2 + 2 h) fluorcanasite glass–ceramic had the lowest brittleness index.
sion
2 (2 + 2 h) fluorcanasite glass–ceramic has acceptable chemical solubility, high biaxial flexural strength, fracture toughness and hardness.
al significance
l glass–ceramic has been developed with potential as a restorative material. The S82 (2 + 2 h) has mechanical and physical properties that would allow the glass–ceramic to be used as a machinable core material for veneered resin-bonded ceramic restorations.

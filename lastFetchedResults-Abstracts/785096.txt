Objective: the aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of central obesity to inflammatory
responses in the postprandial state in elderly patients with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Material/Methods: We evaluated 80 elderly individuals who were distributed into three groups: MetS, abdominal
obesity (abobes) and Control, according to atPiii criteria. interleukin-6 (il-6) serum concentration was
measured at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours after the ingestion of a physiological meal without an overload of fat. Results:
Serum il-6 increased 6 hours after the meal in all of the groups (P<0.001). Comparing the groups, there was no
difference in the area under the curve (aUC) of il-6 in the postprandial state. there was a correlation between
the 6-hour changes in the concentrations of il-6 and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HoMa-ir) (r = 0.25, P<0.05). Conclusion: in this study, differences in abdominal circumference (aC) have not
determined a different behavior of il-6 in the postprandial state, despite the correlation between aC and il-6.
However, we found that, in the elderly, there is a rise in serum il-6 at 6 hours.

Background and Objective: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR), in comparison with the other nonionizing radiations is more energetic and could produce some biological effects. WHO has reported some of UV effects such as skin cancer and cataract. As a result, the integral observation of UV levels and their effects at ground level is important to assess present and future environmental and health implications of atmospheric UV radiation. Since the amount of UVR has not previously been measured in Khuzestan, the aim of the present study was to measure the amount in Ahvaz area in different months of the year and allocate the maximum UVR during day time. Materials and Methods: In this research, daily quantity of solar UVR were measured in Ahvaz during one year 2007-2008 using a Hand-held Lux-uv-Ir-meter. Three measurements in each day: at noon, and 2 hours before and 2 hours after noon.

Results: Averaging the UVR measurements for each month showed that the maximum and the minimum amount of UVR were in Khordad (June-July) and Azar (January-February) respectively. Comparison of UVR measurements during a single day showed that the maximum was at noon hours.

Conclusion: Although UV radiation levels are influenced by geographical and climate situations and therefore any comparison between the results of UV measurements at different areas of the world is inappropriate. However, it is possible to compare the average of the measured data in this study with those from the relatively near areas. According to the results the amount of solar UV is highest in summer time, it is recommended to wear appropriate sunglasses and limit time of exposure in the midday sunshine during this period.

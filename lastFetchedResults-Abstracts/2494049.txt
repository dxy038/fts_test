Objective(s): Progestrone is a prequisite for pre-implantation angiogenesis and induce decidual angiogenesis. It is unknown the effect of progestrone administration on the endometrium of hyperstimulated mice at pre-implantation time. Material and Methods: Adult female NMRI mice were divided in three groups [control group, ovarian stimulated group and progestrone treated mice after ovarian stimulation]. Uterine horn samples removed at pre-implantation time in each group. Motic image Plus 2 software was used to assess the quantitative vascular parameters of endometrium. Gene expression was determined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT) and Kinase insert domain protein receptor (FLK)genes using the real time PCR method. Data analysis was done with LinReg PCR and Rest-RG software. Results: Comparison between progestrone treated mice after ovarian stimulation with control group showed that increase in rate of VEGF gene expression [0.775] and decrease in rate of FLK [6.072] and FLT [1.711] gene expression. Analysis of the data on quantitative vascular parameters were indicated remarkable increase in quantitative vascular parameters of progestrone treated mice compare to control group. Conclusion: Biological effect of progestrone on the vascular changes after ovarian stimulation resulted in an increase in VEGF receptors experession, it seems that induced angiogenesis by progesterone could result in better condition for implantation.

Objective
The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of peroral encapsulated Bifidobacteria on intestinal microflora, bacterial translocation (BT), plasma endotoxin, and ileal villi injury in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock.
Methods

Sprague-Dawley rats were fed daily with three different diet supplements: phosphate buffered saline, Bifidobacteria (109 colon-forming units/day), or microencapsulated Bifidobacteria (109 colony-forming units/day). After 7 d of treatment, rats were anesthetized for hemorrhagic or sham shock. Then a laparotomy was performed to determine microbiological analysis of cecal content, BT to mesenteric lymph nodes, plasma endotoxin, and terminal ileal villous damage.
Results

In the hemorrhagic-shock model, rats pretreated with Bifidobacteria showed decreases in total aerobes in cecum, magnitude of total aerobes to BT, levels of plasma endotoxin, and percentage of ileal villous damage when compared with rats treated with phosphate buffered saline. Encapsulated Bifidobacteria induced greater decreases than intact Bifidobacteria in this model, except for no difference in percentage of ileal villous damage between the two groups. In addition, the incidence of BT was decreased in hemorrhagic rats pretreated with Bifidobacteria compared with control. However, the magnitude of total anaerobes and Bifidobacteria BT were similar among hemorrhagic-shocked rats receiving three different supplements.
Conclusion

Bifidobacteria can be useful in preventing BT in hemorrhagic-shocked rats, and encapsulated Bifidobacteria can augment this effect further. Peroral administration of Bifidobacteria may be a favorable strategy to prevent sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in hemorrhagic shock.

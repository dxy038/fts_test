Component-based software development was new to the local software industry in Hiroshima, Japan. For the development of the local industry, we proposed that the city government and some local companies should experiment with the new technology in real industrial settings. The goal of the project was to transfer the component-based software technology from academia to local industry to see if it could significantly improve software productivity and quality. The primary objective was to learn about component-based software development in industry. The secondary objective was to assess the benefits of the new technology in applying it to the development of typical industrial applications. The method of study we used was experimentation. This means that software engineers from the local software industry redeveloped several existing and new applications using the proposed technology, although the process to be applied was unknown

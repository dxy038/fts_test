Background and Objective: Visfatin is a secreted protein from visceral adipose tissue that has been linked to obesity and associated with health risk factors. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 8 weeks of interval endurance rope training on plasma visfatin and insulin resistance in overweight non-athletic adolescents.
Materials and Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 36 healthy overweight and obese male adolescents were randomly assigned to experimental (n=18) and control (n=18) groups. The experimental group underwent 8 weeks of interval endurance rope training (45 min/d, 4 d/wk). Blood samples were taken before and after the completion of exercise training to assess levels of visfatin, insulin resistance and lipid profiles. Independent T-test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to analysis the data. 
Results: The results showed that 8 weeks of interval endurance rope training decreased the plasma visfatin, body fat percent, BMI, insulin resistance, waist circumference and triglycerides levels in in the experimental group (P < 0.05). Also, there was a significant and positive relationship between visfatin, body fat percent and plasma triglyceride levels (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 8 weeks of interval endurance rope training with decreased triglyceride, insulin resistance and obesity induced a significant reduction of plasma visfatin in overweight and obese adolescents.

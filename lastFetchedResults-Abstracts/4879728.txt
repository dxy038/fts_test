This paper considers a packet scheduling algorithm using two different priority metrics specified for each service to support integrated services of real-time (RT) and non-realtime (NRT) applications. In particular, as a packet scheduling algorithm for NRT service, this paper proposes a new minimum guaranteed throughput scheduling (MGBRS) algorithm with two priority metrics based on average throughput and the minimum guaranteed throughput requirement and its design objective is to increase the number of NRT service users satisfying the required minimum guaranteed throughput. For the performance evaluation of the proposed MGBRS scheme in a wireless communication system, this paper adopts a transmission structure of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a significant improvement in terms of increase of the number of NRT service users satisfying the target outage probability and the per-cell total throughput performance by the number of NRT service users meeting the target outage probability is improved.

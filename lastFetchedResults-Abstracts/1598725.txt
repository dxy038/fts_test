In the event of an accident occurring in a nuclear power plant (NPP), being able to predict the amount of released radioactive substances in the environment is of prime importance. Depending on the severity of the accident, it can be necessary to quickly and efficiently protect the population and the surrounding environment from the associated radiological consequences. In France, the IRSN Emergency Technical Centre provides a technical support in decision making in case of a nuclear accident. The main objectives are to evaluate and predict the plant behaviour and radioactive releases during the accident. Different types of complementary tools are used: expert assessments, pre-calculated databases, simulation tools, etc.

 case of Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR) accidents that may lead to significant radioactive releases to the atmosphere through the steam generator relief valves, IRSN is currently improving the simulation tools for diagnosis in crisis management. The objective is to adapt the thermal-hydraulic and FP behaviour modules of the severe accident integral code ASTEC V2.0, jointly developed by IRSN and its German counterpart GRS, to crisis management requirements. These requirements impose a fast running, highly reliable (accurate physical results), flexible and simple tool.

aper summarizes the results of the benchmarks between the ASTEC V2.0 thermal-hydraulic module and the CATHARE 2 (V2.5) French reference thermal-hydraulics code on several SGTR scenarios both for PWR 900 and 1300 MWe, with a particular emphasis on the computational time and physical models assessment. The overall agreement between both codes is good on the primary and secondary circuit thermal-hydraulic parameters. Moreover, the reliability and fast computational time of the thermal-hydraulic module of ASTEC V2.0 code appeared very satisfactory and in accordance with the requirements of an emergency tool.

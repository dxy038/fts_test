In this paper, the base station placement is automatically determined using genetic approach, and the transmit power is estimated considering the interference situation in the case of interference-dominant systems. For applying a genetic algorithm to the base station placement problem, a new representation scheme with real numbers is proposed. And, corresponding operators such as crossover and mutation are introduced. A weighted objective function is designed for performing the cell planning coverage, cost-effectively. To verify the proposed algorithm, the situation where the optimum positions and number of base stations are obvious is considered. The proposed algorithm is applied to an inhomogeneous traffic density environment, where a base stationÂ´s coverage may be limited by offered traffic loads. Simulation result proves that the algorithm enables us to find near optimal base station placement and the efficient number of base stations.

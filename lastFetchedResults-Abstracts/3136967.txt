For the speed control of film winding system, the pseudo-derivative feedback (PDF) controller is first selected. Controller parameters tuning then becomes a nonlinear constrained optimization problem with nonlinearity and load variations of film winding system. To avoid the selection of penalty parameters in constraint handling, NSGA-II is utilized by converting the nonlinear constrained optimization problem into bi-objective optimization problem. Simulation results show the optimized controller has strong robustness and quick step responses without overshoot and oscillation.

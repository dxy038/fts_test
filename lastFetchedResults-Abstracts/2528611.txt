While considerable recognition regarding the importance of warehousing has been 
generated throughout the last few decades, the published literature does not give a clear
insight towards the elements of warehousing and its interconnection to the warehouse
efficiency. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of ergonomic warehouse
designing to increase efficiency. And to achieve the objective, the current published
literature related to warehouse designing have been reviewed and the potential issues to be
addressed and factors to be considered have been analysed and recommendations have
been made to ensure that the significance of the designing phase is being understood by all
stakeholders.

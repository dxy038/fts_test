Wireless Sensor Networks comprise of very small sensors that are characterized by limited processing power and energy resources. WSNs are used in various domains such as military applications, medical engineering, and industrial task automation. It is very important to have an optimal network in order to use its processing power at maximum. This paper proposes and analyzes the efficiency of a hierarchical routing protocol designed to extend the life of the network by minimizing energy consumption and latency by choosing the best nodes to become cluster-heads. Minimization is realized with a multi-objective genetic algorithm executed on a central BS and the results send to the network nodes. Simulation is done in NS-2 where there is already an implementation of Leach protocol with whose results we compare.

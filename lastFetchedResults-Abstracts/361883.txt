Study Objective: We sought to evaluate the efficacy of eye patching in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions in terms of time to healing and reduction in pain and discomfort. Methods: One hundred sixty-three patients presenting at the emergency department of a large university-affiliated hospital with traumatic corneal abrasions were included in this single-blind prospective controlled trial. Eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment regimens: topical antibiotic ointment and occlusive patch over the affected eye (n=82) or topical antibiotic ointment 4 times a day without an occlusive patch (n=81). Patients were reexamined every 24 hours until corneal healing occurred. Healing evaluation was performed by the emergency physician, using a slit lamp with fluorescein staining, without knowledge of the patientâ€™s assignment to a treatment group. The degree of discomfort was assessed at each visit by using a visual analog scale. Results: Both treatment groups were similar regarding size of the corneal lesions, delay from trauma to first ED visit, presence of foreign body or siderosis, initial degree of discomfort, and presence of specific symptoms (irritation, foreign body sensation, photophobia, redness, and pain). In the patched group, cumulative incidences of healing were 51%, 78%, and 92% after 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, compared with 60%, 83%, and 88% in the nonpatched group. In the patched group, symptoms of initial discomfort decreased by 4.8, 4.1, and 5.5 cm after 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, compared with 3.3, 5.1, and 6.5 cm in the nonpatched group. Conclusion: Eye patching does not appear to be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions compared with topical antibiotic ointment. [Le Sage N, Verreault R, Rochette L.

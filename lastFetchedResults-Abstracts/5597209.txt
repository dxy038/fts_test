This work study the PLL (Phase Lock Loop) applied to systems of carrier frequency and data symbols. In each system, we consider four PLL types, namely the analog, hybrid, combinational and sequential.In the synchronizers for carrier frequency, the four PLL (Pll-cf) synchronizes directly with the input carrier.In the synchronizers for data symbols, the four PLL (f+Pll-ds) synchronizes with the data fundamental harmonic, selected by a previous tuning filter.The objective is to study the various synchronizers and evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).

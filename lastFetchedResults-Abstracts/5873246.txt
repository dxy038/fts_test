A new ZVS-ZCS bidirectional flyback DC-DC converter is proposed, which provides low output voltages 24V-60V. With proposed ZVS-ZCS concept, the MATLAB simulation results of the applications to a battery application have been obtained and compared with those of ZCS flyback bidirectional converter. In addition to this an experimental setup has been developed. Experimental results are compared with simulation results.

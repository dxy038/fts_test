BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Assa-Foetida L is traditionally used in treatment of different diseases including asthma, roundworm, stomach reflex, flu and nervous disease. Although some studies have done on Assa-Foetida properties, but little studies have been done on its cellular and molecular effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of polyphenols in Assa-Foetida L and its toxicity effect on C2C12  as a cell model of glucose consumer.
METHODS: At first, hydroalcoholic extract of Assa-Foetida L was prepared. The polyphenols of Assa-Foetida was determined using gallic acid as a standard by Folin–Ciocalteu’s method. The toxicity of the herbal on C2C12 cells was evaluated using Tripan blue at concentration of 50-2500µg/µl for 3 hours.
FINDINGS: Hydroalcoholic extract of Assa-Foetida L contain polyphenol contents. Absorbance of Assa-Foetida L increases linearly with gallic acid absorbance (R2=0.9989 vs R2=9986). Different concentrations of Assa-Foetida L extract showed that its hydro-alcoholic extract up to 200 µg/µl concentration had no toxicity effect on C2C12 and the cells were stable in treated culture of Assa Foetida after 3 hours. There was no significant difference in viability rate of cells between treated and control groups.  
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that Assa-Foetida L extract up to 200 µg/µl concentrations had no toxicity effect on these cells after 3 hours.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore how women recognize and respond to symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Framework: The Common Sense Model by Leventhal provided the theoretic framework for the study. Design: A descriptive qualitative design was used. Sample: The study sample included 21 women enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Findings: The causes and consequences of COPD were these women's most prominent representations. They struggled not only with dyspnea and fatigue, but with depression, loss of social support and intimacy, and stigma. Breathing techniques, medication, rest, and avoidance measures were the most frequently used coping strategies. Practice Implications: Because dyspnea is the central symptom, nurses must continue to teach methods to control it, as well as to search for new interventions to relieve the symptoms. Optimal levels of rest and the effect on outcomes deserve close attention. Devising ways to deal with social and psychologic isolation would also enhance coping with COPD.

The objective was to compare the prediction of bone mechanical properties provided by axial transmission to that provided by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at the distal radius. The distal radius is the location for Collesâ€™ fractures, a common osteoporosis related trauma situation. Measurements of the radial speed of sound were performed using three axial transmission devices: a commercial device (Sunlight Omnisense, 1.25 MHz), a bi-directional axial transmission prototype (1 MHz), both measuring the velocity of the first arriving signal (FAS), and a low frequency (200 kHz) device, measuring the velocity of a slower wave. Co-localized pQCT measurements of bone mineral density and cortical thickness were performed. Ultrasound and pQCT parameters were compared to mechanical parameters such as failure load and Young's modulus, obtained using quasistatic compressive mechanical testing and finite elements modelling (FEM).

ations of the ultrasound and pQCT parameters to mechanical parameters were comparable. The best predictor of failure load was the pQCT measured cortical thickness. The best predictor of Young's modulus was the bi-directional SOS. The low frequency device significantly correlated to cortical thickness and failure load.

sults suggest that different axial transmission approaches give access to different bone mechanical parameters. The association of different axial transmission techniques should be able to provide a good prediction of bone mechanical parameters, and should therefore be helpful for fracture risk prediction.

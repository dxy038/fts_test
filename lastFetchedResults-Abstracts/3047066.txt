The objective of This work is to present a polynomial model of Flash memory cell suitable for silicon diagnosis purpose. This model allows a fast study of the geometric parameters of a flash memory cell. The failing geometric parameter is diagnosed taking as input the threshold voltages of the cell extracted during the parametric test and in plotting failure scenario using our high level model.

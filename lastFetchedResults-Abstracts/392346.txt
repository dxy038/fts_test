The questionnaire is constructed of physical, social, communicational and psychological states. It was administered to 60 subjects >65 years of age (mean age: 79 years) living in nursing homes, with hearing threshold levels in the better ear ranging from normal to severe and their response were analyzed. Results: Chronbach's Î±-values of the questionnaire obtained ranged from 0.66 to 0.91 and was 0.84 overall. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire as well as its brevity, simplicity, ease of administration and interpretation, all satisfied its use in assessing the QOL of the elderly in nursing homes.

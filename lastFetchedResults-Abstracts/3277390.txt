A single phase rectification technique with a new architecture and control scheme is proposed. The new circuit is constructed by connecting a single bidirectional switch and capacitor in parallel to the diode bridge rectifier. The control strategy is carefully designed to maintain a high input power factor, provide a reduction in the size of the DC side capacitor and reduce the line current harmonics compared with the conventional rectifier. Circuit configuration, design parameters, principles of operation and the mathematical analysis are presented. The AC side harmonics analysis is done using WoodwardÂ´s notation which applies to chopped waveforms. The proposed concept is verified by the experimental results of a case study.

For pt. I see ibid., vol. 43, pp. 385-92 (1996). This work describes a fundamental investigation into a new series of transducer array structures intended for those applications where surface conformity is desirable. The first objective is to consider which material combinations will offer flexibility, while at the same time maximize the electromechanical efficiency for operating into solid load media. The theoretical approach of Part I is employed to compare and assess different array structures for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) imaging applications. The array structures under consideration include multielement piezocomposite and piezopolymer arrays, and hybrid devices comprising piezocomposite transmitters with piezopolymer receivers. Experimental data are provided for a novel array configuration, comprising a separate piezocomposite transmitter coupled to a piezopolymer receiver. Good agreement is demonstrated between experimental and theoretical results.

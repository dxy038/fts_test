For large scale wireless sensor networks, it is a fundamental challenge to extend the lifetime when the energy supply is limited. In this paper, we proposed a random-based wireless sensor network model which composed of sensor nodes and relay nodes as region heads upgraded from sensor nodes. In order to maximize the network lifetime, we present this optimal placement of relay nodes problem with a spin-glass model of minimal upgrading set of wireless sensor network with random-graph topology. By introducing the concept of interactive core, we study the statistical approach to estimate the solutions of the objective problem such that the maximal network lifetime can be achieved. As a further study of this model, we propose, from the theoretical point of view, a scheme to determine the key relay nodes while the minimum number of relay nodes has been determined by the first step. Our results show that the strategy to deal with the maximum lifetime problem of two-tied network model for large scale case from statistical physics can be help to design more efficient wireless sensor networks with random located sensors.

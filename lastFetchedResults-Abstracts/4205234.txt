In the present paper, a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time delays is studied. Without strict conditions imposed on self regulation functions, some new sufficient conditions for the existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique equilibrium are established. It is believed that these results are significant and useful for the design and applications of BAM-type biological and artificial neural networks.

The vector evaluated particle swarm optimization (VEPSO) algorithm is a multi-swarm variation of the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) used to solve static multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs). Recently, the dynamic VEPSO (DVEPSO) algorithm was proposed as an extension to VEPSO enabling the algorithm to handle dynamic MOOPs (DMOOPs). While DVEPSO has been successful at handling DMOOPs, the change detection mechanism relied on observing changes in objective space. An alternative strategy is proposed by using charged PSO (CPSO) sub-swarms with decision space change detection to address the outdated memory issue observed in vanilla PSO. This dynamic PSO variant allows for (implicit) decision space tracking not seen in DVEPSO while implicitly handling the diversity issue seen in dynamic environments. The proposed charged VEPSO is compared to DVEPSO on a wide variety of dynamic environment types. Results indicated that, in general, the proposed charged VEPSO outperformed the existing DVEPSO. Further, charged VEPSO exhibited better front-tracking abilities, while DVEPSO was superior with regards to locating the Pareto front.

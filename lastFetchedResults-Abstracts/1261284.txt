Objective To examine vocal attack time (VAT) values associated with the production of low, mid, and high rates of vocal fold vibration in normal speakers. Study Design Sound pressure (SP) and electroglottographic (EGG) recordings were obtained for eight female and five male subjects while producing multiple tokens of the sustained vowels /ة‘/, /i/, and /u/ at comfortable loudness and at mid, low (âˆ’3 semitones), and high (+6 semitones) rates of vocal fold vibration. Methods Generalized sinusoidal models of the SP and EGG signals were computed to compare rates of amplitude change. VAT was computed from the time lag of the cross-correlation function. Results Adjusted mean VAT for the high frequency condition was smaller than the adjusted mean VAT values for the low- and mid-frequency conditions. There was no significant difference between the mid and low frequency conditions. Conclusions Findings reveal an association of the VAT measure with increases in vocal fold tension associated with the production of high rates of vocal fold vibration.

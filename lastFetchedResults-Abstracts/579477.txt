The main objective of this study was to determine the interactive effects of dietary selenium and fat on fatty acid compositions of rainbow trout tissues. We formulated six experimental diets by addition of two fat levels (15 and 30%) and three selenium levels (0.1, 0.15 and 0.2mg/kg) to a basal diet, according to a 3x2 factorial design. Juvenile rainbow trout with initial weights of 6.99g were assigned to 18 tanks with 300L capacity each containing 25 fish, with three replicates for each diet. The result showed that unsaturated fatty acid and tissue oxidation rate increased with an increase in fat content of the diets. Addition of dietary selenium increased enzyme of Glutathione (GSH-Px) activity and at high-fat diet (30% fat), selenium addition improved polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions by depression of oxidation rate. However, inclusion of high dose of selenium (0.2mg/kg) had a negative impact on the Arachidonic and Eicosapentaenoic acids. In conclusion, dietary selenium supplementation can preserve fatty acid quality by controlling fatty acid oxidation at high-fat diet.  The results obtained from the current study suggest that rainbow trout at high-fat diet requires 0.15mg/kg selenium to reduce oxidation level.

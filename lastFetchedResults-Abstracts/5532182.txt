The topology control is a very important issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Many approaches have been proposed to carry out in this aspect, including modern heuristic approach. In this paper, the Topology Control based on Artificial Immune Algorithm (ToCAIA) is proposed to solute the energy-aware topology control for WSNs. ToCAIA is a heuristic algorithm, which is heuristic from the immune system of human. In ToCAIA, the antibody is the solution of the problem, and the antigen is the problem. ToCAIA could be used to solve the multi-objective minimum energy network connectivity (MENC) problem, and get the approximate solution. The experiment result shows that the topology control by using ToCAIA can be utilized for WSNs network optimization purposes.

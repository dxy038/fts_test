This paper is concerned with the problem of determining the position of a mobile vehicle during navigation. In order to achieve this objective a multisensor navigation system for self location of the robot has been developed. By tracking a few known landmarks with a vision module, the system is able to monitor continuously its position and to integrate these estimates with the measures provided by the vehicle odometers. This paper describes in detail the vision module used by the navigation system

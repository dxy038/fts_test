Nighttime imagery poses significant challenges to its enhancement due to loss of color information and limitation of single sensor to capture complete visual information at night. To cope with this challenge, multiple sensors are used to capture reliable nighttime imagery which presents additional demands for reliable visual information fusion. In this paper, we present a system, Scarf, which proposes reliable image fusion using advanced feature extraction techniques and a novel semi-automatic colorization based on optimization conformal to human visual system. Subjective and objective quality evaluation proves the effectiveness of proposed system.

A new approach to multi-rate sensor measurement feedback is described based on the stochastic, digital output feedback regulator problem. The objective is to find the constant gain feedback control system which feeds back sensor measurements at different rates and minimizes a discrete quadratic cost function. An iterative algorithm which can be used to compute the optimal multi-rate output feedback gain is presented.

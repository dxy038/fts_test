Although solutions of transient water flow can be obtained by numerical
modeling, their application may be limited in part as root water uptake is generally
considered to be one-dimensional only. The objective of this study was to evaluate
the accuracy of two-dimensional root water uptake model by Hydrus-2D in the
Lysimeter. The root water uptake model was incorporated into a two- dimensional
flow model and parameters of governing equation were optimized based on
minimizing the residuals between measured and simulated water content data.
Water content was measured at different points and layers. To calibrate the flow, a
genetic algorithm was used. With the optimized parameters of model, simulated
and measured water contents during the 30 days period were in excellent
agreement. Based on results, R2 values generally ranged between 0.92 and 0.94 and
a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0236 m3m -3. In this Paper effect of soil
hydraulic properties on Hydrus simulation was evaluated by several predictions of
neural network. Finally, results illustrate that Hydrus-2D is extremely flexible in
simulation of soil water content pattern.

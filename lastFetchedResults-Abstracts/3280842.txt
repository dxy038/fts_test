This paper proposes amplify-and-forward (AF) relay matrices for a one-source-one-destination pair and cooperative distributed N relay nodes under three adverse wireless relay communication environments: (1) broadband noise jamming (BNJ), (2) node geometry (NG), and (3) channel uncertainty (CU). The main objective of this paper is to analytically derive the minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based optimal relay amplifying matrix. Another objective of this paper is to analyze the MMSE cost function, relay power usage, and signal component power of the received signal at the destination using the derived optimal relay amplifying matrix. Finally, the impacts on these three wireless communication environments for the wireless relay networks will be observed by presenting bit error rate (BER) performance.

While a great number of battery balancing circuit topologies have been proposed, the unique control objective typically pursued is equalization of single cell charge. However, a balancing circuit could offer potentially more control features, especially with topologies able to provide bidirectional power flow control. This has not been explored yet in literature or at least not with enough thoroughness. Thus, in addition to charge balancing, up to three more objectives could be pursued simultaneously. Firstly, virtual resistance control, in order to provide dynamic compensation for variations in terminal cell voltage. Secondly, thermal management, to achieve a more uniform temperature distribution within a battery pack. Third, on-board diagnosis or fault detection tools, e.g. to perform characterization tests or to identify and even isolate problematic cells. In this paper, this issue is discussed and evaluated for a battery pack made up of 48 large format Li-Ion cells in series in a e-mobility application. Simulation results demonstrate the technical feasibility of this newly defined concept.

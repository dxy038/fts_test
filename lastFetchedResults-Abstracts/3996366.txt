We consider in this paper first-order hybrid Petri nets, a model that consists of continuous places holding fluid, discrete places containing a nonnegative integer number of tokens, and transitions, either discrete or continuous. We set up a linear algebraic formalism to study the first-order continuous behavior of this model and show how its control can be framed as a conflict resolution policy that aims at optimizing a given objective function. The use of linear algebra leads to sensitivity analysis that allows one to study of how changes in the structure of the model influence the optimal behavior. As an example of application, we show how the proposed formalism can be applied to flexible manufacturing systems with arbitrary layout and different classes of products

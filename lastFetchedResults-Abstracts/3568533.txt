There are several experiences proving a linear relationship between information content of signs or events and reaction or perception time of the human operator (fig. l,2). As information is a function of probability there must be a convergence, called informational accomodation, of subjective to objective information if the (subjective) probability approaches the (objective) frequency. The speed of this process is correlated with intelligence, measured by success at school (average grades). The information of a sign or event multiplied by its frequency is called its striking value <img src="/images/tex/4552.gif" alt="A_i"/> . It is shown, that the estimations <img src="/images/tex/4553.gif" alt="s_i"/> of frequencies equal the relative striking values <img src="/images/tex/4554.gif" alt="a_i"/> , even beyond <img src="/images/tex/4555.gif" alt="h = 1/e \\approx"/> 37% if <img src="/images/tex/4556.gif" alt="Ss"/> are not too aged, intelligent or experienced in giving estimates (fig.3). Other experiences show the influence of the <img src="/images/tex/4554.gif" alt="a_i"/> even during the process of informational accommodation (fig.4,5).

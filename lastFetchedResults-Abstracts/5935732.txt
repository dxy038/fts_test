We propose a discriminative method for combining heterogeneous sets of features for the continuous hidden Markov model classifier. We use a model level fusion approach and apply it to the problem of landmine detection using ground penetrating radar (GPR). We hypothesize that each signature (mine or non-mine) can be characterized better by multiple synchronous sequences that can capture different and complementary features. Our work is motivated by the fact that mines and clutter objects can have different characteristics depending on the mine type, soil and weather conditions, and burial depth. Thus, different sets of specialized feature extraction mechanisms, may be needed to achieve high detection and low false alarm rates. In order to fuse the different modalities, a multi-stream continuous HMM that includes a stream relevance weighting component is developed. In particular, we modify the probability density function that characterizes the standard continuous HMM to include state and component dependent stream relevance weights. We generalize the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) objective function to include stream relevance weights and derive the necessary conditions to update all model parameters simultaneously. Results on a large collection of GPR alarms show that the proposed model level fusion outperforms the baseline HMM when each feature is used independently and when both features are combined with equal weights.

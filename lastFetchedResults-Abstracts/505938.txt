Solid handling by air inside pipeline is called pneumatic conveying. In solid handling the velocity of air is the vital parameter. In this project dilute phase with air velocity of about 10 m/s was used. Powder materials were injected to the pipeline from a bin by a rotary valve and were classified by cyclone. Classifiers depending on their design, operational parameters such as air velocity and powder properties can separate a vast range of powders with respect to their size. After injecting to the pipe, materials are fed to the gravity settling chamber. In this project the objective was to separate powder particles larger than 74 Âµm. The experiments were carried out for talc and kaolin and the effect of parameters on separation efficiency were investigated.

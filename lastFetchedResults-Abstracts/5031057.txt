In the present scenario, it is very much inevitable to protect the human force with high level of intelligent gadgets that could ensure peace and harmony from fatal and collateral damages happening day-to-day. This paper attempts to ensure one such measure towards reinforcing peace and security through smart and intelligent technologies. The main objective of this initiative is to avoid the human loss of life and also other collateral damages caused by explosions. Here, Explosion is referred as bomb explosion. The secured locations are interconnected in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with special sensors so that every single movement is observed and classified. The result of this will lead to trigger subsequent alarming signals to contact the control room and deploy intelligent robots to diffuse or confiscate the explosive materials from the carriers. This idea may be possible for implementation with technical feasibilities and availability of the devices which need to be conformed to the expected standards.

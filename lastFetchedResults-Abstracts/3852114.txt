Since a prime objective of static power converter design is to minimize weight, optimizing magnetic components is particularly important. This paper derives the fundamental relationship between magnetic device weight and the basic design parameters. These include volt-ampere rating and frequency, characteristics of core and conductor materials, and ratios defining physical dimensions. Also, an expression for estimating heat rejection is obtained; thus, the practicality of a given design can easily be determined.

In this paper we proposed and developed the model for receiver-initiated tree construction protocol (R-IWDM) with quality of services (QoS) using discrete event simulator. Our protocol is based on generalized multiprotocol label switching or GMPLS. For our model, signaling model and data distribution model adapted R-IWDM to provide better control of video/voice transmission over Internet by routing and wavelength assignment scheme (RWA). Objective modular network simulator called OMNeT++ is used to model and analyze the performance of the network. In this paper, we discuss the structure, topology and network architecture of an optical Internet and the suitability for multimedia over IP transmission at the ISP network. Based on GMPLS concept, the R-IWDM tree construction protocol is modified to provide QoS.

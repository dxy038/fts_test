The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of calcium supplementation on prevention of pregnancy induced hypertension. A randomized clinical trial of calcium supplementation in pregnancy versus no Ca supplementation was performed on 400 primigravida with 20 completed weeks of pregnancy. 200 patients(Ca supplementation) and 200 patients(without Ca supplementation) were similar in age, weight, economic and occupational situation. In Ca supplementation group calcium gluconate was prescribed 2gr daily from 20th completed week of pregnancy. All the patients were followed monthly until 28th week of pregnancy and after that every 2 weeks until 36th week of pregnancy, then weekly until delivery and 24 hours after delivery. The rates of pregnancy induced hypertension(PIH), preterm delivery and cesarean section were evaluated. Two patients from control group and 6 patients from calcium supplementation group who did not have delivery in our hospital were excluded from the study. Of 198 patients in control group 10 cases(5.05%) and of 194 patients in calcium group, 4 patients(2.06%) had PIH which was a statistically significant difference(P<0.01). Preterm delivery and cesarean section did not have statistically significant difference in two groups. To conclude, Ca supplementation can reduce pregnancy induced hypertension and may prevent this dangerous complication of pregnancy.

A characteristic of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is to allow individual decision making units (DMUs) to select the most advantageous weights in calculating their efficiency scores. This flexibility, on the other hand, deters the comparison among DMUs on a common base. For dealing with this difficulty and assessing all the DMUs on the same scale, this paper proposes using a multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) approach for generating a common set of weights in the DEA framework.

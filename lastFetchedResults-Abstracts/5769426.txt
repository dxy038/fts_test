The image fusion technique is the synergistic use of two or more sensors at the same time. Access to the image of a scene or image sequence information to be integrated to obtain the same target is more objective, providing a more fundamental understanding of processing technology. Multi-scale structure to resolve the difficulties caused by different characteristics of the image grayscale image fusion is based on wavelet transform because the wavelet transform can remove the correlation between the scales of two adjacent sub-image information. The paper presents the algorithm of image fusion based on wavelet transform.

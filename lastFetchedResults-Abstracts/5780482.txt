In this paper, we consider a group of agents with state and input constraints. The objective of this paper is to make the agents reach a desired formation while avoiding constraint violations. This paper considers two types of constraints: coupled and decoupled constraints. We prepare so-called a safe region which contains all the pairs of initial states such that both types of constraints are satisfied. In order to meet the objective, we present a distributed receding horizon control algorithm consisting of two algorithms: decision making algorithm and reference management algorithm. We show that the present algorithm achieves constraint fulfillment under some reasonable conditions.

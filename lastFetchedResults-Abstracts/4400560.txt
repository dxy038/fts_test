We present a method for real-time depth enhancement based on multiple depth map fusion. We use a multi-sensor setup of low-cost depth sensors to obtain a combined depth map that can be arbitrary positioned between the input sensors. Our method fills holes in the depth map and reduces sensor noise. It uses GPU acceleration via OpenGL and is applicable as a preprocessing step for a wide variety of applications where real-time depth maps are necessary. We present subjective and objective results and investigate the influence of vibrating sensors to our method.

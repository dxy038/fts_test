The obtained data were analyzed by implementing independent sample T test and ANOVA. P value=0.05 was considered significant.
Results: based on the obtained results, neuroticism was significantly higher)P?0/001 (and extraversion was significantly lower )P?0/001) in patients, compared to those of healthy subjects.
Conclusion: based on these results, it seems that in psychological treatment we need to pay more attention to personality characteristics of IBS patients

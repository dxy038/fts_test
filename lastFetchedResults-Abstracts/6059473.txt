Recent joint services test demonstration programs require that deliverable systems apply Synthetic Instrumentation (SI). This paper reports on a new generation of microwave SI which will be delivered this calendar year for two demonstration programs. The paper begins with a look at the initiatives of the NxTest group and objectives related to future test equipment programs. We describe the rationale for trends toward ATS implementation using synthetic test concepts. Next, the process and challenges required for mapping multiple legacy system capabilities into requirements for a single synthetic system platform are discussed. A description of the microwave synthetic test subsystem architecture is provided and details of a representative system design are provided to demonstrate how the modularity of a synthetic test platform addresses the requirements. In terms of software, we will explore both the strengths and potential shortcomings with respect to the ambitious objective to run legacy TPSs without modification. Ultimately, success of future programs in applying synthetic technology will be measured by its ability to implement the required testing at competitive capital cost and superior overall tester lifecycle characteristics. WeÂ´ll project expectations in terms of these characteristics

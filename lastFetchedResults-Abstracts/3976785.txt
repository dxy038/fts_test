This paper discusses the design optimization of a wing for supersonic transport (SST) using a multiple-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Three objective functions are used to minimize the drag for supersonic cruise, the drag for transonic cruise, and the bending moment at the wing root for supersonic cruise. The wing shape is defined by 66 design variables. A Euler flow code is used to evaluate supersonic performance, and a potential flow code is used to evaluate transonic performance. To reduce the total computational time, flow calculations are parallelized on an NEC SX-4 computer using 32 processing elements. The detailed analysis of the resulting Pareto front suggests a renewed interest in the arrow wing planform for the supersonic wing

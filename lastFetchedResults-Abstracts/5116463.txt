Summary form only given. Human gait is composed of the stance and swing phases. Stance phase, the weight support course for the other leg to move forward, is important phase that needs stability. The objective of this study is to develop a design tool that can help the development of lower limb prosthesis. For the purpose, the stance phase gait of SNS (stance and swing phase) controlled knee prosthesis for transfemoral amputee was modeled and simulated. Large deformation components, such as foot and knee damper, were modeled using the finite element (FE) and used to dynamic gait analysis. Material property of each model is obtained by part experiments and gait simulation result is compared with gait experiments result. The developed FE model could be used to design advanced knee prosthesis and optimized the above knee prosthetic components.

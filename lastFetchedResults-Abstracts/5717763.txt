A preliminary integrated services digital network (ISDN) model is developed that incorporates basic features such as voice and data call generation, call setup for circuit-switched calls, packet-switched signaling, transmission of low-rate data on the signaling channel, and selectable number of nodes, link capacities, and connectivities. The model concentrates mainly on the basic call control procedures of the ISDN user part of the CCITT Signaling System No.7 in conjunction with D-channel protocols. The primary objective of the ISDN simulation model is to aid in understanding the performance of the ISDN protocols. In the design mode, it may be used to evaluate a number of potential architectures consisting of various message traffic/workload scenarios with different mix of voice and data traffic, resource additions and expansions and congestion handling. The model produces statistical measures of network utilization and call blockage that can be used to evaluate the effect of changes in network topology. routing algorithms, and traffic. The architecture and input/output formats of the model are described. Some numerical results from sample runs are given

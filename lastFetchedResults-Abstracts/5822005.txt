In this paper, a real time and robust multi-view lip localization in video frames is proposed. The objective of this research is to exactly localize lip surrounding box with sub-pixel accuracy in low quality video frames. This is achieved by multi-view face detection in video frames, lip ROI extraction, color space transformation, vertical edge feature detection and lip localization by a feature-spatial profile analysis on a joint color-edge plane. One possible application of talking face detection in video is used to evaluate our work. Experimental results on TV programs and movies demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and robust in lip localization.

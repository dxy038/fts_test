The simulation model is a proven tool in solving nonlinear and stochastic problems and allows examination of the likely behavior of a proposed manufacturing system under selected conditions. However, it does not provide a method for optimization. A practical problem often embodies many characteristics of a multiresponse optimization problem. The present paper proposes to solve the multiresponse simulation-optimization problem by a multiple-attribute decision-making methodâ€”a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The method assumes that the control factors have discrete values and that each control factor has exactly three control levels. Taguchi quality-loss functions are adapted to model the factor mean and variance effects. TOPSIS is then used to find the surrogate objective function for the multiple responses. The present paper predicts the system performances for any combination of levels of the control factors by using the main effects of the control factors according to the principles of a robust design method. The optimal design can then be obtained. A practical case study from an integrated-circuit packaging company illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, constraints of the proposed method are addressed.

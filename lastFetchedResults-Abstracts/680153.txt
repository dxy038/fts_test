The NATO/CCMS Pilot Study “Air pollution transport and diffusion over coastal urban areas” held an international workshop in Athens, 3–5 May 1993. The objective of this workshop was to develop guidelines for it reference experiment in a coastal urban area. It was intended that the guidelines would be sufficiently general that they could be applied to any coastal urban area, but Athens was bome in mind as a suitable candidate location. On the first day of the workshop, invited speakers delivered their lectures on different issues of dispersion in urban coastal areas. The second day was devoted to discussions in working groups focusing on key issues, such as, emissions' inventory, meteorological measurements, surface pollutant concentration measurements, aircraft measurements, remote sensing and model evaluation. On the final half-day the rapporteur from each working group reported on its work. Their reports are briefly summarized in the present paper.

Objective: Medical plants, as rich sources of natural antioxidants with antidiabetic effects, are used worldwide to diminish a variety of symptoms and many diseases. R. ribes L., which belongs to the family of polygonaceae, can provide symptomatic relief and assist in the prevention of the secondary complications of the diabetes. Material and Methods: 36 female adult rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 6. Normal Control groups treated with normal saline. Positive control groups treated with hydroalcohlic extract of R. ribes root (150 mg/kg) daily by gavages for 4 consecutive weeks. Diabetes was inducedby injection of 120 mg/kg alloxan monohydrate intraperitoneally. Two diabetic groups were treated with different doses of R. ribes root extract. The sixth diabetic groups were treated with glibenclamide (0.6 mg/kg). At the end of 28 days, blood samples were collected and their kidney tissues were processed for light microscopy. Results: The results showed that hydro-alcoholic extract of R. ribes decreased the level of glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, urea and creatinine in diabetic rats (p<0.05) in compared with diabetic rats, while the level of HDL increased at the same group (p<0.05). Histopathological changes of kidney samples were comparable with respective control. In diabetic rats, kidney sections showed atrophy of glomerular capillaries with increased Bowman's space and acute tubular necrosis. The groups that were treated with R. ribes root were improved towards normal condition. Conclusion: It is interesting to note that hydroalcohlic extract of R. ribes root improves renal dysfunction in alloxan-induced diabetic rats through controlling blood glucose and renal protective effects.

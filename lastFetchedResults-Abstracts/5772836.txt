This paper studies the dynamics of a class of retarded impulsive differential equations (IDE), which generalizes the delayed cellular neural networks (DCNN), delayed bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks and some population growth models. We get the existence almost periodic solution of a class of retarded impulsive differential equations in this paper. When the impulsive jumps are absent, our results reduce to its corresponding results for the nonimpulsive systems. The approaches are based on BanachÂ´s fixed point theorem, matrix theory and its spectral theory.

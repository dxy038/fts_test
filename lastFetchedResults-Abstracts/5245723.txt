Objective To research and implement converting HL7 Version 2.x medical messages ER7(Encoding Rules 7) standard format to XML format and vice versa. Methods By parsing HL7 message structure, using HAPI as supportive toolkit and based on object-oriented programming, format conversion of the medical information message is accomplished. Results Lots of HL7 messages such as patient demographic information, laboratory analysis information and other relative therapy information are tested, all of which can achieve message format conversion of medical information. Conclusion It is very necessary and significant that the paper implements format conversion of medical messages, which not only facilitates systems based on HL7 v2.x to update to HL7 V3 in the future, but also expedites medical information systems to communicate to the other health related systems.

In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the accordion transform that tends to exploit the both intra and inter frame correlation. The major novelty of the new approach compared to classic one is the dynamic strategy of video frames scan. The direction of the frames scan will depends on a gradient based algorithm which tries to predict the direction where minimal pixels intensities changes are recorded. Both objective (PSNR) and subjective quality evaluation prove the improvement of the compression efficiency, especially in fast and uniform motion video sequences which usually represents the weakness of the classical approach.

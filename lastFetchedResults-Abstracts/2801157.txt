The coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) is a promising platform for mobile computing. In this paper, how to prolong the lifetime of battery-powered reconfigurable computing platform is addressed. Considering the nonlinear characteristics of battery, a multi-objective optimization model is built for extending the lifetime of battery. Based on this model, a joint task-mapping and battery-scheduling method is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 26.22% improvement of battery runtime on average comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.

The objective of this study was to analyze reproductive performance in swine females re-serviced after return to estrus or abortion in comparison with females in first service (gilts or weaned females). Records used were obtained from four commercial sow herds in Brazil including 24,194 mating records from PigCHAMP® research database. Three mating categories (first service in gilts or weaned sows, re-serviced after return to estrus and re-serviced after abortion) were considered for the analysis. The farrowing rate (FR) was less and return to estrus (RER), abortion rate (ABR) and total born (TB) were greater in the category re-serviced after return to estrus compared to first service category (P &lt; 0.05). The category re-serviced after abortion only differed from the first service category by a greater ABR (P &lt; 0.05). In gilts and PO2–5 females re-serviced after a return to estrus, the FR was less (72.0% and 83.2%) and RER was greater (22.3% and 12.5%) compared to first service PO2–5 sows (92.7% and 5.3%; P &lt; 0.05). A re-service after a return to estrus did not affect TB in PO ≥2 females (P &gt; 0.05) but resulted in less TB in gilts and greater TB in primiparous sows (P &lt; 0.05). In females re-serviced after a return to estrus the performance was similar (P &gt; 0.05) between the two intervals considered as regular return to estrus (18–24 days and 36–48 days). Among the intervals considered as irregular return to estrus, greater FR was observed in intermediate (25–35 days) than in early (11–17 days) or late (&gt;48 days) intervals. The re-service after a return to estrus results in an impaired farrowing rate, with a greater impact on gilts than at older parities. Females re-serviced after abortion are more predisposed to the recurrence of this reproductive failure.

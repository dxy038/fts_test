A new bidirectional dc-dc PWM converter with a steep voltage conversion ratio is proposed in the paper. The proposed converter makes use of coupled inductors to step up small dc voltage to large ones or to step down large dc voltages to small ones. Its switches operate with zero-voltage switching due to a very simple auxiliary circuit that contains a single active switch and a few passive elements. In the paper, the proposed converter is presented, its operation is explained in detail and analyzed, and a systematic design procedure is derived and used to design a prototype converter. The feasibility of the converter is confirmed with results obtained from the lab prototype.

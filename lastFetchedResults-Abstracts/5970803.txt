Time-cost optimization problem in service-workflows is a hard to solve and widely existing problem in practical systems. In this paper, a improved multi-objective PSO method is proposed. By constructing discrete particles, Outside Population and Meshing method based on Niche Technique are introduced to obtain an evenly distributed Pareto set, Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for the considered problem. Many evenly distributed Pareto sets with high quality are obtained for various characteristic instances.

The video pre-roll delay for filling up the client buffer can not be too long for user utility and buffer limitations in wireless point-to-multipoint streaming systems. Cross-layer design that deals with both physical and application layer aspects jointly is necessary for this purpose. We present a cross-layer optimized multiuser video adaptation and user scheduling framework for wireless video communication, where quality-of-service (QoS) fairness among users is provided with maximum video quality and video throughput. Both protocol layers are jointly optimized using a single multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework that aims to schedule the user with the least remaining playback time and the highest video throughput (delivered video seconds per transmission slot) with maximum video quality. Experiments carried out in the IS-856 (IxEV-DO) standard and ITU pedestrian and vehicular environments demonstrate the improvements over the state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of video QoS fairness, video quality and throughput

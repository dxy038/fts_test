In this paper, human behaviour, its context and the dynamics of their interplay are interpreted in terms of clusters of activities with a focus and corresponding aspects. These are considered to occur in the realms of objective/subjective continuum of behaviour and the realms of contextual certainty/uncertainty continuum. Furthermore, activities are clustered using their dynamics and facilitating media, where four primitive facilitating media are identified and these are matter, energy, information as well as fields.

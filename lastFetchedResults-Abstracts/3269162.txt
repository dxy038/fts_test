The objective of this paper is to investigate the fast power-routing capability of line current commutating (LCC)-HVDC. Such capability is most desired in future grids with high penetration of renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar). The technology presented in this paper replaces the traditional LCC-HVDC rectifier power order control by an ac voltage-mode control. This technology enables the HVDC rectifier ac bus to act as an infinite bus and absorb fluctuating wind power. A study system consisting of an ac system, an LCC-HVDC, and a doubly fed induction generator-based wind farm is built in Matlab/SimPowersystems. Simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate the proposed HVDC rectifier control in routing fluctuating wind power and load change. Parameters of the proposed voltage-mode control are investigated to show their impact on HVDC power routing and ac fault recovery.

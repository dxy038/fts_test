Objective
Propionic acidemia is one of the rare congenital neurometabolic disorders with
autosomal recessive inheritance. This disorder is caused by a defect in the
propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme and can be presented with life-threatening
ketoacidosis, lethargy, failure to thrive, and developmental delay.
Materials & Methods
The patients diagnosed as having propionic acidemia in Neurology Department
of Mofid Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Tehran, Iran, between 2002 and 2012 were
include in our study. This disorder was confirmed by clinical manifestations,
neuroimaging findings, and neurometabolic assessment in the reference
laboratory in Germany. Our study was conducted to define the sex, age, gender,
past medical history, developmental status, clinical findings, and neuroimaging
manifestations in 10 patients with propionic acidemia.
Results
Seventy percent of patients were offspring of consanguineous marriages. In this
study, only one patient had microcephaly at birth, but at detection time, 30% of
patients had head circumference and weight below the 3rd percentile.
The patients were followed for approximately 5 years and this follow-up showed
that the patients with early diagnosis had a more favorable clinical response.
Neuroimaging findings included brain atrophy, white matter and globus pallidus
involvement.
Conclusion
Finally we suggest that early diagnosis and treatment have an important role in
the prevention of disease progression

The injuries in the lower limbs are common at the sports, and one of the most common injuries is ankle sprain. Kinesio taping is one of the useful treatments of ankle sprain. The objective of this study is to investigate the biomechanical effects of ankle Kinesio taping on ground impacts during the landing of vertical jump, and the effect of ankle Kinesio taping on vertical jump in functional instability. Two AMTI force plates and VICON motion analysis system were used to collect kinematic and kinetic data. The result of this study showed that the ankle Kinesio taping can reduce the functional instability groupÂ´s time to ankle second peak ground reaction forces, and decrease the first peak vertical ground reaction forces and the integrated impulses after landing. There was no significant effect of ankle Kinesio taping on the biomechanical parameters of ground impact in the control group.

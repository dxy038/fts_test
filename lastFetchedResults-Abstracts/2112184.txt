There are literally several studies accomplished to predict the fatigue life of leaf springs but estimation of fatigue life of a parabolic leaf spring by using CAE tools has not yet been executed in the past. Parabolic spring is an important component in a vehicle suspension system. It needs to have excellent fatigue life and in todayâ€™s scenario manufacturers rely on constant loading fatigue analysis. The objective of this work is to perform the fatigue analysis of parabolic leaf spring by three different methods where CAE analysis is performed to observe the distribution of stress fatigue life and damage using Goodman approach. In this work, fatigue life of the parabolic leaf spring is determined as per SAE spring design manual and experimentally by testing on full scale fatigue testing machine. ANSYS is used for CAE solution for the prediction of leaf springs fatigue life considering stress theory. The fatigue life estimated by all three modes is then compared for the purpose of validation. The methodology used in this paper brings a practical approach to the professionals in the industries who are engaged for design of mechanical components.

THE OBJECTIVE OF combining improved performance with saving in materials has been accomplished in the redesign of a line of liquid-filled bushings in ratings 15 kv through 69 kv. In this redesign, the mechanical and electrical reliability of the bushings in service has been improved and field servicing and repairs have been facilitated. Simultaneously, the design has been simplified to reduce the size of some parts and eliminate others.

The main objective of this letter is to present the design of an efficient, real-time data archival system to a secure digital flash memory card via reconfigurable hardware. The data access from the SD card is implemented completely using Verilog and hence, there is no use of any microcontroller or on-chip general purpose processors. And since the complete design is a single-purpose system, no extra hardware is required. The design has four independent modules for the required different operations on the SD memory card. These four modules are for single-block write, multiple-block write, single-block read, and multiple-block read operations. We show how the bidirectional access takes place correctly and the data integrity has been verified using cyclic redundancy code in both field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and the SD card controller.

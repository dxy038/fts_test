The objective of present study was to estimate heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations of meat quality traits in Japanese quail. Genetic parameters of meat quality traits were estimated using ASREML software. Heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations were estimated using univariate and bivariate animal models. Heritability estimates for breast meat quality including pH, meat color (redness, yellowness, lightness), water holding capacity, drip loss, intra muscular fat, thawing-cooking loss and shear force were from 0.2 (intra muscular fat) to 0.58 (yellowness). Heritability estimates for thigh meat quality consisting pH, meat color (redness, yellowness. lightness), and drip loss were from 0.22 (redness) to 0.56 (drip loss). Geneticcorrelations between redness and lightness were -0.74 inbreastmuscle and -0.73 in thigh muscle. Geneticcorrelationsbetween pH and redness were 0.26 inbreastmuscle and 0.41 in thigh muscle. Geneticcorrelationsbetween pH and lightness were -0.37 inbreastmuscle and -0.74 in thigh muscle. Current results showed that most of meat quality traits in Japanese quail had high heritability; therefore it is possible to improve meat quality through genetic selection and selection for lower pH or redness, may improve the production of Japanese quail.

Objective: In this program a postpartum woman could consent to receive her newborn’s human immunodeficiency virus test result from the New York State Newborn Screening Program. Study Design: By state regulation each postpartum woman was counseled and offered her newborn’s human immunodeficiency virus test result. With the mother’s consent, newborn human immunodeficiency virus antibody test results from the Newborn Screening Program were sent to the baby’s pediatrician; otherwise, test results were blinded. Data were analyzed for births from August 1, 1996, to January 31, 1997. Results: Overall, 92.5% of women offered newborn human immunodeficiency virus testing consented to receive the result. Among 444 human immunodeficiency virus–positive women offered newborn testing, consented testing resulted in a 21.4% increase in knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus status from 72.3% (n = 321) at delivery to 93.7% (n = 416) after newborn testing; 6.3% (n = 28) of human immunodeficiency virus–positive women delivered of infants who did not consent apparently remained unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus status. Conclusion: Combined prenatal and consented newborn testing identified 94% of human immunodeficiency virus–positive mothers and exposed newborns, allowing early entry into care. Such testing may provide an opportunity for women not previously tested for the human immunodeficiency virus to learn their status but is not a substitute for universal prenatal human immunodeficiency virus counseling and consented human immunodeficiency virus testing.

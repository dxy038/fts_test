Introduction: The national institute for Health and Clinical excellence (niCe) in the united
Kingdom, the institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen (iQWiG) in Germany and the
Haute autorité de santé (Has) in France have recently set out guidelines on prescription of anti-dementia
medication. The Has proposes in particular that continuation of these drugs for longer than one year should be
decided in multidisciplinary team meetings (mdTm). Objective: To assess the feasibility of mdTm and the
satisfaction of coordinating physicians from institutions for the dependent elderly (nursing home, nH) and expert
physicians from memory clinics who have participated in the meetings. Methods: survey carried out among
physicians who had participated in the mdTm held as part of the idem study (interest of systematic tracking of
dementia cases in nH: analysing the contribution of mdTm in alzheimer's disease and related diseases; PHRC
national 2009, Code 0910701). The survey evaluated the organization of mdTm and the physicians' opinion of
these meetings. Results: The cases of 574 patients were discussed in mdTm involving 133 healthcare
professionals (32 coordinating physicians, 48 expert physicians, 4 general practitioners and 49 other health
professionals). The mean number of participants was 4.2±1.6. about 16 minutes were spent discussing the case
of each resident. about 90% of physicians considered that the meetings were useful. overall assessment of their
efficacy was 11.5/20 for the coordinating physicians and 14.1/20 for the expert physicians. The benefits of
mdTm in relation to the work entailed were considered important by 60% of expert physicians and 33% of
coordinating physicians. Conclusions: our survey confirmed the feasibility of mdTm in the field of alzheimer’s
disease. The overall benefit/workload ratio of the meetings was considered to be favorable for the expert
physicians. The benefits of mdTm were turned out to be less appreciated by the coordinating physicians
according to high workload involved.

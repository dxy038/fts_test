key-Kavus, Eskandar's son, known as Onsorol-Maali was one of "Zeyari" dynasty kings and princes who lived in the fifth century and wrote the invaluable book "Qabousnameh", "Pandname" or "Nasihatnameh". Onsorol-Maali has written the book, as he stated in the introduction, as an order to his son "Gilanshah" in forty-four chapters. More specifically, from Onsorol-Maali's viewpoint, the main objective of the book was to teach his son the  appropriate way of living and behaving.
Onsorol-Moali has allocated thirty-five chapter of "Qabousnameh" to the principles of poetry. Benefiting from the issue of poetry, he advised his son very concisely: Regarding the extent to which "Gilanshah" sticks to these pieces of advice, no information is available. But it seems that these pieces of advice have been followed and practiced by "Sheikh-Moslehodin-Saadi-Shirazi" two centuries after Onsorol-Maali's death and applied in his poetry and prose. Accordingly, Saadi's works can be criticized to a great extent in line with these pieces of advice. 
The present study aims at how well Saadi sticks, to Onsorol-Maali's advice and recommendations in the creation of his works. To fulfill the objective, after a number of points in the introduction, the major principles of Onsorol-Maali's  advice are investigated separately. Then, benefiting from the remaining works of "Sheikh-Ajal" as well as other researchers, ideas working on Saadi, the study hopes to bring its tenets home.

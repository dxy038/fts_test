A reference-based algorithm for scene image categorization is presented in this letter. In addition to using a reference-set for images representation, we also associate the reference-set with training data in sparse codes during the dictionary learning process. The reference-set is combined with the reconstruction error to form a unified objective function. The optimal solution is efficiently obtained using the K-SVD algorithm. After dictionaries are constructed, Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) features of images are extracted. Then, we represent each image feature vector using the similarities between the image and the reference-set, leading to a significant reduction of the dimensionality in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance.

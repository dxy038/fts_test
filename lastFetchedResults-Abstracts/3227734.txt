The main objective is to improve the overall performance of membrane-based water desalination processes by applying innovative technologies to reduce energy consumption by using renewable energy and save energy of condensation. The coupled collector to this installation is a flat plate collector. To simulate solar radiation we have choose a EUFRAT model. The model allows to obtain the out water temperature along the day. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model describing the functioning of hollow fiber module using the VMD principle. This model enables us to determine the instantaneous variation of the distillate flow as well as the daily productivity. We design and develop an autonomous solar desalination system (PV - thermal collector) for a capacity about 0.5 m<sup>3</sup>/day. The pilot plant was installed in the village of orphaned children (8.0.8 Mahares TUNISIE). Experimental tests were carried to determine the permeate water production.

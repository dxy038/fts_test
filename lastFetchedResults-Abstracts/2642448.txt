Objective: The high prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in Iran and its maternal and fetal consequences as well as the high risk of its long-term effects including obesity is known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) in ages of 18 months and 6 years and maternal glucose concentration.
Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 199 pairs of mother and child in five health-care centers of Yazd. The children born in 2007 and 2008 were selected, followed by a calculation of BMI in the ages of 18 months and 6 years (school age) based on their heights and weights recorded in their family files. The relationship between the resulting BMI and maternal glucose concentration and pregnancy conditions was then determined.
Results A population of 199 mother-child pairs were investigated consisting of 105 male children (52.8%) and 94 female ones (47.2 %). The mean (±SD) glucose challenge test (50 gram -GCT) and pre-pregnancy BMI were 121(25.7) mg/dL and 24.16 (4.85) kg/m^2, respectively. At 18 months, the mean (±SD) child BMI was 15.78 (1.21) kg/m^2, 5.5% of which were overweight/obese and at 6 years, the mean (±SD) child BMI was 14.46 (1.81) kg/m^2, 12.6% of which were overweight/obese. This study revealed a significant association between BMI 18 months and 6 years and pre-pregnancy BMI with maternal GCT (P-value  < 0.003). Therefore, GCT ? 130 mg/dL compared with GCT  < 129 mg/dL significantly associated with BMI at 18 months and 6 years old and the mother's pre-pregnancy BMI.
Conclusion: According to this study, it can be concluded that there is a significant correlation between GCT and the increase of children BMI. It is necessary to control and treat gestational diabetes mellitus by means of decrease the intergenerational cycle of obesity and diabetes in offspring. Also infants of women with diabetes should be specifically targeted for obesity prevention programs.

A four-quadrant AC-DC converter with high frequency isolation and all-digital control, based on the matrix converter topology, is analyzed in this paper. The selected topology consists of a bidirectional three-phase cycloconverter with power factor correction and a bidirectional active rectifier. The inclusion of the isolation transformer at the switching frequency permits to reduce volume and weight. Experimental and simulated results of a 1.5 kW, 20 kHz prototype proof the performance of the proposed topology.

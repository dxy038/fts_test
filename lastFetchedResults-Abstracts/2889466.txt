Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) is a ground-breaking invention in many areas of Microelectronics, Biochemistry, and Biomedical sciences. It is also known as `Lab-on-a-ChipÂ´ for its performance as an alternative for laboratory experiments. Various types of diagnosis procedures are performed on it through a sequence of modular operations like sample preparation, mixing, and detection. Mixing is the most important operation of DMFB as the outcome of the experiment is almost dominated by mixing. A good mixing of corresponding sample and reagent gives proper result while an improper mixing leads to erroneous result, which may be the reason to discard the assay. So, our objective is the betterment of mixing operation. In this paper, we have proposed a design using equilateral triangular electrodes instead of square electrodes, maintaining all the constraints required to ensure safe droplet movement and other modular operations, while improvement of the mixing operation is the key design issue.

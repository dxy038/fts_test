Direct matrix converter is an efficient dc-link capacitor less direct AC/ AC conversion scheme. It consists of bidirectional switches arranged such that any input phase can be connected to any output phase at any point in time. This paper presents a Space Vector Modulation (SVM) control technique applied to direct Matrix converter. The model of the direct matrix converter and the principle of the SVM modulation are detailed. The viability of the space vector modulation scheme for the direct matrix is demonstrated using analytical and simulation approaches. An input and output LC filters are designed and used to compensate harmonics and reactive power of the output/input voltages/currents. The simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the designed filters. It is shown that the direct matrix converter operates with sinusoidal output/input voltages/currents and unity input power factor without added passive components nor energy storage devices.

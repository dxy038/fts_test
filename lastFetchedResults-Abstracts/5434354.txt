Our global objective is to profit from the technology offered by the computer and/or Internet without being constrained by sitting in front of a computer. As an example of application, we present a method to use Voice over IP (VoIP) computer software remotely. This method targets mainly the population with reduced mobility or the population unfamiliar with computers, who may have difficulty using this type of software on the computer itself. This design allows for the use of a telephone keypad and headset with a microphone wirelessly, away from the computer. The system attempts to mimic the same kind of interface provided by telephones, with the same type of keypad, in an effort to maximize convenience, and reduce the amount of difficulty that someone with reduced mobility may have in using the system. We will describe the implementation used, present some results on how well the system works and some possibilities for the future.

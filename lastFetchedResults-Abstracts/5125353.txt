Aiming at the minimal delay of vehicles in each direction along the artery at the expected speed of travel, this paper proposes an optimal offset model for artery traffic signal control system by analyzing the rules of two directional traffic flow delay at the intersections, which introduces the idea of bidirectional green-wave signal control. The objective function is optimized by applying the genetic algorithms. During the simulation, delay of lateral is considered. By comparing with the fixed-time control, the result of the simulation shows the new control model wins over traditional control in reducing the average total delay of vehicles in arterial road.

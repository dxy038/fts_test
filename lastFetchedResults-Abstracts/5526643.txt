This paper describes the optimization of a power system that has connected a distributed generation source (a distributed generator). The optimal location of the distributed generator is determined first based on the power losses. Then, the optimization is performed for two objective functions, the generation cost and the power losses, subjected to constraints. The optimization is performed for two cases: when the distributed generator is connected to the system, and when the distributed generator is not connected to the system. The optimization results for the two cases are presented. The analyzes are performed with a specialized software for the simulation and analysis of power systems.

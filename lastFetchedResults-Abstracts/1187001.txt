The objective of this paper is to clarify the effects of seawater–structure interaction on the residual displacement of caisson-type quay wall after a real earthquake shock. The dynamic response of quay wall during earthquake, including soil–sea–structure interaction, is calculated using ADINA finite element program. A typical configuration of caisson-type quay wall is used for analysis and seven real earthquake records along with one harmonic excitation are applied as base acceleration. The results demonstrate that the influence of seawater–structure interaction on the permanent displacement of a caisson-type quay wall, constructed on relatively non-liquefiable site, is not significant.

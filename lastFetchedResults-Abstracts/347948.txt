Objective: The possibility of simultaneously observing activation of primary and secondary auditory cortices has been demonstrated by Engelien et al. [Hear Res 2000;148:153–60].
Methods: Such a dual monitoring by means of neuromagnetic recordings can be achieved when a subject is stimulated by brief pulses of 40 Hz-modulated tones. Depending on the frequency filter applied, either the steady-state field (SSF) or the N1m can be extracted from the evoked magnetic field complex.
Results: Using this ‘combined’ (two-maps) paradigm with 4 carrier frequencies, we show that it is possible to synchronously screen two tonotopic maps—one map each reflected either by the SSF or the N1m. Indicators are the systematic variation in the location (higher frequencies are more posterior) and orientation (higher frequencies oriented differently in the saggital plane) of the equivalent current dipole (ECD). These parameters were compared with those obtained from ‘classic’ (one map) paradigms in which either a pure tone elicits an N1m or a 40 Hz continuous (3 s) stimulation produces an SSF. Overall the results were similar, however, systematic differences between the paradigms were found for ECD localization, dipole strength, amplitude, and phase.
Conclusions and Significance: One possible interpretation of these results is that different tonotopically arranged cortical fields were involved in the generation of the components.

Background
Nonneonatal Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital anomaly for which numerous operative techniques have been described to repair the aberrant tricuspid valve, exclude the atrialized right ventricle, and address right heart dysfunction. We reviewed short-term outcomes in surgical patients treated by a simplified operative technique.
Methods
Our operative approach to Ebstein's anomaly is approximation of the anteroposterior commissure to the remnant septal leaflet with closure of the cul-de-sac longitudinally. Plication of the atrialized right ventricle (1 patient) and a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection (2 patients) were performed only if necessary. All patients were followed postoperatively by their cardiac surgeon and cardiologist.
Results
Seven patients with a mean age of 39 years (range, 3.6 to 63.8 years) underwent repair. Preoperatively all patients had 4+ tricuspid valve regurgitation and were New York Heart Association class III. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7 ± 2 days (range, 4 to 11 days). Mean follow-up is 42 ± 18 months (range, 7 to 58 months). At last follow-up 5 patients are New York Heart Association class I and average tricuspid valve regurgitation is mild.
Conclusions
Plication of the posterior annulus without plication of the atrialized right ventricle, resiting the tricuspid valve, or performing prophylactic cavopulmonary connection appears to be a reasonable operative approach to nonneonatal Ebstein's anomaly. Long-term follow-up of this cohort is necessary to determine the durability of such a surgical approach.

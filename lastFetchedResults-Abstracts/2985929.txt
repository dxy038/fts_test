Integrated optimum design of structure and control system is expected to achieve the higher performance of various mechanical systems. Recently, much efforts have been given to develop the integrated optimization methods in order to improve the dynamic characteristics of the combined structure/control systems. The objective of this paper is to present some concepts of the integrated optimum design in vibration control problems. Some integrated optimization problems are introduced with applications

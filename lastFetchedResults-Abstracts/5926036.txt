This study proposed a traffic responsive urban traffic control system using RFID(radio frequency identification) technology to get traffic information. The proposed system is a decentralized control using model predictive control. The objective of the proposed system is to obtain traffic data using advanced technology for controlling the junctionsÂ´ traffic rights. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.

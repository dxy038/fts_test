Materials & Methods: In this study 600 pregnant women residing in Shiraz were selected using Lin cross size of sample (multistage sampling). Data were collected through the validated questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS software by multi-variables logistic regression and X2 techniques. 

Results: Research hypotheses about significant relation among these factors (age, age of marriage, education, spouseâ€™s education, occupational status, place of birth, social class status, previous childbirth method, record of barrenness, place of previous childbirth, place of pregnant care, record of cesarean in family and attitude toward cesarean) with choice of cesarean have been approved.

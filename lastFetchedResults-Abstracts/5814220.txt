Constructing a panoramic video out of multiple incoming live mobile video streams is a challenging problem. This problem involves multiple users live streaming the same scene from different angles, using their mobile phones, with the objective of constructing a panoramic video of the scene. The main challenge in this problem is the lack of coordination between the streaming users, resulting in too much, too little, or no overlap between incoming streams. To add to the challenge, the streaming users are generally free to move, which means that the amounts of overlap between the different streams are dynamically changing. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically coordinating between the streaming users, such that the quality of the resulting panoramic video is enhanced. The method works by analyzing the incoming video streams, and automatically providing active feedback to the streaming users. We investigate different methods for generating the active feedback and presenting it to the streaming users resulting in an improved panoramic video output compared to the case where no feedback is utilized.

Objective
To report here a new acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cell line SH-2 and describe its biological characteristics.
Materials and Methods

Mononuclear cells isolated from a patient with AML-M2 subtype were passaged by liquid culture medium. Interleukin-3 and bone marrow stromal cells were used to support cell proliferation at the first 3 months. Various methods, including cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex FISH (M-FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR, short tandem repeat (STR)–PCR, direct sequencing of DNA, clonogenic assay, and tumorigenicity in nude and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were employed to identify and characterize SH-2 cell line.
Results

SH-2 cells were maintained without cytokine and stromal cells for 3 years. It had no Epstein-Barr virus or mycoplasma contamination. The SH-2 cell line showed typical myelocytic features in morphology and simultaneous strongly expressed myeloid antigens (CD13, 99.6% and CD33, 99.26%) and natural killer (NK)–related antigens (CD56, 99.5% and CD16/56, 99.62%) suggesting that SH-2 is an AML cell line with NK-antigen expression. SH-2 cell line initially showed a karyotype of 45, X, -Y, der(16)t(16;17)(q24;q12), −17, +19. During the passage period, the cells with a hypodiploid karyotype gradually decreased and were replaced by the near-tetraploid cells with a karyotype of 71-105(86), XX, -Y, -Y, der(16)t(16;17)×2, −17, −17, +19, +19. FISH and M-FISH delineated all abnormalities. SH-2 cells had the approximately same morphological, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetic features as the patient's leukemia cells had. STR-PCR provided powerful evidence for the derivation of SH-2 cell line from the patient's leukemia cells. SH-2 cells showed multiple drug resistance (MDR), which may be related to the p53 gene alteration, including the loss of one p53 allele due to the monosomy 17 and a point mutation of CAG to CAT at codon 576 of exon 5 in another p53 allele resulting in the loss of p53 gene function. In addition, SH-2 cell line did not express MDR-related genes, such as MDR1, multidrug resistance-related protein, and lung resistance protein, but expressed apoptosis-related genes, such as Bcl-2, Fas, glutathione S-transferase-π, and p21, which were also related to the MDR. SH-2 cell line had tumorigenic capacities in nude and SCID mice.
Conclusion

Because SH-2 cell line had a clear biology background, it will provide a useful tool for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment strategy of AML with MDR.

The optimal control of a production facility consisting of a single machine processing a certain number of jobs with a fixed service sequence is considered. The objective of the problem is that of determining the optimal timing and lot-sizing of the considered jobs. Necessary conditions for optimality are derived which allow the determination of an optimal solution for the control problem

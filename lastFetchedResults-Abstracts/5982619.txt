The cross connections will be the only way to away from the fire accidents if happened. Considering the factors both of safe evacuation and engineering cost, the evaluation model of the optimal space of cross connections was built up based on evacuation theory and multi-objective programming analysis. Taking ShiZiYang Railway Tunnel as project example, the optimal distance of cross connections is calculated to be 450m and the minimum engineering cost is 690m<sup>3</sup>.

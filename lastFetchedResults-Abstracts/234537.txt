The objective of this study was to determine some physical and mechanical properties of solid wood of wingnut (Pterocarya fraxinifolia (Lam.) Spach.) in comparison with major hardwood species in Turkey. In the study, some properties of plywood specimens produced from wingnut wood were also determined. Results showed that the characteristics of solid wingnut wood were comparable with some major hardwood species used in Turkey. Based on physical and mechanical properties tested, the wood could be consumed in some usage areas where high strength is not expected. Plywood from wingnut wood can be also used in various applications based on the mechanical properties tested.

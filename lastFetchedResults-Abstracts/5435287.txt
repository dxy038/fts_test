The Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) System has specially configured support ships for supporting the DSRV during rescue missions. If one of these prime support platforms is not available to provide the necessary support within the desired time span, an alternate support ship, called a Ship-of-Opportunity (S00), will be needed to tow a manned DSRV to the submarine disaster site. The DSRV will be towed on the surface in shallow water and submerged in deep water. The primary objective of the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle Ship of Opportunity Study (Ref. 1) was to develop the knowledge that would provide the capability to tow a DSRV to the scene of a submarine disaster.

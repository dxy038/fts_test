In this paper, a bi-objective medical center location model was proposed, in which the shortage of medical supplies and the priority for some special populations were considered while keeping the number of medical centers and the distance from the demand points to medical centers as small as possible. The proposed model can give some advises for the commanders. In order to solve the problem, the model is decomposed into two sub-models, one is a 0-1 programming (for determining the location) and the other is an integral linear programming (for determining the shipment quantity). And the two sub-models are coupled with a branch and bound algorithm and the ideals of a greedy algorithm. Several numerical simulations were carried out to test and show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

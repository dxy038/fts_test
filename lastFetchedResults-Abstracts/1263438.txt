The objective of this study is the estimation of energy consumption during various stages of broiler production and analysis the effects of numbers of chick and ventilation system type on energy efficiency of these units. Data for this study were collected from 44 growers by using a face to face questionnaire method during Januaryâ€“February 2010. Collected data were classified into three groups according to the numbers of chicks and two groups according to type of ventilation system. The effects of numbers of chicks at three levels (less 10000 bird, 10000 to 20000 bird and more 20000 bird) and ventilation system type at two levels (tunnel and cross ventilation) were analyzed on energy efficiency. The results indicated energy ratio, energy productivity and specific energy as 0.15, 0.014 kg MJ-1 and 71.95 MJ kg-1, respectively. The results of ANOVA presented that the number of chicks had significant effect on energy efficiency (P < 0.01) and level 3 (more 20000 bird) had the biggest energy ratio. The effect of ventilation system type was significant at 5% level and tunnel ventilation system used in 61% of units had the bigger energy efficiency.

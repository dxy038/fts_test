Fatigue driving has been the fatal latent danger of automobile security, so it is important to research the fatigue driving detection method to improve the traffic security condition. EEG can reflect the driver´s brain activity directly. It is the most precise and objective method for fatigue driving detection. According to the character of EEG, the method of wavelet packet sub-band energy ratio to detect fatigue driving is presented. With analyzing the EEG, which is collected in simulate driving condition. The energy ratio of wave and slow wave is computed by wavelet packet coefficient and it is defined as F value. The experiment result showed the different subject has different F value, but to the same subject, F value is decrease with the driving time and fatigue level. The attenuation level compared with normal state can reflect the driver´s fatigue level.

A robust design method applied to microgyroscope is presented which is of automation, efficiency and accuracy. The design target is to maximize the microgyroscope performance, within minimum variation of performance due to uncertainties caused by fabricating errors. Analysis of the tolerance is used to calculate the nominal value and the transmitted variation of the objective function, and the genetic algorithm with advantage of global optimization is employed for the optimal process. Compared with stochastic optimization and sensitivity analysis investigated in previous studies, proposed method in this paper can reach more accurate results with lower computational cost. Robustness analyses of optimization and robustness show robust optimum is less sensitive to errors than deterministic optimization. Also, Monte Carlo simulation is performed to check yield of robust design, and the result indicates 90% of samples are acceptable, whereas, only 50% in the deterministic optimization.

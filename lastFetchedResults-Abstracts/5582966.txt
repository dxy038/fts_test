This paper focuses on the design of a holistic model that represents the dynamics of technology within an innovative organization. The cardinal objective is to promote strategic thinking by helping the managers to recognize and design alternative business strategies to manage uncertainty. In this research, principles of system dynamics and cybernetics have been used to develop the causal loop diagrams and flow diagrams. The influence of variables viz., competent R&amp;D staffs present and future fail rates, the impacts of R&amp;D capability, technology exploration and exploitation, upon the performance of the organization was studied. The effect of critical success factor, namely, time varying competence training is incorporated in the model and dynamic simulation has been carried out. The results were used to obtain alternatives to capitalize on the opportunities and improve the organizationÂ´s competitiveness

This paper presents a shunt single-phase active filter controlled by the TMS320F240 DSP, programmed in assembler language, providing a very quick action from the control system in the power system. As the most part of the control is implemented in software, the hardware becomes very cheap and small in the control system. This work has the objective to improve the quality of the energy in low power loads (commercial and residential use) with a low cost, allowing the quality of the energy not only in industrial places, but in every place which has harmonic distortion.

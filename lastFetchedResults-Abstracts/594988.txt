Objective: To evaluate the safety and cost affectively of single layer interrupted intestinal anastomosis in comparison with the double layer conventional methods of intestinal anastomosis.Material and Methods: This was a comparative prospective study, conducted in Saidu group of teaching hospital Swat (NWFP) from Feb 2001 to Dec 2002. Total of 113 patients were included in the study. They were divided into two groups I and II. The data was collected from emergency as well as from OPD patients admitted for elective list. In group I containing 52 patients (36-Males and 16- Females) single layer anastomosis was constructed, while in group II contained 61 patients (43-Males and 18-Females) double layer conventional anastomosis were fashioned. Age of group II ranged from 9 years to 60 years with the mean of 34.5 years. The suture material was vicryl (poly galactin 910) 2/0 on round bodied needle. In group II the outer layer (Lambert suture) was done with silk 2/0 on round body needle. The same antibiotics were used in both groups. The safety of both the technique were analysed in terms of morbidity and mortality.Results: One patient in group I while 8 patients in group II developed leakage. Five patients in group II re-explored and stomal diversion performed. Two patients in group II died of sepsis and multi organ failure. Mortality in group I was 0% while in group II it was 3.27%.Conclusion: The study shows that there was low incidence of anastomotic failure and septic complications in group I (single layer) as compared with the double conventional methods of gut anastomosis. Hence the single layer anastomosis is safe and cost effective.

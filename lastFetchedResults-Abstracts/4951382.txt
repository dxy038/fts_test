Providing nested mobile networks with network mobility (NEMO) capabilities is of considerable challenges, because NEMO introduces far more complex mobility scenarios than node mobility. In this paper, a novel NEMO support protocol with hierarchical routing architecture is proposed, which includes both global routing and intra-NEMO routing. Moreover, a generic solution for intra-NEMO routing is introduced, according to which a routing header containing the path information can be constructed for packets to traverse the nested mobile network. The proposed protocol achieves the following advantages: (1) it provides the so-called nested mobility support with bidirectional end-to-end route optimization solution, completely avoiding tunnel in the tunnel problem; (2) the optimization of intra-NEMO routing is addressed; (3) its hierarchical architecture enables localizing the mobility management of local handoff, then lessening disruption to ongoing sessions; and (4) it is compatible with existing protocols, then few modifications to existing entities are required. Performance analysis indicates that our solution can significantly reduce end-to-end packet delay and local handoff delay while keeping the processing and signaling overheads relatively low.

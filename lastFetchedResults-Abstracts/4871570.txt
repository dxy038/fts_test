Movement interaction devices offer important capabilities to create learning systems where students are able to interact with them through natural movements and gestures. In this paper, we present a system based on Kinect, whose main objective is to improve and train two important studentsÂ´ faculties: memory and motor abilities. The system is inspired on the Simon Says game where students have to repeat postures that the system shows previously. By means of this educational technique, young students and students with low disabilities may find the system an adequate environment to improve their memory and motor disabilities in addition to rehabilitation centers, such us hospitals and clinics. They can perform rehabilitation exercises in the same place and in the same way where their classmates train similar faculties.

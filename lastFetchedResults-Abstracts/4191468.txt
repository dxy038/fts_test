STRATEGIC OPTIONS is a prototype software system for the strategic planning of survivable interoffice networks. STRATEGIC OPTIONS considers 1:1 diverse protection with hubbing, as well as three types of synchronous optical network (SONET) self-healing rings: unidirectional, two-fiber bidirectional, and four-fiber bidirectional. STRATEGIC OPTIONS has three main software modules: the bundler, and ring selector, and the topology optimizer. These modules are described. Inputs include nodes, links, facility hierarchy, and multi-year point-to-point demands, together with the costs of fiber material and splicing, route mileage and multiplexers and regenerators of different rates. The outputs are a set of near-optimal rings based on cost, including types and rates, fiber span sizes and counts, regenerator locations and speeds, the topology, and the network cost. In addition, the software outputs the time in the planning period each ring and fiber span should be installed

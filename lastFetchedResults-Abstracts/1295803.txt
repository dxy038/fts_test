Manufacturing or service systems with multiple product classes, job circulation due to random failures, resources shared between product classes, and some portions of the manufacturing or assembly carried in series and the rest in parallel are commonly observed in real-life. The web server assembly is one such manufacturing system which exhibits the above characteristics. Predicting the performance measures of these manufacturing systems is not an easy task. The primary objective of this research was to propose analytical approximations to predict the flow times of the manufacturing systems, with the above characteristics, and evaluate its accuracy. The manufacturing system is represented as a network of queues. The parametric decomposition approach is used to develop analytical approximations for a system with arrival and service rates from a Markovian distribution. The results from the analytical approximations are compared to simulation models. In order to bridge the gap in error, correction terms were developed through regression modeling. The experimental study conducted indicates that the analytical approximations along with the correction terms can serve as a good estimate for the flow times of the manufacturing systems with the above characteristics.

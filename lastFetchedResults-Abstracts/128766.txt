BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dermoid cyst of testis is very rare in post-pubertal age which testicular sparing surgery can be done. There are different methods of treatment (radical orchiectomy, partial orchiectomy) for these cases. In this study, we present a case of dermoid cyst of testis which responded to partial orchiectomy.
CASE: An 18 year old man referred to hospital with a painless left testicular mass (1.5 to 2 cm nontender firm mass in center of left testis) since one year prior to admission. Sonography showed a 1.5 to 2 cm hypoechoic mass in left testis and blood tumor markers (alfa .F. protein and (beta). H.C.G) were normal. Patient was operated by a left inguinal incision and there was a thick wall encapsulated, whitish keratin filled cyst, which only cyst was enucleated and testis was saved. Pathology report was dermoid cyst and up to 2 years after surgery patient had no recurrence.
CONCLUSION: In patients with tumor of testis and all work-ups are in favor of benign lesion, testicular sparing surgery can be done.

Context and objective: There are stories in Medias and scientific and
political communities’ organizations that acquire nuclear weapons. The latest
and the most catastrophic kind of terrorism is nuclear terrorism. This paper
deals with nuclear terrorism and strategies to combat it with an international
approach.
Methodology: This paper is descriptive- analytic and library based.
Findings: Since now nuclear terrorism in its narrow sense the use of nuclear
weapons by terrorist groups- has not happened; but in its other instances, it has
largely happened. Nuclear terrorism has become one of the biggest problems
and concerns in the international level. This concern is serious that former
UN secretary General Kofi Annan on 1 October 2001 at the General assembly
stated that “a terrorist attack with nuclear weapons can kill millions while the
world was not even able to prevent the 11 September terrorist attacks.” In
addition, in his last major report in 2005, he considered the nuclear terrorism
a global treat and the future challenge of international community.
Also, the presidents of many western countries believe that nuclear terrorism
is the greatest treat to their national security.
Results: Security council Resolution 1540 in 2004, amending the convention
on physical protection of Nuclear Materials and ratifying the International
Convention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism are among activities that
have been done in international level to deal with terrorism

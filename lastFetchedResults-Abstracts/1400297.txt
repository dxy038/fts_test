Boron carbide is one of the hardest materials with diamond-like mechanical properties, and is already used for a variety of applications including armor plating, blasting nozzles, and mechanical seal faces, as well as for grinding and cutting tools. It is produced on an industrial scale by classical carbothermal reduction of boric oxides at high temperatures, but the formation of pure boron carbide in processed forms, such as films and fibers, is difficult. As an alternative to high-temperature powder techniques, there is recently great interest in the development of polymer precursors to produce ceramic materials. The aim of the present work is to develop a cost effective and low-temperature manufacturing process to synthesize boron carbide from cheap and easily available raw materials. The initial objective of our research is the design and synthesis of a new type of boron–carbon polymer, which would serve as precursor for boron carbide. The polymeric precursor is synthesized by the reaction of boric acid and polyvinyl alcohol that after pyrolysis at 400 °C and 800 °C gives boron carbide. The polymeric precursor and its pyrolyzed products are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray diffraction shows that boron carbide (B4C) obtained from this method has an orthorhombic crystal structure. It is a unique low-temperature (∼400 °C) synthetic route for boron carbide.

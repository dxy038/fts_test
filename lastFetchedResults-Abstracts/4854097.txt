A control method is proposed with the objective of maximizing the energy transference in permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). Such control is based on the evaluation of instantaneous power components as well as of the optimization strategies to obtain the generator reference currents. Two possibilities are studied in the present work: with connection and without connection to neutral, for generators with three different EMF waveforms. In addition, two possibilities for each connection type are also presented in this effort. The first strategy has the main objective of generating at constant power and with minimum losses. On the other hand, the main objective of the second strategy is to get the maximum power while preserving the generator thermal limits. Simulation results are presented and analyzed to validate the proposed strategies. From these results, it can be concluded that when neutral is connected, it is possible to take advantage of the homopolar components of the generator EMF by imposing and adequate current with the objective of maximizing the generator power.

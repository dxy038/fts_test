In this paper simultaneous coordinated design of (P-&#969;) dual-channel PSS, AVR and TCSC-based POD controller is researched for the first time. The purpose of proposed coordination is to enhance power system overall stability including oscillation stability achieved by dual-channel PSS in coordination with FACTS device and also transient stability accomplished via contributively influences of all controllers especially AVR. The design problem is based on power system state space model and the coordination is focused on concurrent selection of adaptable gains and time constants of controllers using PSO algorithm by minimizing the multi-objective function that is defined based on linear model. From outlook of eigenvalue evaluation, the aim of design is to relocate unstable or weakly damped electromechanical oscillation modes inside desired area in the complex plane to fulfill the damping criteria. In order to compare transient performance of proposed controllers illustratively with the CPSS-TCSC coordinated controllers, time domain simulations are carried out on SMIB test system under different disturbances. The results manifest that great advancement in overall stability of the power system has acquired by employing proposed coordinated controllers.

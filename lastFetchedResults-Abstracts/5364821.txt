Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) is a contactless method interested in conductivity properties of the object. In MIT system, excitation coil plays an important role since it generate primary field which then will propagate through the object (in this case is biological tissues) going to be imaged. The main problem in MIT is the magnitude of primary field is very large compare to secondary field generate by the tissue due to tissues low conductivity. This primary field besides disturb the detected secondary signal at the receiver, it also introduce interference to the neighbour´s circuit. The main objective of this research is to design an excitation coil which has the capability of focusing the primary field only to the object while at the same time reducing the interference to the neighbour´s circuit. The simulation results have shown that through the design, the primary field can be focused and the interference can be reduced.

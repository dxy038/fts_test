Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the nutritional status of hospitalized elderly and
verify if calf circumference can be a tool to monitor nutritional status in this population. Methods: A total of 170
inpatients (79 men and 91 women) aged more than 60 years were assessed. Anthropometric and dietary
assessments were done according to standard procedures. The software STATISTICA 6.0 was used for the
statistical analysis. The confidence interval was set at 95% and significance level at 5% (p<0.05). Results: Body
mass index assessment revealed a high rate of underweight patients (45.3%), and arm circumference and triceps
skinfold revealed a high prevalence of depletion. Males had more lean mass according to the mid-arm muscle
circumference (p=0.017) and mid-arm muscle area (p=0.01), and females presented higher triceps skinfold values
(p<0.001). There was a positive correlation between calf circumference and Body Mass Index (p<0.001), arm
circumference (p=0.001), triceps skinfold (p=0.001), mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.001), and mid-arm
muscle area (p=0.001). Conclusion: This study found a positive correlation between calf circumference and
nutritional status of assessed patients indicating that this measurement can be used as a complementary tool for
monitoring the nutritional status of elderly inpatients

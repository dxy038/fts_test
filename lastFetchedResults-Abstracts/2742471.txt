The objective of this article is to make a correction to our previously published results [1] on the adaptive vibration suppression system. The vibration suppression system consists of a piezoelectric actuator of electric impedance Z<sub>S</sub>, which is connected to an active shunt circuit of electric impedance Z. In this situation, the effective spring constant of the piezoelectric actuator K<sub>eff</sub> is controlled by the value of the connected shunt impedance Z. It is shown in the article [1] that when the effective spring constant of the piezoelectric actuator K<sub>eff</sub> reaches small values (ideally zero value), the transmissibility of vibrations through the piezoelectric element greatly decreases.

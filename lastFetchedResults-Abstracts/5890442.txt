Wavelet Transform Coding Scheme is very promising due to its high coding efficiency. The coder of this scheme provides the coded bit stream can be truncated at any point adapting to best effort delivery of network. In this work, we investigate R-D (Rate-Distortion) model for each subband based on statistical property of coefficients. Then, a constrained bitrate allocation method is derived by exploiting the R-D performance of the coder. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provides bitrate-distortion tradeoff, and achieves target bitrate allocation and guarantees both good subjective and objective quality.

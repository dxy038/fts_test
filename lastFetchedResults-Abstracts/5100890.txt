Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been widely used in biological studies like tissue and cells characterization, both in vivo and in vitro. The objective of this study was to investigate cells adhesion over a microelectrodes array by monitoring the electrical impedance. A comprehensive electrical model of the cell-electrode interface has been used to fit experimental data. The electrode surface coverage has been evaluated both with the variation of impedance measurements and with the variation of parameters extracted from the electrical model. A cover factor &#946; has been used in the model in order to quantify the presence of different number of cells over an electrode surface.

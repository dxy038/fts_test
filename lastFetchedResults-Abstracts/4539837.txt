The objective of this work is to use an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the sizing parameters of photovoltaic (PV) system with a minimum of input data. A neural network has been trained by using 54 known sizing parameter data corresponding to 54 locations. In this way the network was trained to accept and even handle a number of unusual cases. Known data were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of prediction. A prediction with maximum deviation of 6% was obtained. This result indicates that the proposed method can successfully be used for the estimation of sizing parameters data for any locations.

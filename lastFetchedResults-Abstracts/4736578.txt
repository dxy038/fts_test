A soft-switched AC-AC converter with a bidirectional four-quadrant active power transfer capability is proposed in this paper. In this topology, the energy of switch capacitors is retrieved and delivered to the high voltage side. In addition, this topology provides zero voltage switching (ZVS) turn on/off for main switches and zero current switching (ZCS) turn on and ZVS turn-off for auxiliary switches. The design procedure is provided and the performance of the proposed converter is evaluated on a 250 kHz, 1 kW prototype.

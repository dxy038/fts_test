This paper deals with analysis of the evoked response of a sensory nerve signal in the time-frequency domain due to mechanical perturbations. The objective of the project is to determine whether other than amplitude information can be extracted from the sensory neural activity (ENG) to classify the mechanical events. Wavelet analysis has been applied because of its inherent capability to analyse non-stationary signals such as ENG

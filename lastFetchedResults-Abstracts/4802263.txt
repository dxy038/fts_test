This investigation uses particle swam optimization (PSO) approach to calculate the reliability index. PSO can search the extreme point of the complex objective function more effectively in contrast to tradition optimization algorithm. According to PC pipe piles static test data in Wuhan, both statistics analysis and reliability analysis of the bearing capacity of single PC pipe pile are made by using the limit state equation of dimensionless random variables. PSO method and JC method are used to calculate the index of reliability of the single PC pipe pile. By PSO, the reliability of the nonlinear and complex performance function of geotechnical engineering can be obtained without derivation only uses the objective function value.

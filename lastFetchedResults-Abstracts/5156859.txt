The intelligent analysis of Databases may be affected by the presence of unimportant features, which motivates the application of Feature Selection. By treating this task as a search and optimization process, it is possible to use the synergy between Genetic Algorithms and Multi-objective Optimization to carry out the search for (quasi) optimal subsets of features considering possible conflicting importance criteria. This work presents an application of Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms to the Feature Selection problem, combining different criteria measuring the importance of the subsets of features.

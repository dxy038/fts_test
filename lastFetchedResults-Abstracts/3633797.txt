The application of transform coding using trellis coded quantization (TCQ) to encode monochrome and color images is investigated. Specifically, TCQ is used to encode transform coefficients resulting from applying a 16 &#215; 16 discrete cosine transform (DCT) to 8-b gray level and 24-b color images. For the color images, the red, green, and blue (RGB) planes are transformed into the NTSC transmission primaries (Y,I,and Q) before the DCT is applied. Rate allocation schemes for encoding the transform coefficients and side information are presented and discussed. The generalized Lloyd algorithm and the entropy-constrained vector quantizer design algorithm are used to design fixed-rate and entropy-constrained codebooks. The entropy-constrained designs result in a low-complexity system with objective performance rivaling that of many coding schemes from the literature

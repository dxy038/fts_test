This paper reviews a modal solution of the single mode Step Index fiber and Polarization Maintaining fiber based on the analysis and simulation with FEM lab which reflects a significant way of propagating signals with less power consumptions as the Polarization Maintaining Fiber the Panda Fiber has been selected depending upon the comparative analysis. The main objective of this paper is to make an analytical view on these two types of fibers and show how much they can contribute in propagating signal with very low power losses. The electric and magnetic field intensity as well as the time averaged power flow are also a significant issue and factors in this analysis which enable us to select the polarization maintaining fiber for optical communications.

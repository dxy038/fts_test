A personnel consultant company provides services to employers by recommending suitable applicants to them. The selection of applicants is a time consuming and non-routine process which requires professional analysis and judgement. The experience of the personnel officers is important in providing fast and good service to the employers. Inexperienced officers may require longer to search for qualified applicants. Different officers may have different judgement on the same applicant. It is valuable for the personnel consultant agents to have an expert system which can assist personnel officers in the selection of suitable applicant. The expert system employs the cumulative past experience as knowledge that helps to perform fast searching of eligible applicants with a consistent and objective selection scheme. This paper describes the analysis design and implementation of an expert system that facilitates the above features. The system adopts some new system integration techniques which include OLE, DDE and DLL to link database statistical packages in a unified system. The database system integration is required for a large data and knowledge repository. The computation package integration is needed for more efficient mathematical calculation. These integration techniques enhance the limited capability usually offered by an single expert system development environment

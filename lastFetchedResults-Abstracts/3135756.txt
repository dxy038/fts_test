At the very outset it is important to realize that the requirements and the very origins of most of the technology that we take for granted today such as air travel, the internet, remotely operated subsurface recovery vessels etc lie in the fact that these technologies came into being in trying to cater to the requirements of the Military. As a military might India by itself is required to fend for such technological wants by treading the path of indigenous production of military supplies. Indigenisation is a continuous process, which is realized through Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D), Transfer of Technology (TOT) and Reverse Engineering (RE). As far as defence is concerned, Navy was the first one to provide impetus to indigenisation with the commissioning of INS Nilgiri way back in 1972. Ever since then, Navy in collaboration with the Indian Industries has successfully indigenised large number of combatants and equipment towards realizing the ultimate objective of total self reliance.

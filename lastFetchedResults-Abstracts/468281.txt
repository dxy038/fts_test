Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare cytologic findings of fluid from ovarian cysts with ovarian histologic findings. Study Design: Ovaries submitted for pathologic examination were grossly examined for ovarian cysts. Fluid was removed by needle aspiration from intact ovarian cysts and prepared for cytologic examination. The cytologic findings were categorized as benign, malignant, indeterminate, and nondiagnostic. Histologic classification was assigned using the guidelines established by the World Health Organization. A single pathologist evaluated each cytologic specimen and was blinded to the gross appearance and histologic findings of each ovary. Cytologic diagnoses were compared with the histologic diagnoses. Results: The study material consisted of 105 ovaries from 98 women. A comparison of the ovarian histologic findings with the cytologic diagnosis was performed in 89 of 105 cases. Histologic examination of the ovaries revealed 89 benign ovarian tumors and 13 ovarian carcinomas. The sensitivity of ovarian cyst cytologic evaluation was 25%, and the specificity was 90%. The false-positive rate for ovarian cytologic evaluation was 73%, and the false-negative rate was 12%. Conclusions: Cytologic examination of aspirated ovarian cyst fluid does not accurately predict ovarian histologic findings. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:550-3.)

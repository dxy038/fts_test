We present a diffusion model adapted to an operational control of flying insects. The operational objective entails working with non-homogeneous regions and the corresponding non-uniform diffusion tensors. It the becomes necessary to study the problem of scale in order to justify the diffusion equation. We show that in typical cases, the spatial resolution must be coarser than 20 m and we have specified the appropriated time scales. We propose a method for computing the tensors at the given resolution, in relation to the landscape and the insectsâ€™ species and a method for the numerical solution of the equations and present two applications

This work presents a numerical model of radiofrequency heating of the cornea in order to achieve permanent changes in its topography. The model is based on the finite element method. The first objective was to assess the free convection effect of aqueous humor during the heating procedure. The results reveal that the free convection of the fluid in the anterior chamber is not negligible. A comparison with different convection conditions reveals a difference of up to 4.5&#176;C (at endothelium) between cases. The second objective was to modify the model to simulate radiofrequency thermokeratoplasty with cooled radiofrequency electrodes. In this case, results indicate that temperature profile is suitable, and only presents significant differences near to endothelium and in the anterior chamber

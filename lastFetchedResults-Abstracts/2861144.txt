The paper considers a given discrete-time linear dynamic in closed loop with a piecewise affine control law defined over a bounded polyhedral partition of the state space &#967;. The objective is to describe the largest error affecting the control law coefficients over each region in the above partition, for which the positive invariance of the set &#967; is guaranteed with respect to the closed loop dynamics. This subset describes in fact a robust invariance margin with respect to a subset of closed-loop parameters and subsequently represents the explicit fragility margin of the given piecewise affine controller. The fragility characterizes the impact of an error in the implementation of a given controller. It is shown that the largest subset of errors in the state feedback gains is represented by a polyhedral set explicitly constructed with operations over convex domains. A series of remarks on the structure of the numerical problems are discussed and an example is provided for illustration.

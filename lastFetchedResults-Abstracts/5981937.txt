The objective of computer supported knowledge aided collaborative conceptual design (CSKACCD) is to aid group design activities semi-automatically or automatically with multidisciplinary knowledge. This paper presents a general distributed design system model to give a global view of CSKACCD, and then designs a constraint-based distributed knowledge representation model based on different constraints abstracted from the domain specific knowledge of the designing artifact. Finally, this paper describes a robust distributed conflict detection and resolution mechanism developed for different designers to interact with each other effectively

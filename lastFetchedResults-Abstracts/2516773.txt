This paper aims to present a conceptual model to evaluate the performance of science and technology diplomacy at national level. It is divided into two parts: the first part is an introductory to the multidisciplinary field of “Science and Technology Diplomacy “and its relations with “Security Studies” and “Innovation Economics” and other similar fields. In the second part, the paper develops a conceptual model with two pillars: security doctrine and Innovation System. The selected Innovation System approach here is functional upon which based on its seven innovation functions, researchers can analyze S&T cooperation. The result is finally evaluated on the basis of increasing or decreasing the factor of “power as an instrument “and the factor of “power as an objective” of a nation at international level

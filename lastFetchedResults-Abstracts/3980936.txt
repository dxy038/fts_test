This paper is part of an ongoing activity of the IEEE Application of Probability Methods Subcommittee to advance the probabilistic methods used to analyze bulk power system (BPS) reliability. The objective of the Task Force is to develop a set of guidelines for measuring delivery point reliability. This involves reviewing published literature and other documentation of existing procedures, definitions, and indices. This report presents the results of the Task Force efforts to compile a useful set of terms and procedures for consistent reporting of BPS delivery point reliability

With the increasing share of distributed generation in electrical energy supply, the proper planning procedure for using these units, has become more vital for power system planners. In this paper, the application of multi-objective optimization techniques for siting, sizing and determination of the proper technology to be used, has been investigated in such a way that, the load demand during the planning horizon is met and the technical and environmental constraints are satisfied. Unlike the traditional optimization methods used in power system optimization, NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm does not consider techno-economical and environmental parameters in the constraints of optimization problem. This method optimizes them simultaneously as multiple cost functions to find out non-dominated solutions set, named Pareto optimal front, instead of aiming to find single solution.

This paper presents an optimal design method to maximize the efficiency of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. To do this, the efficiency of the motor is taken as the objective function, and the genetic algorithm is used as the optimization algorithm to find the optimal design variables of the objective function. To make a more accurate prediction of performance possible, the air gap flux density and d, q axis inductances obtained by an analytical method are compensated by using the results from FEM studies

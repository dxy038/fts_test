With the advances of robust and high-speed wireless connectivity a new paradigm called"Aeronautical Networks" is beginning to take shape globally. Programs lead by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), EUROCONTROL and Networking the Sky for Civil Aeronautical Communications (NEWSKY) are all including the aeronautical platform as part of the network. The objective is to provide a low delay and cost effective data network to an aeronautical platform. Most of current systems use a satellite for connecting a aeronautical platform. Satellite resources are limited, expensive and offer limited data throughput as compared to a terrestrial networks. In this paper current and future prospects of such a data network are discussed in terms of cross interoperability with a terrestrial backbone. The result of a notional network capacity analysis is presented. Channel model specific to an aeronautical platform for a wideband system is discussed. Connectivity and robustness of an Aeronautical based Network, both as a relay for terrestrial networks and to provide in-flight internet is discussed.

We propose a joint power control and quality aware routing scheme for rechargeable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that are characterized by a high degree of spatial and temporal variations of energy resources. The proposed scheme adapts the energy consumption in the nodes to meet their corresponding energy resources with the objective of attaining network wide reliability of operations. This is achieved by dynamically controlling the transmission powers and route selection. Some initial performance evaluations are presented from experimental studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

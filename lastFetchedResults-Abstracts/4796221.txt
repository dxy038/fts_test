The objective of this paper is to identify the necessary practical measures to prevent the efficiency of a machine being adversely affected by rewinding. The repair industry has always responded to meet the changing needs and expectations of itÂ´s customers and will continue to do so, with the introduction of the AEMT/DETR Good Practice Guide Best Practices to Maintain Energy Efficiency. For the repair companies with well documented procedures, operating to BS EN ISO 9002 the requirements of the Good Practice Guide will mean minor amendments to existing procedures. When these are combined with training and implementation programs for the total workforce, together they will ensure that the best practices are effectively adopted throughout the repair industry

This paper deals with the design of filters for processing data obtained from arrays of sensors used for signal measurements in a variety of applications. The objective of the filters is to optimally suppress undesired signals intercepting the array, while at the same time to preserve the desired signal that the array is attempting to measure. A constrained minimization problem is formulated for determining the filterÂ´s coefficients, and the computational requirements necessary for designing and applying the filters are kept to a minimum. When compared to the widely used delay-and-sum and Chebyshev methods, this technique is shown to have a superior frequency reject response which becomes more apparent if the array has a relatively small number of sensors. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the method, two examples on applying the filters for processing synthetic and real seismic data are worked out in detail.

Summary form only given. In a continuing effort to increase network capacity while reducing recurring capital costs, MCI is performing field trials in conjunction with two major transmission equipment manufacturers on production quality OC-192, 2 X 2 (four wavelength) bidirectional optical line amplifiers, and passive optical dispersion compensation techniques. The objective of this trial is to confirm the technology performance and identify deployment implications to the network in a field environment. The OC-192 terminals and regenerators with power amplifiers, receiver preamplifiers, bidirectional line amplifiers, and fiber Bragg grating technologies are being field tested on a 443-km route. These technologies will be deployed on all MCI fiber types (NDSF, DSF, LS). MCI does not endorse only wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) as the solution to increasing network capacity, but rather the use of the combination merits of both high-speed TDM and WDM along with bidirectional line amplification

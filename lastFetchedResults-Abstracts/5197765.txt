A baseline objective on the availability of a local-exchange network due to failures (not including the effects of blocking due to traffic congestion) is provided. This end-to-end objective is derived from availability objectives which have been set for the segments of BellcoreÂ´s Client Company networks. A simple hypothetical reference connection for the local-exchange network is first given. Next, the baseline end-to-end network availability performance objective is derived. Application of the end-to-end and segment objectives to network architectures and equipment reference models that will provide existing and new services are discussed

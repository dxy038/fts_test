This paper presents the algorithm for speed control of a separately excited dc motor (SEDCM) drive with fuzzy self-organizing. The objective is to design the system that can learn, increase, reduce and modify rule in knowledge base or rule base to suit the case and set response within acceptable area. The concepts about state analyze and performance measure are used to determine the modification rule in the knowledge base. The structure of fuzzy self-organizing controller consists of self-organizing control, dc chopper and speed sensor devices. For the control method, the close loop speed techniques are applied. The fuzzy self-organizing algorithm is experimented by controlling the speed of separately excited dc motor. The rules of fuzzy self-organizing with separately excited dc motor is to see response when load is changed.

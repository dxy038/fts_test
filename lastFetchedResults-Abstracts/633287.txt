This paper considers a stochastic online scheduling problem in which a set of independent jobs are to
be processed on a single machine. Each job has a processing time, which is a random variable with
normal distribution. All the jobs arrive overtime, which means that the existence and the parameters of
each job including its processing time specifications and weight are unknown until its release date.
Moreover, the actual processing time of each job is unknown until its completion. During the
processing, jobs are allowed to be preempted and restarted later. So, the processing time devoted to the
job before the preemption is lost and considered as preemption penalty. The objective is to minimize
the expected value of the total weighted completion time. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, a
heuristic algorithm is proposed in this paper and is validated using numerical examples. The proposed
method utilizes the properties of the normal distribution but it can be used as a heuristic for other
distributions, as long as their means and variances are available.

This work describes a novel approach to the base station deployment problem based on artificial immune systems. It is a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOP), since it involves a large number of variables and design constraints. The multi-objective optimisation algorithms based on artificial immune systems (MO-AIS) are a new class of evolutionary algorithms. The Binary-coded Multi-objective Optimisation Algorithm (BRMOA) is presented and is the basis of the new optimisation strategy. The procedure is applied to a realistic scenario. Preliminary results are presented and a thorough analysis is provided. Results are compared to previous works and indicate the feasibility of the optimisation strategy in solving a base station deployment problem.

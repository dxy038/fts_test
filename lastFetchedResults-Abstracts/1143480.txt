Salting is one of the basic procedures in food processing. The NaCl concentration influences water holding properties, viscosity, texture, emulsification, etc. It is important to study and model mixing processes by mathematical methods to predict properties of the matrix and the food quality. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model of mixing of salt and meat in a bowl cutter and verify this with experimental data. The bowl cutter is described as a continuous stirred tank reactor, combined with a plug flow reactor in a repetitive series-model. The theoretical model shows that 30 rounds are sufficient to get a salt concentration in the whole bulk of meat with a deviation between maximum and minimum values of about 5%. The comparison of the theoretically predicted salt gradient and the experimental results showed that the mathematical equation developed is appropriate to describe the process.

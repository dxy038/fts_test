In this paper, the design variables of the contacts with two segments coil AMF for a vacuum interrupter (VI), such as the contact diameter, the coil height, the coil thickness and the slot number of the contact were taken as the main design parameters in the orthogonal experiment. And by normalization, the AMF characteristic was numerically simulated using 3D finite element analysis and taken as the objective function. For improving the AMF characteristic, mutation cancellation niche genetic algorithm (MCNGA) was applied to optimize the weight ratio and the contact parameters. Furthermore, the optimal AMF contact parameters, the quantitative relationship between the AMF characteristic and the contact parameters were obtained. Moreover, the optimal AMF performance was obtained.

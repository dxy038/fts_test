BACKGROUND: Angioplasty of coronary vessels is one of the basic and elective treatments for
many patients with coronary diseases. The main objective of the present study was to survey the
effective factors on patients' decision to undergo angioplasty from the viewpoint of patients.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 30 angioplasty candidates were selected using
convenience sampling. Data was collected by a researcher-made questionnaire consisting of five
demographic questions and ten questions about factors affecting the decision to undergo
angioplasty. The respondents scored the importance of each item as very high, high, medium,
low, and very low. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-
Wallis tests in SPSS.
RESULTS: Financial problems were considered as an important barrier against undergoing
angioplasty by 26 participants (86.7%). History of unpleasant experience was of little
importance for 15 patients. Financial problems and existence of fear and anxiety were the most
important factors and history of an unpleasant experience and high age were the least
important. Fear was more effective on women than men (P = 0.37). Type of insurance was more
important for patients with high school diploma or university degree (P = 0.33).
CONCLUSION: Since financial problems and fear and anxiety were effective on the decision to
undergo angioplasty, arrangements need to be made to eliminate such factors and to prepare
patients with heart diseases to better accept angioplasty.

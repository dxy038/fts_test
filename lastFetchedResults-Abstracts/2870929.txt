In this paper, a single-phase current-source-type bidirectional converter topology for V2G applications is proposed. The proposed converter offers bidirectional power flow between the battery and the grid in buck or boost mode and expands the output voltage range, so it can be compatible with different voltage levels. The topology structure and operating principles of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail. An indirect control algorithm is used to realize the charging and discharging of battery. Finally the semiconductor losses and system efficiency are analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed topology.

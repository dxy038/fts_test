The successive linearization optimization, incision plane, little-step grads and two-rank linearization solution method was introduced. For a problem with two-rank objective function and constraint function, three times of solving linearization problem achieves the optimization point nearly same as extremum point by successive linearization optimization. The method has the characteristic of gradual optimization. The computing result shows that the isoline of simplified linear function is not tangency with the isoline of original function. It is different from the conclusion that assuming their tangency as a matter of course.

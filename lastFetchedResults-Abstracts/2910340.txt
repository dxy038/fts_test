This paper analyzes LTE-A Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) performance in terms of usual Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency and Electromagnetic Field (EMF) exposure. The main objective is to identify network deployment rules that would allow achieving optimal performance from multiple key indicators taking into account a realistic forecast of wireless data traffic demand growth. This study relies on simulation results obtained with an innovative network coverage and analysis tool taking into account both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). In particular, EMF exposure sources resulting respectively from the base-station and the User Equipment (UE) transmissions are jointly analyzed. The main outcome is the characterization of HetNet with different small-cell deployment strategies against a realistic network traffic growth over a period of five years. EMF exposure, which is of growing importance, is in particular reduced with small-cell densification as long as the user traffic demand remains well under the network capacity.

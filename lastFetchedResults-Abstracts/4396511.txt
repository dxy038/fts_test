The intelligent scheduling system has been proposed in this study and successfully applied to the scheduling of a screw manufacturer located at Taiwan, we aim added a concept of multi-objective optimization into practical scheduling system to promote the efficient of schedule and production. In order to meet userÂ´s requirement, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) with a multi-objective design was adopted as a core technique of this intelligent system. It differs from traditional GA scheduling solution, our model capable of avoided incorrectly assigned a job to infeasible machine; thus, special designs in evolution process of GA are not required. A real case study was introduced in this paper, and the proposed model has been tested with 100 work orders, the empirical results were indicated that the proposed approach outperforms manual scheduling, regardless of the total orders completed time, machine retooling times, and the average load rate of machine.

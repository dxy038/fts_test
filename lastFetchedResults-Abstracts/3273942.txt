The ultimate goal of the movie industry is to create an emotion from a story. However it is difficult to measure this emotional impact on an user. Questionnaires or other audience measurement techniques are often used, but with well known biases difficult to remove. We propose here an objective solution based on the viewer\´s physiological response (aka the EDA or GSR signals). The demonstration consists of an on the fly and live capture of an user\´s physiological signals, corresponding to his unconscious body reaction, and the real-time computing and display of the corresponding user\´s "affective profile".

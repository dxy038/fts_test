A highly efficient receiver, called the RAKE with bidirectional decision-feedback receiver, for M -ary biorthogonal keying (MBOK) direct-sequence ultra-wideband (UWB) radio is proposed. Based on a compact signal model for UWB channel dispersion over many consecutive symbols, the proposed receiver is designed to cancel all the post- and precursor intersymbol interferences as well as multicode interference at symbol rate. For practical implementation, a fast computation algorithm is also derived. Under the 802.15.3a CM2 and CM4 UWB channels, simulation results show the receiver can attain a near-optimum performance in terms of the matched filter bound, with only a moderate increase in the receiver complexity compared with the baseline RAKE receiver.

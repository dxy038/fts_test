In this paper, a new interpolation algorithm for magnifying images based on the relative color difference of pixels (RCD) is presented, with its basic principle and implementation method being discussed in detail. Its comparison with the nearest neighbor interpolator and the bilinear interpolator, in terms of some objective evaluation criteria, are also given. The simulation result indicates that our method combines strong points of the other two algorithms.

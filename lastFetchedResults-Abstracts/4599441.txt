This paper makes a lot of investigation, analysis and research about the image quality control and AHP modeling theory. Based on the theory and principle of color reproduction in color image reproductive process, a index system evaluating the quality of color image reproduction is presented. Referring to the national and industry standards, the relative evaluation standards of various indicators is given. Using the analytic hierarchy process in mathematics, it establishes a mathematics modeling of synthetical evaluation of color image reproductive quality, and designs a set of mathematics methods of synthetical evaluating image processing and color reproduction. Finally,using VB to design panels and programmes, it basically realizes the objective of simulated evaluating color images reproduction quality in computer.

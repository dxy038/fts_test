Study Objective
To describe (1) the treatment interval for adolescent females with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV); (2) the proportion treated in ≤7 days; and (3) factors influencing the treatment interval.
Design and Participants
Charts of sexually active females from an urban teen health center who participated in a larger study and were positive for CT, GC or TV (N = 58) were retrospectively reviewed for dates of treatment, and compared to demographic and symptom data. The treatment interval was defined as days from visit to treatment. CT and/or GC were analyzed together (CT/GC) because presumptive treatment covered both infections, and the diagnostic test (nucleic acid amplification) differed from that of TV (wet mount or culture).
Results
The median treatment interval was 0 days for TV, 5 days for CT/GC, and 3 days for any STI. Overall, 39 (69%) were treated within 7 days of their visit. Those with TV were more likely than those with CT/GC to receive treatment at their initial visit (58% vs. 6%). Genitourinary symptoms increased the odds of treatment in ≤7 days. The treatment interval was significantly shorter for subjects who had their prescriptions phoned to a pharmacy than for those who returned to clinic for treatment (median 2.5 vs. 8 days).
Conclusions
Where presumptive treatment was uncommon, providers were more likely to prescribe same-day therapy to symptomatic patients or those with TV on wet mount. Additional strategies are needed to improve the proportion of adolescent females treated in ≤7 days.

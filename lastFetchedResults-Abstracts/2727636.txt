In this paper, the robust synchronization problem of fuzzy complex dynamical networks is investigated. A fuzzy complex dynamical network is an extension to an uncertain complex dynamical network in which all sources of parametric uncertainties are modeled with fuzzy numbers, i.e., all nodesÂ´ dynamics are described by fuzzy differential equations (FDEs) that permit a better description of a real process occurring in the presence of inaccuracy. To resolve the synchronization problem, this paper introduces new adaptive and impulsive controllers in which globally exponential synchronization of fuzzy dynamical networks under easily verified conditions is guaranteed. Moreover, we propose an efficient method that helps to find certain suitable nodes to be impulsively controlled via pinning, noting that these nodes, in general, vary at distinct impulsive time instants. Therefore, by using adaptive controllers and applying impulsive controllers to only a small portion of nodes, the whole network will completely be synchronized to a certain objective state. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

This article describes the main challenges of implementing a Java media on demand (MoD) system. The objective of this system is to offer a complete solution for creating multimedia presentations (audio, video, text, slides) and their synchronized reproduction on the client side. This system consists of the following elements: an authoring presentation tool, a standalone MoD server application, a Web integrated MoD client, a database containing all the available media presentations, and a proprietary protocol that provides all the functionality of a VCR stream control mechanism. The Java Media Framework library (JMF) and the RTP protocol for audio and video transmission were used as development tools.

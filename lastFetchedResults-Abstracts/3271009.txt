The aim of this review paper is to emphasis Computer Aided Inspection (CAI) system for the detection of defects in food products. As the food products are being consumed directly (processed / Unprocessed) by human beings, defects in food products cause serious health hazards which insists to develop an inspection system which facilitates for food products of high quality and safety standards. CAI system provides an alternative for an automated, non-destructive and cost effective technique to accomplish accurate, fast and objective quality determination. This CAI system is based on image Analysis and processing which can be adopted in food industry. The various stages of CAI system consists of preprocessing, enhancement, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Considerable research as proven its potential for inspection and grading of fruits, meat, vegetables, grain, bakery products, confessionary products and processed food products. This paper reviews the recent development and advances of CAI in the food industry. The fundamental elements of the system and technology are examined.

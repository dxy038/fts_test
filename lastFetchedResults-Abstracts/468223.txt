Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether concentrations of activin A and corticotropin-releasing factor in amniotic fluid can identify patients at risk of fetal death. Study Design: A retrospective case-control study of women who have had a midtrimester amniocentesis was designed. Case subjects consisted of patients who had a spontaneous fetal death after the procedure, whereas the control group consisted of patients who had a normal pregnancy outcome after midtrimester amniocentesis. Dimeric activin A was measured by a specific 2-site enzyme immunoassay, and corticotropin-releasing factor was measured by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay after acidic extraction. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher’s exact test, and χ2 tests and regression analysis. Results: First, activin A was detectable in all amniotic fluid samples. Second, the concentration of activin A in amniotic fluid increased with advancing gestational age. Third, patients who subsequently had a fetal death had a higher median concentration of activin A than those with a normal pregnancy outcome (P< .01). Fourth, an amniotic fluid concentration of activin A greater than the 95th confidence interval for gestational age was found in 40% of patients who subsequently had a fetal death (odds ratio: 21.6; P< .005). Finally, the median concentration of corticotropin-releasing factor in amniotic fluid was not different in case subjects and control subjects. Conclusions: An elevated concentration of activin A in amniotic fluid identifies women at risk of fetal death. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:194-7.)

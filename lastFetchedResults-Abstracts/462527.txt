Objective: To determine whether the implementation of the Put Prevention Into Practice (PPIP) office-based system would increase the delivery rates of specific clinical preventive services among demonstration clinics.

Methods: Chart review was conducted before (n=372) and 33 to 39 months after (n=376) the implementation of the PPIP office-based system in two community health centers and three family practice residency programs in Texas. The population included all adult patients aged ≥19 years who had presented to the clinic during the study periods.

Results: Documentation of timely cholesterol screening increased from 70% to 84%; smoking assessment, from 56% to 80%; for women, up-to-date Papanicolaou smear, from 70% to 81%; annual mammograms (women aged ≥51), from 30% to 48%; and up-to-date tetanus–diphtheria immunizations, from 19% to 59%. For adults aged ≥66 years, documentation of pneumococcal immunization increased from 22% to 48%, while influenza immunizations improved, although not significantly (45% to 49%). Blood pressure screening was almost universal (99%) at baseline and at 33- to 39-month follow-up.

Conclusion: PPIP system changes were associated with an observed increase in delivery of selected clinical preventive services.

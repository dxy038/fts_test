There are pedagogical shifts in learning where self-educated are being encouraged to be active in their own learning. Educational research increasingly recognizes the fact that a significant amount of learning is happening in the informal settings. Furthermore, due to the proliferation of varieties of products, consumers need to be educated with relevant information of the products in the informal settings. Cultural background, health reasons and religious inclinations are considered influencing factors to the decision on whether to consume or not. As such, relevant information such as ingredients of the food products may provide strong inclination on the decision to purchase. Thus, consumers may benefit from mobile learning in informal setting (e.g., scanning codes to obtain further information of the ingredient of the product). Thus, the main objective of this study is to design Halal-Checker Mobile Application by using agile user centered design. Agile user centered design is the integration of User-Centered Design and agile methods. The Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technique and agile approach adapted are Contextual Design Model, User Personas and extreme programming. The results shown in this study are, (i) contextual design model and user personas and (ii) development of Halal-checker mobile application prototype using extreme programming. Future work may involve including more HCI techniques and agile approaches together in the agile user centered design methodology to improve the quality of the digital mobile artifacts.

Background: Artemisia species with common Persian name of Dermaneh are found all over Iran and are used for treatment in infectious diseases such as malaria, hepatitis and other diseases. Some Artemisia species are used in traditionally as tonic and anti-helmintic in north of Iran.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate chemical composition of the essential oil of Artemisia haussknechtii. Also potential antioxidant and anti microbial activities of the essential oil and ethanolic extract were studied. 
Methods: The essential oil was prepared by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC/MS instruments. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by methods; namely DPPH, free radical scavenging, FTC system and total phenolic compounds analyzing. The antimicrobial activities of the extract were individually tested against a panel of microorganisms using disc diffusion method and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) measurement.
Results: Forty-eight components were identified constituting 98.35 of total oil. Camphor (12.4%), ?-Terpineol (9.93%), Davana ether (6/24%), and Bornyl acetate (3.77%) were the major components. Good antioxidant activity of extract; increasing with the increment of concentration of plant extract was revealed. Ethanolic extract of Artemisia haussknechtii inhibited both gram- positive and gram- negative bacteria. MIC of the extract against yeast was the lowest (2.5 Âµg/ml).
Conclusion: A known anti-bacterial compound (camphor) was one of major components in the essential oil, ethanolic extract showed good anti-oxidant activity and also extract inhibited growth of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi. These findings supported some traditional use of this plant.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of Paclobutrazol on vegetative growth, leaf chlorophyll, time to flowering and harvest, yield and fruit composition of greenhouse-grown cultivar banana during its first cycle. Paclobutrazol as potent specific inhibitor of GA3 biosynthesis. Paclobutrazol slightly decreased the length of the shoots and Leaf area reduction by paclobutrazol was reported and increased total leaf chlorophyll content. Paclobutrazol has been reported to increase yield of fruit trees. Found no PP333 influence on apple fruit quality, pH, acidity or soluble solid content.

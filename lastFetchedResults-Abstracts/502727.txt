Background and Objective: Osteoporotic fractures are major health problems in contemporary societies which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and substantial economic costs. Recently, increased plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level has been suggested as an independent risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. This study aimed to compare the level of plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 in Iranian postmenopausal women with low and normal bone mineral density (BMD).
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study which was performed from August 2006 to May 2007, BMD of 130 Iranian postmenopausal women were measured by dual energy X- ray absorbtiometry (DXA). The subjects were assigned to one of the two groups of case (BMD  <  -1; n= 67) and control (BMD ? -1; n=63). Fasting plasma Homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 were also determined. BMD at the neck of femur and lumbar spine, together with other collected data were analyzed with SPSS and T- test.
Results: The mean age of the subjects was 58.1 ± 6 years. The mean of Hcy level in the case group was 16.98±9.4 and in the control group was 12.39 M mol/L. The mean of vit-B12 in the case group was 
598± 801 and in the control group was 551.2±410 Pg/L. Mann-Whitney test exibited a significant difference. The mean of serum folate level in the case group was 5.2±2.9 and in the control group was 6.5±2.9 Ng/L. Hcy, folate and B12 were significantly related to low BMD. LS –T score was negatively related to Hcy level and FN T-score had a positive relation with folate and B12 (p=0.002, p=0.017 and p=0.007, respectively). There was a relationship between folate and B12 and with increasing serum folate level, B12 level increased, too.
Conclusion: The results suggest an association of vitamin B12 and folate with BMD. Whether this relationship is causal, remains unclear and demands further study.

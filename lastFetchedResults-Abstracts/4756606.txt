A geometric program (GP) is a type of optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions that have a special form. By combining with a simple constraint-handling mechanism based on feasibility rules, a new approach based on a differential evolution algorithm is proposed for solving the GP problem in this paper. Numerical simulation experiments show the validity of the method, and comparative studies expose the proposed algorithm as a competitive approach for geometric programming problems.

Objective: We investigated the prevalence of adverse sexual, personal hygiene, and self-treatment behavior among women with chronic benign vulvar and vaginal disorders. Study Design: This study was carried out by means of a scientific clinical audit producing actuarial data by way of a semistructured questionnaire. Subjects consisted of a sample of 530 cases treated at a specialist clinic for vulvar diseases. In addition to clinical and laboratory investigations, the patients were interviewed by the clinicâ€™s psychologist, who used a structured interview schedule developed specifically for the study. Descriptive analysis and analysis of variance were used to investigate data. Results: Most patients remained sexually active in spite of arousal failure and discomfort and engaged in unlubricated and often painful sexual intercourse. Most women engaged in potentially harmful genital hygiene and self-treatment behavior. Adverse self-treatment practices but not adverse genital hygiene practices were associated with greater symptom duration. Conclusions: Adverse practices should be addressed during the management of cases of chronic vulvar disease. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:34-8.)

High tuberculosis (TB) prevalence in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a serious public
health concern. The epidemic in this region is exacerbated by the presence of drugresistant
TB strains as well as HIV infection. This presents a public health threat not
only locally but also to Australia due to the high potential for cross-border transmission
between PNGâ€™s Western Province and the Australian Torres Strait Islands. We present
two mathematical models of TB in the Western Province: a simple model of the
underlying TB dynamics, and a detailed model which accounts for the additional
effects of HIV and drug resistance. The detailed model is used to make quantitative
predictions about the impact of expanding the TB case detection rate under the Directly
Observed Treatment, Short-course treatment regimen. This paper provides a framework
for future investigation into the economic costs and public health benefits of potential
TB interventions in this region, with the eventual aim of providing recommendations to
guide policy makers in both PNG and Australia.

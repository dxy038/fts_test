Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies and articles that have identified and ranked global information technology (IT) issues in various parts of the world. The objective of this article is to aggregate the results of these studies and explore the possibility of linkage of these key IT issues to environmental and organizational factors. An organizing framework for global IT issues is developed and one of the factors in the framework, the level of economic development of the country, is analyzed to observe its impact on the ranking of key IT issues. Cluster analysis on a sample of ranked IT issues from 16 different regions indicates a linkage between the level of economic development of a region and the ranking of various types of IT issues. The analysis provides stronger support for the three-way classification of regions into developed, developing, and under-developed rather than the more recent four-way classification of developed, newly industrialized, developing, and under-developed.

In the present work the results of experimental studyies of the electrodynamic properties of QDR with a local inhomogeneity present. The local inhomogeneity has a form of cuvette (in a two-hemidisk resonator) and a form of cylindrical capillary (in a disk resonator). The cuvette(s) or the capillary are filled with liquid studied and both types of inhomogeneity are placed within antinode field area of whispering gallery mode wave. Evidently, quantity of studied liquids placed within the cuvette or the capillary can be rather small. The objective of the present work is to investigate frequency and energy (quality factor, attenuation) properties of the resonators and to find out possibilities of their use for characterization of liquid permittivity.

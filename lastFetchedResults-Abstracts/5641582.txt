Mathematics was used to promote Homeland Security Management to reveal how academics face a challenge when expressing relationships between new fields of study. Homeland Security Management is the new fields of study involved with Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in this project. The needs analysis showed that the average student exhibits awkwardness in developing the knowledge required to acquire numerical skills in mathematics. Correspondingly, the underlying assumption of this project is that society shows the same awkwardness toward Homeland Security Management. The objective of this project is to facilitate a link between STEM education [1] and Homeland Security by using a filter-and-switch methodology as language logic to produce filters and switches in mathematical language (FIML) and (SIML), respectively. This study finds that the correlation between the FIML and SIML is language connectives, which were used to model the relationships of STEM-education and Homeland Security. This project further finds that language is the primary linkage between STEM-education and Homeland Security Management. It is significantly evident that language indiscipline will threaten the future and success of Homeland Security Management and general education.

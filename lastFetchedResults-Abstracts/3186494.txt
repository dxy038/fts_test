One of the main aims of distribution networks operators(DNOs) is increasing participation of distributed generation(DG). Technical problems such as voltage rise and power losses in distribution networks prevent high penetration of distributed generations in distribution network. Active network management(ANM) play basic role in connection of new generation units without restructuring distribution network. In this paper, relation of DG stability with its participation level is investigated considering technical issues. A multi-objective function for operation of the distribution network is proposed based on technical problems with regard to DG stability at the moment of short circuit in vicinity of the generator. Coordinated control of on-load tap changers and installed reactive power compensator is used for active management of distribution network. Multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA II) is employed to solve the optimization problem.

Making efficient use of network resources is of great importance in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer algorithm to minimize the energy consumption and provide QoS guarantee jointly for various connections with different QoS requirements in wireless cellular networks. We formulate an admission control problem and a multiple objective programming problem which allocates the rate and network resource for each connection in the network simultaneously. We derive efficient solutions to the two problems which attain an efficient usage of the transmission powers, and guarantee the rate and delay requirements of every admitted connection in the network. The simulation results show that our algorithm makes use of the network resource more effectively than layered approaches and our algorithm can be implemented in various wireless cellular networks with fast convergence.

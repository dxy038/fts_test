Energy management of CHP-based microgrid is largely dependent on optimal deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), where optimal bus-locations, capacity-sizes, and types are three major points to be considered in a microgrid planning. Investment and O&amp;M cost, including fuel cost, are solely dependent on types of DERs. Present paper searches a way-out of how a electrical tracking demand is economically shared between micro-turbines and diesel generators on the basis of multi-objective optimization of fuel cost as well as emission in 4-DER 14-bus radial microgrids. Optimization is done using PSO technique under real power demand equality constraint and DERs capacity limits constraint.

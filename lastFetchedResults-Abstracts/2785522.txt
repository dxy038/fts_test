Compact high power diplexer has been designed for Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) spacecraft of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), launched in November-2013. This is realized using waveguide combline filter structures with an additional objective of multipaction-free operation. Used in S-band TT&amp;C transponder that handles continuous RF power of 200W in telemetry path besides an isolation of &gt;145dB to telecommand path. Diplexer design, realization and test results are presented. Mission performance of on-board diplexer is normal.

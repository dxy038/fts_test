Localization helps robots to navigate and plan its path. The outdoor localization systems fail in localization of indoor applications because of indoor environment and inability of radio frequency signals from GPS satellites, which are difficult to penetrate the walls. The objective of this paper is to solve the problem of indoor localization of Pioneer robots using simple, cheap nodes which act as beacons. The localization problem is solved with various algorithms like trilateration, multilateration, and Extended Kalman Filter. With these algorithms, localization of Pioneer robots is achieved with simple beacons using distance estimation techniques.

In this paper we propose a pseudo adaptive routing which is an extension of classic XY routing. We consider mesh topology for evaluating proposed routing. Our switches use pseudo adaptive XY routing algorithm. The load in the center of a network in ordinary XY routing is much higher rather than total average. This extra load on the center of mesh can cause spot hot. The main objective of our routing algorithm is to distribute network load. One of the advantages of distributing network load is balanced temperature on the mesh. Our routing algorithm has two deterministic and adaptive modes that status of neighbors of each switch is used to decide on which mode must be selected. Packets are routed with classic XY routing (deterministic mode), when congestion in the network is low. When congestion is high, packets are routed through less congested route adaptively (adaptive mode). We developed a NOC environment using SystemC and applied two multimedia applications and a random traffic to proposed routing and compared with classic XY routing. Experimental results show better latency while average load is unchanged.

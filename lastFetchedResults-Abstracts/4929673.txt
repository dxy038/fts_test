In this project the total new construction of a small ultra lightweight solar powered airship was realized within 16 months. The objective was to demonstrate the feasibility and with that to show one possible ecological alternative within some areas of air traffic. Several technical challenges had to be overcome. A high efficient lightweight photovoltaic generator with foil modules of crystalline silicon cells could be realized and examined regarding the behaviour under various mechanical load conditions. The static and dynamic load tests at the photovoltaic modules are very promising regarding the application of lightweight crystalline silicon foil modules on bent and flexible surfaces. This offers the chance to develop new application areas for photovoltaics, not least for the development of a zero emission transport system or vehicle

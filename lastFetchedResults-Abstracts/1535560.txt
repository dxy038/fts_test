Flow induced in a viscoelastic fluid by a linearly stretched sheet is investigated assuming that the fluid is Maxwellian and the sheet is subjected to a transverse magnetic field. The objective is to investigate the effects of parameters such as elasticity number, magnetic number, radiative heat transfer, Prandtl number, and Eckert number on the temperature field above the sheet. To do this, boundary layer theory will be used to simplify energy and momentum equations assuming that fluid physical/rheological properties remain constant. A suitable similarity transformation will be used to transform boundary layer equations from PDEs into ODEs. Homotopy analysis method (HAM) will be invoked to find an analytical solution for the temperature field above the sheet knowing the velocity profiles (see Alizadeh-Pahlavan et al. [Alizadeh-Pahlavan A, Aliakbar V, Vakili-Farahani F, Sadeghy K. MHD flows of UCM fluids above porous stretching sheets using two-auxiliary parameter homotopy analysis method. Commun. Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat, in press]). The importance of manipulating the transverse velocity component, v, will be discussed on the temperature field above the sheet.

The use of Soliton pulse falls in an area of emerging engineering and technology promising great changes in the functionality and capacity of optical data transmission and networking. In this paper, the main objective is to familiarize with the basic analytical propagation model of the soliton pulse in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) system. For this proposed model, we used a soliton pulse, which will be carried out at the transmitter and receiver end easily. The soliton pulse propagations are basically based on the numerical solution of Non-linear Schro&#776;dinger Equation [NLSE], and also in some special case it is problem to solve it analytically. We have studied a propagation of soliton pulses in WDM system using a simulation tool Optisim. The main parameter, on which we have concentrated in our present work are BER, Jitter, Q-factor and power drop.

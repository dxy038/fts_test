The Iranian society evolved in a particular way in the Qajarid period, as a pre-modern and traditional society. The introduction of modernity was the main factor behind these changes. The political result of the defeat of this modernity was the onset of the Pahlavid dynasty, which shaped changes in the Iranian society of the Pahlavid period based on this very modernity;the changes and developments through which the issue of the evolution of Iranian clothing is also raised. 
The present research is a fundamental study based on its goals, and a descriptive-analytical research based on its theme. To reach this objective, the required data were extracted from the previous researches and historical references, and undergone quality analysis to reach scientific results. 
The results showed that the changes in clothing of the Qajarid period, due to preservation of traditional structure, were only received and accepted by a small number of the court members and the intellectuals of the time, and the common folk persisted on sticking to the traditional norms of clothing. In the First Pahlavid era, under the rule of a dictatorial modernity system that conveyed trends from the top to create an identity for the society, changes in men’s clothing grew with the cooperation of the cultural sources of the society, but change in women’s clothing took on a different form due to the non-cooperation of this group.

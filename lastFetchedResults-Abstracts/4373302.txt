A new algebraic test for deciding whether a multi-dimensional polynomial has all its zeros in the unit polydisk is presented. A simple procedure is proposed that facilitates the application of the 1D stability criteria. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility for extension of the Routh stability test to the stability analysis of multidimensional shift invariant digital filters

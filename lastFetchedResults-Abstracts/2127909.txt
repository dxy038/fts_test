Selection of proper fertigation method will decrease environmental pollution.
The objective of this research was estimation of drainage water and phosphorus
leaching with different fertigation methods in onion field in Shahrood. In this
research 4 fertigation methods were used. Two methods were weekly fertigation of
10 minutes before and after irrigation and other two methods were alternate day
fertigation of 10 minutes before and after irrigation with drip system in 3 types of
soils i.e. sandy loam, sandy clay loam and silty clay loam. Modeling method has
been used in this research. Results showed that in the fertigation system drainage
water was 3% and in basin irrigation it was more than 50%. Also results showed
that the method of weekly fertigation 10 minute before irrigation was the best
method in comparison with other methods. This method comparing with fertigation
methods had 28% more yield and with comparison to basin irrigation it had 70%
more yield in sandy loam soil. In this method phosphorus leaching was 0.9, 0.8 and
0.6 kg/ha in sandy loam, sandy clay loam and silty clay loam soil respectively. This
method with comparison of alternate day fertilizer distribution show?s 12, 7.6 and
4.4% less phosphorus leaching in sandy loam, sandy clay loam and silty clay loam
soil, respectively. Moreover it was revealed that this method show?s 32.2 percent
less phosphorus leaching in sandy loam soil comparing to basin irrigation method.

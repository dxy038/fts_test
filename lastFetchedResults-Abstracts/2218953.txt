Objective(s): Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs contribute to various genetic and epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer (GC). Recent studies focused on the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of pre-miRNAs including rs11614913, rs3746444, rs2910164, and rs2292832. It was suggested that these four SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of GC and were described as candidate susceptibility factors. However, the previous results show conflicting findings. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these four SNPs are associated with GC in Chinese Han population.
Materials and Methods: Genotype frequencies of these four SNPs of pre-miRNAs in 220 GC patients and 530 control subjects were performed using a PCR-RFLP assay.
Results:No significant differences in genotype and allelic distribution were found in these four SNPs between GC and control subjects in the Chinese Han population. However, we found that the allelic frequency distributions of control subjects in these four SNPs were significantly different from those of the Japanese and the Koreans (All the P<0.05).
Conclusion:The four SNPs did not show any significant correlation with the development of GC in the Chinese Han population, based on the current study.

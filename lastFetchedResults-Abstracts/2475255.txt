The main objective of this article is to study the effect of magnetic field on the combined buoyancy and surface tension driven convection in a cylindrical annular enclosure. In this study, the top surface of the annulus is assumed to be free, and the bottom wall is insulated, whereas the inner and the outer cylindrical walls are kept at hot and cold temperatures respectively. The governing equations of the flow system are numerically solved using an implicit finite difference technique. The numerical results for various governing parameters of the problem are discussed in terms of the streamlines, isotherms, Nusselt number and velocity profiles in the annuli. Our results reveal that, in tall cavities, the axial magnetic field suppresses the surface tension flow more effectively than the radial magnetic field, whereas, the radial magnetic field is found to be better for suppressing the buoyancy driven flow compared to axial magnetic field. However, the axial magnetic field is found to be effective in suppressing both the flows in shallow cavities. From the results, we also found that the surface tension effect is predominant in shallow cavities compared to the square and tall annulus. Further, the heat transfer rate increases with radii ratio, but decreases with the Hartmann number.

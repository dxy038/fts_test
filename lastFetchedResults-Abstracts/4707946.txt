A lattice piecewise-linear function is introduced for modeling nonlinear systems. A systematic procedure is proposed for building a lattice piecewise-linear model from the given input-output data. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate that modeling a nonlinear system using a lattice piecewise-linear function is a practically viable and very effective method of applying linear techniques to nonlinear dynamical systems.

Since the cardiotocographic (CTG) monitoring of fetal health, during pregnancy and labour, was introduced, perinatal mortality and morbidity are very reduced. However, inter-observer and intra-observer variability in the interpretation of CTGs requires new researches to improve monitoring efficacy. This study aims to extract frequency parameters for physicians decision support. The Variability of the Fetal Heart Rate around its baseline could be a base for a more objective analysis and for a better knowledge of ANS reactions.

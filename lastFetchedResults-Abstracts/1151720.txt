The objective of this research is to develop a system that measures the flow front position dynamically, expands the observing flow front area, and tracks the flow automatically. The development of such a system for the observation of defects of injection moldings and the validation of the developed system are reported here. The developed in-process two-axis tracking system allows observation of the flow front behavior at flow front velocities up to 350 mm/s. In addition to flow marks, we were able to capture pictures of the formation of silver streaks for the first time. The results and developed system validated the postulations of the injection molding defects and also provided a new tool for exploring new frontiers in the analysis of fountain flow.

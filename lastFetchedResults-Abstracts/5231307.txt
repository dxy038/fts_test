Various kinds of the fuzzy regression models are introduced in the literature and many different algorithms are proposed to estimate fuzzy parameters of the models. In this study a new approach is introduced to find the parameters of a linear fuzzy regression, the input data of which is measured by crisp numbers. A new objective function is designed and solved, by which a minimum degree of acceptable uncertainty (the h-level or h-cut) is found. Two numerical examples are presented to compare the proposed approach with other methods.

Monte-Carlo path tracing algorithms for computer graphics require that given an incident light ray at a surface
an outgoing direction can be computed with a distribution given by the magnitude of the bidirectional reflectance
distribution function (BRDF). For analytic reflectance functions this can be done using various techniques including
inverting the function, or tabulating some representation of the inverse. However, measured BRDF data sets
are too large for this to be practical.
We present a method to generate reflection rays distributed according to the magnitude of the BRDF. The method
relies on a wavelet-based representation of the BRDF. This representation is efficient and compact, allowing large,
anisotropicmeasured BRDF data sets to be representedwith a few thousand coefficients. In particular, we exploit
the wavelet representation to quickly compute integrals over ranges of the BRDF.

In this paper we consider a cognitive radio (CR) communication system based on spectrum sharing schemes, where we have a secondary user (SU) link with multiple transmitting antennas and a single receiving antenna, coexisting with a primary user (PU) link with a single receiving antenna. At the SU transmitter (SU-Tx), the channel state information (CSI) of the SU link is assumed to be perfectly known; while the interference channel from the SU-Tx to the PU receiver (PU-Rx) is not perfectly known due to less cooperation between the SU and the PU. Considering a SU transmit power constraint, our design objective is to determine the transmit covariance matrix that maximizes the SU rate, while we protect the PU by enforcing both a PU average interference constraint and a PU outage probability constraint. This problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem with a non-explicit probabilistic constraint, which is then approximated as a mixed binary integer programming (MBIP) problem and solved with the Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm. The complexity of the BB algorithm is analyzed and numerical results are presented to show the performance of the CR system under consideration with our optimal solution.

We are pursuing research on programming languages for massively parallel processing. The objective of the research is the following two points according to the top level research objective of our Massively Parallel Processing Principle Research Project: firstly to develop a prototype of a massively parallel programming language and compiler system, which is competitive to commercial language systems like data parallel C, Fortran D or HPF; and secondly to explore a massively parallel computation model, and design an experimental language as an implementation of the newly explored massively parallel computation model

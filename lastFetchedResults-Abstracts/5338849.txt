The paper proposes a new adaptive 2D spatial filter operator for the restoration of salt &amp; pepper impulse corrupted digital images. The Adaptive Impulse Filter effectively identifies the impulsive positions of the noisy digital image and switches to restore them by an adaptive impulse correction scheme. Experimental results in terms of objective metrics and visual analysis through varied impulse noise levels favor the new algorithm when compared to most other impulse filters. The efficient impulse filter gives better signal preservation and provides quality results devoid of impulsive patches with less computational complexity even at very high levels of impulse noise.

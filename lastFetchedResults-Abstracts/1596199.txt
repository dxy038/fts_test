An experimental study on post-dryout heat transfer was conducted in the High-pressure WAter Test (HWAT) loop at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The objective of the experiments was to investigate the influence of flow obstacles on the post-dryout heat transfer. The investigated operational conditions include mass flux equal to 500 kg/m2 s, inlet sub-cooling 10 K and system pressure 5 and 7 MPa. The experiments were performed in annuli in which the central rod was supported with five pin spacers. Two additional types of flow obstacles were placed in the exit part of the test section: a cylinder supported on the central rod only and a typical BWR grid spacer cell. The measurements indicate that flow obstacles improve heat transfer in the boiling channel. It has been observed that the dryout power is higher when additional obstacles are present. In addition the wall temperature in post-dryout heat transfer regime is reduced due to increased turbulence and drop deposition. The present data can be used for validation of computational models of post-dryout heat transfer in channels with flow obstacles.

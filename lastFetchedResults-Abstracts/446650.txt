Background
Objective analysis of surgical skill is necessary. A novel method of assessment using simple error analysis in synthetic models is examined for construct validity.
Methods

Two examination protocols were devised using synthetic models. These contained either a purpose made error or were representative of good surgical practice. Protocol one contained models of skin closure and minor operations. Protocol two in addition more complex procedures. Face validity was established by the approval of senior surgeons. Junior surgeons were recruited to undertake the assessment. A p value of less than 0.05 was deemed to be significant.
Results

Eighty-nine surgeons were recruited. Both protocol one and two were able to discriminate between groups at statistically significant levels.
Conclusions

Construct validity has been established by showing that error analysis is able to distinguish surgeons with varying levels of experience.

Nowadays, it is more common to use both systems, a Learning Management System (LMS) and a remote laboratory, independently. However, we understand it is highly convenient for the students to have access and perform real experimental practices in remote laboratories from a LMS. This integration of both educational resources constitutes one objective of a project developed by a joint venture company-university: a technology company (&#8220;educativa&#8221;) and a public university (UNR). The project is based on the addition to the &#8220;Virtual Campus LMS&#8221;, developed by &#8220;e-ducativa&#8221;, of a function that allows the access and control, via Internet, to the &#8220;Remote Laboratory of Electronic Physics&#8221; located in the university headquarters. Technology is basically a self-communication protocol that allows exchanging data in a standardized way between the LMS software and the device control connected to the remote equipment. The project includes the implementation of an interface that allows the users of the e-learning platform to have access to it and to future developments of remote laboratories. In this paper the authors describe the technical implementation of the project and provide educational criteria in order to integrate the new development into the electronic engineering curriculum.

Detection, identification, and accommodation of sensor failures can be a challenging task for complex dynamic systems. This paper presents the comparison of two different approaches for the task of sensor failure detection, identification, and accommodation in a flight control system assumed to be without physical redundancy in the sensory capabilities. The first approach is based on the use of a set of online learning neural networks; the second approach is based on the use of a bank of Kalman filters. The objective is to evaluate the robustness of both schemes; the comparison is performed through testing of the schemes for several types of failures presenting different level of complexity in terms of detectability. The required computational effort for both schemes is also evaluated. For each of these failure types this comparison is performed at nominal conditions, that is with the system model and its noise perfectly modeled (with the Kalman filter scheme performing at nominal conditions), and at conditions, where discrepancies occur for the modeling of the system as well as the system and measurement noises. While the Kalman-filter-based scheme takes advantage of its robustness capabilities, the neural-network-based scheme, starting from a random numerical architecture, relies on the learning accumulated either online or from off-line simulations. The study reveals that online learning neural architectures have potential for online estimation purposes in a sensor validation scheme, particularly in the case of poorly modeled dynamics

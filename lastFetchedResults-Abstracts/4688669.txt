The existing literature mostly studies the allocation of emergency commodities in the emergency service center. This paper studies how to rationally distribute the scare emergency commodities between every factory when there arenÂ´t enough emergency commodities and related factories have to be mobilized to produce commodities after the large-scale emergency occurs. A mathematical model is established by considering producing capability, cost and the time spent from every factory to the disaster area and taking the minimum emergency time and the minimum emergency cost as the objective function, and the algorithm and the example are given.

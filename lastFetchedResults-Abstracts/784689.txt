Objective: To determine the effect of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol on oxidative stress and bone
mineral density (BMD) in elderly people. Design: A double-blind, controlled clinical assay was carried out in a
sample of 90 elderly subjects divided into three age-paired random groups with 30 subjects in each group. Group
Tx0 received placebo, group Tx1 received 500 mg of ascorbic acid and 400 IU of alpha-tocopherol, whereas
group Tx2 received 1,000 mg of ascorbic acid and 400 IU of alpha-tocopherol, for a 12-month period.
Measurements: We measured thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total antioxidant status (TAS),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutation peroxidase (GPx); BMD was obtained on DXA of hip and spine
before and after the 12-month treatment period with supplementation of vitamins C and E. Results: We found a
positive correlation between hip-BMD and SOD (r = 0.298, p <0.05) and GPx (r = 0.214, p <0.05). Also, a
significantly lower decrease of LPO (p <0.05) was observed as linked with hip bone loss in the Tx2 group than in
the Tx0 group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that that administration of 1,000 mg of ascorbic acid together
with 400 IU of alpha-tocopherol could be useful in preventing or aiding in the treatment of age-related
osteoporosis.

As for the renewable energy sources some subjects focus on biotechnology. We have started microalgae cultivation a few years ago. We have constructed a photobioreactor system on a laboratory and pilot scale. Our first objective was the algae cultivation for production of biodiesel raw materials with carbon-dioxide capture. It was concluded that the processing of residuals, especially raffinate is worth consideration.

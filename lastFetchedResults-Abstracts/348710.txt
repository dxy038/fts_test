Objective
To demonstrate a method of sensory nerve conduction study (NCS) for the medial calcaneal nerve (MCN) and confirm the medial calcaneal neuropathy in patients with plantar fasciitis (PF).
Methods
Twenty-six patients with clinical and ultrasonographic diagnosis of PF participated in the present study. An antidromic method for sensory NCS of MCN was performed in each patient and in 30 controls. The conduction latency, sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and amplitude of the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) were measured and the correlation of the SNCV of MCN with both body weight and body mass index (BMI) was studied.
Results
The mean conduction latency obtained in the MCN was greater in the PF patients than in the normal controls. Mean SNCV and SNAP amplitude of the MCN were significantly less in the PF patients than in the normal controls. Body weight and BMI were greater in PF patients than in controls. Six patients were identified as having a medial calcaneal neuropathy by using the criteria of the lowest normal values of the NCS of MCN from the normal controls.
Conclusions
Medial calcaneal neuropathy is associated with PF. The present method of sensory NCS is useful and objective in the diagnosis of the medial calcaneal neuropathy.
Significance
Medial calcaneal neuropathy was confirmed by the sensory NCS of MCN and shown to be associated with PF.

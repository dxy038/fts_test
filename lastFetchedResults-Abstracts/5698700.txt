The radio frequency spectrum is a scarce natural resource, so it is very important to use the spectrum efficiently. Cognitive radio, which can greatly improve the spectrum utilization, is able to adjust the transmit parameters according to the environment. In this paper, an adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to design the cognitive radio engine. In order to improve the performance of the algorithm, adaptive mutation mechanism and the elite strategy is introduced into the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is used to design a cognitive radio engine in a multi-carrier system with ten sub-carriers. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective.

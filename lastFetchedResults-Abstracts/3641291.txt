The HIMASS electromagnetic launcher is a unique large-bore, large-mass railgun driven by a helical flux compression generator. Two experiments were conducted at 3-4 MA current levels. The objective of the experiments was to study the effects of scaling, ablation, and material parameters on electromagnetic launcher performance. Data from these two experiments are presented.

Objective
Functional recovery of the immune system is critical for long-term survival in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In this study, two donor-recipient allogeneic transplant settings (haploidentical and fully mismatched) are used to investigate the functional activity of donor-derived B and T cells in animals grafted with purified c-kit+, Thy 1.1lo, Lin−/lo, and Sca-1+ hematopoietic stem cells (KTLS HSC).
Materials and Methods

Ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin G, polyclonal immunoglobulin isotypes, and B- and T-cell proliferation were examined on the recipients who received haploidentical or fully mismatched HSC.
Results

A severe deficiency of antigen-specific immunoglobulin response occurs in fully engrafted mice that received KTLS HSC from fully mismatched, but not haploidentical, donors. This lack of B-cell–specific immunity is not due to a deficiency of polyclonal immunoglobulins in serum. B cells from both fully mismatched and haploidentical recipients proliferate normally after stimulation with anti-μ and the percentage of mature B cells is normal. The T-cell response to anti-CD3 in fully mismatched recipients was much weaker than that of their untransplanted controls. However, T cells from haploidentical recipients respond normally to anti-CD3.
Conclusions

This study demonstrates that numerical recovery of donor-derived cells in the periphery of recipients does not represent a functional reconstitution, particularly in animals that receive fully mismatched transplants. Defects of specific B-cell immunity and T-cell proliferation are observed in fully mismatched, purified HSC transplant recipients with a quantitative recovery within the normal range of donor-derived lymphocytes.

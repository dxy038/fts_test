Changed conditions in manufacturing industries´ business strategies, i.e. intentions to earn more revenue from service provision, motivate the introduction of rough and sketchy prototypes as part of the learning and collaboration activities. This paper presents and compares changed conditions between traditional and novel in general, but particularly exemplifies the importance of prototyping in such a new setting. This is done, not only to inspire CogInfoCom research, but also to contribute to the use of prototyping and learning in modern product development. The paper´s objective is to discuss how prototyping can benefit radical thinking and learning for innovation.

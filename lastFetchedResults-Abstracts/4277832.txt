This article according to the composition concept of System on Chip (SoC), carries on the patent analysis in U.S and Taiwan. The article had recognized SoC international patent classification (IPC) in national, owner´s distribution by the objective statistical analysis. It had understood the SoC technological development´s process, also clearly observe research and develop organization´s possible structure of the patent owners. Findings discovery are: 1. The SoC technology´s development is at present in the growth period of the front. 2. The U.S has the constitutive design and reliable confirmation technical lead in the SoC technology´s development, i.e. system on chip application plan ability. 3. Taiwan has the outstanding lead in SoC chip´s manufacture and spare part conformity processing technology. 4. In SoC technology research and development output, the major part was the research and development team joint effort achievement, only had the few parts was concentrated in the specific inventor.

The effectiveness of surface-mount devices (SMD) placement on three-dimensional (3-D) molded interconnect devices (MID) is influenced by a number of factors, including component accuracy, the assembly machine, and the device itself. The objective of this research project was to model dimensional variations and further optimize the placement process. Optimal placement is achieved by determining the best lead-to-pad coverage. The chosen approach is demonstrated by simulating the placement process. Results show that the process can be significantly improved through an optimization procedure

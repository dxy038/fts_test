This work is a continuation of research on the asymptotic behavior of the nondeterministic discrete event system (DES) with probabilities known. The objective is to predict the long-range performance of the nondeterministic discrete event processes for decision making and control. A class of nondeterministic DESs for which the point probability distributions are known is considered. A hybrid dynamical state-space representation of the nondeterministic DES is established by using minimax algebra to formalize the treatment of time sequences and by using the usual algebra to introduce a Markovian structure that assigns the transition probabilities to events. The asymptotic behavior of the system is investigated, and the results are illustrated by the example of a flexible manufacturing system

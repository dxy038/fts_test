The problem of discrete-time modelling of processes with input and output data is addressed. The objective is to produce the most representative model with adequate numbers of parameters. Conventional methods involve a computationally inefficient method of selection through exhaustive trials of all candidate models. Proposed is a new approach based on singular value decomposition (SVD), where the representative model is determined through rank-loss assessment of appropriately configured data matrix

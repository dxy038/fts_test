Summary form only given. The atmospheric pressure plasma polymerization of furan was carried out with the objective of synthesizing polvfuran film. RF (13.56 MHz) plasma electrical characteristics and optical characteristics are examined. The structure, compositions and morphology of the plasma deposited poly furan film were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultravioletvisible absorption spectroscopy (IJV-vis) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The formation of polyfuran was confirmed using FTIR and UV-visible analysis. The properties of plasma-deposited polvfuran were compared with those of chemicallv synthesized polyfuran. Although the plasma deposited polyfuran shows lower thermal stability than that of chemicallv synthesized polyfuran, it has better solubility in common solvents.

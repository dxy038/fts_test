The optimal portfolio problem for a bank account, single risky stock is developed. The investment objective is maximizing the utility of the investorpsilas consumption and terminal wealth. The problem has been solved by the stochastic dynamic programming principle. For the constant relative risk aversion utility case, the explicitly optimal investment consumption strategies are obtained. A numerical example is presented.

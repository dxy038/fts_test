Researchers have attempted to identify critical factors that contribute to academic achievement. Some studies report direct relation of emotional intelligence, self concept and self esteem with academic achievement. On the other hand, some experts doubt their direct relationship. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship among emotional intelligence, self concept and self esteem with academic achievement. 400 university students were selected by simple random sampling. Bar â€“ on questionnaire of emotional intelligence, Rogers self concept test, and Pop self esteem test were administered. Furthermore, the mean scores of students were used as an index of academic achievement. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical indexes. No statistically significant relationship between emotional intelligence, self concept, self esteem, and academic achievement were found. In addition, no statistically significant differences between emotional intelligence and self concept were found between male and female students. However, the self esteem of female students was higher than male students. The lack of significant relations among the constructs suggests the need for considering other factors that may influence the academic achievement.

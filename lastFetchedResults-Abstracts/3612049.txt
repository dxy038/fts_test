An active current injection network for a three-phase rectifier is proposed. The proposed circuit uses three bidirectional switches operating at low frequency and a half-bridge inverter operating at high frequency. It also uses an inductor in order to make the current modulation. Because only 3.7% of the total power delivered to the load is processed by the injection network, the proposed converter offers high efficiency, and not only a high power factor is obtained but also the total harmonic distortion is reduced. Operation, analysis, simulation, and experimental results are shown in this paper.

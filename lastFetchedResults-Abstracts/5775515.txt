In our companion WoWMoM 2015 paper, we propose a content-centric routing mechanism for Wi-Fi Direct networks. In that paper, we showed how to implement a Wi-Fi Direct multi-group network with unrooted Android devices that supports bidirectional communication between different groups. We devised on it a content-centric application, denoted as Multi-Group Content (MGC), that enables content request and delivery in a distributed and cooperative way. Finally, we demonstrated our application with Android devices to fully validate our approach and assess its performance. Aim of the current demonstration is to allow demo session attendees to experiment MSG and assess its behavior and performance in real time.

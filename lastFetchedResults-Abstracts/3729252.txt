A novel method using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is proposed for optimising parameters of controllers of a wind turbine (WT) with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The PSO algorithm is employed in the proposed parameter tuning method to search for the optimal parameters of controllers and achieve the optimal coordinated control of multiple controllers of WT system. The implementation of the algorithm for optimising the controllers´ parameters is described in detail. In the analysis, the generic dynamic model of WT with DFIG and its associated controllers is presented, and the small signal stability model is derived; based on this, an eigenvalue-based objective function is utilised in the PSO-based optimisation algorithm to optimise the controllers´ parameters. With the optimised controller parameters, the system stability is improved under both small and large disturbances. Furthermore, the fault ride-through capability of the WT with DFIG can be improved using the optimised controller. Simulations are performed to illustrate the control performance.

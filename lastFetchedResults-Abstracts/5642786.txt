Adaptive focusing particle swarm optimization (AFPSO) based on the balance characteristic between global search and local search of particle swarm optimization was an adaptive swarm intelligence optimization algorithm with preferable ability of global search and search rate. AFPSO was proposed to optimize the reactive power optimization. Based on optimal control principle, AFPSO applied for optimal reactive power is evaluated on an IEEE 57-bus power system. The modeling of reactive power optimization is established taking the minimum network losses as the objective. The simulation results and the comparison results with various optimization algorithms demonstrated that the proposed approach converges to better solutions than and the algorithm can make effectively use in reactive power optimization. Simultaneously, the validity and superiority of AFPSO was proved.

Objective
ing nephrectomy has been shown to improve survival in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and is now a standard procedure. However, it remains controversial if debulking nephrectomy should routinely be followed by interferon. We report on the clinical course of metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients after debulking nephrectomy who did not receive routine systemic anticancer therapy.
ts and Methods
n consecutive metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients were put on a “watch and wait” protocol after debulking nephrectomy. This included regular computer tomographic scans done at 6 to 8 weeks after debulking nephrectomy, and subsequently 3 to 4 monthly. Systemic treatment was instituted only after disease progression.
s
edian follow-up of 18 months, 80% of patients had progressed. However, a third of the patients had at least 6 months of progression-free interval, and 3 of 15 patients had not progressed at prolonged follow-up durations of 18, 23, and 46 months. A third of the patients remained alive and the median survival for the cohort was 25 months. Preoperative predictive factors for nonprogression after debulking nephrectomy included absence of abnormal laboratory indices, single organ system metastases, and good performance status.
sions
is a subset of metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients who will have an indolent course after debulking nephrectomy. Toxic systemic therapies may be avoided in such patients for a significant period of time.

In this paper we present a multi-objective optimization approach to subarrayed linear antenna arrays design. We define this problem as a bi-objective one. We consider two objective functions for directivity maximization and sidelobe level minimization. Memetic algorithms (MAs) are hybrid algorithms that combine the benefits of a global search Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a local search method. In this paper, we introduce a new memetic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm namely the memetic generalized differential evolution (MGDE3). This algorithm is a memetic extension of the popular generalized differential evolution (GDE3) algorithm. Another popular MOEA is the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). MGDE3, GDE3 and NSGA-II are applied to the synthesis of uniform and nonuniform subarrayed linear arrays, providing an extensive set of solutions for each design case. Depending on the desired array characteristics, the designer can select the most suitable solution. The results of the proposed method are compared with those reported in the literature, indicating the advantages and applicability of the multi-objective approach.

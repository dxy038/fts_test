In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based file sharing systems, keyword-based retrieving is the predominant search functionality. Both, the emergence of semantic web structures and research results on user behavior indicate that in certain circumstances, browsing in semantic networks is not only the more efficient search functionality in specific cases, but also leads to a higher user satisfaction. In this paper, our research objective is threefold. First, we want to explore currently provided search mechanisms in P2P file sharing systems in order to uncover a possible lack in the provision of user-friendly search functionalities. Second, we want to examine for P2P file sharing systems whether information browsing on semantic networks and keyword-based searching lead to significant differences in search efficiency and user satisfaction. Third and closely related to the second research aim, we want to additionally investigate the predictors of search efficiency, user satisfaction and usage intention in the context of P2P file sharing systems.

Wireless networked mobile robots pursuing a common objective are envisioned to be an efficient solution for many military, industrial, commercial, and environmental applications. This paper presents the design considerations of an autonomous intruder detection system based on wireless networked robots. Specifically, three critical aspects of these systems, such as coordination and task allocation, communication, and map-based intruder detection, have been investigated and a multi-sensor fusion mechanism has been presented. Performance results show that the fusion of redundant information from different sensors can increase the accuracy of a system and reduce overall uncertainty in intruder detection applications.

This paper studies service restoration in distribution network with distributed generation (DG). After the occurrence of fault in a distribution network, loads get disconnected and service to the affected loads should be restored through a network reconfiguration procedure. The introduction of DG has great effect on service restoration and network reconfiguration. In this paper, the impact of DG on the distribution system during service restoration procedure is studied, and the mathematical model of network reconfiguration with DG is established. The objective function and constraints are modified considering DG and power quality indicators. A method based on modified binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is applied to solve network reconfiguration problems. The IEEE69 model is tested. The results shows that the method in this paper is effective and reasonable.

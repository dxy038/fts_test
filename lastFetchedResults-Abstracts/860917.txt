As flooding events and subsequent damages are increasing and flood control plans are costly, determination of control scenarios and their prioritization in terms of type and spatial distribution in line with watershed management concepts are essential. The effect of various flood control scenarios may be simulated using the integrated hydrologic and hydraulic models, and selection of the most appropriate scenario can be based on an objective function involving costs and damages. However, information needed for an accurate estimation of costs and flood damages is not readily available. Thus, in this research, the cost-benefit ratio was defined as a function of hydrologic factors. For an assessment of such benefit to cost ratios, and determination of flood control scenarios in the Rudzard Watershed, two main scenarios of upgrading rangelands as well as conversion of rangeland to farm land and orchard were considered in view of management and improvement of vegetative cover as parts of the biological measures. The ModClark distributed hydrologic model and the HEC-RAS hydraulic model were used for the sub-watershed and river routing, respectively. The combined model was run based on the new land use changes in each scenario, and the peak outlet discharge was determined. The results indicated that rangeland improvement scenario was more effective in reducing the peak discharges of both sub-watershed and main watershed outlets. Abgelal and Mashin sub-watersheds were identified as the two main candidates for land use improvement at the sub-watershed scale. However, Mashin and Damdeli sub-watersheds were of primary interest to reduce the peak discharge at the outlet of the entire watershed, while Abgelal and Alekhorshid came next.

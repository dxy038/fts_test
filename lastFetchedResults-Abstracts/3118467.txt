This paper is concerned with estimation of conductivity of Maxwell equations. In order to overcome the presence of local minima in objective functional, a multiresolution Method for distributed conductivity is studied numerically. The identification of the coefficient of Maxwell equation in two dimension is considered as model problem. Firstly, the objective function is decomposed to multiple scales with wavelet transform. Then it is solved according to the scale from the shortest to the longest. Secondly, Gauss-Newton method is carried out on each scale. Finally, based some numerical results, it is shown that the method of multiresolution yields robust and fast convergence.

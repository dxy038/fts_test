The goal of service recovery is to make immediate response when service failures result in customer dissatisfaction or complaints. However, it is difficult to detect service failures and customer dissatisfactions easily because customers might not express their true reception. Hence, this study builds a logistical regression model to detect the effectiveness of service and provide service recovery suggestions when customer satisfaction level is not achieved. A health management motion sport game is applied to present the proposed method. An experiment is conducted to collected objective physiological data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) and subjective user ratings of perceived exertion after the sport game. The contribution of this study mainly focuses on the usage of the logistical regression model built to assure the effectiveness of exercise. Hence, the users can follow the results of the suggestions, which are in accordance with different effectiveness of exercise, suited for them to effectively maintain good health status.

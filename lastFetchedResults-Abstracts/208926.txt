Objective:To find out the presence or absence of insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Material & Methods:The study included 55 T2DM patients (34 male & 21 female), who were already taking oral anti diabetic drugs for the last 3 â€“ 5 years. Obesity or weight gain in T2DM patients aggravates metabolic disturbances along with increased insulin resistance. The five variables in T2DM patients were studied as per recommendations of the United States National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III), to find out the presence or absence of insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) in T2DM patients. The T2DM patients who had shown the presence of three or more variables out of five z were considered to have IRS.
Results:32 (58.18%) T2DM patients (20 male & 12 female) had IRS. The T2DM patients with IRS had significant (p<0.001) increase in mean blood glucose levels, waist circumference, triglyceride levels and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean HDL Cholesterol was significantly (p<0.001) decreased in T2DM patients with IRS as compared to T2DM patients without IRS.
Conclusion: An increase in waist circumference in T2DM patients will increase the prevalence of insulin resistance syndrome.

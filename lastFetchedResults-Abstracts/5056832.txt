The authors describe the project manager (PM) that forms the core of the Faust environment. PMÂ´s primary objective is to provide an infrastructure, or object base, for Faust tool integration. A project is a set of related executable programs. PM defines an extensible project model that gives all projects a similar abstract structure. PM attempts to be sensitive to special needs of scientific programmers in parallel environments by allowing for easy definition of overlapping subprojects and by providing servers for execution of remote system commands in a heterogeneous system environment

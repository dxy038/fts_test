Nowadays, the Russian Linguists have drawn their attention more than before to semantic structure of a sentence. They examine and describe the meaning of a sentence based on their various theoretical perspectives. Amongst different points of view in this context, we can differentiate two of them as the most important approaches to examine the semantic structure of a sentence.
The first approach investigates the semantic structures of sentences considering their formal structures. Determining structural schema of structure with an aim to specify its semantic structure is in the agenda.
The second approach examines the semantic structures of sentences their formal structures. Determining semantic features of a sentence is regarded as being the most important medium for understanding the semantic structure of a sentence. Objective and subjective semantic components are known as necessary semantic parts of a sentence. The present paper tends to study the two above- mentioned approaches in contemporary Russian Linguistics.
This paper deals with the two above - mentioned perspectives in contemporary Russian linguistics.

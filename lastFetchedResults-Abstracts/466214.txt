Objective: The object of this study was to use an in-depth peer-review process to determine the maternal mortality ratio at a single urban perinatal center and to identify factors associated with fatal outcomes to elucidate opportunities for preventive measures to reduce the maternal mortality ratio. Study Design: Between 1992 and 1998 all maternal deaths occurring within our perinatal network were identified. A peer-review committee was established to review all available data for each death to determine the underlying cause of death, whether it was related to pregnancy, and whether the death was potentially preventable. Results: There were 131,500 births and 42 maternal deaths, for a maternal mortality ratio of 31.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The adjusted pregnancy-related maternal mortality ratio was 22.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, with 37% of those deaths (11/30) deemed potentially preventable and a provider factor cited in >80% of these. Pulmonary embolus and cardiac disease together accounted for 40% of the pregnancy-related deaths. Conclusion: Local maternal mortality ratios identified through a peer-review process indicate that the magnitude of the problem is much greater than is recognized through national death certificate data. The high proportion of potentially preventable maternal deaths indicates the need for improvement in both patient and provider education if we are to reduce the maternal mortality ratio to 3.3 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, the stated national health goal of Healthy People 2000.

This paper deals with the first clinical investigation of a new designed orthosis to apply a traction force at lumbar spine. The objective is to verify the effect on healthy subjects and to assess the comfort of the orthosis. The results obtained are interesting. No negative feedback at spine level and many data on the comfort of the orthosis. The investigation suggests some modification to the prototype.

Based on virtual team critical success factors (CSFs) analyses, this paper identified five rules that have significant influence on virtual team operational performance. The five rules are common objective, IT skills, membersÂ´ attributes, leadership, and communication capacity. Each rule was scored on the basis of questionnaire survey. Then, under the framework of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this paper presented a method to evaluate the effectiveness priorities of all alternative virtual teams by combing with fuzzy preference programming. Finally, a numerical example was given to demonstrate the application of this method.

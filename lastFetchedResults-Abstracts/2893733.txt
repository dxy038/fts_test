This paper addresses one of the potential graph-based problems that arises when an optimal shortest path solution, or near optimal solution is acceptable, namely the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem. The single source shortest path problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has long challenged researchers. The objective of the SSSP is to find the path between two nodes with shortest length (weight). For solving this problem, a new technique Modified Shuffled Frog Leaping algorithm (MSFLA) with GA cross-over is developed and evaluated. SFLA is a meta-heuristic search method inspired by natural memetics. It combines the benefits of both meme-based Memetic Algorithm (MA) and social behaviour based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this paper some modification of SFLA is done and also GA Cross-over is implemented and applied it to SSSP problem. Some problems from references are solved using the proposed algorithm and an implementation study is presented. The implementation study shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

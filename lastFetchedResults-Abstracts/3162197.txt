ARTIST4G is an integrated project addressing objective 1.1 of the seventh framework program of the European commission: the network of the future. A credible framework is proposed in order to tackle the problem of true ubiquity in the network through proper management of the interference. The three pillars of the project being interference avoidance (at the transmitter), interference exploitation (at the receiver) and advanced relaying are jointly studied driven by appropriate new metrics in the tradition of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Next Generation Mobile Network (NGMN) frameworks. Impacts on the architectures of the network are part of the study as well, and the results are validated by means of computer simulations, hardware prototyping and lab tests and field trials to check the models and the critical assumptions on which main results rely. ARTIST4G started in January 2010 and will last 30 months.

This paper presents a concise yet comprehensive description of a multichannel vehicle-to-infrastructure communication system. Existing mathematical models for such a system overlook some of its essential behavioral characteristics such as the reneging, force termination, and, ultimately, blocking of service requests (SRs). Thus, the reported performance results obtained from these models seem to be unrealistically overoptimistic. Accordingly, in this paper, a multiserver queueing model is proposed for the purpose of accurately capturing the dynamics of the aforementioned communication system and evaluating its performance. The proposed model is renowned for its complexity and the nonexistence of closed-form analytical expressions that characterize its fundamental performance metrics. Hence, approximations were exploited as a means to enhance this model´s mathematical tractability. Simulations are conducted in the context of a realistic scenario with the objective of validating the proposed approximate model, verifying its accuracy, and characterizing the system´s performance in terms of several new metrics. The simulations´ results indicate a cataclysmic SR blocking probability in the range of 65%-85%.

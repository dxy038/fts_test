Objective
te cancer is an underreported and emerging problem in China. Here we summarize the data for Chinese patients with prostate cancer (PCa), describe available treatment options, and report 5-year outcomes at multiple tertiary care institutions.
ts and methods
es of 1611 patients (mean age 76.51 years) diagnosed with PCa were enrolled. Survival rates for patients were analyzed using the Kaplanâ€“Meier method. Prognostic factors for disease-specific survival were analyzed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.
s
hundreds and thirty-two patients with a prostate tumor clinical stage of III or IV and 879 with a tumor clinical stage of I or II were diagnosed. The disease-specific survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 94.6%, 81.3% and 72.6%, respectively. Five-year disease-specific survival rates were 99.2% for patients with low clinical stage PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy, 76.5% for those who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate plus hormone therapy, 38% for those who received hormone therapy plus radiation therapy and 29% for those that received hormone therapy alone.
sions
ping with a lack of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening, Chinese men present later in life and course of their disease, with over 27% men dying of PCa at five years. Debulking of tumors by surgery and radiation therapy for high grade tumor may provide some survival benefit in the senior men but further study is required to validate these findings. It is important of the annual use of PSA test for men over 50 years old to detect the PCa in the early stage in this nation.

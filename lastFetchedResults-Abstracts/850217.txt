Objective (s): over 100 million women worldwide are using oral contraceptives pills (OCP) and mood changes were being as the primary reason for OCP discontinuation. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and predisposing factors to mood change in oral contraceptive pills users.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 500 women aged 15-49 years old using low dose (LD) pills attending family planning centers in Ahwaz, Iran in year 2012. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire including items on demographic, self-efficacy and mood change. Both univarate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between OCP use and the independent variables.
Results: In all 31% of women (n =153) reported mood change due to OCs use. The results of logistic regression revealed that education (OR =1.80, 95% CI=1.15-2.80, P =0.009), place of living (OR =2.57, 95% CI=1.06-6.20, P =0.03), and self-efficacy (OR =0.87, 95% CI=0.80-0.94, P =0.001) were significant predictors of mood change.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that the prevalence of mood changes due to OCP use was relatively high among Iranian women. In addition the findings showed that education on side effects and self-efficacy was important predicting factors for mood changes. Indeed implementing educational programs and increasing self-efficacy among women are recommended.

We propose a new motion compensated frame interpolation scheme for video post-processing. Mixed particle filter (PF) and genetic algorithm (GA) approach is proposed to do the motion estimation, also a new fitness function considering object and subject visual quality evaluation is proposed. Beside, two new motion vector smoothing method are proposed to get a more consistency motion vector field. The simulation shows a high subjective and objective performance of the proposed scheme.

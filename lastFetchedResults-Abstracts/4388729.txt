The paper proposes an image adaptive Singular Value Decomposition based Watermarking scheme. The proposed algorithm incorporates standard deviation method to identify high / low frequency blocks of the carrier image to decide where the blocks of the watermark image are to be embedded so that perception quality is not affected. The extraction algorithm is straight forward and it uses block mapping to identify the blocks of carrier image where the watermarks are attached. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing good quality watermarked images in terms of objective and subjective matrices with less distortion even in case of potential attacks.

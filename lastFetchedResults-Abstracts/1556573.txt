We develop and analyze a new affine scaling Levenberg–Marquardt method with nonmonotonic interior backtracking line search technique for solving bound-constrained semismooth equations under local error bound conditions. The affine scaling Levenberg–Marquardt equation is based on a minimization of the squared Euclidean norm of linear model adding a quadratic affine scaling matrix to find a solution that belongs to the bounded constraints on variable. The global convergence results are developed in a very general setting of computing trial directions by a semismooth Levenberg–Marquardt method where a backtracking line search technique projects trial steps onto the feasible interior set. We establish that close to the solution set the affine scaling interior Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is shown to converge locally Q-superlinearly depending on the quality of the semismooth and Levenberg–Marquardt parameter under an error bound assumption that is much weaker than the standard nonsingularity condition, that is, BD-regular condition under nonsmooth case. A nonmonotonic criterion should bring about speed up the convergence progress in the contours of objective function with large curvature.

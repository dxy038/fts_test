Objective
This study searches for association between the subject of medical students' required research projects and subsequent choices of residency, focusing specifically on women's health fields.
Study design
Students at our school graduating between 1997 and 2004 (n = 535) were required to undertake a research project beginning in the preclinical years. The subject of their required research project was related to their subsequent choice of residency.
Results
Ninety-nine of the 535 projects (18.5%) were women's health related. Although overall there was no significant relationship between the research project and residency choice, students who completed a women's health care project were nearly twice (1.8, 95% CI, 1.4-2.3) as likely to enter a women's health (obstetrics and gynecology or family medicine) residency than those who did not.
Conclusion
An association exists between student participation in women's health research beginning during preclinical years and the subsequent choice of a women's health residency.

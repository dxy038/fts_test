Life cycle assessment (LCA) is known to entail multiple objective decision-making in the analysis of tradeoffs between different
environmental impacts. The work of Azapagic and Clift in the late 1990s illustrates the use of multiple objective linear programming
(MOLP) in the context of LCA. However, it will be noted that their approach yields a range of Pareto optimal alternatives from
which the decision-maker must ultimately select the final solution. An alternative approach making use of Zimmermannâ€™s symmetric
fuzzy linear programming method is proposed and illustrated with a simple case study. The procedure effectively yields a single,
optimal compromise solution.

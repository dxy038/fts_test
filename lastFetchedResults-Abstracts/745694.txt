The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between coronary disease and osteoporosis and determine the effect of osteoprotegerin (OPG) on bone remodeling and bone mineral density (BMD) in a group of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Eighty-three patients (52 males and 31 women) with acute coronary syndrome (75 patients with acute myocardial infarction and 8 with unstable angina) with an average age of 61 ± 10 years were studied. Levels of osteocalcin, urinarydeoxypyridinoline, OPG and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) were determined during the hospital stay. Femoral neck, trochanter and lumbar spine densitometry was carried out using a DXA densitometer. Thirty percent of patients presented osteoporosis (39% of females and 26% of males). Osteoporotic patients were older and had a lower weight and height and elevated serum levels of osteocalcin (3.6 ± 2.25 2.63 versus ± 1.55, p = 0.05). Levels of OPG and RANKL were similar in both groups and showed no relationship with BMD. In conclusion, no relationship was observed between the OPG/RANKL system and BMD in these patients.

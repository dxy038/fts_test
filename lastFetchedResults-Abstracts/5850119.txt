The present article focuses on the application of a procedure based on ant colonies to solve disassembly line balancing problem. Firstly, the problem under study is proposed with the objective functions of line idle rate, workload smoothness and disassembly cost. Subsequently, the multi-objective optimization mathematical model of disassembly line balancing is formulated based on the proposed functions of the three objectives. Then, combining characteristics of disassembly line balancing problem, an improved multi-objective ant colony algorithm based on Pareto set is developed to optimize the optimization model. Finally, a practical case is provided to illustrate the proposed model and algorithm.

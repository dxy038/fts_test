In light of ChinaÂ´s logistics industry, the location selection of distribution center is one of the most important issues. The objective of this research is to present a location-selection model of logistics distribution center based on fuzzy multi-criteria decision making theory. With the model, the candidate evaluation programs of the logistics distribution center location are simulated and tested by the triangular fuzzy number and fuzzy value. The final decision is determined by the classical fuzzy multiple attribute group decision-making theory. By cooperation of quantitative factors and qualitative factors with the subjective preference factor from adjudicators, the model has been optimized to reduce considerably the volatility of evaluation results. The ultimate purpose of the model is to achieve the functionality to acquire the weighting hierarchy of candidate programs to choose out the most appropriate plan. The model effectively reduces the computational complexity of the selection process. It can provide accurate data supporting on decision-determining for logistics distribution center location.

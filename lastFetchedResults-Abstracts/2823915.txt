The method of moments (MoM) has been developed and widely used for solving electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems. The major disadvantage of the MoM is that it has O(N<sup>2</sup>) computational and storage complexities, which result in a large memory requirement and a tremendous amount of computation time (J.-M. Jin, Theory and Computation of Electromagnetic Fields. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley, 2010). To alleviate these problems, a GPU-accelerated multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) has been developed with a capability of solving one-million-unknown problems on four GPUs (J. Guan, S. Yan, and J.-M. Jin, IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol. 60, pp. 3607-3616, June 2013). However, this parallelized algorithm requires substantially more GPU resources if the problem size increases further, which would result in a reduction of the computational efficiency because more data communications between CPU and GPU are required in the MLFMA. To overcome this problem, a &#8220;compute on-the-fly&#8221; strategy is investigated in this work, with the objective to solve larger problems with limited GPU resources.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition resulting from excess extracellular matrix deposition that leads to progressive lung destruction and scarring. In the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases, activation of myofibroblasts by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role. Since no effective therapy for pulmonary fibrosis is currently recognized, finding an effective antifibrotic agent is an important objective. One approach might be through identification of agents that inactivate myofibroblasts. In the current study we examined the potential of conditioned medium obtained from several types of cells to exhibit myofibroblast inactivating activity. Conditioned media from lung cancer cell lines A549 and PC9 were found to have this action, as shown by its ability to decrease α-smooth muscle actin expression in MRC-5 cells. Subsequently the inhibitory factor was purified from the medium and identified as 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), and its mechanism of action elucidated. Activation of protein kinase A and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) were detected. MTA inhibited TGF-β-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Furthermore, the gain-of-function mutant CREB caused inactivation of myofibroblasts. These results show that A549 and PC9 conditioned media have the ability to inactivate myofibroblasts, and that CREB-phosphorylation plays a central role in this process.

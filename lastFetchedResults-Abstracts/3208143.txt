A novel multi-functional grid-connected inverter (MFGCI) is presented in this paper, which can enhance power quality at the point of common coupling (PCC), compensating the unbalanced, harmonic and reactive current simultaneously. To achieve comprehensive compensation, comprehensive indicators of power quality are proposed and a multi-objective optimal mathematical model is built with some constraints. Furthermore, the algorithms to calculate the reference current and to solve the multi-objective optimal compensation are proposed. In addition, the validity and effectiveness of the MFGCI utilized to customized power quality at PCC and its multi-objective optimal compensation is verified by the simulation results of PSCAD/EMTDC.

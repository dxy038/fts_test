We demonstrate a cost-effective bidirectional-wavelength network using a novel bidirectional add/drop amplifier module. The maximum power penalty incurred in this network for bidirectional transmission and add/drop multiplexing of WDM signals was measured to be less than 0.5 dB at an error rate of 10/sup -9/. The restoration time was less than 2 ms. The results show that this framework could accommodate at least ten nodes when the node spacing is 80 km.

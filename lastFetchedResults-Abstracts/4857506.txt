Spain is taking part in the ITALSAT propagation measurements using the radiotelescope from the Yebes Astronomy Centre, as a receiver. The main objective of this experiment is to investigate the effects of atmospheric phenomena on the 50 GHz received signal, performing both radiometric and beacon measurements. Though beacon and radiometer measurements are performed sequentially, if weather conditions are sufficiently stable, a reference for the beacon tests can be obtained from the radiometer measurements, which are also being employed to study atmospheric attenuation. The results discussed correspond to the data stored from April 1994 to September 1995, with a total of 230 hours of beacon data and 30 hours of radiometer data

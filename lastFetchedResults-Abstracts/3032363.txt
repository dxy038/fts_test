The aim of the present work is to find the optimum magnetic period length for the LNLS elliptically polarizing undulator (EPU). An objective function for the radiation which takes into consideration both intensity and polarization over the energy range desired by LNLS users is proposed and used in the optimization calculation. Results of such calculation are presented and discussed after a review of EPUs and their radiation characteristics.

Vulnerability control is becoming an essential requirement for security of power systems in the new utility environment. It is a difficult task for system operator who under economic pressure may be reluctant to take preventive action against harmful contingencies in order to guarantee providing continued service. For power systems which are operated closer to their stability limits, it is desirable to use load shedding as a form of vulnerability control strategy. This paper presents a neuro-fuzzy approach for determining the amount of load to be shed in order to avoid a cascading outage. The objective is to develop fast and accurate load shedding technique to control the vulnerability of power systems by means of using a neuro-fuzzy controller. A case study is performed on the IEEE 300-bus test system so as to validate the performance of neuro-fuzzy controller in determining the amount of load shed. Test results prove that the neuro-fuzzy controller provides accurate and faster vulnerability control action.

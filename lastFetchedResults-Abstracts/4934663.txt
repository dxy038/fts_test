The COMPANION system, which has been developed by BMW over the last ten years, is a roadside hazard warning and information system designed for use on inter-urban roads. Its main objective is to reduce the number of `shuntÂ´ style accidents by warning drivers in advance of stationary vehicles in front of them. This is done through roadside electronic guide markers, which emit yellow or orange signals, to indicate that there are incidents ahead. The system has been trialled at Dunfermline in Scotland, Munich in Germany and Verona in Italy. The main objective of the trials has been the assessment of driving behaviour and user acceptance of COMPANION. Overall, traffic speeds are reduced by between 10% and 20%, on activation of the system and instances of critical headways between vehicles are reduced significantly. The system is well liked by drivers who see it as providing a positive improvement in road safety. This opinion is also held by those who operate the system, primarily to advise motorists of incidents ahead and to protect those who have already been involved in an incident. There is some objective data that the system has a real impact on accident rates, although a longer post opening period is required before any firm conclusions can been drawn in this area

Objective
The nutritional status of 222 Khasi girls within age groups 4 to 6 y, 7 to 9 y, and 10 to 12 y was studied.
Methods

Personal interviews using questionnaires and 24-h dietary recall were used. Weights and heights were recorded, body mass index was calculated, and children were classified as normal or malnourished using Z scores and growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Based on weights and heights, children were classified as normal or undernourished according to classifications by Gomez, Waterlow, and the National Center for Health Statistics.
Results

Heights of girls ages 7 to 9 y and 10 to 12 y and weights of all girls were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the reference values for height (126.4 and 142.7 m) and weight (19, 26.9, and 31.5 kg), respectively. The lowest Z scores (−1.5 to −1.0) and percentiles (10th) for body mass index were seen in 12-y-old girls. Most girls ages 7 to 9 y had grade I malnutrition. Girls ages 10 to 12 y had the highest incidence of moderate malnutrition. Severe stunting was observed in all groups. Average energy consumption was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the recommended dietary allowance in all the age groups. Consumption of protein by children ages 7 to 9 y and 10 to 12 y was also significantly lower than the recommended dietary allowance. Consumption of calcium, iron, and carotene in children 10 to 12 y old was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the recommended dietary allowance.
Conclusions

Sociologic community factors are required to facilitate implementation of a nutritional package and availability of key nutrients to ensure growth in children.

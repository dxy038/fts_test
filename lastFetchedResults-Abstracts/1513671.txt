In contrast to α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins, little information is available on the isolation and separation of cycloamylose (CA) with degree of polymerization (DP) larger than 22. The objective of the current study was to develop a new iodine affinity capillary electrophoresis (CE) for separation of CA with DP of 22–42, which was based on the formation of CA-iodine inclusion complexes, CA with twisted conformations made complicated mobility behaviors on CE instead of merely size dependent. The influences of iodide/iodine ratio, iodine concentration, pH, ion strength of running phosphate buffer, voltage, and temperature on the peak resolution and electrophoretic mobility were further investigated. Our results suggest that iodine affinity capillary electrophoresis provides a versatile and selective tool for the isolation and analysis of CA with DP from 22 to 42.

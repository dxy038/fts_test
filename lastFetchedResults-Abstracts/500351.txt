The US national defense strategy in fact can be assumed as the way of responding its national security threats. All defense planners should adopt an approach that can provide a comprehensive response against objective and subjective threats. The US defense report in 2006 was set up based on subjective threats. Therefore, the Strategy of Preemption was a response against these subjective threats too. Giving a new definition of national security threats, Defense Secretary Robert Gates explained new patterns to cope with explicit and implicit as well as declining and mounting threats. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the trend of the new US defense strategy is about coping with the objective threats and on the other hand some new issues have been raised in this strategy which are as follows: deterring conflicts, enhancing the relationship with the US allies and risk management. Also freedom of act to meet the US strategic goals is only allowed in a time that the threats are of concrete, severe and mounting characteristics.

This paper presents an algorithm for the near-optimal allocation of buffer space to an assembly line by means of the ant colony optimisation (ACO) paradigm. Uniquely, the algorithm has been designed to work in conjunction with a simulation model and is adapted to have both combinatorial and stochastic problem-solving capability. The simulation model was developed using the WITNESS simulation package and serves the purpose of an objective function evaluator, encapsulating the dynamics of the line and enabling the production rate for a particular buffer configuration to be determined. Finally, the WITNESS Optimiser module was used as a benchmark in validating the ACO algorithmÂ´s performance. In the simulation experiments conducted, ACO attained slightly better results overall.

The objective of the present study was to examine whether blood pressure (BP) relates to various executive functions in residents of homes for the elderly. Several cognitive tests measuring flexibility, fluency, inhibition, planning, and working memory were administered. Associations between these executive functions and systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were examined. The results revealed that normal SBP (<120 mmHg) related to better fluency and flexibility performance, whereas no significant effects of DBP were noted. The present study indicates that specifically SBP might be important with regard to executive ability in residents of homes for the elderly.

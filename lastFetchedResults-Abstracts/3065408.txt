Recently, it has been recognized that the dilation of the LMI characterizations has new potentials in dealing with such involved problems as multi-objective control, robust performance analysis or synthesis for real polytopic uncertainty and so on. In MPC area, Cuzzola et al. have proposed a technique which is based on the use of several Lyapunov functions each one corresponding to a different vertex of the uncertainty polytope. The main advantage of this approach with respect to the other well-known techniques is the reduced conservativeness. However, this approach also increases the on-line computational complexity, which partially limits its practicality. In this paper a novel approach by using convex combinations is addressed in order to reduce such on-line computational complexity substantially, with guaranteed robust stability of the closed-loop system, and by using the concept of the asymptotically stable invariant ellipsoids.

Approximately 75% of inmates in New South Wales (NSW) have mental health issues (Butler &amp; Alnutt, 2003). Scarce resources force the management of acute psychiatric symptoms only, meaning that co-morbid conditions such as neurocognitive deficits are less likely to be assessed. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of a computerized battery in the assessment of inmates within the criminal justice system. Thirty male inmates were assessed. Data were compared to matched controls. The custodial sample was characterized by an increase in the prevalence of previous trauma; high levels of depression, anxiety and stress and neurocognitive deficits, including sustained attention, impulsivity and executive dysfunction.

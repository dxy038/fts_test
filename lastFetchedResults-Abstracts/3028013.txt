Characteristics of design and magnetic field analysis of induction machine (IM) with field weakening operation are investigated. Design objective and constraints, which are related to performance requirements of increased constant power range and speed limit, can be defined preliminarily, and the designed IM prototype for field weakening will be proposed. Subsequently, nonlinear magnetic field analysis with input voltage source is performed to the designed IM.

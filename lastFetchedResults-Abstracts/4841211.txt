The problem of optimizing virtual paths (VPs) system based in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network is addressed. In order to obtain the optimum VPs system, we propose the use of the genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this kind of problem. The equivalent bandwidth of each VP which guarantees both the quality of service (QoS) in the cell level and the grade of service (GoS) in the connection level is formulated to represent the effective transmission rate of the heterogeneous traffic VP. A multi-objective function which comprises of the average blocking rate (ABR) and the average packet delay (APD) is used as the VPs system assignment constraint is to be minimized in the optimization method. We describe a simple coding technique in which each chromosome is represented as the VPs system. Also, the concept of the past solution is used in order to reduce the calculation times for adaptive VPs assignment. The numerical results show that with our proposed method, the optimum VPs system which we obtain maximizes the ATM network throughput

Furans are dangerous and highly toxic compounds entering to the environment
from natural and manmade sources. Having high stability and half-life, these
compounds remain for a long period in the medium and bring about severe effects
on human beings and the environment. The aim of this study was to identify
dioxins and furans emission sources in Iran and to estimate their
contribution in emission rate. ‌Materials and Methods: First, we identified the emission sources of dioxins and furans and then
necessary data was gathered by referring to the authorized organizations and
filling the prepared UNEP questionnaires. We used Excel software to analyze the
data collected.Results: According to
the results obtained, total dioxins and furan emission in Iran in 2010,
was 1957 g TEQ/yr; out of this amount, 705.8 g TEQ is emitted to the atmosphere
and 643.2 g TEQ is residual ash. Therefore, dioxins and furans emission rate
was 26.4 µg TEQ/capita in Iran.
The most rates of emissions were associated with uncontrolled open burning
(732.8 g TEQ/yr) and ferrous and nonferrous metal production (635.7 g TEQ/yr)
such as cupper, iron, and steel.‌Conclusion: Our findings showed that the
emission rate of Dioxins and Furans is much higher in Iran compared
with other countries and appropriate management strategies are required to
control these dangerous pollutants.

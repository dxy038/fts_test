Background: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first enzyme in initiating the pentose phosphate shunt, is an important component in generation of NADPH. Although innumerable studies have been performed on human erythrocyte G6PD, however, the effect of trace elements on the enzyme activity requires further investigations.
Objective: To study the effect of aluminum on human erythrocyte G6PD.
Methods: In this experimental research, following the purification of G6PD using chromatographic methods, the effect of different concentrations of A13+ (up to 100 micro-molar) on G6PD activity was studied. The enzyme activity was measured at different concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+ to determine the type of inhibitory action.
Findings: Aluminum at the concentration of 100 ÂµM showed a considerable inhibitory effect on G6PD activity (60%). The type of inhibitory action, depending on the use of glucose-6-phosphate or NADP+, was competitive and noncompetitive, respectively.
Conclusion: Aluminum exerts an inhibitory action on human erythrocyte G6PD activity.

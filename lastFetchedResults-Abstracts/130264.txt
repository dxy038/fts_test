BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regarding prospective effects and cross immunity between some species of parasites, obtained antigens of a parasite can be used to prevent other parasitic diseases and adjuvant of this effect can be increased. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hydatid cyst components in prevention of H. nana in rat.
METHODS: Forty rats with the same sex and age were selected after gaining confidence in nonexistence of any parasitic disease. They were divided into two groups and each group were divided into four subgroups. In one group, antigen of fluid, protoscolex, germinal layer were injected respectively and in the other group, these antigenic materials were used with an adjuvant. Control group was considered for both groups. The immunization was performed by multiple injection. One week after injection of antigenic materials, H. nana eggs were received orally by rats. After observation of H. nana in stool of rats in control group, blood sample was taken from all rats. Different biochemical tests and immunological and parasitological tests were performed on sera and stool samples, respectively.
FINDINGS: Different protein measurements especially gammaglobulin indicated that membrane of hydatid cyst had the strongest antigenic effect in comparison to two other parts of cyst and hydatid cyst fluid showed the weakest one.
CONCLUSION: Stool test in control group and exposing egg showed that this group was infected. It was not seen any exposing egg in rats that immunized with different hydatid cyst components. Statistical and biochemical results demonstrated that this effect increased by using adjuvant with different hydatid cyst components and its results showed that immune effect would be increased after injection of adjuvant.

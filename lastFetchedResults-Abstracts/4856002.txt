In fact, to converse membership degrees is information fusion technology, the key steps of which is to find the information in index membership about object classification. For this case, distinguishable weight, effective value and comparable value are designed through the analysis of contribution of index to sample classification, which eliminates the redundant data and extract the effective values. In this way, the safety reliability model of mine ventilation system based on information fusion technology, was proposed.

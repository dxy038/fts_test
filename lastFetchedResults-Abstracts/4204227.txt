In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), user association is one of the most significant tools to deal with the problem of load balancing or interference mitigation. However, though much work has been down on the design of user association scheme, some important real-world policies are largely ignored and fail to be considered simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the user association scheme in HetNets with the rules such as traffic capacity constraint, power budget, stable connection guarantee and transmission cost-optimal. Firstly we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem with users of different quality of service (QoS) requirements (constant bit rate requirement (CBR) users and best effort (BE) users). The objectives of the problem are balancing the load distribution of CBR users, maximizing the throughput of BE users and minimizing network transmission cost, respectively. Then we analyze how to optimize the three objectives jointly and employ binary particle swarm optimizer to solve the problem. Extensive simulations are conducted, the results show that our algorithm can lead to significantly better performances than traditional algorithms, i.e., higher balancing index for CBR users, higher throughput for BE users, low transmission cost and more stable link connection.

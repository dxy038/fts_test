This paper presents a new way to combine two different approaches of artificial intelligence looking for the best path in a graph, ant colony optimization and Bayesian networks. The main objective is to develop a learning management system which will have the capability of adapting the learning path to the learnerpsilas needs in execution time, taking into account the pedagogical weight of each learning unit and the systempsilas social behavior.

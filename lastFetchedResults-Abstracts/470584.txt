Objective
We investigated whether homeostatic indices of insulin sensitivity might suitably screen for gestational diabetes mellitus.
Study design
One hundred twenty-three pregnant women who were between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation completed a 3-hour 100-g oral glucose challenge test and fasting insulin level in a nested case-control study design. Insulin sensitivity indices were calculated and tested for their ability to detect gestational diabetes mellitus.
Results
Fasting glucose demonstrated the best overall accuracy, but the homeostasis model assessment and quick insulin sensitivity check index were also sensitive screening techniques for gestational diabetes mellitus when either the National Diabetes Data Group or Carpenter-Coustan criteria were used.
Conclusion
Homeostasis model assessment, quick insulin sensitivity check index, and fasting glucose are sensitive screening tests for gestational diabetes mellitus and can avoid oral administration of glucose-containing solutions.

We evaluate different admission control (AC) policies in various mobile cellular scenarios with multimedia support and QoS guarantees defined by the expected blocking probabilities for new call set up and handover requests. For each of the studied policies we determine the maximum calling rate that can be offered to the system while satisfying the QoS objective, using a hill-climbing algorithm. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of the optimization process. Additionally we study how sensitive these policies are to the tolerance of system parameters and to overloads. In regard to the system capacity, preliminary results show that policies of the trunk reservation class outperform policies that produce a product-form solution and the improvement ranges approximately between 5 and 15%.

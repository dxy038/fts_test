Objective: To investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and aggrevation of the disease in patients with malaria.
Methods and Results: In the present study lipoperoxidation was demonstrated during the acute phase of malaria by a significant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The lowest values of PUFA were obtained for C20:4 and C22:6, which were the main targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when parasitemia was higher than 1%. Similarly, plasma vitamins E and A were significantly reduced during the acute phase of malaria owing to their consumption in part as antioxidants. However, evaluation of the antioxidant enzymatic system in red blood cells of malaria patients indicated no significant difference from controls. Only superoxide dismutase activity tended to decrease when parasitemia increased.
Conclusion: The results suggest that superoxide radicals are the main ROS produced during the acute phase of malaria, and that rejuvenation of RBC during hemolysis involving increased enzyme activities interacts to protect RBC from excessive superoxide radical production.

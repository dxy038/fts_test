Wavelength Division Multiplexed based Passive Optical Networks (WDM-PON) are subjected to wide variety of incidental failures. It is preferred in WDM-PONs to provide fault management (survivability) at link layer level. In this paper, our objective is to determine the factors, which can increase the scope of survivability at link layer, not available currently. We propose a cost-effective recovery mechanism, called ldquoExtended Survivable Passive Access Networkrdquo (e-SPAN). e-SPAN is a multi-level protection scheme that has potential to corrects eventual errors that are caused by the transmission system by using different forward error correcting codes at receiver end, thus allowing us to have better performance budget in terms of BER and extended transmission distance of 8 to 12 Km.

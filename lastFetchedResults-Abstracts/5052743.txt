The erection of a structural steel frame in high-rise construction requires a significant amount of skilled labor and is inherently a very dangerous occupation. In order to resolve these problems, the use of robots in structural steel frame erection is currently being researched in Korea. In addition, since robots consist of many sensitive machines, sensors, and devices, the development of a weather-unaffected working space was considered. However, the advanced automation construction systems being developed in Korea differ from those previously researched in that the former employ existing tower cranes; therefore, the need for a construction factory (CF) that comprises a temporary shield with opening and shutting sliders was felt. Therefore, the work space environment, which is covered by a CF, should be evaluated to enhance the advanced automation construction systems in Korea. The objective of this study is to evaluate the work space environment in CF by using a simulation method such as computational fluid dynamics. The results of this study reveal that a CF can provide a work space with a suitable and stable environment for construction automation, thereby enabling the development of advanced automation construction systems in Korea.

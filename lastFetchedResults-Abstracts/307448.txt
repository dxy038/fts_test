Objective: To observe the adrenomedullin (AM) and total nitrite levels in the milk of preeclamptic and normal pregnant women.
Design and methods: Fifteen women with preeclampsia and 15 normal pregnant women were included in the study. Total nitrite was quantitated by Griess reaction, while AM was measured by HPLC.
Results: The levels of AM and total nitrite in colostrum and 30th-day breast milk were decreased in preeclamptics. Total nitrite levels (μmol/l) were 56.09 ± 11.18 vs. 82.20 ± 12.01, P< 0.05, in colostrum of preeclamptics and controls, respectively. The level of total nitrite was 37.75 ± 12.10 vs. 53.28 ± 10.25, P< 0.05, in 30th-day milk of same patients. AM levels (pg/ml) were 11.18 ± 1.11 vs. 16.59 ± 1.24, P< 0.0001, in colostrum of preeclamptics and controls, respectively. In 30th-day milk of same patients, AM levels were 8.41 ± 1.39 vs. 12.18 ± 1.48, P< 0.005, respectively.
Conclusion: This report shows for the first time that human milk has decreased levels of AM and total nitrite in preeclampsia.

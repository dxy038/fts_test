Outbreaks of food-borne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, continue to draw public attention to food safety. Several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of using natural ingredients to control the growth of food-borne pathogens. The objective of this study was to investigate antimicrobial effects of lactic acid and copper, alone and in combination, on the survival and growth of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 in laboratory medium and carrot juice. Survival and growth of 38 Salmonella spp. and six E. coli O157:H7 strains were compared when grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and carrot juice under conditions including either lactic acid (0.2%) alone, copper sulfate (50 ppm) alone or the combination of the two. The growth inhibition was negligible when copper sulfate was added to BHI broth and carrot juice. Lactic acid (0.2%) retarded the growth of bacterial strains. However, the growth of bacterial strains was significantly inhibited when both lactic acid and copper were in BHI broth and carrot juice within the time frame of this study. These findings indicated that lactic acid, in combination with copper sulfate, could be used to inhibit the growth of pathogens. Natural ingredients, such as lactic acid and low dose of copper ions, can be used to improve the safety of food products.

Linear feed system of high precision and high speed CNC machine tool is direct driven by Permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM). In order to reduce transient vibration of machine tool caused by PMLSM in start and stop with high speed change, the jerk motion profile of PMLSM was designed by using sinusoidal curve without any abrupt corner. An objective function was minimized which was composed of execution time and integral of the squared jerk. The kinematic and physical limitations of PMSLM were considered in the optimal proceeding. Compared with other motion planning, the simulations of results show that propose planning has reduced vibration with same execute time.

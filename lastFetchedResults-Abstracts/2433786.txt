This paper presents a mathematical model for solving dynamic cell formation problem, operator assignment and the inter-cellular and intra-cellular layouts simultaneously. The proposed model includes three objectives, the first objective seeks to minimize inter and intra-cell part movement, machine relocation, second objective minimize operator related cost, third objective maximize ratio of consecutive forward flows. The model is Multi-objective; therefore, the LP-metric approach is used to solve it. In order to validate the model, the proposed model has been solved by using Lingo software. Then, due to NP-hardness of the cell formation problem, for solving large scale problems, a multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm proposed. Several numerical examples solved by Lingo software and multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm. Results show that the proposed multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm solved considerably time less than the software Lingo and also none of the answers obtained by the two methods are not dominated

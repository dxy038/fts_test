This paper presents the first results of the eco-design problematic in case of one of the simplest electromagnetic energy converter: the single-phase electric transformer connected to a constant frequency and voltage power supply. The optimization of its sizes is led with the following objectives: the active mass and the global life cycle energy cost. We first compare optimization\´s results to those with "classic" mass versus power losses (copper and iron losses) optimization for several times of use ratio. This leads to recognition of the significant impact of the life cycle energy on the arrangement of the optimal Pareto fronts, explained by conflicting energy contribution in the life cycle global energy cost objective. Then we logically observe that the life cycle assessment impact is more significant when the real use duration is smaller than the lifetime. After that, the sensitivity of the optimization\´s results to the elementary raw materials energy costs is considered with the same times of use ratio. At last, some optimizations are run with a different raw material: aluminium instead of copper for the windings.

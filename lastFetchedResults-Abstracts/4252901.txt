With increasing the penetration of wind power into electrical grids, DFIG wind turbines are largely developed due to the variable speed feature and hence influencing system dynamics. A detailed mathematical model of DFIG with a closed-loop vector control system is developed. Based on this, objective functions of the transient conditions are implemented and to optimize the controller parameters of both the rotor and grid-side converters. This paper deals the behaviour of interconnected DFIG with hydro-governor synchronous generator with the transient and post-transient operating conditions. During these conditions, the variations of real and reactive power flows of synchronous and asynchronous generators are analysed by PSCAD/EMTDC software.

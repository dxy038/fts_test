In this paper we present a parasitic aware, process variation tolerant optimization methodology that may be applied to nanoscale circuits to ensure better yield. A current- starved voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is treated as a case study and to the best of the authorsÂ´ knowledge, this is the first VCO design that accounts for both parasitic degradation and process variation together. The physical design of the VCO is carried out in a generic 90 nm Salicide 1.2V/2.5V 1 Poly 9 Metal process design kit. The oscillation frequency is the objective function with the area overhead as constraint. A performance degradation of 43.5% is observed when the parasitic extracted circuit was subjected to worst case process variation. After a single physical design iteration, the frequency of oscillation was within 4.5% of the target.

Background and Objective: Nonspecific chronic lower back pain is the most common type of chronic lower back pain. The use of rehabilitation to achieve a more rapid improvement in patients with chronic lower back pain has always been taken into account. The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of a Pilates program on chronic nonspecific lower back pain and stable range of motion in 40 to 60 year old women.

Materials and Methods: The subjects of this study included 34 women with chronic nonspecific lower back pain (CNLBP) that were randomly assigned into two groups; a group undergoing a Pilates program (n = 17) and a control group (n = 17). The Pilates group performed exercises for 10 one hour sessions. After completion of the training program, the posttest was conducted. The ModifiedModified Schober test, lateral bend angle and visual analog scale (VAS), were used to collect data. In order to analyze the data, descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Covariance; ANCOVA and Sidac post hoc test) were used.

Results: Pilates exercises had a significant influence on the variables of pain, left lateral flexion, right lateral flexion, hyperextension and flexion of the lumbar spine (P&lt;0/05). Sidac findings also showed significant differences between the Pilates and the control group in measurements of pain, left lateral flexion, lateral flexion right, hyperextension and flexion (P&lt;0/05).

Conclusion: In order to increase the range of motion of the lumbar spine, trunk stability and reduce back pain, coaches and managers could use this noninvasive and lowcost method (Pilates) in rehabilitation programs for patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

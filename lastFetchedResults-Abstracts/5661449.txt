Superconductor microelectronics (SME) enables the realization of the true digital-RF architecture, extending the flexibility and fidelity of digital processing up to multi-GRz speeds. HYPRES is developing digital-RF subsystems that provide wideband and narrowband OBJECTIVE-level performance for WIN-T, FCS, TCA and JTRS communications systems. These subsystems are designed for near-term insertion into existing and future systems providing dramatic performance improvements and major reductions in SWaP and life cycle cost. This quantum electronics technology provides a quantum leap in performance ypassing the slow incremental improvements of traditional mostly analog electronics - to revolutionize future RF systems. This revolutionary SME technology provides unparalleled accuracies, spectral purities and ultra fast speeds that are otherwise unattainable with competing semiconductor technologies. The advantages and features of SME technology can be applied to a wide range of military satellite communications applications to include an extended family of JTRS SCA compliant radios in the 2 GHz to 55 GHz band and digital beamforming (DBF) phased arrays that make SATCOM-On-The-Move (SOTM) viable.

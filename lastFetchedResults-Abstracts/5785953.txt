BTRON is the business-oriented operating system (OS) specification of TRON (The Realtime Operating System Nucleus) and is a computer architecture for office workstations. The major objective is to offer a unified man-machine interface (MMI) and the handling of multimedia data. Data transportability has also been achieved. In order to achieve these objectives, the BTRON specification proposes a data model called the real-object/virtual-object model. The evaluation of the BTRON specification is described.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The deployment of highly powerful and sophisticated new-generation satellite broadband systems implies that a large portion of their bandwidth on the radio interface has to be devoted to conveying signalling information. Adequately dimensioning such a signalling bandwidth is an important design objective allowing the effective exploitation of the overall system resources and the cost-effective provision of a target quality of service to multimedia traffic. The performance of two basic techniques for accessing the signalling channels in a reference multimedia geostationary platform is investigated in this paper: random (slotted Aloha) and dedicated access. It is demonstrated here that dedicated access, despite rational appearances, allows 50% saving of signalling bandwidth while satisfying both the system and user constraints in terms of grade and quality of service respectively. This is accomplished by providing a statistical centralized connection admission control on Earth and an intelligent scheduling of the resource requests on board the satellite.

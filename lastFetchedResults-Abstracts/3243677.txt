The main objective of this paper is to present a model-based starting control scheme and the experimental validations for the spark ignition (SI) engines. The control scheme targets smooth and quick engine speed response during the starting stage. Specifically, the control scheme consists of the fuel injection control loop and the speed regulation loop. For the fuel control, an observer-based estimation is used to get the air charge for each cylinder. With the estimation, individual injection command is attained from the dynamical model of fuel path. The speed regulation is conducted by event-based coordinative feedback control with spark advance (SA) and throttle opening. Validation experiments carried out on a commercial car-used engine test bench demonstrate that the design method guarantees the specifications of a starting speed control benchmark problem.

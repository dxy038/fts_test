In this paper, a p-cycle generation algorithm is proposed that can protect service of static traffic model in WDM network. As the basic p-cycle sets calculated by algorithm such as the straddle link algorithm (SLA) always contain a straddle link in it. That is why the protection efficiency is higher than bidirectional line switch ring (BLSR). Any idle resource can be used for traffic restoration. But if the resource is not configured carefully then not all the resource of idle state can be utilized efficiently. Some extensions of algorithms are brought into effect to improve the protection capability. Based on these extensions, a novel iterative expanding p-cycle is introduced. A platform is constructed in OPNET modeler to verify the performance of this algorithm. Simulation results show that after several expansions for the basic p-cycle sets, the efficiency is improved. The pre-configured resource is deployed before any requests come. Comparison between different network topologies is studied. Finally, the results are analyzed and some directivity is given for further research.

We have previously proposed a statistical method for estimating pronunciation proficiency and intelligibility of presentations delivered in English by Japanese speakers. In an offline test, we also evaluated possibly-confused pairs of phonemes that are often mispronounced by Japanese native speakers [7][8]. In this study, we developed an online evaluation system for English spoken by Japanese speakers using offline techniques and carried out an evaluation to obtain the effect thereof based on experimental results. The results showed that both the objective and subjective evaluations improved when using this system.

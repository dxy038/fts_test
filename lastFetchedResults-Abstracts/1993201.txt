The objective of this study was to investigate the anticancer activity of caffeate derivatives in human cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that caffeate derivatives decreased the population growth of COLO 205, assessed using the MTT assay. However, caffeate derivatives, at the concentrations used in this study (0–250 μM) did not affect the viability of HepG2, Huh7, PLC5, and SK-Hep-1 cells. Flow cytometric analysis of COLO 205 cells exposed to decyl caffeate showed that the number of apoptotic cells increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that decyl caffeate stimulated an increase in protein expression levels of p53, Fas, FasL, AIF, and Apaf-1. Additionally, treatment with decyl caffeate changed the expression levels of Bcl-2 family members and subsequently induced the activation of caspase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3, which was followed by cleavage of PARP. Our findings highlight the chemopreventive potential of decyl caffeate.

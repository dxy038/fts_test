The location of multi-distribution centers is an NP-hard problem. For some urgent goods, the method of locating the distribution centers in terms of minimizing transportation costs sometimes cannot satisfy the needs of customers. Considering the maximization of service level as the objective to locate the centers, we construct a mathematical model and design a genetic algorithm of optimization to solve the model. The simulation in a numerical example shows that the constructed model and the designed algorithm are effective and feasible to solve the problem of locating the centers according to the maximization of service level for some urgent goods.

[Objective] To explore the preventive effect of probiotics on sperm damage induced by diet oxidative stress. [Methods] Thirty male rats were assigned to three groups randomly: group I (control) consumed a normal standard diet (5% fat, w:w), group II (high fat diet) were fed with the standard diet supplemented with a 20% pure sunflower seed oil and group III (high fat diet + probiotics) were fed with the standard diet supplemented with 20% pure sunflower seed oil and 2% probiotics. After 3 weeks, concentration, viability and motility of sperm, and sperm cell DNA integrity were determined using a comet assay. [Results] The results showed that high fat diet could significant reduce the sperm concentration, viability, motility, and damage in sperm DNA. The damage of sperm were significantly attenuated in probiotics supplemented treatment and had no obviously difference on sperm quality compared with control group. [Conclusion] Present observation indicated the probiotics had the positive protective function on reproduction damage by improving sperm quality.

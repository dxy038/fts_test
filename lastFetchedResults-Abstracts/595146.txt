Objective: To compare the rubber bond ligation of haemorrhoids with Milligan and Morgan haemorrhoidectomy in 2nd and 3rd degree of haemorrhoids in terms of postoperative complication.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in Surgical "A" unit PGM1, LRH, Peshawar, from Feb. 2003 to September 2003. A total of 100 patients were selected and admitted through OPD. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Group H comprised of Milligan and Morgan haemorrhoidectomy and group B was that of rubber band ligation (RBL). Fifty patients were included in each group. Postoperative clinical course was compared. The SPSS version 10 was applied to the data.Results: Rubber band Ligation group on average stayed in hospital for 1.2 days. While Haemorrhoidectomy group stayed for 1.5 days on average. Stay range was from 1 to 3 days in both cases. Eighty percent of cases (n=40) in haemorrhoidectomy group had pain and 56% (n=28) had urinary retention. While in RBL group pain was present in 8% of cases (n-4) and urinary retention in 4% (n-2) of cases, (P-value < 0.001 for pain and < 0.001 for urinary retention).Conclusion: In second and third degree uncomplicated haemorrhoids rubber band ligation is quite safe and simple way of dealing with haemorrhoids in contrast to Milligan and Morgan hemorrhoidectomy. Rubber band ligation is associated with least complications.

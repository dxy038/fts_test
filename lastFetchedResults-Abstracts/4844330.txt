Efficient logistics and supply chain management are enabled through utilization of efficient information technologies. A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a handheld computer that is used for mobile data applications in different industries to improve the effectiveness of the organizations. The objective of this paper is to aid decision makers to identify the most appropriate PDAs especially for logistics companies. To achieve this, several evaluation criteria have been identified and existing leading PDAs have been investigated. An axiomatic design based fuzzy group decision making is adopted to evaluate PDA alternatives. Finally, a case study is given to demonstrate the potential of the methodology.

Chronic parotiditis is a rare disease of the parotid glands. Both infectious (e.g. tuberculosis) and non-infectious causes (e.g. sarcoidosis, autoimmune diseases, malignancy and duct stones) have been enumerated for this condition.
Primary tuberculous parotiditis is a rare disease. It was diagnosed in a 20-year-old soldier after obtaining a biopsy and observing granuloma and caseous necrosis compatible with TB in histological examination of the specimen. Cultures of discharge and tissue were negative in regard to mycobacterium tuberculosis. Also, malignancy was ruled out by histopathological examinations. Therefore, the four drug anti-TB regimen was initiated. The patient was completely treated and there was no report of recurrence.
The endemic condition of TB in developing countries such as Iran has increased the rate of extra-pulmonary TB. One of the extra pulmonary sites which is rarely involved in TB is parotid gland; presenting usually as chronic swelling or mass. Therefore, it is recommended to consider TB in the differential diagnosis of parotiditis and chronic swelling of this salivary gland especially in developing countries.

This paper presents a new quality evaluation model for stereoscopic videos using depth map segmentation. This study includes both objective and subjective evaluation. The goal of this study is to understand the effect of different depth levels on the overall 3D quality. Test sequences with different coding schemes are used. The results show that overall quality has a strong correlation with the quality of the background, where disparity is smaller relative to the foreground. The results also showed that content type is an important factor in determining the visual quality. While depth segmentation gives information related to 3D perception, additional work is required to develop an objective metric.

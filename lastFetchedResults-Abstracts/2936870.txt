The objective of this work is to reduce the cost and improve the quality of terrestrial photovoltaic modules by developing automated high-throughput (5 MW/yr) processes for interconnecting thin silicon solar cells. New low-stress, high-throughput processes have been developed for cell loading, alignment, and inspection, interconnect ribbon handling, flux application, ribbon-to-cell soldering, cell string handling, and I-V testing of assembled cell strings. Both standard thickness (350 &#956;m) and thin (200 &#956;m) cells have been used to evaluate and refine these processes

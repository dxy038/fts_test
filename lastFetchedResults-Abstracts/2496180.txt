Objective: Bone Marrow ‎Transplantation is considered ‎one of the main procedures used ‎in the treatment of both ‎malignant and non-malignant ‎diseases. Psychological factors ‎after Bone Marrow ‎Transplantation have an ‎important role in the survival of ‎the patients undergoing this ‎procedure‏.‏
Method: In the present study, ‎some parameters including ‎depression, anxiety and cognition ‎were assessed during both pre ‎and post-transplantation in ‎patients undergoing Bone ‎Marrow Transplantation. The ‎evaluations were performed by ‎utilizing several questionnaires ‎including Hospital Anxiety and ‎Depression Scale and Wechsler ‎Memory Scale within 72 hours ‎after hospitalization (pre-‎transplantation) and one month ‎after transplantation (post-‎transplantation). All patients ‎received intensive chemotherapy ‎during the first 72 hours after ‎hospitalization.  Paired t test was ‎used to compare pre and post ‎values. SPSS (version 18) was ‎used to analysis the data. The ‎significance level was defined as ‎p  <  0.05‎‏.‏
Results: Twenty one patients ‎who were not receiving any ‎antianxiety agents at least for two ‎weeks prior to and during this ‎study were included. It was noted ‎that anxiety was significantly less ‎at post-transplantation compared ‎to its pre-transplantation level (P ‎‎= 0.008). However, no significant ‎difference was found between ‎pre and post-transplantation ‎depression. Memory function ‎was significantly improved at ‎post-transplantation compared to ‎pre-transplantation (P = 0.001).‎
Conclusion: The authors suggest ‎that the improvement of anxiety ‎and memory status of the ‎patients one month after the ‎bone marrow transplantation is ‎expected even in the absence of ‎consumption of any antianxiety ‎agents. However, ‎antidepressants may be needed ‎to help those patients who ‎undergo bone marrow ‎transplantation.‎

Objective
hypothesized that dietary patterns, individual nutrients, and specific prescription and over-the-counter medications may influence prostate carcinogenesis. Little information is available regarding the use of these products among men who are participating in prevention trials targeting prostate cancer.
als and methods
l of 92 men (mean age 69 years) participating in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) at an academic center were asked to bring all nutritional supplements and medications to regularly scheduled study visits.
s
ere collected on 86 of 92 men. We found that 85% of men in the PCPT regularly consumed at least 1 nutritional supplement. The mean (±standard deviation) number of dietary supplements consumed per man was 3.3 ± 3.5 (range 0–21). A multivitamin and multimineral (73%) supplement was the most common product consumed. Single-nutrient supplements regularly consumed included: vitamin E (48%), vitamin C (31%), calcium (24%), and selenium (7%). Of men, 36% reported consumption of herbal products. Medications frequently consumed during the study period that may influence prostate carcinogenesis included nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (57%), antihypertensives (49%), lipid lowering agents (27%), and aspirin (64%).
sions
ipants in the PCPT at an academic center have a high propensity for dietary supplement use. Many, such as vitamin E and selenium, are hypothesized to influence the risk of prostate cancer. Several of the medications commonly consumed, including aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and statins, are being investigated as chemopreventive agents. Investigators designing prostate cancer chemoprevention trials should consider including detailed documentation of exposure to these products that may influence study outcomes.

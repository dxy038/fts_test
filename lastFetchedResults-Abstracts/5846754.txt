The Class-Shape function Transformation (CST) method is used to describe the parameterized airfoil geometry. The parameterized models for aerodynamic and stealthy performance of airfoil are constructed. The aerodynamic analysis model of airfoil is constructed by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method based on N-S equations. And the stealthy performance analysis model of airfoil is constructed by Computational Electromagnetic Method (CEM) based Method of Moments (MoM). The multi-objective aerodynamic and stealthy performance optimization method for airfoil using Kriging surrogate model is presented in this paper. The Latin hypercube method is employed to get a set of sample points. The aerodynamic and stealthy performance Kriging models are built. The multi-objective aerodynamic and stealthy performance optimization of airfoil is optimized by combining Pareto genetic algorithm with Kriging surrogate model. The presented method is validated by two applications. The results of the investigation show that the constructed analysis models are reasonable and the presented multi-objective optimization design method is feasible, which can improve the performance of airfoil and the efficiency of optimization effectively.

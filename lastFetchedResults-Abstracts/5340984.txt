We present optimal solutions to the following problems: (1) post-layout buffer insertion, (2) wire-sizing and (3) simultaneous buffer insertion and wire-sizing. We optimize a practical objective function: required arrival time. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first sub-exponential algorithms for these problems. In experiments, we observe substantial improvements over previous results for buffer insertion, and up to 25% improvement in delay by wire-sizing

In this paper, we present an optimum approach to design a MIMO controller for a manipulator using discrete tabu search (TS) algorithm. In the first step, the TS algorithm is reviewed and then we employ the proposed method in order to assign efficiently the optimal PID controller parameters. The design goal is to minimize the integral absolute error and reduce transient response by minimizing overshoot, settling time and rise time of the system. A 5-bar-linkage is considered as a case study. We define an objective function including these indexes. Then by minimizing this function using discrete TS algorithm, controller parameters design is performed efficiently and quickly. Superior features of this algorithm are fast tuning of PID parameters, rapid convergence, less computational burden and capability to avoid from local minima. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed TS method compared with other heuristic method, i.e., the genetic algorithm (GA) is more efficient in terms of improving the step response of the robot.

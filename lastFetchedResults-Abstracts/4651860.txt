The objective of this paper is to introduce and investigate the issue of integrity in an INS/GPS navigation loop for autonomous land vehicle applications. The paper briefly outlines the standard fusion algorithm for the INS/GPS loop, while the focus is on the detection of possible faults both before and during the fusion process. The concept of fault detection focuses on the low frequency faults of the INS, caused by bias and drift, and the high frequency faults of the GPS unit caused by multipath errors and changes in satellite geometry

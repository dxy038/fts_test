This research made use and analyzed the objective and subjective data simultaneously so as to gain more insightful information of users, where we took physiological data as objective data and questionnaire result as subjective data. Therefore, we considered that using eye activity data, heart rate data, mental workload data and questionnaires data was a complete and detailed approach to evaluate usability.

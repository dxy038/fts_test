The study of macrolideâ€“ribosome interactions has been investigated using two-dimensional transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (TRNOESY). A new medically important macrolide antibiotic, roxithromycin, with the replacement of the 9-keto group in erythromycin by a 9-oxime chain, was studied in the complex state with the bacterial ribosome. Analysis of transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (TRNOE) experiment resulted in a set of constraints for all protons pairs. These constraints were used in structure determination procedures based on molecular modelling to obtain a bound structure compatible with the experimental NMR data. The results compared with the conformational analysis of the substrate in solution indicate that only one specific conformation is preferred in the bound state while in the free state the sugar ring moities were relatively disordered. The bioactive macrolide antibiotics studied roxithromycin and erythromycin which displayed a strong NMR response, are metabolized in RU39001 and erythralosamine respectively which do not retain antimicrobial activity. The inactive major metabolites were used to define if TRNOEs observation may be characteristic of a biological activity. These control experiments gave essentially blank TRNOESY spectra. This study shows that Mg2+ does not play a direct role for the low affinity binding site studied by TRNOE what is in agreement with an hypothesis of two distinct binding levels, with a low affinity binding level necessary for the tight binding one.

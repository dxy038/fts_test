In dealing with computer networks, these allow the flow of information through the resources of various equipmentÂ´s. This work describes the implementation through the encapsulation of Protocol DNP3, usually employed in Smart Grid communication, in a simulator of discrete events. The NS-2 is a simulator in open source of network events, that facilitate the development of communication networks scenarios considering the protocols involved, in wireless or wired technologies. The objective of this work is to develop the DNP3 protocol encapsulation over a TCP/IP in the in the discrete event Simulator NS-2, allowing an analysis of behavior of a middle or large network sized in Smart Grid applications.

The mobile user objective system (MUOS) uses WCDMA as a basis for its waveform definition. This paper deals with the quasi-analytic method of WCDMA physical layer simulation that has been used extensively for performance simulation, model development for system simulation and development of signal processing algorithms on the MUOS project. Quasi-analytic method offers speedup factors, relative to conventional waveform simulation, of 100x or more. It is shown here that quasi-analytic can also be very accurate.

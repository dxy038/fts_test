In this paper the correlation between user-oriented perception based objective measures of digital video quality and signal impairments due to a broadcast radio channel is investigated using simulation. The simulation chain encompasses an MPEG-2 codec, channel coding and OFDM modulation to transmit the signal, then the modulated signal is corrupted by the radio channel (which is assumed frequency selective) and by the receiver AWGN. The amount of degradation introduced is quantified by comparing the same video quality measures at the source and at the receiver end. The amount of degradation is finally related to radio channel characteristics, bit error rate (BER), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and error burst distribution

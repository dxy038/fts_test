The main objective of this project is to realize an integration plan for Avarious renewable-energy systems in remote areas using a geographical-Ainformation system (GIS) in order to Adetermine the optimal management and use Aof energy in these locations. The area studied is Corsica, an island located in Athe south-east of France. For the remote site considered, four systems Asupplying electricity are compared: a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) / batteries Asystem, a hybrid PV / batteries / back-up generator system, an engine generator Aand an extension of the existing electrical network. The most economic Aconfiguration was chosen as the best solution to electrify the remote site. APhysical and technical-economical processes are integrated in the GIS. This GIS Ais used to determine the profitability boundaries for PV systems compared to a grid extension and under four different load profiles, and has led to the Aelaboration of an integration plan of renewable energies in south Corsica. The Astudy has shown that for 60-90% of remote sites, a PV decentralized electricity Asystem is the most economical means of electrification, (c; 1999 Elsevier AScience Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper presents an integrated framework for evaluating impacts of demand side management (DSM) on composite generation and transmission system reliability. A set of load management models for peak clipping/shifting and valley filling, strategic conservation and strategic load growth are presented. Composite DSM actions in the power systemÂ´s diverse areas are also modeled. Composite system reliability evaluation procedure incorporated with DSM resources is given in Monte Carlo simulation approach. The DC power-flow-based optimal load curtailment objective and multiple level load curves are employed to calculate composite reliability indices. The IEEE reliability test system is used to illustrate the proposed approach and implement comparisons of impacts with and without DSM activity on reliability indices

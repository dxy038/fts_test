Main objective of the paper is to create a generic methodology as well as context sensitive services based on an ontological approach, to support decision support across various application domains (e.g, manufacturing, software engineering). It is investigated how context sensitivity can be used in order to achieve high adaptivity of software solutions for decision support within the addressed application domains. This will result in realizing decision support services self-adaptable to the current identified context of users/products/services. The research will be driven by industrial application scenarios for decision support solutions for adapting of product extension services in several manufacturing companies in various sectors and for Quality Assurance of software development projects.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of pre-treatment of prepubertal gilts with FSH on the estrus and ovulatory responses to eCG injection at two ages. A total of 149 prepubertal Hypor gilts were selected at 150 days (n = 76) or 180 days (n = 73) of age and assigned to injection of 400 IU eCG plus 200 IU hCG (PG600), 600 IU eCG alone (Folligon), pre-treatment with 72 mg FSH (Folltropin) administered as 6 Ã— 12 mg injections at 12 h intervals with 600 IU Folligon 12 h after last FSH injection, or non-injected controls. To facilitate detection of estrus, gilts were exposed to a mature boar for 15 min daily for 7 days. To determine ovulatory responses, blood samples were obtained on the day of injection and 10 days later and assayed for progesterone content. Following treatment at 150 days, one control gilt (5.3%) was deemed estrus but ovulation did not occur. Compared to treatment with Folligon alone, PG600 injection tended (P = 0.1) to increase the estrus response (52.6% compared with. 26.3%) and increased (P &lt; 0.01) the ovulatory response (89.5% compared with. 47.4%). The estrous response in gilts pretreated with Folltropin was intermediate (42.1%) but the ovulatory response (47.4%) was the same as for Folligon alone. Following treatment at 180 days, two control gilts (10.5%) were deemed estrus and ovulation did occur in these gilts. There was no difference between hormone-treated groups for estrus or ovulatory responses, although the ovulatory response of PG600-treated gilts tended (P = 0.1) to be greater than for the Folligon-treated group (89.5% compared with 66.7%), with Folltropin-pretreated gilts being intermediate (76.5%). These data demonstrate that the estrus and ovulatory responses of gilts were greater for PG600 than for Folligon and that while responses to PG600 were not affected by gilt age, for the combined Folligon groups, estrous response (P &lt; 0.02) and ovulatory response (P &lt; 0.05) improved with increased gilt age.

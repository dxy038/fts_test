In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze the solubility and distribution of dried europium(III)-chelate dyed nanoparticles in mini channels of milled polystyrene (PS) cartridges. The particular objective for the study is to measure quantitatively the efficiency of the resuspension of dried nanoparticles from the surface of PS channels and to determine the homogeneity of the solute particles in a reaction chamber considering also the incubation time.

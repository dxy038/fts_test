Collaboration among enterprises through Web service has become a hot topic. Before the collaboration, how to select the most appropriate enterprise to collaborate with, from a set of enterprise candidates that provide similar functions, is an important issue. Existing work focus on proposing evaluation rules, and aggregating these rules to evaluate a service, where subjectiveness is usually involved. In this paper, we propose to utilize &#194;&#191;serve, be served&#194;&#191; relationship to evaluate the quality of services. In more detail, we use quality dependency graph (QDG) method model the relationship among enterprises, and then, by traveling the built QDG, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model is used to calculate the evaluation result of each candidate organization. Our method provides a more objective way for collaboration on enterprise level.

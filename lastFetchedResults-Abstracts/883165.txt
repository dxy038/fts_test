Objective: Obesity is one of the modifiable risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adiposity causes insulin
resistance and diabetes by various mechanisms. This study was undertaken to determine diabetogenic effect of
adiposity in relation to age for identification of vulnerable age groups.
Methods: This prospective study included 370 healthy adult non-diabetic individuals. Height and weight were
recorded to calculate body mass index (BMI). Fasting blood sugar (FBS) was estimated by glucose oxidase method.
Results: A stepwise increase in magnitude of BMI was observed with increase of age in decades. Although increase
in mean FBS was observed with age, statistically significant (p = 0.00093) increase in mean FBS was observed only
in 4th decade of life. Positive correlation was observed (Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient r = + 0.26) between BMI
and FBS.
Conclusion: With increasing age, BMI and FBS increase, especially during 4th decade of life. This emphasizes the
need to target the vulnerable age group (30-40 years) for creating awareness about maintenance of ideal body weight
to prevent early onset of type 2 diabetes. Positive correlation between BMI and FBS reiterates diabetogenic effect of
adipose tissue and emphasizes importance of maintenance of normal BMI.

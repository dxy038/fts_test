This paper discusses novel approach to micro device product engineering. The main objective is a customer-oriented methodology based on a real sample of MEMS vibration sensor engineering flow. Multi-site product development, virtual prototyping, rapid virtual wafer run with extended customer support and feedback are discussed. Specific set of software tools is also defined. Methodology visualization and it validation by the reference to real MEMS inertial sensor fabrication process are also presented.

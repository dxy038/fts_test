The objective of the present work, is to investigate the feasibility of machining hard materials with bonded tools. In the present work, a nickel-based superalloy namely; supermet 718 has been machined with bonded as well as mechanically clamped tools. The present work demonstrates a favorable effect for bonded tools on surface roughness, when compared with mechanically clamped tools. However, the tool wear seems to be unaffected by the technique of cutting tool assembly.

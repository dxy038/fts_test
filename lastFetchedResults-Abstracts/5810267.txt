In this paper, we present an integrated time-series data mining environment for medical data mining. Medical time-series data mining is one of key issues to get useful clinical knowledge from medical databases. However, users often face difficulties during such medical time-series data mining process for data preprocessing method selection/construction, mining algorithm selection, and post-processing to refine the data mining process as shown in other data mining processes. To get more valuable rules for medical experts from a time-series data mining process, we have designed an environment which integrates time- series pattern extraction methods, rule induction methods and rule evaluation methods with visual human-system interface. After implementing this environment, we have done a case study to mine time- series rules from blood/urine biochemical test database on chronic hepatitis patients. The result shows the availability to find out valuable clinical course rules based on time-series pattern extraction. Furthermore, we compared the difference of time-series pattern extraction methods with objective rule evaluation results.

The authors introduce a physically based objective function for determining optimal discrete pulse modulation waveforms in power electronics applications. Using this objective function, it is demonstrated that the problem of selecting an optimal waveform reduces to a quadratic zero-one integer program. It is shown that the structure of this zero-one program lends itself to a bounding algorithm that allows many of the branches in the search tree to be eliminated, considerably reducing the computational cost.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

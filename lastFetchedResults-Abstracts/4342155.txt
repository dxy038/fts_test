Both dynamic electrical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were successfully associated to explore the relaxational processes and phase transitions in amorphous and semi-crystalline PEN samples. The main objective of this work is to understand the influence of morphological and conformational changes on the activation parameters of molecular mobility responsible for various dielectric relaxations observed in PEN.

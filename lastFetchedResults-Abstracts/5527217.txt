China´s electronics industry has seen a significant development in the last decades. The electronics manufacturing industry has become the country´s largest industry. Many well-qualified researchers and engineers are needed to meet the demands of the microelectronics industry and research. The fast developing electronics industry challenges the conventional university education. How to innovate the education curriculum to provide qualified engineers for the electronics industry is a challenging task for universities. Education program on microelectronic packaging and assembly has been established at GUET. In this paper, the experiences of establishing the multi-level education program for the microelectronics manufacturing are briefly summarized. A focus is put on the new bachelor´s degree program of Microelectronic Manufacturing Engineering. The objective, scope and curriculum structure of the education program are proposed, which is with an emphasis on the sectors of electronic packaging, assembly and test. This proposal is supported by the fact of the existing huge demands for the qualified engineers in these sectors. To achieve the goal, the core courses for the educational curriculum and educational means are proposed and discussed. Further effort to enhance the educational ability is needed.

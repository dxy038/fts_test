The objective of this article is to improve the performance of a transaction in a real time distributed system comprising of heterogeneous networks. For this purpose we have developed a Queue Sensing Distributed Real-Time Commit Protocol (QSDRCP) which ensures the maximum number of transactions is processed before the deadline expires and the ACID property of the transactions executed is preserved. In the design of QSDRCP, various dependencies are considered that exist between the transactions and then determine that if the new incoming transaction can be granted lock. Measures have been taken to enhance the processing speed of the transactions without violating any database constraints that must be enforced. Queue sensing means as soon as a transaction is reaching at a site it is immediately scheduled for the processing and not putting in the wait queue. Further in the presented protocol we are considering percentage of a transaction (low priority) processed before aborting/rescheduling the execution on the arrival of new high priority transaction. A comparative study is also made with some existing protocols. It is found that QSDRCP gives better results.

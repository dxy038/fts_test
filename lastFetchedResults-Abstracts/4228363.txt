Remote working using roaming work agents supported campaigns need multiple observer based view formation by dynamic reconfiguration of the observers located at site. The work addresses development of machine intelligence for dynamic reconfiguration of observers and pertinent context sensitization synchronized to on-line visuals depending on the campaign objective at different phases of operation which mainly relate to navigation, appreciation of surrounding for navigation planning and assessment of local work environment at a site. The comprehensive human-machine interface described here, addresses the dual problem of optimum view set formation and visual context appraisal in an on-line process.

This paper presents design compromises for the capacitor bank chargers needed for klystron modulators of a new 50km long linear collider under study at CERN. The problematic consists in a utility grid power fluctuation resulting from more than 1600 capacitor discharge power converters operating simultaneously. The objective is to supply all klystron modulators with a constant power of 300MW. The utility grid configuration and capacitor chargers design compromises are analyzed from topological and control point of view. Integration issues (volumes) and multi objective control strategies to meet tight specifications in terms of pulse-to-pulse reproducibility and utility grid power fluctuation are evaluated and discussed.

This paper proposes a universal serial bus (USB) solution for sensor networking. First, network architecture has been presented to have, as its primary objective, its integration with existing infrastructure. For this reason, a USB-to-Ethernet gateway has been introduced. Then, many aspects of industrial applications have been considered to realize a suitable solution. Insulation problems and low-cost implementation have been tackled. Working prototypes of each network component have been defined and realized: USB host gateway, USB insulator, and USB hub. Several commercial USB devices can be used as sensors. Finally, some experiments have been carried out: Timing performances, network activities, and power consumption have been tested.

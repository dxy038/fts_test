In this paper we address the issue of failure of data warehousing projects due to an inadequate requirement collection and definition process. We describe a framework that can help accomplish the objective of developing a business driven, actionable set of requirements. The framework consists of a series of steps that facilitate an effective data warehouse requirement collection and definition phase. The paper also addresses the difficult yet common issue of end-usersÂ´ limited availability during the requirement collection process and proposes an approach that can serve to alleviate this problem.

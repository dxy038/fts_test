Introduction: Low birth weight is considered as one of the world's most serious health problems that put tremendous pressure on health care system and family. Poor diet and poor weight gain during pregnancy affect negatively on maternal health and infant birth weight.
Objective: To determine the relationship between nutritional status and maternal weight gain during pregnancy with low birth weight term infants.
Materials and Methods: This study is a historical cohort one conducted on the subjects consisting of 1177 mothers referred to the health-care centers or posts for postpartum care or their children's vaccinations for two months and all have had health records. The mothers, based on their newbornsâ€™ birth weights, were classified into two groups: mothers of underweight infants (2500 grams or less) and mothers of infants with normal weight (more than 2500- 4000 grams). Data were collected from maternal health records and organized interview with mothers. For data analysis, descriptive statistics, chi-square, Fisher, Mann-Whitney U and logistic regression models were used. 
Results: The results showed a significant relationship between maternal nutritional status (p < 0.008) and weight gain (p < 0.002) during pregnancy with low birth weight. Low intake of dairy products 2/57 times (P < 0.018, OR=2.57), low consumption of fruits 3/75 times (slightly significant P < 0.069, OR=3.75), not taking iron supplements, multivitamins and folic acid 13/16 times (P < 0.001, OR=13.16) during pregnancy seem to have increased the chances of the low birth weight.
Conclusion: Considering the dietary factors associated with low birth weight, the role of hygienic personnel in promoting public awareness about proper nutritional status and weight gain during pregnancy is important.

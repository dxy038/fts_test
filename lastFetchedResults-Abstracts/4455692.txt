Among many other applications, ultra wideband (UWB) is considered a promising technology to be deployed for the future wireless personal area networks (WPAN) . The objective of our work is to investigate the indoor propagation characteristics of a UWB signal of which its equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) is limited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the U.S.. A 90 m<sup>2</sup> residential flat in a high-rise building of Hong Kong is a typical example to exhibit the scenarios for a WPAN application. This paper presents the empirical results from various aspects of the propagation characteristics by employing a pair of FCC-compliant UWB transceivers

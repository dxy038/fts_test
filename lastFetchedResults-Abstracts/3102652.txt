This paper analyses problems in robust measurement for resource constrained project. Then, project makespan and the total number of critical sequences as objective functions to be optimized is proposed to determine the right-justified baseline schedule. On the basis of this baseline schedule, the indices of quality robustness and solution robustness are defined. Examples show that the methods proposed in this paper are better than what proposed by Kobylanski and Kuchta.

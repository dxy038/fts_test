In this paper, the authors present interactive, graphical software for introducing speech coding in undergraduate and graduate courses on digital signal processing (DSP) and speech processing. The software facilitates students in understanding and experimentation for practical applications of signal processing concepts introduced in DSP courses. It consists of two complementary components. The first is a MATLAB-based graphical simulation of a state-of-the-art speech coder. This component of the software is designed to complement the theoretical aspects of speech coding with practical exposure to the algorithms using hands-on simulations. The second component is an application that provides a framework for evaluation of different speech coding algorithms for a variety of applications. With this tool, students can easily categorize the performance of different speech coding algorithms through objective measurements as well as subjective listening tests. These tools could be used in entry-level graduate courses in DSP and speech coding.

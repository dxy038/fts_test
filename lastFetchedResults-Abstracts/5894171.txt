In this paper, a power-saving method for emissive display by shrinking histogram is proposed. Based on a modern pixel-level power model of an OLED module, the power consumption factor can be employed in the objective function. Nevertheless, contrast enhancement intrinsically contradicts saving power. In order to solve this problem, we formulate a new objective function which is subject to the constant entropy. By minimizing the distance between two near non-empty bins of image histogram, the power reduction and entropy preservation are simultaneously achieved. To further enhance the perceptional quality, the proposed method is also integrated with other related algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of reducing display power, while the performance of contrast enhancement is also improved.

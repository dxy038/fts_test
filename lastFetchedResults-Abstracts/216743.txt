In this study, genital tracts of 20 healthy non-pregnant buffaloes were collected from Urmia abattoir.
These genital tracts were selected based on their ovaries conditions, half of them were in follicular phase and
the other half were in luteal phase. The samples were taken from anterior, middle and posterior regions of the
cervix and fixed in 10% buffer formalin. Then, histological sections of 5-7 urn thickness were prepared and
stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histomorphometrical study and toluidine blue for study of mast cells.
Histomorphometrical study was accomplished by graded and latticed objective lens device. The results
revealed that the thickness of epithelium significantly (P<0.05) increased in the luteal phase. Mean thickness
of mucosa-submucosa layers in the middle (290.4 ± 12.69 11m) and posterior (283.14 ± 16.49 11m) regions of
the cervix in the follicular phase was significantly more than the luteal phase (P<0.05). Mean thickness of
tunica muscularis increased significantly (P<0.05) during the follicular phase in the anterior region of the
cervix (3325.28 ± 286.69 11m). This study also revealed that the mean distribution of mast cells in the luteal
phase (0.53 ± 0.02) was significantly more than the follicular phase (P<O.OO 1). Generally, this study showed
that the histomorphometrical changes in the cervix of buffalo occur in the follicular and luteal phases of
oestrous cycle. These changes may be related to the fluctuation of oestrogen and progesterone hormones and
distribution of mast cells.

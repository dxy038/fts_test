The design of DNA sequence is important in improving the reliability of DNA computing. In order to find better DNA coding sequence, some appropriate constrained terms that DNA sequence should satisfy are selected, and then the evaluation formulas of each DNA individual corresponding to the selected constrained terms are proposed. Modified Particle Swarm Optimization/Genetic Algorithm(MPSO/GA) Algorithm is presented to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. At last the comparison of the results with the known DNA sequences is made to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the method.

The first preliminary results are reported from the U.S. Round-Robin Test on Plasma Expansion Speed. The tests were performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center on two coupons (six strings) of International Space Station (ISS) solar cell arrays, with a separate small array to obtain arcs (because it is so difficult to get ISS arrays to arc). ISS arrays were used because they have no exposed interconnects to act as bare current collectors and confuse the experimental results. The preconstructed ISS strings were laid out approximately parallel to the plasma expansion velocity to allow for the best test of the simple plasma expansion front current waveform model. Several Langmuir probes were arranged above and to the sides of the sample to allow for measurement of the plasma propagation speed. In the initial set of tests, primary arcs and the consequent current waveforms were measured in a Low Earth Orbit-type plasma. In a second set of tests, two electron guns with diffusers were used to provide an approximately uniform Geosynchronous Earth Orbit-type environment, and primary arcs and current waveforms were obtained. The objective of this and other round-robin tests is to characterize primary arc waveforms in terms of speed and degree of discharge of arc plasmas produced by primary arcs, and their dependences on environment, capacitance per unit area, arc voltage, temperature, and so on. The final goal is to allow engineering estimates of arc current peaks and half-widths to allow confident design and construction of space solar arrays, and to allow mitigation techniques to be evaluated. This is the first in an extended series of tests to be performed at six different U.S. facilities, and with participation from ten different U.S. organizations.

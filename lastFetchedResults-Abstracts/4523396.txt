This paper presents an algorithm that applies a new mechanism in order to generate scheduling which allows for evaluation of the quality of solutions that are obtained in the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP). In this research, the quality of the solution is evaluated by using the makespan as an objective function. It is demonstrated experimentally that the proposed algorithm has better efficiency and efficacy when compared to the classic form of scheduling generation used to evaluate the quality of the solution in the JSSP. The efficiency and efficacy obtained by the proposed algorithm make it possible to generate and evaluate a greater number of better quality solutions in less time, so a greater exploration of the solution space for the JSSP can be conducted.

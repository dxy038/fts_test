The vastness of IPv6 address space and rapid spread of its deployment attract us to usage of IPv6 network. Various types of devices, including embedded systems, are ready to use IPv6 addresses and some of them have already been connected directly to the Internet. Such situation entices attackers to change their strategies and choose the embedded systems as their targets. We have to deploy various types of honey pots on IPv6 network to trace his activities and infer his objective. Huge address space and wide variety of devices, however, suggest the limitation of conventional honey pots. In this paper, we propose a system that dynamically assigns an address to a honey pot by detecting an access to an unassigned address. We also present our strategy against IPv6 address scans by making honey pots collaborate each other.

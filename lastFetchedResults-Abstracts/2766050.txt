A multi-objective (MO) optimization approach is proposed in this letter to develop optimal transmission switching strategies with minimal generating cost and maximal probabilistic reliability. The problem is solved via an evolutionary algorithm together with Monte Carlo simulation to capture the probabilistic nature of system component failures. The numerical results show that the identified quasi Pareto-optimal solutions can provide insights into the trade-off between generating cost and system reliability considering transmission switching.

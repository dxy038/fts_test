In this article, we consider the problem of calculating an appropriate number of near-optimal (subject to a certain routing objective) routes for mobile agents (MAs) that incrementally fuse the data as they visit the nodes in a distributed sensor network. We propose an improved heuristic algorithm which computes an approximate solution to the problem by suggesting an appropriate number of MAs and constructing near-optimal itineraries for each of them. The performance gain of our algorithm over alternative approaches both in terms of cost and task completion latency is demonstrated by a quantitative evaluation and also in simulated environments through a Java-based tool.

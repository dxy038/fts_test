This paper presents an overview of the multiwavelength optical networking (MONET) program and summarizes its vision. The program objective is to advance, demonstrate, and integrate network architecture and economics, advanced multiwavelength technology, and network management and control to achieve high capacity, reconfigurable, high performance, reliable multiwavelength optical networks, with scalability to national scale, for both commercial and specialized government applications. The paper describes the major research thrusts of the program including network elements, networking demonstration plans, network control and management, and architecture and economics.

The paper presents theory and an experimental results of a variable speed generation system providing constant amplitude and frequency three phase four wire AC voltage. The variable speed generation system (VSGS) consists of an driving engine, axial flux permanent magnet generator (PMG) and an AC/DC/AC converter. The goal of the research is to develop a system in which the driving engine operates along the lowest specific fuel consumption The electrical part of the generation system may be build using a number of generators and converters topologies. The paper presents an original topology using high frequency axial flux permanent magnet generator, controlled rectifier which delivers two independently controlled DC voltages and a three phase four wires three level bidirectional switch, neutral point clamped system (BSNPCS) as an inverter producing sinusoidal standard AC voltage.


Background: Psychologists believe that negative thoughts and
emotions can greatly limit our thoughts, actions, and creativity, while
positive and thoughts result in the expansion of our actions. Positive
thoughts and positive emotions (happiness and joy) direct our mindsets
toward curiosity and creativity. Nowadays, a great number of
psychologists believe that creativity can be developed by education.
Objective: This study investigated the impact of positive thinking skills
on the first-year high school female students’ creativity and creativity
elements (flexibility, fluency, originality and elaboration).
Method: Two groups, consisting of 34 students, were chosen using multistage
cluster sampling from among the first year high school female
students of a high school affiliated with Educational Department District
5 in Tehran. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups,
control group and experimental group. First, Creativity Test (Abdei, 1995)
was administered for both groups. Then, the experimental group was
taught positive thinking skills in 10 sessions. Upon completion of
instruction, Abdei (1995) Creativity Test was re-administered to both
groups.
Results: Data analysis was accomplished using Analysis of Variance.
The results confirmed the significant positive effects of positive thinking
skills on the participants’ creativity and creativity elements (flexibility,
fluency, originality and elaboration).
Conclusion: Accordingly, we can conclude that teaching positive
thinking skills can enhance the students’ creativity.

Background and Objective: Traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM) has a long history in the field of diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, particularly addiction. Different therapeutic methods have been recommended in this respect. One of these methods is the replacement of natural narcotics instead of opium. Hab-o Shefa is a natural product of TIM which has been used as an alternative for opium in the treatment of addiction since centuries ago. In this study, the effect of Hab-o Shefa was investigated on behavioral quantities of morphine withdrawal syndrome. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 30 rats were divided into three groups of ten cases each. The control group received solely morphine at a dosage of 10 mg/kg daily for 8 days by the intraperitoneal route. In the second group, in addition to morphin with the same dosage, methadone at the dosage of 25 mg/kg was daily administered by gavage. Hab-o Shefa at a dosage of 2000 mg/kg through gavage was administered in addition to 10 mg/kg of morphine daily for the third group. Finally and 4 to 24 hours after the last injection of morphine, naloxone was injected i.p. at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg and the desired withdrawal parameters were evaluated. 
Results: Considering uncountable parameters, a significant difference was seen when comparing methadone and Hab-o Shefa with placebo in regarding diarrhea symptoms (p < 0.05). Regarding jumping between Hab-o Shefa and placebo and also between methadone and placebo, the difference was also statistically significant (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: In summary, Hab-o Shefa better controlled the withdrawal symptoms in comparison with placebo and it also better improved the symptoms of diarrhea and salivation as compared to methadone.

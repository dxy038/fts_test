The objective of this paper is a classification and analysis of a fully polarimetric ground based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) image to discriminate the different terrain media. Wishart supervised classification method was applied to classify the fully polarimetric GB-SAR data and the refined Lee filter for reducing a speckle noise. We discussed about the classification results of the obtained GB-SAR.

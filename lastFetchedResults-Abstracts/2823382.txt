This paper presents an algorithm for the optimal scheduling of distributed energy storage units from the system losses standpoint. An exact model based on Lagrange relaxation is proposed. Simulation results on the IEEE 37-bus test feeder demonstrate that an energy storage system can be used for minimizing transmission losses in a distribution system by reshaping the load curve. The main contribution of this approach is the objective function and the optimization algorithm. Lagrange multipliers are used for determining optimal placement and sizing of the energy storage units. A discussion about the impact of energy storage units on the distribution planning is also presented.

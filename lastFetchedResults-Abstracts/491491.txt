Multimedia programmes relating to education and consents may be useful for
decreasing anxiety during catheter-based repair in patients with congenitally malformed hearts. Objective: Our
study was aimed at evaluating the impact of multimedia protocols for education of a population of consecutive
patients with congenitally malformed hearts prior to transcatheter repair. Methods: Between September, 2006,
and May, 2008, we enrolled 100 consecutive patients, with a mean age of 45619 years, of whom 69 were
female, for catheter-based repair of their congenitally malformed hearts. In the first 50 patients, we used a
written form for informed consent sent to the patients 15 days before the procedure, coupled with a personal
interview of 30 minutes. In the subsequent 50 patients, we used multimedia protocol for education,
comprising a booklet of 4 pages containing a simple and brief explanation of the intervention, and a digital
film of 4 minutes showing the transcatheter procedure with a commentary provided by the referring physician,
prior to obtaining the signature for informed consent. We then compared the scores for anxiety, the preoperative
heart rate, the frequency of vaso-vagal episodes, and the need for conscious sedation between the two
groups. Results: Patients who underwent preconditioning using the multimedia programme were significantly
less anxious, and had significantly lower heart rates. Vaso-vagal episodes were also significantly less in this
group, with no episodes compared to 14% in those providing standard informed consent. Conscious sedation
was needed more frequently in those providing standard informed consent. Conclusion: Our brief study
suggests that a comprehensive multimedia programme of preparation increases the tolerability, and decrease
the emotional state, of adults about to undergo catheter-based interventions for congenital cardiac disease.

Objective
The purpose of this research was to study the effects on the physiologic pain response of the neonate during circumcision with the use of a gloved human finger.
Study design
This was a randomized controlled trial analyzing the effect of non-nutritive sucking (NNS) on pain response during circumcision. Term neonates were randomized to 2 groups. All infants received oral Tylenol and a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) before the circumcision. The study group was offered the addition of NNS before the DPNB and throughout the procedure. The primary outcome measured was heart rate during the circumcision. Other variables studied included crying time and salivary cortisol levels. Each circumcision was filmed to calculate pain profile scores using the Premature Infant Pain Profile. Variables were compared using Student t test, chi-square, and Wilcoxon test. A P value of < .05 was considered significant.
Results
Forty-four infants met inclusion criteria. Twenty-two infants were randomized to each arm. No difference in mean heart rate during the procedure was apparent. A significant decrease in crying time, 90-minute post-procedure salivary cortisol level, and post-penile clamping pain score was noted in the study group (all P values < .01).
Conclusion
NNS significantly decreases some elements of measurable physiologic pain response of the neonate during circumcision. This method is a useful and inexpensive addition to DPNB and oral analgesics.

The article is to revise the Chinese version of the 25-item WURS,and verify its reliability and validity. Method: We took a random sample from 6 university in Wuhan. The scale was administered to 787 subjects (340 males, 447 females)that aged from 20 to 25.3 weeks later, we chose 35 subjects by random for the second assessment, than we can evaluate Test-retest Reliability of the Chinese version of the 25-item Wender Utah RatingScale. Results: Exploratory factor analysis was performed on the 25-item WURS, and resulted in a three-factor solution that accounted for 51.354% of the variance. The ascription of the items in the Chinese version of the 25-item WURS didn´t completely accord with the English version. Pearson correlation coefficients that was calculated on the scale and on the subscales resulting from the factor analysis were all between 0.7-0.9, it stood for reliable Content Validity. Cronbach´s alpha coefficient was: the Chinese version of the 25-item WURS Total=0.835, and Pearson correlation coefficient on the pretest and aftertest that performed 3 weeks later was 0.977. Conclusion: We get satisfactory reliability and validity on the Chinese version of the 25-item WURS, an expand- d sample is still needed to verify the scale and make its Structure Validity more perfect. As a whole, the revised edition is a valid tool in the diagnosis of ADHD for Chinese adults.

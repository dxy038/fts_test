The objective of this paper is to introduce a reference model of BACnet-based fire detection and monitoring system using MS/TP and ARCNET protocols. The reference model is designed to satisfy the requirements of response time, survivability and flexibility. The reference model is operated on the basis of BACnet, a standard communication protocol for building automation systems. In this study, a simulator for the reference model of fire detection and monitoring system was developed. Using the simulator, this study examined the validity of the reference model proposed in this study. This study also evaluated the performance of the BACnet-based fire detection and monitoring system in terms of network-induced delay. Simulation results show that the reference model satisfies the requirements of fire detection and monitoring system.

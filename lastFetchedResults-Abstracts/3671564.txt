The objective of this paper is to design a microstrip patch antenna for communication with medical implants in the 402-405-MHz Medical Implant Communications Services band. Microstrip antenna design parameters are evaluated using the finite-difference time-domain method, and are compared to measured results. The effects of shape, length, size, location of feed point and ground point, substrate and superstrate materials, and their thicknesses are evaluated. An extensive study of the performance of the antennas to changes in these parameters was undertaken. The results of this paper provide guidance in the design of implantable microstrip antennas.

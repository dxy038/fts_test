Objective
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune systemic disease with 
unknown etiology, affects virtually every part of the body; involvement of 
the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the major causes of morbidity 
and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and is the least 
understood aspect of the disease. neutropenia is very uncommon in childhood 
lupus. True negative anti nuclear antibody (ANA) tests in patients with lupus 
are now very rare. The patient reported here was a 12-year-old girl with ANA 
negative lupus cerebritis who presented with left hemiparesia after a generalized 
seizure, with neutropenia observed during its course.

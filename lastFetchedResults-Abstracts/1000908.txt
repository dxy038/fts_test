The objective of this paper was to establish an efficient method for quality control of Lidanpaishi (LDPS) tablet and keli, two famous traditional Chinese medicines. A simple and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with photodiode array detector (DAD) method was developed both for fingerprint analysis (FA) and quantitative determination. In quantitative analysis, linear regressions, limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), intra-day and inter-day precisions, recovery, repeatability and stability were all tested and good results were obtained to simultaneously determine the 15 marker compounds, namely chlorogenic acid, rhaponticin, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, chrysin, honokiol, magnolol, emodin, and chrysophanol in the herbal drugs. In fingerprint analysis, 34 peaks were selected as the characteristic peaks to evaluate the similarities of different samples collected from different pharmaceutical companies in China according to the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) requirements, and two kinds of data, relative retention time (RRT) and relative peak area (RPA) were used to identify the common peaks in 15 samples for investigation. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was also performed to evaluate the variation of the herbal drugs. The present approach, i.e. HPLC coupled with multiple compounds determination (MCD) and FA is a powerful and meaningful tool to comprehensively conduct the quality control of traditional Chinese medicines.

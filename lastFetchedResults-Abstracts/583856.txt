Background and Objective: Elevation of the b-HCG serum levels has been reported in several tumors including breast cancer, and it is usually associated with aggressiveness.  The aim of this study was to examine the possible correlation between the b-HCG serum levels and different grades of breast cancer tumors in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Zanjan during 2009-10.  Serum samples from 56 cases of breast cancer patients were collected after surgery and prior to chemotherapy for analysis of total free b-HCG by electro chemiluminescence immunoassay, and the same procedure was repeated after 8 courses of chemotherapy.  The b-HCG serum levels were compared in poor versus mild to moderate grades before and after chemotherapy. 
Results: In 37 cases of mild to moderate grade tumors, the mean b-HCG level was 1.09 ±1.4 miu/ml compared with 1.2 ±0.3 miu/ml (P= 0.75) in 29 cases of poor grade tumors.  The mean b-HCG levels before and after chemotherapy were 1.15 ±1.4 miu/ml and 1.17 ±1.4 miu/ml (P=0.24), respectively.
Conclusion: We did not find any significant association between the b-HCG serum levels and breast cancer tumor grades.  Furthermore, chemotherapy does not appear to have an effect on b-HCG serum levels.

For bidirectional optical link at 2.5 Gb/s, we designed and fabricated a driver-receiver combined CMOS transceiver in 0.18-mum technology, an optical connector, and an optical PCB. The CMOS transceiver provides both transmitting and receiving modes of operation on a single chip, showing -3-dB bandwidths of 2.2 GHz and 2.4 GHz, and small-signal isolations of -28 dB and -40 dB between operating modes, respectively. The optical PCB (OPCB) was fabricated as a multi-layered OPCB in which 2times6 channels fibers were embedded. The optical connector was designed as a 90deg-bent fiber connector which was fabricated by bending 2 times 12 multimode fibers and the bending radius of the fiber was 3.5 mm

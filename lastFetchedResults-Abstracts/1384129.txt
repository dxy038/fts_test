DMRT1, which encodes a zinc finger-like DNA binding motif, is a well-conserved gene that is involved in testis differentiation in a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. The objective of this study was to determine whether a DMRT1 microsatellite marker allele is associated with the affected phenotype in a pedigree of canine SRY-negative XX sex reversal generated from an American Cocker spaniel founder.

fected dogs and their parents and grandparents were genotyped. Four alleles at this locus and five different genotypes were found in this pedigree. All affected dogs inherited this trait from the foundation sire of this colony. Thus, the disease-causing mutation should be identical by descent in all affected dogs. Six affected dogs were found to have genotypes at this locus that were different from those of the founder sire. These results indicate that DMRT1 is an unlikely candidate gene for SRY-negative XX sex reversal in this model.

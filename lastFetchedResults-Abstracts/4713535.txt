A bidirectional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed with the arbitration of the Viterbi decoder. The proposed DFE uses the minimum path metric between Viterbi decoders for the forward and reverse DFEs in the arbitration process. Simulation results show that the proposed equalizer is better than the conventional schemes.

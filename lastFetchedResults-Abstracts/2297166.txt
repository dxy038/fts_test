European nature conservation documents, often reflect the charisma of a species rather than its actual degree of threat. The assessment of the threat status of 14 endemic Sardinian butterfly species, underlines that European nature legislation documents are incomplete. Pseudophilotes barbagiae and Lysandra coridon gennargenti (Lycaenidae) are identified as globally Vulnerable and are therefore proposed to be added to the Red Data Book of European butterflies as species of global conservation concern. A threat factor analysis identifies risks towards butterflies in Sardinia arising from increasing human activities. It is shown how the quantitative information used by the IUCN criteria, together with a qualitative assessment of human induced threat factors, could be combined to produce an objective standardised assessment that can be used also when only data on present distribution are available. Threats to Sardinian butterflies are highlighted and conservation measures proposed. The inclusion of Pseudophilotes barbagiae and Lysandra coridon gennargenti in Annex II and IV of the European Habitats Directive, and in Appendix II of the Bern Convention, is strongly recommended.

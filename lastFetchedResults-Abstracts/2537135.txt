Notwithstanding the importance of education in translation and the vitality of comparing English language interpretersâ€™ performance and success in translation of various texts, few empirical studies have been done in this regard. Such studies can indeed be useful for all practitioners who are in a way involved in the field of translation including language teachers, translators, test-book writers, materials developers and students who are engaged in teaching language studies, English language learning and translation. The main objective of the present research probe, hence, is to reveal the differences found in the translation performance of an experimental interpreter as compared to a translator with university education. More specifically, the performance of four M.A. holding translators (i.e., two with an educational degree in the field of translation but no real experience of translation and two with at least 4 years of experience in translation but no academic exposure).In order to check the quality of the translations, the Julian House's (TQA) Model was used and the number and type of omissions, additions and grammatical errors were investigated. Two major factors, namely loyalty and ethics that the translators observe were also scrutinized. The data analysis showed some interesting facts with regard to the strategies, type and number of the given features. The most important foci of this study were therefore on the knowledge, competencies, skills, strategies and techniques applied in the task of translation. This study can not only accrue to and amend the assumptions about translators and translation quality assessment, but also bring into light the need for translator training in the field of higher education.

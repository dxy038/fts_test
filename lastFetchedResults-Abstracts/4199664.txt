The objective of this paper is the performances comparison of a classical variable structure algorithm (CVS) with the new regulator using the theory of generalized variable structure algorithm (GVS). The GVS control technique takes account the derivatives of control in a non-Kalman state representation. The switching is done on the highest derivative of the control (input), consequently to eliminate the undesirable chatter motion, caused by the discontinuous control law. The performances are compared by considering the time response, the robustness to unmodelled dynamics, and the reduced chattering. The plant is a robotic manipulator studied in two of its degrees of freedom, which is sufficient for examining the validity of the control method and to show clearly the advantages

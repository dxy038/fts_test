Objective: To evaluate the multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) manifestations of the normal small bowel mesentery. Methods: Sixty cases were study to assess the 64-slice CT manifestations of the normal small bowel mesentery. Results: (1) The superior mesenteric artery/ vein were identified on axial, sagittal and coronal CT images in 60 cases. The diameter of the jejunal mesenteric vein (which had the largest diameter than other mesenteric veins) was 5mm-9mm in 56 cases. (2) The jejunal and ileal mesentery had different appearances. The mesenteric arteries/veins showed wavy manifestations as they passed through the small bowl mesenteric fatty tissue. (3) The lymph nodes of the mesentery were not routinely detected on the MSCT. The attenuation of the fat located within the small bowel mesentery was ranged from -83Hu to -117Hu. Conclusion: The superior mesenteric artery/vein can be identified readily on the MSCT images of normal individuals. The demonstration of the small bowel mesentery is best on coronal MSCT images; integrating the axial, coronal and sagital MSCT images can display the small bowel mesentery completely.

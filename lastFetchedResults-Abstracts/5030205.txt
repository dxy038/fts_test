One of the most considerations in the field of chromosome analysis is the segmentation and determination of the centromere detection and karyotying of the chromosomes. Previously depend upon centromere position and its angle with the p-arm and q-arm positions, bond comparisons as made the classification of chromosomes and the pairing possibilities of the chromosomes. Such that in this paper as describe as the possibilities depend upon Taguchi experimental design technique, distance between the bonds in the chromosomes and the detection points made using the enrichment of the gray scaled image. It is also unique and different from similar studies recently presented in the literature with some superior features. The results were presented on the basis of the combination of these objective and subjective metrics for illustrating the qualitative properties of the proposed methods and its evaluation of their performances. Experimental results have shown that one biometric feature can be determined from another. The comparison between the feature from one chromosome with another, the same property of the chromosomes where paired. The process of comparison as done on each chromosome by the neural network and finally the karyotying of the chromosomes were achieved.

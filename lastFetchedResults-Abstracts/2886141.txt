Effective spatial resolution of projection-based 3D light-field (LF) displays is an important quantity, which is informative about the capabilities of the display to recreate views in space and is important for content creation. We propose a subjective experiment to measure the spatial resolution of LF displays and compare it to our objective measurement technique. The subjective experiment determines the limit of visibility on the screen as perceived by viewers. The test involves subjects determining the direction of patterns that resemble tumbling E eye test charts. These results are checked against the LF display resolution determined by objective means. The objective measurement models the display as a signal-processing channel. It characterizes the display throughput in terms of passband, quantified by spatial resolution measurements in multiple directions. We also explore the effect of viewing angle and motion parallax on the spatial resolution.

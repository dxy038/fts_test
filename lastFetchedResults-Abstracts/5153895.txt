Block-based discrete cosine transform is widely used in many video coding standards includes H.264. Due to the property of the discrete cosine transform, it usually introduces annoying blockiness artifacts in the reconstructed video. H.264 uses an adaptive in-loop deblocking filter to reduce the blockiness artifacts. This paper introduces an algorithm for the deblocking filter in H.264. The proposed algorithm improves the filterpsilas ability in distinguishing between true edges and artificial one with the help of macroblock modes and intra prediction modes, which are readily accessible by both encoder and decoder. Experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm is able to improve both the subjective and objective quality.

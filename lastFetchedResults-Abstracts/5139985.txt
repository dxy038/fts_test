This paper focus on multidisciplinary and multi-objective algorithms and their application into aircraft conceptual parameter design. Physical programming is an effective algorithm solving multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, different optimization objectives for aircraft in different segments are integrated through physical programming method to get an uniform system objective. Then four subsystems are considered to coordinate with the system objective. Through the method proposed in this paper, a more comprehensive and reasonable design point is achievable, and meanwhile better original data and theory basis are obtained for the aircraft conceptual parameter design.

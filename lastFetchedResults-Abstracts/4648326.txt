Nowadays, the techniques based on the use of artificial neural networks are instigating increasing interest in the fields of control and robotics. The rapidity of processing, the ability to learn and adapt as well as the robustness of these approaches, are motivating this work. To help this system be embedded in a wheelchair, it is imperative to respect the functional constraints and those of resource allocation, weights, consumption, cost... So conceiving an embedded system is ultimately an exercise in optimization: minimizing production costs for optimal functionality. The objective of this work is FPGA implementation of an optimal architecture of neuronal network.

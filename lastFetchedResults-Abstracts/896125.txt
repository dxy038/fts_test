Abstract
Fat replacement with oat bran derivative in certain bakery products provides the possibility to create high-quality products. The objective of the present study was to produce reduced-fat shortened cakes containing oat bran derivative with suitable quality regarding desirable sensory properties, pH, hardness, and specific volume. Effect of shortening replacement with oat bran derivative named Nutrim oat bran, 20% and 40% by weight, on the aforesaid properties of shortened cakes was examined. pH, hardness and specific volume of the cakes were measured using electronic pH meter, Testometric and rapeseed displacement method, respectively. Regarding sensory properties, samples were evaluated using trained panelists (n=9) via hedonic scaling and overall acceptance tests. A completely randomized experimental design was used in the present study and the comparison of means was made by the Duncan's multiple range test at ?=1%. This replacement did not show any significant effect on the pH of cakes and a significant increase in hardness and a significant decrease in specific volume were noted in the 40% treatment sample, compared to, both, the control and the 20% treatment samples. No significant difference in all sensory attributes was detected among the samples. Furthermore, the acceptance rating for the category of overall acceptability has been similar for all samples. The treatment samples had suitable pH and sensory quality. However, the preferred sample was the 20% treatment sample for its proper hardness and specific volume.

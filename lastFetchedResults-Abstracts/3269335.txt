A DC distribution system is proposed for integration of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in public parking areas. The proposed system assumes that each PHEV is interfaced with a network of DC lines, through a corresponding bidirectional DC-DC converter (battery charger). It also assumes that a central Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) provides the interface between the DC network and the host AC utility grid. The proposed system is expected to be more efficient and economical than an equivalent aggregate of AC-DC battery charges connected to the AC grid, since it relieves the battery chargers from the need for a bidirectional, front-end, power-factor correction (PFC) stage. Further, due to its DC nature, the proposed system is amenable to integration of Photovoltaic (PV) modules. The paper presents a mathematical model for the proposed DC system and discusses the potential stability issues.

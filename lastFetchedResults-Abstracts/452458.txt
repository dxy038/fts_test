Purpoe
To determine the clinical value and relevance of punctal and proximal canalicular tenoe after punctal plug therapy in moderate to evere dry eye yndrome.
Deign

Retropective, obervational cae erie.
Method

eventeen eye were determined to have punctum or proximal canalicular tenoe after pontaneou lo of a collared ilicone punctal plug. After initial diagnoi all patient had 12 month or more of follow-up (mean, 39; range, 12 to 87 month). The clinical data collected included gender and age of patient, localization of the tenoi, plug ize, duration of punctal occluion, ubjective ymptom, objective ocular urface dieae parameter, and occurrence of complication.
Reult

A tatitically ignificant correlation between localization of the tenoi and plug ize, and localization of the tenoi and duration of punctal occluion could not be found. At follow-up, ubjective ymptom (P < .01) and frequency of artificial tear application (P < .001) were ignificantly reduced compared to data before plug inertion. chirmer I tet reult (P < .001), corneal fluorecein taining (P < .01), and roe bengal taining (P < .001) improved ignificantly, wherea tear break-up time (P < .2) and impreion cytology core of the conjunctival urface (P = .2) remained almot unchanged. Complication could not be found.
Concluion

Within the obervation period of up to even year, all tenoe remained aymptomatic. Additionally, ubjective ymptom and mot dry eye parameter in our tudy population improved.

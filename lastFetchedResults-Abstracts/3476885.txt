In this letter, we present a hybrid motion compensation scheme integrating overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) and control grid interpolation (CGI), called irregular grid-based OBMC (IG-OBMC). The objective of this letter is to develop both subjectively and objectively improved motion compensation scheme by combining distinct advantages of OBMC and CGI without additional motion vectors or a complicated motion estimation processing. To evaluate the performance, IG-OBMC is applied to error concealment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid motion compensation method achieves a better performance than the conventional motion compensation methods.

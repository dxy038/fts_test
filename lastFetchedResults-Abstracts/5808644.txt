Our long-term objective is to develop robots that engage in natural language-mediated cooperative tasks with humans. To support this goal, we are developing an amodal representation and associated processes which is called a grounded situation model (GSM). We are also developing a modular architecture in which the GSM resides in a centrally located module, around which there are language, perception, and action-related modules. The GSM acts as a sensor-updated "structured blackboard", that serves as a workspace with contents similar to a "theatrical stage" in the robot\´s "mind", which might be filled in with present, past or imagined situations. Two main desiderata drive the design of the GSM: first, "parsing" situations into ontological types and relations that reflect human language semantics, and second, allowing bidirectional translation between sensory-derived data/expectations and linguistic descriptions. We present an implemented system that allows of a range of conversational and assistive behavior by a manipulator robot. The robot updates beliefs (held in the GSM) about its physical environment, the human user, and itself, based on a mixture of linguistic, visual and proprioceptive evidence. It can answer basic questions about the present or past and also perform actions through verbal interaction. Most importantly, a novel contribution of our approach is the robot\´s ability for seamless integration of both language- and sensor-derived information about the situation: for example, the system can acquire parts of situations either by seeing them or by "imagining" them through descriptions given by the user: "There is a red ball at the left". These situations can later be used to create mental imagery and sensory expectations, thus enabling the aforementioned bidirectionality

A new antenna concept, dielectric-resonator-on-patch (DROP), is presented as a way of improving the bandwidth of dielectric-resonator antennas. Driven by the objective of developing a simple low-profile antenna (height&lt;1 cm) for 5 GHz UNII-band wireless portable computers, an example DROP antenna was designed and an excellent input return loss (&gt;15 dB) was achieved over the entire band from 5.150-5.825 GHz. This design not only validates the DROP concept but also highlights its potential as a small, low-cost, lightweight antenna for mobile and wireless applications.

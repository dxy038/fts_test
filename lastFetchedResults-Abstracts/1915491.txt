Objective
ermine the safety and feasibility after image-guided single fraction robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with bone metastases of prostate cancer.
als and methods
patients with 64 bone metastases of prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled in a single center study and underwent 54 consecutive outpatient single session SRS procedures during a 4-year period. F-18 choline PET/CT in addition to standard CT imaging was done prior to SRS in all patients. Nineteen patients were under anti-androgen therapy, 8 patients had undergone chemotherapy before SRS. Overall survival and freedom from local tumor recurrence was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.
s
ollow-up was 14 months (3–48 months). Seventy-five percent of patients had a single bone metastasis. The median tumor volume was 13 cc. The mean prescribed tumor dose was 20.2 Gy (16.5–22 Gy). Eight patients had died at the time point of the data analysis. The actuarial 6-months, 12-months, and 24-months local tumor control rate was 95.5% (95% CI: 83.0–98.8) as measured by MRI and PET CT imaging. The median initial PSA before SRS was 5.4 ng/dl (CI: 1.4–8.2) and dropped to 2.7 ng/dl (CI: 0.14–10) after 3 months. One case of progressive neurological deficits was documented.
sions
irst report on single session, image-guided robotic SRS documents a safe, feasible, and patient-friendly treatment option in selected patients with bone metastases of prostate cancer.

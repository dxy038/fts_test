A multiciteria decision making problem in water resource is addressed through the generation of fuzzy Pareto optimal set. Methodology is using positive and negative ideal solutions (Lai, Y.-J., Liu, T.-Y., Hwang, C.L. (1994). TOPSIS for MODM. European Journal of Operational Research 76, 486â€“500) and a set of weights assigned to the objective functions in fuzzy triangular form. Solution of the problem is obtained by transforming each objective function into a set of three objective functions. A planning problem of multicriteria waste water treatment from the literature is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology. The obtained fuzzy Pareto solution set has been compared with the deterministic solution set. It is shown that the proposed approach can: (a) capture the uncertainty associated with the assignment of weights; and (b) provide the decision makers with a wider range of solutions to select from.

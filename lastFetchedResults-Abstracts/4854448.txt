Ubiquitous computing technology has brought high availabilities of network environments. At the same time, it has become a prerequisite for providing appropriate services in accordance with user contexts. For the context-aware services, there have been a wide variety of task applications, but coordination among tasks is still a major issue. Here, this paper proposes behavior coordination mechanism using action selection mechanism for intelligent home environments. In behavior-based control of a robot, a behavior is a series of actions towards a system objective. In the same way, high level applications for a smart home can be considered behaviors of a robot since task applications generally have activity scenarios to achieve their own objectives; a robot is not just a physical single robot but a robotic system from a broad point of view. In order to avoid multiple objective behavior conflict, this paper focuses on the subsumption architecture as an action section mechanism, and also introduces service management techniques for seamless services at an intelligent home

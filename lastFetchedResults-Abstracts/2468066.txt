The objective of this paper is to improve the precision and reliability of algorithms for temperature measurement using an IRFPA. A high-precision infrared temperature measurement algorithm based on the nonlinear response of each pixel in the IRFPA is proposed. The results show that the error variance of the algorithm is about one-sixth of traditional algorithms under identical conditions.

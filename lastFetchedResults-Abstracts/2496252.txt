Objective
Febrile Convulsion (FC) is occurred in 6 months to 5 yr old children. The aim of
this study was to investigate the prevalence of HHV-6 infection in FC admitted
patients of Bandar Abbas Children Hospital, southern Iran.
Materials & Methods
In a cross-sectional study, 118 children aged 6-60 months who had FC were
selected by a simple random method in 2010-11. Demographic data, clinical
manifestation and two blood samples gathered to assess the human herpes virus
type 6 (HHV6). Blood sample obtained at the time of admission and 10 days
after the first examination. ELISA was used to detect HHV-6 IgG. The subjects
were studied in two groups with and without infection of HHV-6. Two groups
were compared by t-test and X2
.
Results
Fifty-three subjects completed the study, including 30 boys (56.6 %) and 23
girls (43.4%). The HHV-6 infection was detected in 23 patients out of 53 studied
subjects. The mean of age for the groups with and without HHV-6 infection was
19.7±9.7 and 20.4±10.2 months old, respectively. The most common clinical
presentation in both groups was rhinorrhea, diarrhea, vomiting and lethargy
without any significant difference between two groups. Five patients (21.7%)
in HHV-6 group and 1 patient (3.3%) in HHV-6 negative group had postictal
phase more than 15 minutes (P < 0.05). Convulsion within 1 hour from beginning
of fever was more frequent in HHV-6 infection group than the other group
(P < 0.01).
Conclusion
There was not any difference in terms of age group, gender and clinical
manifestation of infected and non-infected children with FC. Postictal phase
and seizure during 1 hour after the fever were significantly different between
two groups.

In this paper an improved direct torque control (DTC) scheme for a matrix converter fed induction motor is presented. Matrix converter seems to be a good alternative to conventional VSIÂ´s. It provides interesting capabilities like unity input power factor, bidirectional power flow and sinusoidal input and output currents; and DTC is one of most attractive control schemes for induction motors. The major disadvantage of DTC is existence of high torque ripples. In this paper an improved duty ratio control is established to overcome this drawback. Simulation results show that in addition to a good dynamic response, torque ripple in this scheme is significantly reduced.

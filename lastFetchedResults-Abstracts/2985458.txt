Closed-loop control of neuroprostheses strongly depends upon the sensor system quality. A patient-mounted multi-sensor system is currently developed consisting of goniometers, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and insole force sensor arrays. The objective is to build a system employing low-cost off-the-shelf sensors. Sensor fusion techniques are applied to compensate for limited signal quality. Thus, sufficient information for the control of sit-to-stand transfers, walking and stair-climbing can be provided. First results are presented

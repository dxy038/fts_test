Objective(s): To identify factors influencing the severity of injuries in motor vehicle crashes.
Methods: The source of data was The National Trauma Study -Teheran (1999-2000), performed in six major hospitals in Tehran. We looked at demographic and pre-hospital data on 564 car passengers injured in nonfatal traffic accidents. We used the Injury Severity Score (ISS) to determine the severity of injuries. Results: Most cases of trauma involved the extremities and the bony pelvis. Injuries were more severe in passengers of pick-up trucks compared to those injured in crashes involving two passenger cars. Also, those traveling in pick-up trucks were more likely to be injured in the head and neck (P<0.05). There were significant differences in the severity of injuries between urban and rural accidents.
Conclusion: Higher severity of injuries in accidents involving pick-up trucks shows the need for more in-depth studies about safety of pick-up trucks in Iran. For better monitoring and evaluation of injuries, the use of standard forms to gather data on all traffic accidents is needed.

Processing multichannel signals using digital signal processing techniques has received increased attention lately due to its importance in applications such as multimedia technologies and telecommunications. The objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to introduce adaptive filtering techniques to the reader who is just beginning in this area and 2) to provide a review for the reader who may be well versed in signal processing. The perspective of the topic offered here is one that comes primarily from work done in the field of multichannel (color) image processing. Hence, many of the techniques and works cited here relate to image processing with the emphasis placed primarily on filtering algorithms based on fuzzy concepts, multidimensional scaling, and order statistics-based designs. It should be noted, however, that multichannel signal processing is a very broad field and thus contains many other approaches that have been developed from different perspectives, such as transform domain filtering, classical least-square approaches, neural networks, and stochastic methods, just to name a few. We present a general formulation based on fuzzy concepts, which allows the use of adaptive weights in the filtering structure, and we discuss different filter designs. The strong potential of fuzzy adaptive filters for multichannel signal applications, such as color image processing, is illustrated with several examples

An algorithm is presented for algebraically projecting certain plans that partially specify a set of events, using real parameters for the times of events, rates, quantities, etc. Algebraic projection is designed for both deliberate and reactive planning. It describes the effects of a plan in terms of its parameters, without requiring an objective function, and allows flexible translation of planning questions into precise minimization problems. An implementated system is briefly described. It could contribute to intelligent control by assisting with the middle layer of a hierarchical control system in which an upper level reactively suggests general solutions to be used for some time interval. These techniques help optimize those solutions, and a lower level provides real-time control

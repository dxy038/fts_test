This work presents a parametric identification using the least square method based on the output error. The Rosenbrock algorithm is applied as a technique to minimise the objective function in order to obtain simultaneously the electrical and the mechanical machine parameters. The validation of the algorithm is obtained from experiments carried out on different machines

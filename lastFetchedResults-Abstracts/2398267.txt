Background: Distinction of hydatidiform moles (HMs) from non-molar abortions and
sub-classification of HMs are important for clinical practice; yet, diagnosis based solely
on morphology is affected by interobserver variability. The objective of this study was
to determine the role of DNA flow cytometry in distinguishing molar from non-molar
pregnancies.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Department
of Pathology, Womenâ€™s Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran,
between 2006 and 2010. DNA ploidy analysis and histopathologic re-evaluation were
performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from 36 (17 complete and 19 partial) molar and
24 hydropic abortus (HA) cases which were previously diagnosed based on histomorphologic
study.
Results: Of the 17 cases initially diagnosed as complete HM (CHM), 9 were diploid,
2 were triploid, 5 were tetraploid and 1 was aneuploid. Of the 19 initial partial
HMs (PHMs), 2, 8, 1 and 8 cases were diploid, triploid, tetraploid and aneuploid,
respectively. In the initial HA category (n=24), 14 diploid, 1 triploid, 5 tetraploid,
and 4 aneuploid cases existed. Following flow cytometry and histopathologic reevaluation,
1 case with previous diagnosis of HA was reclassified as PHM, 2 initial
PHMs were reclassified as CHM and 2 initial CHMs were categorized as PHM.
Conclusion: The results show that correct diagnosis of PMH is the main challenge in
histological diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). DNA flow cytometric
analysis could be an informative supplement to the histological interpretation of molar
and hydropic placentas.

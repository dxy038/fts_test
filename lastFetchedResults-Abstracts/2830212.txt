The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL), a NASA Discovery mission, twin spacecraft were launched on 10 September 2012 and were inserted into lunar orbit on 31 December 2011 and 01 January 2012. The objective of the mission was to measure a high-resolution lunar gravity field using inter-spacecraft range measurements in order to investigate the interior structure of the Moon from crust to core. The first step in the lunar gravity field determination process involved correcting for general relativity, measurement noise, biases and relative &amp; absolute timing. Three independent clocks participated in the process and needed to be correlated after the fact. Measuring the absolute time tags for the GRAIL mission data turned out to be a challenging task primarily because of limited periods when such measurements could be conducted. Unlike the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), where absolute timing measurements are available using the GPS system, no absolute timing measurements were available on the far side of the Moon or when there were no DSN coverage periods. During the early cruise phase, it was determined that a direct absolute timing measurement of each spacecraft Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) clock could be directly observed by using a DSN station to eavesdrop on the Time Transfer System (TTS) S-band inter-satellite ranging signal. By detecting the TTS system directly on earth, the LGRS clock can be correlated directly to Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) because the TTS and LGRS use the same clock to time-tag their measurements. This paper describes the end-to-end preparation process by building and installing a dedicated hardware at Goldstone station DSS-24, selecting favorable lunar orbit geometries, real time signal detection and post processing, and finally how the absolute timing is used in the overall construction of lunar gravity fields.

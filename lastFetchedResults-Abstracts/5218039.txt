The NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) conducts research on off-board Low Frequency Active (LFA) sensors for use in Cooperative distributed ASW (CASW). The objective is to create a scalable and autonomous system that removes vulnerable personnel from the vicinity of high risk, is cheaper than conventional ship-based sonar and that potentially leverages the benefits of multi-static operations by creating an increased diversity of assets and spatial distribution. Such systems would also release personnel to perform tasks elsewhere. The NURC intends to prototype an open-architecture system with a high degree of interoperability in a concept demonstration in 2012.

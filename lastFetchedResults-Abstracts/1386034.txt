The objective of the present paper is the experimental validation of a numerical model for the prediction of traffic-induced vibrations. The vibrations in the free field, generated by the passage of a vehicle on an uneven road, are predicted in two stages. First, the equations of motion of the vehicle are solved to determine the dynamic axle loads. Next, these axle loads are applied to the road and the free field vibrations are computed. An elaborate measurement campaign has been set up to validate this model. The response of a Volvo FL6 truck and the response in the free field have been measured simultaneously during the passage of the truck over an artificial road unevenness. The parameters related to the vehicle, the road and the soil have been determined experimentally. A comparison of the predicted and the measured response demonstrates the predictive qualities of the numerical model. Furthermore, the results provide a clear insight in the influence of the vehicle speed on the vehicle's and the free field response.

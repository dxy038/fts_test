Objective (s): Mothers and infants are considered as vulnerable groups. Maintaining and improving their health are very much dependent on quality and accuracy of health information. Thus providing timely information is essential for monitoring and evaluating maternal and neonatal health condition. Since this information is organized in perinatal health information systems in developed countries, this study was conducted to present a model of perinatal information management system in Iran.
Methods: This was an applied and mixed method study (qualitative-comparative and Delphi) conducted in 2013. Perinatal information management systems in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, America, England and Iran were studied and compared via library sources, the Internet, available documents, and correspondence with authors. Comparative tables were provided to analyze the data. Then, the initial model for perinatal information management system was suggested and a questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was tested by Delphi technique in two rounds. Finally, items by more than 75 percent were added to the model.
Results: The final model was presented in three major topics: goals, structures and mechanism of data collection. In this model, 32 goals were confirmed. Responsible organizations, monitoring organizations, committees and centers of data production in the axis of structure were determined. In data collection mechanism, data sources, media types, long range data transmission, data collection processes, privacy and data security procedures were also examined.
Conclusion: The proposed model is expected to serve as a basis for improving the quality of perinatal health information, exchanging health data and achieving an integrated information management system.

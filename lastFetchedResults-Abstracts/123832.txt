In this paper an objective ,otientation is presented fore  controling  multi-objecetive systems. The principles of this method is based on an emotional learning and temporal difference learning, and has a neuro-fuzzy structure. The proposal method can control the system in a way that objectives such as the present conditions, the system action in the part and the controlling aims are attained in the best way and least amount of time.
The holistic structure of this paper is as follows: first, in the third unit object oriented control is studied. The fourth unit deals with emotional learning as a method for intelligent control. In the fifth unit the emotional control of temporal difference is defined and discussed. The sixth unit presents and discusses a new critic structure with temporal difference learning and then Some Multivariable systems, which are one of the most important controlling problems because of coupling, are defined. Then in the last unit the functional control structures used in this paper are studied and the experimental results are compared.

The Travelling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a NP-hard problem that abstracts the features of certain types of sports scheduling problems. Objective of TTP is to minimize the total distance travelled by all the teams in a sports league during the tournament. This work proposes a novel hybrid approach of Biogeography Based optimization (BBO) and Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristics to generate schedules for mirrored version of TTP. We evaluate our hybrid algorithm on publicly available standard benchmarks. Results are found to be competitive with existing techniques in literature while taking reasonable amount of time.

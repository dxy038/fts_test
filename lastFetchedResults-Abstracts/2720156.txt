Self-organizing networks act autonomously for the sake of achieving the best possible performance. The attainable routing depends on a delicate balance of diverse and often conflicting quality-of-service requirements. Finding the optimal solution typically becomes an nonolynomial-hard problem, as the network size increases in terms of the number of nodes. Moreover, the employment of user-defined utility functions for the aggregation of the different objective functions often leads to suboptimal solutions. On the other hand, Pareto optimality is capable of amalgamating the different design objectives by providing an element of elitism. Although there is a plethora of bioinspired algorithms that attempt to address this optimization problem, they often fail to generate all the points constituting the optimal Pareto front. As a remedy, we propose an optimal multiobjective quantum-assisted algorithm, namely the nondominated quantum optimization algorithm (NDQO), which evaluates the legitimate routes using the concept of Pareto optimality at a reduced complexity. We then compare the performance of the NDQO algorithm to the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating that the NDQO algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we analytically derive the upper and lower bounds of the NDQO algorithmic complexity, which is of the order of O(N) and O(N&#8730;(N)) in the best and worst case scenario, respectively. This corresponds to a substantial complexity reduction of the NDQO from the order of O(N<sup>2</sup>) imposed by the brute-force method.

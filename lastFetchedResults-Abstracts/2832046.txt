Wireless communication alert messaging protocols based on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have promising role to play in reducing road accidents. Reliable reception of the alert messages to all concerned vehicles within a certain time limit is a prime objective to achieve when employing alert messaging in VANETs. In this work, we propose a bi-directional link quality assessment based alert messaging protocol. Simulated performance evaluation is presented while stressing on reachability of the alert messages in varying network density scenarios. The proposed communication model is compared to conventional distance based alert messaging as being the most widely used technique for relay nodes selection. The proposed protocol outperforms in reachability the conventional one, while adhering well below to delay requirements of alert messages propagation for most endangered vehicles.

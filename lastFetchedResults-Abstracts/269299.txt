Conventional fuel reformers are complex, multi-component devices which produce large amounts of CO2  emissions. The main objective of this work is to develop an efficient, compact and emission-free fuel reformer for mobile and portable fuel cell (FC) applications. The concept is based on single-stage catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen-rich gas and carbon products. This approach allows to eliminate the production of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and, consequently, the need for the waterâ€“gas shift (WGS) and gas separation stages which significantly simplifies the process. The paper presents the experimental results of CO2-free production of hydrogen-rich gas via catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbon fuels (propane, methane and gasoline). The perspectives of CO2-free fuel reformers for mobile and portable fuel cell applications are discussed in this paper.

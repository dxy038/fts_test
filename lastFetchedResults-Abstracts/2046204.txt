During the recent years, there have been many studies on automatic audio classification and segmentation to use several features and techniques. The signal recorded at a microphone in a room incorporates the direct arrival of the sound from the source as well as the multiple weaker copies of the same signal that are created by sound reflections off the room walls. We call it as acoustic. Due to complications associated with exact tracking of the target in three dimensional environments, in many applications such as source localization and speech recognition the reverberate patterns imposed by the environment are seen as undesirable. In an auditorium, the common disturbances in public speech are Noise, Acoustic Echo etc.  The MMSE estimator is one of the algorithms proposed for removal of additive background noise. It is a single channel speech enhancement technique for the enhancement of speech degraded by additive background noise. Background noise can effect our conversation in a noisy environment like in streets or in a car, when sending speech from the cockpit of an airplane to the ground or to the cabin and can effect both quality and intelligibility of speech. With the passage of time Spectral subtraction has undergone many modifications. This is a review paper and its objective is to provide an overview of MMSE estimator that has been proposed for enhancement of speech degraded by additive background noise during past decades.

The component-mode synthesis (CMS) technique is applied in the dynamic analysis of a class of linear systems that has a time-varying structure. The stability analysis of such systems is carried out based on tke model established using the CMS technique. The approach adopted is to decompose a time-varying system into a series of subsystems. The interconnections among these subsystems are modeled as time-varying constrains. The stability analysis of the overall system is based on the subsystem models and time-varying constrains. The objective is to eventually utilize the stability and constraint information of subsystems to establish the stability of the overall system.

Objective
To estimate trends in mortality due to different stroke subtypes in the population of Belgrade during the period 1989–2003.
Patients and methods
Mortality data for stroke were compiled from material of the Municipal Institute of Statistics. Stroke mortality rates were standardized by world standard population. Linear regression coefficient in time trend analysis of mortality rates was assessed by Fisher's test.
Results
In Belgrade, 1989–2003, the highest values of mortality rates were for ischemic stroke in both sexes: 50.1/100,000-men, and 39.9/100,000-women. The mortality rate from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was lower in men (3.9/100,000) compared to women (5.3/100,000). For intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the death rate was 3.1 times higher than that for SAH. Stroke due to hemorrhage was a more common cause of death than ischemic stroke for both sexes in all age groups up to 59. In older age, ischemic stroke became the more frequent cause of death. The time trends of stroke mortality rates in the Belgrade population during the period 1989–2003 showed that the most excessive statistically significant increase in death rates was related to ICH in both sexes. The death rates from SAH had increasing tendency in both sexes, especially in women (p = 0.017). Upward trends were observed for ischemic stroke mortality rates too, with statistical significance in men (p = 0.048).
Conclusion
Further research is needed to explain the causes of the increasing burden of stroke in Serbia. Since different profiles of risk factors play a role in the etiology of different stroke subtypes, these facts should be taken into account in the creation of both prevention and management strategies.

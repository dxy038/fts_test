The linear and multi-hop transmission feature of wireless sensor networks on city drainage pipelines, roads, power lines and other monitoring occasions, is easy to lead to energy imbalance consumption of the network node and premature failure of the monitoring network. In this paper, the linear wireless sensor networks with sensor nodes uniformly distributed and emission capacity restricted is taken as the research object, the network energy consumption characteristic is analyzed. Network efficiency taked as optimization objective, then an efficient node deployment algorithm is proposed. Combining with network performance requirements, the optimal relay node deployment scheme and node forwards the data flow is solved to balance energy consumption and prolong the network life. Results of theoretical analysis and simulation show that the method of nodes placement and topology control can delay the &#8220;energy hole&#8221; problem and improve network efficiency. The researches for guiding nodes placement of linear wireless sensor networks is of great significance.

This work presents two models to simulate the transient and steady state behavior of a vapour compression air-conditioning system. The condenser and the evaporator were divided into a number of control volumes. Time dependent partial differential equations system was obtained from the mass, energy and momentum balances for each control volume. As the expansion valve and the compressor both have very small thermal inertia, the steady state models were applied for these components. Transient and steady state models numerical predictions were compared and good agreement was found. Further simulations were performed with the objective of verifying the possibility of controlling the refrigeration system and the superheating of the refrigerant in the evaporator outlet by varying the compressor speed and the throttling valve sectional area. The results indicate that the proposed models can be used to formulate an algorithm for controlling a refrigeration system.

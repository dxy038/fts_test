Conventional methods used for solving traffic signal control problems used the mean value of traffic flow as the input of traffic system which may differ greatly from the real circumstance. In this paper, we propose a modified robust multi-objective compatible optimization control(RMOOC) algorithm which adopting interval or region control objectives instead of point control objectives, and a min-max robust optimization model is proposed to solve the traffic signal control problem, Simulation results show that better performance may be obtained without loss of too much optimality when the variation of traffic flow is in a limited region, and the proposed robust multi-objective compatible optimization control algorithm is effective in coordinating network control and decreasing delay.

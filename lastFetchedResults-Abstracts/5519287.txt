Business process´s performance determine the whole enterprise´s economic profit, researching work on business process´s optimization is very useful and meaningful. This thesis point out that manager must take the dynamic environment and multiple objectives into account while optimizing the enterprise´s business process. Based on the theory of multiple objective optimizations, AHP, and simulation technology, the thesis builds a dynamic simulation model for business process optimization. Firstly the basic concept of business process is introduced. Secondly the framework of simulation model is put forward, the framework include logic of the simulation process and parameters´ selection. Thirdly, the thesis researched the business process´ s performance evaluation method, and proposed a review model based on AHP, point out that there is a balanced point among time, cost and quality, and the point can help us to find the optimal design of business process. Finally, the thesis provide a experiment to verify the validity of the model put forward by the thesis, and the result prove that the model is effective in optimization of business process.

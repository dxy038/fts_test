This paper introduces a framework of parallel control and management for high-speed railway systems (HRSs). First, based on multiagent modeling, an artificial HRS that is consistent with realistic operations of the actual HRS is constructed. Then, different kinds of computational experiments are performed on the artificial HRS, followed by analysis and synthesis with a case. Finally, through an interactive and parallel operation between the actual and artificial HRSs, a set of practical control and management strategies can be achieved for the actual HRS. With the primary objective of ensuring reliability and safety of HRSs, this study could enhance the quality of services and the integrated transportability with other existing modes of transportation systems to provide appropriate recommendations and strategies for forming an overall effective comprehensive transportation system.

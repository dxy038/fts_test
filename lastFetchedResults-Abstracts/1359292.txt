Background and Objective: It seems that using a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercises (resistance exercises) can induce beneficial physical, psychological, and social effects on hemodialysis patients who are encountered with various stressors. This study aimed to determine the effect of combined aerobic and anaerobic exercises on quality of life in hemodialysis patients.
Materials and Methods: In this study we used a pre and post semi-experimental design with two comparison groups. The subjects consisted of 74 patients from two hemodialysis centers affiliated to Zanjan University of Medical Sciences. All subjects were randomly allocated into two groups. Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF) was used to assess quality of life in patients with kidney disease. 
Results: The results showed that the mean and standard deviation of quality of life  before the intervention in the combined exercises group was 47.7 ± 15.56 and in the aerobic exercise group was 41.1 ± 11.51. But after the intervention, the  mean and standard deviation of quality of life in the combined exercises group increased to 77.1±28.06 and in the aerobic exercise group increased to 56.4 ± 12.78 indicating significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.0001). Both aerobic and combined exercises increased quality of life in hemodialysis patients. Though, the effect of the combined exercises during the  hemodialysis was outstanding in enhancing quality of life in hemodialysis patients in comparison to  aerobic exercises alone.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the aerobic exercises, especially combined exercises in hemodialysis patients may lead to an increase in their quality of life.

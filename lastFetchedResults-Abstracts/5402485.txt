The success of the team allocation in a agile software development project is essential. The agile team allocation is a NP-hard problem, since it comprises the allocation of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Many researchers have driven efforts to apply Computational Intelligence techniques to solve this problem. This work presents a hybrid approach based on NSGA-II multi-objective metaheuristic and Mamdani Fuzzy Inference Systems to solve the agile team allocation problem, together with an initial evaluation of its use in a real environment.

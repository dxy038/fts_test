The topic of practical implementation of MIMO systems for wireless communication has recently gained a lot of attention. One interesting issue is how to design the position of multiple antennas on wireless terminal. In this paper, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to find the optimal antenna placement in order to achieve the best capacity benefit. The effect of mutual coupling based on Z-parameter is the main factor to determine the MIMO capacity concerning as the objective function of GA search. Two cases of 3&#215;3 and 4&#215;4 MIMO systems are experimentally studied. Both simulation and measurement results confirm the success of the proposed method to design MIMO antenna placement.

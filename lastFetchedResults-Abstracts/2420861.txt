The objective of the dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem is to schedule power generation for the online units for a given time horizon economically, satisfying various operational constraints. Due to the effect of valve-point effects and prohibited operating zones (POZs) in the generating units cost functions, DED problem is a highly non-linear and non-convex optimization problem. The DED problem even may be more complicated if transmission losses and ramp-rate constraints are taken into account. This paper presents a novel and heuristic algorithm to solve DED problem of generating units, by employing time varying acceleration coefficients iteration particle swarm optimization (TVAC-IPSO) method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined and validated by carrying out extensive tests on different test systems, i.e. 5-unit and 10-unit test systems. Valve-point effects, POZs and ramp-rate constraints along with transmission losses are considered. To examine the efficiency of the proposed TVAC-IPSO algorithm, comprehensive studies are carried out, which compare convergence properties of the proposed TVAC-IPSO approach with conventional PSO algorithm, in addition to the other recently reported approaches. Numerical results show that the TVAC-IPSO method has good convergence properties and the generation costs resulted from the proposed method are lower than other algorithms reported in recent literature.

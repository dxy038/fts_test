A CMOS peer-relationship optical transceiver has been fabricated, permitting bidirectional digital data transmission with one optical fiber. The IC, when used with a single LED, provides two full-duplex user data channels at 19.2 kb/s and 1200 b/s using time-division multiplexing of the optical signals. A block diagram of the optical transceiver is presented along with a simplified scheme of the analog receiver

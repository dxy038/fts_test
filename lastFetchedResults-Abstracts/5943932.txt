A new contourlet-based method is introduced for reducing noise in images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. This method takes into account the statistical dependencies among the contourlet coefficients of different scales. In view of this, a non-Gaussian multivariate distribution is proposed to capture the across-scale dependencies of the contourlet coefficients. This model is then exploited in a Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator to restore the clean coefficients by deriving an efficient closed-form shrinkage function. Experimental results are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed denoising method using typical noise-free images contaminated by simulated noise. The results show that the proposed method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective criteria.

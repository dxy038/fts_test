Objective: To see the outcome of syndromic management in 100 patients of chronic vaginal discharge. Material and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in outpatient department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar from 1st January 2007 to 30h June 2007. Patients aged from 16 to 50 years with chronic vaginal discharge of more than 6 months duration were included in the study. Pregnant patients and those with the history of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN), Carcinoma of the Cervix, Ovary or Endometrium were excluded from the study. A detailed history and examination was done and a Proforma was filled. All these patients were treated with the syndromic management as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in which no laboratory tests are done and patients are treated empirically with the antibiotics as per criteria of WHO. Results: The mean age of the patients was 32+8.08 years. Vaginal infection improved in 56% of the cases with a single course of antibiotic, in 84% with a second course, 12 patients were lost to follow up and 5 patients who did not improve with two courses of antibiotics had big cervical erosions, were subjected to Cryo therapy. Conclusion: In settings, where bedside tests like microscopy, Potassium Hydroxide, wet mount films and tests for Chlamydia and gonorrhea are not available, syndromic management is a reasonable way of treating cases of chronic vaginal discharge.

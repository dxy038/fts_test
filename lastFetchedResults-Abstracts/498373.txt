Fars province accounts for more than 13 percent of Iranian wheat production. From one hand wheat is produces by a large number of townships in Fars province and on the other hand it is distributed among various regions throughout and out of Fars province, resulting in a large commodity transporting network. The high production of the province also needs the milling and storage centers to be developed. This study aims at determining the priority for establishing wheat milling centers and silos in Fars province's townships. To get the objective transportation cost minimizing model was applied in which a distance minimizing pattern was run for producing - milling and storages transportation network as well as milling and storage-consumption transportation network. In transportation method regarding the marginal distance obtained from running the optimal solution for paths ending at each township an average distance was calculated for them. Then the priority of the townships was determined. Based on the findings Shiraz, Marvdasht, Fasa, Firoozanad, Arsanjan, Istahban, Sepidan and Jahrom were found appropriate for wheat silo establishment. In the case of wheat milling centers also Abadeh, Bavanat, Pasargad and Eqlid were recognized as townships with higher priority. In the case of priority of exporting wheat to other provinces and in terms of the transfer reduction objective, the arrangement was as Kerman, Sistan and Baloochestan, Khoozestan, Hormozgan, Yazd, Tehran, Isfahan, and Razavi Khorasan provinces.

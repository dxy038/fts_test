In this paper, a comparative study of JPEG and SPIHT compression algorithms is presented. A set of objective picture quality measures like peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), maximum difference (MD), least mean square error (LMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) and picture quality scale(PQS) are used to measure the picture quality and comparison is done based upon the results of these quality measures. Different kind of standard test images are assessed with different compression ratios. SPIHT based compression achieves better results as compared to JPEG for all compressions.

The presence of the desired signal (DS) in the training snapshots makes the adaptive beamformer sensitive to any steering vector mismatch and dramatically reduces the convergence rate. The objective of the present study is to propose a new adaptive beamformer which is robust against direction-of-arrival (DOA) mismatch and its convergence rate is not sensitive to the presence of the DS. This method is applicable to the arrays with specific structure such as the linear array. Our approach is based on the DS elimination from the training snapshots and the sub-array beamforming technique. To accomplish this goal, a blocking matrix which converts the primary data to the DS-free data is synthesized. The Synthesis process is based on the desired degree of freedom and the uncertainty of DOA of the DS. Using the signal-free data, the beamforming vector is calculated through the presented algorithm. Owing to elimination of the DS from the training snapshots and performing the adaptive operations in the sub-array level, our algorithm has high convergence rate and excellent performance even in cases with the small sample size. Simulations show that the proposed beamformer can achieve a much better performance in terms of output SINR compared to the existing ones.

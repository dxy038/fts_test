The focal point of this paper is the well known problem of polynomial positivity over a given domain. More specifically, we consider a multivariate polynomial <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) with parameter vector <i>x</i> restricted to a hypercube <i>X</i> sub <b>R</b> <i>n</i>. The objective is to determine if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) &gt; 0 for all <i>x</i> isin <i>X</i>. Motivated by NP-Hardness considerations, we introduce the so-called dilation integral method. Using this method, a ldquosofteningrdquo of this problem is described. That is, rather than insisting that <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) be positive for all <i>x</i> isin <i>X</i>, we consider the notions of practical positivity and practical non-positivity. As explained in the paper, these notions involve the calculation of a quantity epsiv &gt; 0 which serves as an upper bound on the percentage volume of violation in parameter space where <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) les 0 . Whereas checking the polynomial positivity requirement may be computationally prohibitive, using our epsiv-softening and associated dilation integrals, computations are typically straightforward. One highlight of this paper is that we obtain a sequence of upper bounds epsiv<i>k</i> which are shown to be ldquosharprdquo in the sense that they converge to zero whenever the positivity requirement is satisfied. Since for fixed <i>n</i> , computational difficulties generally increase with <i>k</i>, this paper also focuses on results which reduce the size of the required <i>k</i> in order to achieve an acceptable percentage volume certification level. For large classes of problems, as the dimension of parameter space <i>n</i> grows, the required <i>k</i> value for acceptable percentage volume violation may be quite low. In fact, it is often the case that low volumes of violation can be achieved with values as low as <i>k</i>=2.

The main objective of this study was to assess and identify general construction faults and to investigate the effects of construction faults on the linear performance levels of reinforced concrete buildings. For doing this, observed two common construction faults (i.e., corrosion and honeycombing) were considered to be used in linear performance analyses. Finite element method was used to model the honeycombing at the column-beam joints. The effects of corrosion on the performance levels were ensured by reducing the cross-sectional area of reinforcement bars and reduced concrete compressive strength as a function of corrosion rate. Thus, two different construction faults on the levels of structural performance were discussed and compared. The results showed that the effects of honeycombing on performance levels of reinforced concrete building with linear performance analyses was more dramatic when it was compared with the results of damage building due to corrosion having a moderate to high corrosion threshold.

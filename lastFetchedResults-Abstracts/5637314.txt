This paper proposes a new registration algorithm, Co-variance Driven Correspondences (CDC), that depends fundamentally on the estimation of uncertainty in point correspondences. This uncertainty is derived from the covariance matrices of the individual point locations and from the covariance matrix of the estimated transformation parameters. Based on this uncertainty, CDC uses a robust objective function and an EM-like algorithm to simultaneously estimate the transformation parameters, their covariance matrix, and the likely correspondences. Unlike the Robust Point Matching (RPM) algorithm, CDC requires neither an annealing schedule nor an explicit outlier process. Experiments on synthetic and real images using a polynomial transformation models in 2D and in 3D show that CDC has a broader domain of convergence than the well-known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and is more robust to missing or extraneous structures in the data than RPM.

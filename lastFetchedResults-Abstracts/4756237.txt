Cognitive Radio provides a paradigm to enable an efficient and performing use of spectrum resources. Several challenging issues are still to be solved in order to fully exploit the CR potentials. One of these is the development of efficient distributed power allocation methods to be performed by the independent decisional entities of the network. Game Theory, and in particular S-Modular Games, are attracting since they provide useful tools for the definition of multi objective distributed decisional algorithms in the context of radio communications.

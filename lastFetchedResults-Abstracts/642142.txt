Objective
This study assessed whether the consumption of soy milk could add significantly to the lipid profile and lipid peroxidation in comparison with non-fat milk.
Methods
A double-blind, randomized, crossover study was conducted on 60 outpatients with primary hypercholesterolemia following a lipid-lowering diet for at least 6 wk. Lipid profile was obtained at baseline and at 6 and 12 wk, with the patients randomly assigned to receive initially 1 L/d of soy milk or non-fat cow milk for 6 wk. Lipid peroxidation was estimated by plasma thiobarbituric reactive substances. Apolipoprotein E genotypes were examined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism.
Results
The soy milk diet was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction (baseline = 157 ± 5 mg/dL; soy MILK = 148 ± 4 mg/dL; non-fat cow MILK = 158 ± 4 mg/dL; P < 0.05, soy milk versus other treatments) and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increase (baseline = 58 ± 2 mg/dL; soy MILK = 62 ± 2 mg/dL; non-fat cow MILK = 57 ± 2 mg/dL; P < 0.05, soy milk versus other treatments). In addition, plasma thiobarbituric reactive substances were reduced by the soy milk diet (baseline = 1.82 ± 0.12 nM/L; soy MILK = 1.49 ± 0.09 nM/L; non-fat cow MILK = 1.91 ± 0.11 nM/mL; P < 0.05, soy milk versus non-fat cow milk). Changes in lipid profile were not influenced by APOE genotypes.
Conclusions
These results indicate that soy milk as part of a lipid-lowering diet has beneficial effects in improving lipid profile and reducing lipid peroxidation.

VNIIEF is developing magnetocumulative generators of ultrahigh magnetic fields (MC-1) of various size, among which are generators with a large HE charge of 360 and 650 mm inner and outer diameter, and about 140 kg mass. Various sizes of the generator liners, their structural parameters and powering modes have been investigated using numerical model of the cascade MC-1 generator. The objective of the work is to choose a design and operating conditions for cascade MC-1 generator, which will provide maximal fields in a suitable for applications volume.

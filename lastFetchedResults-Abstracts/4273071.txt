We present a methodology and a tool for objective characterization of voice service quality in W-CDMA networks. Specifically, the speech quality of the UMTS adaptive multi-rate speech codec is investigated and relevant results are presented. The results show that the speech quality is not affected appreciably by transmission errors when the FER is kept below 1%. However, the codec can be operated at up to FER=7% in the highest codec mode while keeping a voice quality as good as or better than lower codec rates at lower FER

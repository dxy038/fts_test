This paper presents a methodology to design hermetically sealed shell type oil immersed distribution transformers with minimum evaluated cost according to the IEC standards. Distribution transformer model and design constraints are implemented as a user friendly software using MATLAB. An objective function for total evaluated cost is optimized subjected to ten constraints according to IEC 60076 in addition to geometrical constraints. A design example on a 630kV A transformer is presented for illustration.

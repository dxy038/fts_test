A distributed equalization control approach for series connected battery strings is presented in this paper. Each cell can transfer its energy to others through the energy bus. The distributed model of the equalization system is built and the equalization problem is converted to consensus problem of multi-agents. A bidirectional flyback converter based equalization circuit and a distributed equalization controller are designed. The proposed approach is verified by an equalization system with five series connected battery strings.

In bilateral teleoperation, the performance measure has significant considerations: control objective, quantitativeness, time delay and human haptic perception, but no suitable performance measure exist. Therefore this paper investigates extended transparency as a performance measure in bilateral teleoperation. First, through an analysis based on control objective, extended transparency has two independent control objectives: trackability and immersivity. Second, we develop the performance measure for each control objective of extended transparency by using both the transmission delay constant and the error vector magnitude for the effect of time delay, and both the meaningful perception bandwidth and the compliance just-noticeable-difference for human haptic perception. Finally, extended transparency is applied to two kinds of control architecture in a one-DOF LTI teleoperation system. The case study and simulations demonstrate the ease of application and the validity of the proposed method.

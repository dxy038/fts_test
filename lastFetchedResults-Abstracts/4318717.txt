A synthesis method to design a uniform linear antenna array, based on the ecology and social behavior phenomenon of animals is presented. The main Objective is to perform a rigorous determination of parameters involved in the beam pattern synthesis of antenna arrays with moderate sizes. The main objective of this work to conceive jointly the optimum amplitude and phase of the array elements using the Firefly algorithm (FA) and Invasive weed Optimization (IWO) methods. The distance between the elements is maintained uniformly so that mutual coupling can be ignored. The performance of the Firefly and IWO on the synthesis of a preconceived desired specification is compared in terms of convergence rate and global best solutions achieved.

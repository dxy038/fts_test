This work presents an objective MPEG-2 video quality measurement method based on fragile digital image watermarking. Based on the DCT-based watermarking scheme, this paper presents a fragile digital video watermarking scheme that can work as an automatic quality monitoring system. We embed watermark in the DCT domain of I-frames of original video, and the DCT blocks for embedding are carefully selected so that the degradation of the watermark can reflect the degradation of the video quality. The contrast sensitivity value is taken into account to weighten the quality measurement according to the human vision system. The evaluations demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed scheme against MPEG2 compression and noise pollution.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Exposure to certain infectious diseases such as measles and hepatitis A, by induction of cell mediated immunity cause a Th l (T- helper) activity type immune response. Th1 can antagonize Th2 activity and therefore diminish atopic disease. Therefore, because of relationship between socio-economic status and infectious diseases it was decided to survey the relationship between socio-economic status with atopic disease.
METHODS: In this descriptive-analytical study, demographic characteristics and socio-economic data about 3500 individuals (16-25 years old man) of Sanandaj city was gathered with standard questionnaire by educated interns and nurses during 2001. A clinical diagnosis of atopic disease was assessed by history and physical examination.
FINDINGS: According to the results, living in lower socio-economics status area has decreasing effect on prevalence of seasonal asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis (p<0.05). Low family income and higher paternal education level have decreasing effect on prevalence of seasonal asthma (p<0.05). In observed population, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis was 1.5% and higher maternal education has augmentation effect to it (p<0.05). In this study, the frequency of intrinsic and seasonal asthma and seasonal and chronic rhinocojunctivities were 2.1%, 5.3% and 6.1%, 11.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that high socio-economic status cause increasing effect on prevalence of atopic diseases.

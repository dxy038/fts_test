This paper presents the design and implementation of a multipoint-to-multipoint multicast scheme supporting heterogeneous and flexible QoS over ATM. The objective is to create a flexible network interface for supporting modern co-operative multimedia applications requiring multicasting service as well as predictable and dynamic quality of service (QoS). The scheme features a point-to-multipoint multicast, multipoint-to-multipoint multicast, dynamic member join and leave and QoS negotiation and re-negotiation. We present the architecture and implementation of the scheme and highlight the difficulties and related research issues

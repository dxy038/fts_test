Software quality is the main factor for the software reliability and software performance. Extreme programming strongly argues that it improves the quality of the software through feedback from iterative software development and by practicing pair programming and test driven development. Software quality is mainly depends on non-functional requirements. In most of cases non-functional requirements are not covered in the exploration phase. Especially in XP it is difficult to address non-functional requirements on the story cards. Our objective of this paper is knowledge based support to story cards to improve story cards and other XP practices by bridging them with the design of testability to improve non-functional user requirements, and predefined the factors for software testability on story cards with acceptance tests.

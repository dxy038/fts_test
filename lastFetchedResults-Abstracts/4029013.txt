A methodology for generating large scale distributed intelligence systems (DISÂ´s) using genetic algorithms is presented. An organizational structure (chromosome) is characterized by generic interactions (genes) among the individual nodes comprising it. The objective function evaluates each structure in the generated population against a set of structural constraints and some user defined criteria. The structures satisfying these constraints are feasible solutions to the design problem

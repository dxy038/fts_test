Background Relatively little international
work has examined whether mental health resource allocation
matches need. This study aimed to determine
whether adult mental health resources in Australia are
being distributed equitably.Method Individual measures
of need were extrapolated to Australian Areas,and Areabased
proxies of need were considered.Particular attention
was paid to the prevalence of mental health problems,
since this is arguably the most objective measure of
need.The extent to which these measures predicted public
sector,private sector and total adult mental health expenditure
at an Area level was examined. Results In the
public sector, 41.6% of expenditure variation was explained
by the prevalence of affective disorders, personality
disorders, cognitive impairment and psychosis, as
well as the Areaâ€™s level of economic resources and
State/Territory effects. In the private sector, 72.4% of expenditure
variation was explained by service use and
State/Territory effects (with an alternative model incorporating
service use and State/Territory supply of private
psychiatrists explaining 69.4% of expenditure variation).
A relatively high proportion (58.7%) of total expenditure
variation could be explained by service utilisation
and State/Territory effects. Conclusions For
services to be delivered equitably, the majority of variation
in expenditure would have to be accounted for by appropriate
measures of need. The best model for public
sector expenditure included an appropriate measure of
need but had relatively poor explanatory power. The
models for private sector and total expenditure had
greater explanatory power,but relied on less appropriate
measures of need. It is concluded that mental health services
in Australia are not yet being delivered equitably

Intel Corporation has successfully used DFT and self test methods to enable high volume manufacturing (HVM) of devices with both bidirectional and unidirectional interfaces operating between 1 Gb/s and 2.5 Gb/s on ATE with native data rates of 667 Mb/s or below. Extensions have developed and demonstrated in lab on interfaces up to 20Gb/s. While we continue to rely on full speed functional testing for some of our content we are not driving for ATE that would be capable of the accuracy needed to "measure" the interface performance parameters directly. Can you guess my position?

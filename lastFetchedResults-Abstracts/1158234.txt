The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of different gun configuration parameters on the external gas flow by using a CFD model, and to optimize the design of an arc spray gun based on the modeling results. A converging nozzle and a converging/diverging nozzle for arc spraying were compared by calculating their flow distributions using a two-dimensional (2D) axially symmetrical model. Other parameters such as location of the intersection position and angle between the two wires were also analyzed in a three-dimensional (3D) model. The results show that the converging/diverging nozzle is more favorable for droplet atomization, moving the intersection position from the nozzle outside to the nozzle exit and using a moderate intersection angle are better for improving the flow dynamics properties. Consequently, an innovative design to upgrade the original HAS-01 type gun was put forward, and the modified design was experimentally compared with the original one by measuring the in-flight droplet size and velocity.

The object of image compression is to minimize redundant information. This redundancy is due to correlation between adjacent pixels in a digital image. Different approaches with variable efficacies deal with this type of redundancy; the decomposition into sub-bands either through discrete cosine transforms or through discrete wavelet transforms is generally used. In this work, we are interested in spatial sub-bands coding with wavelet decomposition and we present in this context a comparative study between 5/3 and 9/7 wavelet filters and the variation of the decoded image quality depending on the level of wavelet decomposition. We support our study by objective and subjective quality assessments.

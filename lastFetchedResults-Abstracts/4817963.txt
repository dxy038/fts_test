The objective of this study is to estimate forest above ground biomass (AGB) of the whole areas covered with forest basing on Polarization coherence tomography (PCT) and polarimetric interferometric segmentation. Two scenes of DLR E-SAR L band quad-polarization images were acquired in Traunstein test site. Results show that there is no saturation using this method even when the biomass ups to 500tons/ha and parameters extracted from PCT is easier to implement in practice.

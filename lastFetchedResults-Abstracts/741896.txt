Objective: In this paper we present an attempt at noninvasive imaging of distributed myocardial electrical activity in patients suffering from myocardial infarction and in healthy subjects. Although advances have been made, noninvasive three-dimensional imaging of cardiac electrophysiological activity is still in its infancy and extending our knowledge of cardiac electrophysiological properties may be a valuable guide in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Methods: Magnetic field mapping data formed the input for an inverse solution that is based on a multiple dipole model. The lead field normalized minimum norm least square criterion was applied to predefined myocardial source geometry. Current density distributions were calculated for the left ventricle during ventricular depolarization. Images from two patients with previous myocardial infarction were compared to images from two healthy subjects. Results: Low regional and global current density was found in the infarction patients. Regions of low current density corresponded to infarcted segments. The images of the healthy subjects displayed less marked areas of low current density. Conclusion: The proposed multiple dipole model may be able to distinguish viable from scarred myocardium. A prospective clinical study should be undertaken to investigate the spatial resolution and the diagnostic performance of this method.

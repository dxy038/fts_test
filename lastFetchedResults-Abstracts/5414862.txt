The objective of this paper is to outline the experience and knowledge that the team comprised of Total Quality Systems (TQS) Inc., Westenhaver Wizard Works (WWW), Inc., and the Ogden Air Logistics Center has gained by converting a complicated radar test system from a GPIB based system to an Ethernet based system. Although GPIB based equipment remains available, the latest equipment technology is becoming Ethernet based, and one of the objectives of this effort was to facilitate long term supportability of the equipment, which suggests using modern, sustainable, cost-effective technology. The radar test system currently uses GPIB based instruments to test repaired F-16 antennas for proper functionality before sending the antennas out for use by flying units. The replacement equipment for test station electronic subsystems is Ethernet based. The software for the test system was designed with a modular architecture and can control GPIB equipment as well as the new Ethernet based equipment. The software recognizes whether the test control computer is connected to GPIB or Ethernet based equipment, and uses the appropriate control modules. There are other benefits resulting from the upgrade. Benefits include reducing software response times and reducing the hardware footprint. It is increasingly common for computers to have Ethernet capabilities built into the motherboard as a standard feature. Conversely, GPIB protocol requires additional hardware be installed in the host computer, along with supporting software and drivers. Another advantage can be found in the interconnections of a test system. Ethernet cable is common and inexpensive when compared to GPIB cables. This paper details these, as well as other, improvements and challenges encountered when undertaking the task of replacing the GPIB based equipment with Ethernet based equipment

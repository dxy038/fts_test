An educational effort was undertaken at Georgia Southern University that sought to incorporate the three aspects of Sustainability, environment and technology into a single course. An effort was also made to tie these three seemingly diverse constituents into one coherent course at the introductory level. This paper seeks to present the results of that effort. Audio-visual media are the chosen field of instruction to facilitate knowledge transfer to students. Some of the aspects that receive attention include geology, business case for sustainability, recycling, disassembly and green manufacturing etc. The basic objective of this course is to bring together students from various educational backgrounds in one place and encourage critical and creative thinking using a systems approach. The course focuses on hands-on activities such as mini-design projects that challenge students to think creatively and make some aspect of any chosen system more sustainable.

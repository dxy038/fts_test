Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ground black seeds on renal tubular cell apoptosis following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Materials and Methods: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into 5 equal groups including Sham, I/R model and three I/R+ black seeds (5, 10 and 20%)-treated groups. I/R groupsâ€™ kidneys were subjected to 60 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Microscopically, apoptosis of tubular cells was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) method. Results: The apoptotic cells of renal tubules were increased significantly (P<0.01) in I/R group than those in sham operation group. The TUNEL positive cells in black seeds (10% and 20%) treatment groups decreased significantly (P<0.05). Conclusion: Inhibition of apoptosis may be responsible for the protective effects of black seeds in rats with renal I/R injury.

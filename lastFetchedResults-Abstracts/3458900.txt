A voltage-sourced reversible rectifier (VSRR) which achieves bidirectional power flow between a three-phase AC supply and a DC bus voltage is described. The device features a current-forced control strategy that has the advantages of simplicity and extremely fast response time, while operating with unity power factor and sinusoidal AC supply currents to produce a regulated DC bus voltage. Six power transistors provide the necessary control over the currents, and to prevent them from switching faster than their capability a hysteresis band is introduced into the control strategy. The paper investigates the effects of the hysteresis, inductance and transistor switching delays on switching rates, distortion and efficiency by using both simulated and experimentally obtained results.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

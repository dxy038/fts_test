The resequencing operations of using selectivity banks in automobile paint shops is studied in this paper. A 0-1 integer programming model is formulated to describe the process. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the number of color changes in a car sequence after sorting. A nested ant colony optimization heuristic is developed to find near-optimal solutions. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented algorithm. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the resequencing problem within reasonable time duration.

Sparsity induced in the optimized weights effectively works for factorization with robustness to noises and for classification with feature selection. For enhancing the sparsity, L<sub>1</sub> regularization is introduced into the objective cost function to be minimized. In general, however, L<sub>p</sub> (p&lt;;1) regularization leads to more sparse solutions than L<sub>1</sub>, though L<sub>p</sub> regularized problem is difficult to be effectively optimized. In this paper, we propose a method to efficiently optimize the L<sub>p</sub> regularized problem. The method reduces the L<sub>p</sub> problem into L<sub>1</sub> regularized one via transforming target variables by the mapping based on L<sub>p</sub>, and optimizes it by using orthant-wise approach. In the proposed method, the L<sub>p</sub> problem is directly optimized for computational efficiency without reformulating it into iteratively reweighting scheme. The proposed method is generally applicable to various problems with L<sub>p</sub> regularization, such as factorization and classification. In the experiments on the classification using logistic regression and factorization based on least squares, the proposed method produces favorable sparse results.

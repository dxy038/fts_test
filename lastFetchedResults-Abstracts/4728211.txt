A time series of globally distributed spectral MODIS NBARs (Nadir Bidirectional-reflectance-distribution-function Adjusted surface Reflectance) was used to determine initial tasseled cap coefficients. An assessment of an annual time series of tasseled cap features indicated their utility for detecting vegetation phenological cycles. The comparison analysis showed that the temporal pattern of NBAR greenness was closely correlated with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), while NBAR brightness matched MODIS global broadband albedos. Thresholded global NBAR wetnesses appear to relate to MODIS snow and ice presence as determined by the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI).

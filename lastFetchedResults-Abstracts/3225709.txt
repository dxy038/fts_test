The objective of this paper is to illustrate the details of Line Replacement Unit (LRU)[1], Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA)[2] and development of real models of aircraft on Core Processor Input and Output Module (CPIOM) for the simulation activity. The real models development can be done by using ARINC-653 application software, which is real-time OS. The real models can be implemented using C language, and some scripts have also implemented to run the models. The RTOS running on CPIOM can perform real-time operations such as resource management, memory management etc.

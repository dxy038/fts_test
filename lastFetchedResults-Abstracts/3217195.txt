It is generally assumed that group studies are more effective for students than individual studies. The objective of this work in progress is to quantitatively evaluate and analyze the effect of collaborative studies on individual students performance. This effort would help the student stimulate interest in group learning and collaboration along with exposing them towards multiple problem solving approaches while working individually or in groups. This way the students are challenged to use their existing knowledge and approach, and augment it further with the knowledge and approach provided by group partners. While there are several efforts that focus on developing new group learning techniques, we intend to study the efficacy of previously proposed techniques under various test settings for EE and CS courses without significantly diverting from the course framework.

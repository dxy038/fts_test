Objective
The aim of this program was to develop a multicenter, multidisciplinary anatomy and surgical skills training program for junior residents in obstetrics and gynecology and urology.
Study design
After administering a needs assessment, we developed a collaborative clinical anatomy and surgical skills training program for junior residents in obstetrics and gynecology and urology at 3 academic medical centers in Chicago.
Results
Thirty-two residents participated in the program. Needs assessment results indicated that all residents felt they could benefit by more formal training in basic surgical skills. Learning objectives were developed for each of the 5 3-hour sessions that dealt with basic surgical skills, anterior abdominal wall anatomy, opening and closing the abdomen, female pelvic anatomy, and perineal anatomy and laceration repair. The cost of training each of the residents was approximately $600. Forty-five percent of the costs were one-time “start-up” costs for abdominal trainers and surgical instruments.
Conclusion
By including multiple centers and disciplines, we were able to reduce costs of teaching basic surgical skills and anatomy and maximize faculty teaching time and effort.

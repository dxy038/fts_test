Mobile Computing devices are increasing enormously in all fields of communication, which aims to focus on secure transfer of information. In order to provide authentication, message integrity and secure message transfer, developers need to access the cryptographic packages. The objective of this paper is to analyze and compare various algorithms discussed in Bouncy Castle Toolkit. Analysis was performed for the key generation, encryption and decryption of the information in terms of time and memory requirement. From the depicted graphical representation, a comparative study for both Symmetric and Asymmetric algorithms was performed in which TEA, XTEA and AES Fast proves to be good than ECC.

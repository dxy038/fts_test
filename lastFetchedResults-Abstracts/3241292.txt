In order to improve the quality of single-frame image super-resolution reconstruction, a novel interpolation algorithm based on weighted least squares is proposed. Interpolation pixel can be calculated from different directions by Newton interpolation formula, and get Multiple interpolation results. The interpolation result in the super-solution image can be got by using weighted least squares to fuse all the interpolation results. The weight matrix in the least squares method is determined according to the correlation among the pixels in the original image. Thus, contrasting to the conventional method, it uses more useful information to reconstruct the super-resolution image. Simulation results prove that the method can get the better super-resolution image according to not only visual impression but also the objective evaluation index.

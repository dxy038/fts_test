The objective of the escape system is to eject the crewman from the aircraft, decelerate the seat, and get the crewman onto a fully open parachute without causing injurious loads. The ejection process is summarized and common difficulties that may occur with current seats are identified. Improvements using electronic circuitry to enhance the performance of the standard ejection seat are specified along with additional improvements that can be made through a revision of the overall ejection system concept, in particular, by integration of the seat sequencer to the aircraft avionics

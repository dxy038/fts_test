In this paper, we concentrate on the problem of routing and bandwidth assignment in GMPLS networks. We proposed a new restoration routing algorithm in GMPLS networks with optimized bandwidth. In this new algorithm, we consider multiple network optimizing objectives to setup a LSP with maximize profit and shortest path under the limited resources. By comparing and analyzing with the traditional algorithm, it is much better than the algorithm, which only considers one optimizing objective. In practice it is enough to find a solution, which does not use more bandwidth than the available technology allows

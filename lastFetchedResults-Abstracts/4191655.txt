A novel variable additional riding time (ART) is defined to estimate the passengers riding time through a statistic approximation of traffic data. A more simple and precise method is proposed to calculate the service time, which includes the riding time and the waiting time. The objective of the elevator group control system in this paper is to reduce the service time. A GA-based method is adopted to search the optimal dispatching schedule for all hall calls dynamically. Proposed method can be applied in different traffic patterns. Simulation tests are made with the GA-based algorithm, and the test results show that the new algorithm makes an improvement in the system performance (service time).

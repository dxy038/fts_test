The objective of this work is the implementation of a parameter identification option in the package DESIS. DESIS is a computational tool which allows the modeling and simulation of any non-linear system using the bond graph methodology. The paper includes the presentation of the new module implemented and the modification of existing ones to adapt them to the problem solution. The parametric identification module implemented is for linear and SISO systems

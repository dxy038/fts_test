The Brazilian Amazon Coastal Zone is marked by impressive discharge of sediment and freshwater influence by the mouth of the Amazon River. An extremely wide continental shelf characterizes this coast, rolling plains are periodically flooded and higher plateaus formed in older sedimentary rocks. The objective of this work is to detect changes along the coastline in Marajo&#769; Bay (southern portion of the mouth of the Amazon River) for a period from 1984 to 2013. The analysis of change detection in coastal environments of the mouth of the Amazon River quantified a total of changes between Water and Earth in the order of predominance 853.59 km<sup>2</sup> with a balanced sediment budget with slight erosion with -2.39 km<sup>2</sup>. The change detection in coastal environments applied to the mouth of the Amazon is able to indicate areas most susceptible to natural processes of sediment deposition and coastal erosion.

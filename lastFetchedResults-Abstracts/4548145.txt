Power electronics has continuously been a crucial part of electrical engineering; it is how we transmit and convert electric energy, hence it is desired to develop good fundamental basics of power electronics for electrical engineers. Therefore the main objective of this research work is to create a program that provides an interactive, user friendly and enlightening learning environment to assist users, undergraduate students to learn about power electronics. The program comprises a Graphical User Interface and when the program is executed, a detail labelled simulation graph of desired circuit is presented with user input parameters, embracing the relationship between the relative input/output voltage and currents. The program could potentially save tremendous amounts of time and be extremely useful for educational purpose. This paper will discuss the basics of Power Electronics, specifications, algorithm of the program, simulation results and case studies.

The present paper describes a torque saturation control technique applied on vehicular control, operating on time-varying tire-road adherence conditions and with noise perturbation. The method is based on an instantaneous estimation of the maximum available friction using the Dugoff tire model. The novelty lies in the modeling of the road conditions, which are regarded as continuous variables. A &#8220;dynamic&#8221; Pacejka model is built around the classical Pacejka model, giving a more realistic approach of the tire-road interaction. The implemented estimation method has to adapt to all the parameter changes, to produce a reliable maximum friction on which the control will be applied. The complex modeling of the road conditions will be enlarged with a noise perturbation, to test our methodÂ´s robustness, which represents the objective of the present work. At the same time, the vehicle is considered to be equipped with &#8220;in-wheel&#8221; electrical motors, which provide a quick transmission of the torque directly at the wheel.

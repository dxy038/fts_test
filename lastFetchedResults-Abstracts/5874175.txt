Medical imaging techniques and analysis tools like Computed Tomography (CT) enable the doctors and radiologists to identify as well as diagnose various disorders in internal structures. In this paper, fuzzy multilayer perceptron network based algorithm used for segmentation and region classification and region severance algorithm is used for detection and location of Intra-cerebral hemorrhage. According to location different types of lobar Intra-cerebral hemorrhages are classified. Experimental visualization results are presented which were computed on real intra-cerebral hemorrhage patient brain data. The objective of this paper is to propose a method to assist the radiologists in identifying the different type of lobar Intracerebral hemorrhage and to arrive at a decision faster and accurate.

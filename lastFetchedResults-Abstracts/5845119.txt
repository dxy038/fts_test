A fingertip force decomposition model for a multifingered robot hand grasping and manipulating an object is proposed. During the trajectory execution the fingertip force is decomposed into a dynamic equilibrating force and an internal interaction force. Using the equations of motion and the displacement consistency relationship of the virtual grasping system, a computational algorithm is derived for the dynamic equilibrating forces subject to the constraint of dynamic stability. To simplify the formulation, a representation of the internal interaction force components is developed. An objective function based on the fingertip forces is defined and the internal interaction forces are optimally determined. A computational algorithm for planning fingertip forces during trajectory execution is derived

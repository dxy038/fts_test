A description is given of the VAX code used by a generalized feedback system at the Stanford Linear Collider. The system categorizes various classes of information by the use of linked lists. The lists use a primitive form of an objective-C object in which a container class describes all linked lists. This permits an arbitrary number of feedback loops whose behavior can be globally modified by changing common code.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

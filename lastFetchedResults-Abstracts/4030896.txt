We propose a multistream discrete hidden Markov model (DHMM) framework and apply it to the problem of land-mine detection using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). We hypothesize that each signature (mine or nonmine) can be characterized better by multiple synchronous sequences representing features that capture different environments and different radar characteristics. This paper is motivated by the fact that mines and clutter objects can have different characteristics depending on the mine type, soil and weather conditions, and burial depth. Thus, ideally different sets of specialized feature extraction mechanisms may be needed to achieve high detection and low false alarm rates. In order to fuse the different modalities, a multistream DHMM that includes a stream relevance weighting component is developed. The relevance weight of each stream depends on the symbols and the states. We reformulate the Baum-Welch and the minimum classification error/gradient probabilistic descent learning algorithms to include stream relevance weights and partial state probabilities. We generalize their objective functions and derive the necessary conditions to update all model parameters simultaneously. The results on a synthetic data set and a collection of GPR signatures show that the proposed multistream DHMM framework outperforms the basic single-stream DHMM where all the streams are treated equally important.

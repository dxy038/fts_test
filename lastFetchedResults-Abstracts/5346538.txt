Estimating the depth of anesthesia (DOA) is still a challenging area in anesthesia research. The objective of this study was to design a fuzzy rule based system which integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) features to quantitatively estimate the DOA. The proposed method is based on the analysis of single-channel EEG using frequency and time domain features as well as Shannon entropy measure. The fuzzy classifier is trained with features obtained from four subsets of data comprising well-defined anesthesia states: awake, moderate, general anesthesia, and isoelectric. The classifier extracts efficient fuzzy if-then rules and the DOA index is derived between 100 (full awake) to 0 (isoelectric) using fuzzy inference engine. To validate the proposed method, a clinical study has conducted on 22 patients to construct 4 subsets of reference states and also to compare the results with CSM monitor (Danmeter, Denmark), which has revealed satisfactory correlation with clinical assessments

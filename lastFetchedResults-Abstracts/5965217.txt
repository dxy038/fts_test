An algorithm is presented for optimization problems in which the objective function, its gradient, and its Hessian would require Monte-Carlo-type simulations. First, a conceptual algorithm is presented. Then, an implementable version of this conceptual algorithm, based on the idea of NewtonÂ´s method, is given, together with convergence results and the conditions needed to achieve convergence

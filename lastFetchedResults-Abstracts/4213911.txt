The real-time transmission of voice on a IP network is one of the key techniques in multimedia communication. This paper aims at evaluating the performance of a set of audio codecs best suitable for real-time voice transmission using the real-time transmission protocol (RTP) over an IP network. Voice is encoded using an audio codec and transmission is simulated by means of a RTP media simulator for an IP network. The client/server programming style is used for receiver and transmitter, in both design and implementation. Performance is measured based on the voice quality and objective quality measurements are presented.

The importance of nutrient intakes in osteoporosis prevention in treatment is widely recognized. The
objective of the present study was to develop and validate a FFQ for women with osteoporosis. The questionnaire
was composed of 60 items, separated into 10 groups. The relative validation was accomplished through
comparison of the 3-Day Food Record (3DR) with the FFQ. The 3DR was applied to 30 elderly women with
confirmed osteoporosis, and after 45 days the FFQ was administrated. Statistical analysis comprised the
Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov, Student T test and Pearson correlation coefficient. The agreement between two methods
was evaluated by the frequency of similar classification into quartiles, and by the Bland-Altman method. No
significant differences between methods were observed for the mean evaluated nutrients, except for carbohydrate
and magnesium. Pearson correlation coefficients were positive and statistically significant for all nutrients. The
overall proportion of subjects classified in the same quartile by the two methods was on average 50.01% and in
the opposite quartile 0.47%. For calcium intake, only 3% of subjects were classified in opposite extreme quartiles
by the two methods. The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the differences obtained by the two methods
in each subject were well distributed around the mean of the difference, and the disagreement increases as the
mean intake increases. These results indicates that the FFQ for elderly women with osteoporosis presented here is
highly acceptable and is an accurate method that can be used in large-scale or clinical studies for evaluation of
nutrient intakes in a similar population

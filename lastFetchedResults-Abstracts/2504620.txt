Background: In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) is the best option for patients with hydrosalpinx. However, if hydrosalpinges is not pre-treated, the therapeutic outcomes of IVF-ET would be compromised. Objective: This study aims to investigate the safety and effects of operative hysteroscopy in the treatment of patients with hydrosalpinx prior to IVF-ET, who were not indicated for laparotomy due to extensive pelvic adhesion. Materials and Methods: The study analyses retrospectively data from 10 women with hydrosalpinx, who were unable to undergo laparotomy due to extensive pelvic adhesion and treated by operative hysteroscopy prior to IVF-ET, and was assessed the effects and safety of the procedure. Results: Postoperative Hystero-salpingography demonstrated complete tubal occlusion of the diseased side in all cases. Being applied with IVF-ET for fertility after their hysteroscopy operation, 5 out of 10 patients acquired clinical pregnancy. Conclusion: Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion of the proximal part of the hydrosalpinx can effectively prevent the hydrops backflow to endometrial cavity and benefit subsequent implantation in the course of assisted reproduction without significant complications

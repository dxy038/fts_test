We study the novel hierarchical architecture of Mobile Backbone Networks. In such networks, a set of Mobile Backbone Nodes (MBNs), which are envisioned to be airborne, are deployed to provide an end-to-end communications capability for the terrestrial Regular Nodes (RNs). We address the joint problem of placing a fixed number K MBNs, and assigning each RN to exactly one MBN, using two optimization objectives. The first is the Maximum Fair Placement and Assignment (MFPA) problem in which the objective is to maximize the minimum throughput obtained by any RN. The second is the Maximum Throughput Placement and Assignment (MTPA) problem, in which the objective is to maximize the aggregate throughput of the RNs. We develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm for the MFPA problem for any K, and an optimal polynomial time algorithm for the MTPA problem for K&#8804; 2. We also develop lower complexity approximation algorithms and present simulation results comparing the performance of the various algorithms.

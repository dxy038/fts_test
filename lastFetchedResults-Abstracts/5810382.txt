This paper presents a methodology to address reactive power compensation using Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) technique programmed in the MATLAB environment. The main objective is to find the best operation point minimizing power losses with reactive power compensation, subjected to all operational constraints, namely full AC power flow equations, active and reactive power generation constraints. The methodology has been tested with the IEEE 14 bus test system demonstrating the ability and effectiveness of the proposed approach to handle the reactive power compensation problem.

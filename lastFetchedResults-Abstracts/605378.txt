As far as the statistics is concerned, the high figures of unsuccessful entrepreneurs and business venture failures may raise the fundamental question of why some businesses collapse. The performance in sports business field is the main objective of this research. To this end, two hundred and seventeen, (217) entrepreneurs who were involved in sports services answered the questionnaires on personality traits, opportunity recognition, management skills and leadership style and five indexes were used in order to measure the venture performance. All questionnaires were valid and reliable. The data were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis, multiple regressions and structural equation modeling. The results showed that personality traits, management skills, transformational leadership style as well as opportunity recognition have a significant relationship with an entrepreneur's performance in sports business field, which can explain 50% of variance in venture performance, but no obvious relationship was detected between transactional leadership style and venture performance.

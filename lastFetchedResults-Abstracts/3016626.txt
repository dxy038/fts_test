The main objective of ORiN project is the standardization of networking software used as API that provides standard methods for accessing robot system information based on technologies that have already been designed for information infrastructures that are commonly used in the PCs and telecommunication services. In this paper, we describe the objective of ORiN first, then the architecture and key technologies. The applications developed according to ORiN specification that have been tested during the International Robot Exhibition in Tokyo held in 2001 are reported. This paper concludes with the future plan about the ORiN consortium.

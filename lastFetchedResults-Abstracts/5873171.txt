The main objective of the paper is to develop sliding mode control (SMC) for tracking problem of continuous nth degree nonlinear system in the form; x<sup>(n</sup>)(t)=f(x(t))+u(t), where f(x(t)) is a nonlinear function with an uncertainty having a known bound and x(t)=[x(t)x&#729;(t)...x<sup>(n-1/)(t)]</sup>sup T/ is the state vector. A modification of the conventional switching control is proposed which is shown to give fast convergence in the reaching mode without affecting the desired performance in the sliding mode

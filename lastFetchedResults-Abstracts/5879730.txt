In order to solve the railway flood prevention emergency materials reserve network location optimization problem which satisfies emergency time restraint, the least cost of reserve and risk protection maximization, facility location models of emergency service including location set cover model and p-median model are used to build a multi-objective model. A solving procedure based on enumeration method is given. And then the paper puts the flood control emergency materials reserve network location problem of some railway bureau as an empirical analysis. Analytic results indicate that using the multi-objective programming model and algorithm established in this article can ensure the condition of covering all emergency points, the least reserve cost and risk protection maximization. So the model is more applicable to the reserve network location optimization problem of railway flood prevention emergency materials.

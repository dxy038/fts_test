Objective: To investigate how phase measurements might facilitate the detection of auditory steady-state responses.
Methods: Multiple steady-state responses were evoked by auditory stimuli modulated at rates between 78 and 95 Hz and with intensities between 50 and 0 dB SPL. The responses were evaluated in 20 subjects after 1, 2, 4, and 6 min. The responses were analyzed in the frequency domain using 4 different detection protocols: (1) phase-coherence, (2) phase-weighted coherence, (3) F test for hidden periodicity, and (4) phase-weighted t test. The phase-weighted measurements were either based on the mean phase of a group of normal subjects or derived for each subject from the phase of the response at higher intensities.
Results: Detection protocols based on both phase and amplitude (F test and phase-weighted t test) were more effective than those based on phase alone (phase coherence and phase-weighted coherence) although the difference was small. Protocols using phase-weighting were more effective than those without phase-weighting. The lowest thresholds for the steady-state responses were obtained using the phase-weighted t test.
Conclusion: Threshold detection can be improved by weighting the detection protocols toward an expected phase, provided that the expected phase can be reliably predicted.

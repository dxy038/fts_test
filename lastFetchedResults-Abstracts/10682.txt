The paper discusses a genetic algorithm (GA) developed for solution of two lateral canal scheduling problems presented recently in the literature. The GA formulations use very similar objective functions for both problems. Results obtained with the GA approach are compared with previously published results obtained through linear and integer programming. The GA approach has been demonstrated to be robust and very efficient in application to lateral canal scheduling problems. It is also easily set up and would be easily applied by practitioners.

Background: A genetic syndrome associated with schizophrenia, 22q11 deletion syndrome (22qDS), may represent a genetic subtype of schizophrenia (22qDS-Sz). Structural brain changes are common in schizophrenia and may involve developmental anomalies, but there are no data yet for 22qDS-Sz. The objective of this study was to assess brain structure in adults with 22qDS-Sz using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods: Brain and arterial MRI scans of 11 adults with 22qDS-Sz (mean age = 28.4 years, SD = 6.5) were systematically assessed by a neuroradiologist for qualitative anomalies.
Results: A high frequency of abnormalities were found: T2 white matter bright foci (BF), 90%; developmental midline anomalies, 45%; cerebral atrophy or ventricular enlargement, 54%; mild cerebellar atrophy, 36%; skull base abnormalities, 55%; and minor vascular abnormalities, 36%.
Conclusions: BF and skull base abnormalities, especially in association with neurodevelopmental midline abnormalities, may be distinguishing MRI features for a genetic subtype of schizophrenia involving a deletion on chromosome 22.

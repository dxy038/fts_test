A model validation test based on simple linear autocorrelation is proposed as an objective method to determine the optimal number of units in the hidden layer of a radial basis function network. The data to be fitted is assumed to consist of a signal with additive iid noise. A novel stopping criteria is introduced based on the statistics of the residuals rather than on ad hoc parameters. Consequently, this network is shown to neither overfit nor underfit the data. In addition, each new unit is adjusted to respond locally to the target data

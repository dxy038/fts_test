When a static magnetic field was applied to a Si droplet levitated by an electromagnetic force, only one peak was observed to remain in the frequency spectrum. It was the objective of this work to clarify whether this peak can be assigned to the m = Â± 2 oscillation or to the rotation of the droplet. By analyzing the behavior of the deflection angle of the droplet in a top view, we conclude that this peak is not due to the surface oscillation of the droplet but to the droplet rotation.

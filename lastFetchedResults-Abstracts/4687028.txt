Static guiding sign system is the core factor for rail comprehensive passenger terminal to operate and organize efficiently, so it has important practical significance to evaluate the sign system. The paper firstly establishes a multi-layer evaluation indicator system which is divided into four aspects consisting of plane component, information content, installation form and system organization. Secondly, the paper proposes a qualitative indicator quantification method based on fuzzy statistics method, scale evaluation method and set-valued statistics method. Then AHP method and mean square deviation method are comprehensively used in calculating the weight of evaluation indicators. Thirdly, the paper puts forward a comprehensive evaluation method based on multi-objective grey relation projection model. Finally the case study shows that the method is practical and feasible for evaluating the static guiding sign system.

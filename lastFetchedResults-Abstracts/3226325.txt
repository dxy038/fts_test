In under developing countries, line losses are considered to be a major issue for power distribution systems. It is hard to locate the area where power is being theft and the situation becomes worse in densely populated area. Further in a country like Pakistan where there is power crises, these illegal connections become great hurdle in collecting revenue. Every month billions of circular debt has to be paid on account of power theft. Moreover due to lack of some effective system, it is impossible for the relevant authorities to find exactly when, where and in which amount these losses are cropping up. It is possible to develop an automated electronic based technique through which we can not only detect these outlawed connections but can prevent these as well. The main objective of this paper is to devise a technique for this power theft detection and prevention. Some smart microprocessor based modifications will be helpful to let us know whether there is a presence of any illegal connection or not. This aim can be achieved by the comparison of power supplied and consumed by distributor and consumer respectively. In this regard, the main modifications in power distribution system will be: (a) Instantaneous measurements of power statistics between distributor and consumer, (b) Continuous comparison of power delivered and utilized and (c) Immediate reporting on power mismatch to relevant authorities.

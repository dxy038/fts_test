This work is part of the EFDAÂ´s European Goal Oriented Training programme on Remote Handling (RH) &#8220;GOT-RH&#8221;. The programme aims to train engineers for activities supporting the ITER project and the long-term fusion programme. This paper is written based on the results of a project &#8220;Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) of ITER RH system using Digital Mock-Ups (DMU)&#8221;. The purpose of this project is to study efficient approach of using DMU for the V&amp;V of the ITER RH system design utilizing a System Engineering (SE) framework. It gives an overview of the current trends in product and simulation lifecycle management (PLM/SLM) in the industry. This paper suggests a nearly design verification process centralized around a collaboration platform. The purpose of this paper aims at improving and formalizing the ITER RH design process together with the V&amp;V process. The objective of this study aims to improve the cost efficiency and reliability of ITER RH systems.

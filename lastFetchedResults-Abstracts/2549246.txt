Objective: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) reside in the bone marrow
and control the process of hematopoiesis. They are an excellent instrument for regenerative
treatment and co-culture with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, K562 cell lines were either treated
with butyric acid and co-cultured with MSCs, or cultivated in a conditioned medium from
MSCs plus butyric acid for erythroid differentiation. We used the trypan blue dye exclusion
assay to determine cell counts and viability in each group. For each group, we separately
assessed erythroid differentiation of the K562 cell line with Giemsa stain under light microscopy,
expression of specific markers of erythroid cells by flowcytometry, and erythroidspecific
gene expressions by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results: There was enhandced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells with butyric acid
compared to the K562 cell line co-cultured with MSCs and butyric acid. Erythroid differentiation
of the K562 cell line cultivated in conditioned medium with butyric acid was higher
than the K562 cell line co-cultured with MSCs and butyric acid, but less than K562 cell line
treated with butyric acid only.
Conclusion: Our results showed that MSCs significantly suppressed erythropoiesis.
Therefore, MSCs would not be a suitable optimal treatment strategy for patients with
erythroid leukemia.

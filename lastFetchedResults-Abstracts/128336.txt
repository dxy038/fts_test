In this paper, a new control method for grid connection of PhotoVoltaic(PV) systems is proposed. The objective of this paper is to show that, with an adequate control strategy, the PV system can transfer the DC link energy into grid, improve the power factor of the electrical system and compensate harmonic
currents of the utility. If the PV power generation is not enough to supply demanded power of the load, the utility feeds the active power demand of the  load directly and the PV system supplies a reactive and harmonic compensating component of the load current. With the utility fail, the power is transferred from	the PV system to the load. Finally, in order to validate the accuracy of the proposed control method, grid-connected PV system is simulated.

In this paper design, fabrication and test of three X-Band robust LNA MMICs in microstrip GaN technology are presented to better understand the key aspects of performance versus robustness trade-off for said components. In particular LNAs with different number of amplification stages, input device gate peripheries and topologies have been evaluated with the objective of achieving in the 8-11 GHz frequency range a NF better than 2.5 dB, associated gain of circa 20 dB and overdrive power survivability better than 38 dBm.

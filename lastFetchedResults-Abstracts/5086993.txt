In this paper, the voltage and frequency control of a proposed hybrid AC/DC Micro-Grid is studied. The main objective of this study is to develop the PI, self-tuning fuzzy and wavelet controllers and compare their performances through the study of the voltage and frequency control of the Micro-Grid under disturbances. First, only PI controllers based Micro-Grid is analyzed by MatLab/Simulink during the load and generation uncertainties to show their good control performances. Then, self-tuning fuzzy controllers are follow to show a superior robustness and efficiency compared to the PI controllers during the islanding event. Finally, the wavelet controllers are studied to show and verify a much more ability, precision and robustness than the PI and even the fuzzy controllers to quickly restore and stabilize the Micro-Grid during events such as the islanding.

Crop Simulation models are used for water management in farms and are widely used for optimization of water use efficiency. AquaCrop model is based on yield response to water that developed by FAO. The objective of this study was calibration of two parameters, including growing degree days from sowing to maturity (GDD) and water productivity normalized (WP) for barely in Pakdasht region, Iran. The experiments were done in 20142015 and the treatments were three crop calendars, including early, normal and late planting. Using calibration data and try and error method, GDD and BWP were calculated 1260 degree and 14.8 gram/m2, respectively. The results showed that calibrated model provided close agreement with the reference values, with a coefficient determination of 0.99 and root mean square error of 0.59 ton ha1.

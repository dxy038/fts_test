A novel hybrid five-level DC-DC converter is proposed, which utilized two series connection bidirectional switch and two flying capacitors to provided middle electrical levels. With proper controlling, the volume of output inductance can be reducing to 1/8 compared with traditional full bridge DC-DC converter. The principle of operation and the dc characteristics of the new converter are analyzed and verified on a experimental prototype

Intelligent transportation system telecommunications require the development of reconfigurable demonstration platforms. The PALMYRE platform is a federative project with the aim of coordinating and developing research activities and application programs in the fields of radio communications and MIMO systems within public and private laboratories in Brittany, France. This project involves the design and implementation of a platform for radio system development and evaluation. This platform allows a modular design of systems with reconfigurable, interchangeable and reprogrammable software and hardware components. The objective is to develop and to test radio communication techniques and electronic systems in realistic conditions. A robust serial transmission system, involving digital and radiofrequency parts, has been developed to be used as a test reference for the platform. In this paper, the MIMO 4times4 compliant radiofrequency circuit and its implementation are described. Lastly, simulation results and validation measurements are presented

The objective of this work is to carry out a numerical investigation to examine the effects of geometric parameters on the confined impinging jet heat transfer. Parameters such as Nusselt number, Reynolds number, H/W have been studied. Nozzle width H ranges from 0.6 mm to 2 mm, and nozzle-to-plate spacing W ranges from 0.5 mm to 10 mm. The jet flow is in the range of laminar flow with Reynolds number from 26.8 to 1000. This paper presents distributions of target surface temperature, local and average Nusselt number on the target plate. Pressure drop for different H/W is also obtained. This study can provide useful information to the application of impinging jet heat transfer in industry.

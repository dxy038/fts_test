The Main objective of this paper is to enhance the Availability of Web Services for Mission Critical Applications. Mission Critical Systems (MCS) are time specific and more deterministic and predictable. Every task has a critical time and must be completed within that time. If this application fails for any length of time that leads to great business loss. For example,. Stock Exchange Services, Financial and Banking Services. The Web Services for these Systems should remain available on 24/7 basis. The availability of these systems (MCS) must be guaranteed in case of failures and network disconnections. Load balancing solutions for availability are limited to an enterpriseÂ´s local area network. In this paper we propose architecture for enhancing the availability of mission critical system with the concept of WS-Replication. In this proposed architecture the Service replication is a way to increase the availability of web services over a wide area network. WS-Replication allows the deployment of a replicated web service using web services technology and SOAP for transporting information. WS-Replication deploys services in a set of sites. It broadcasts a single client request to all of the replicated services, waiting for response from one or all of the services. The responses are collated analyzed for faults and a faultless response is returned back to the client thereby increasing the availability of the service.

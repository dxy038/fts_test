This study considers a situation in which a sensor network aims to protect a stationary target (e.g., a large battleship at anchor) and detects signals from approaching objects (e.g., small boats traveling in a harbor). Once the network detects a sufficient number of signals from the object (for example, through video surveillance), it may classify the objectÂ´s intention as hostile and act accordingly by informing responders. The objective is to design an optimal strategy for recognition that guarantees accurate and timely intruder detection. We show that the optimal policy is of a control limit threshold.

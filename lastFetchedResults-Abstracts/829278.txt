Objective: It is believed that monocyte isolation methods and maturation factors affect the
phenotypic and functional characteristics of resultant dendritic cells (DC). In the present
study, we compared two monocyte isolation methods, including plastic adherence-dendritic
cells (Adh-DC) and magnetic activated cell sorting- dendritic cells (MACS-DC), and their ef-
fects on phagocytic activity of differentiated immature DCs (immDCs). 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, immDCs were generated from plastic
adherence and MACS isolated monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) in five days. The phagocytic
activity of immDCs was analyzed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated latex
bead using flow cytometry. One way ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis of differences
among experimental groups, including Adh-DC
and MACS-DC groups. 
Results: We found that phagocytic activity of Adh-DC was higher than MACS-DC, whereas

the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of phagocytic cells was higher in MACS-DC
(p < 0.05).
Conclusion: We concluded that it would be important to consider phagocytosis parameters
of
generated
DCs
before making any decision about monocyte isolation
methods to
have
fully functional DCs.

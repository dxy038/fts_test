IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine began its publishing in 2006 and is now in its sixth year. This milestone means that the magazine is now evaluated in Journal Citation Reports from Thomson Reuters. Journal Citation Reports provide a systematic, objective evaluation of research journals by accumulating and tabulating citation and article counts from technical journals published worldwide. The first evaluation of IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine places it in the top half of all journals published in the electrical engineering field, which is an excellent start. The authors and editors have worked hard to produce content that is relevant and useful, as demonstrated by this initial ranking.

Soil structure is important to root development and crop yield. The objective of this study was to test the Cropping Profile Method in Brazilian soils, in order to evaluate the soil structure in the field. Grouped different structures determined by the Cropping Profile Method were compared to laboratory determinations for soil bulk density, total porosity and mercury porosity. The study was conducted in clayey Oxisols submitted to different uses and management including annual crops, orchards and natural forests in the State of Paraná, southern Brazil. Homogeneous morphological units (HMUs) were determined in trenches using the Cropping Profile Method, and the different structures were grouped as: (a) non-compacted; (b) compacted; (c) in-process-of-compacting. Results of field evaluation were compatible with those obtained in the laboratory. More compacted and in-process-of-compacting structures corresponded to soil bulk density values of 1.42 and 1.33 Mg m−3, which were significantly higher than the 1.18 Mg m−3 value obtained for soil bulk density in non-compacted HMU. The total porosity of compacted HMU and in-process-of-compacting HMU was 0.49 and 0.52 m3 m−3, respectively. These were significantly lower than the value obtained for the non-compacted HMU (0.60 m3 m−3). The Cropping Profile Method is useful mainly in field research works when it is important to verify the effect of management practices on soil structure.

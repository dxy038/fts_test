Study objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a technique for application of tetracaine, adrenaline, and cocaine (TAC) for minor oral lacerations. Methods:  Our study group comprised 22 consecutive children older than 5 years of age who presented to an urban pediatric emergency department with a minor oral laceration 2 cm or less in length requiring single-layer closure. The children were prospectively treated with a two-drop dose of TAC containing .5 mg tetracaine and 12 mg cocaine on a cotton-tipped applicator placed in contact with the wound for up to 5 minutes. Results:  Lacerations involved the labial mucosa (n=12), tongue (n=6), and buccal mucosa (n=4); 41 (91%) of 45 sutures were placed without pain (95% confidence interval, 0% to 8.2%). No patient exhibited an adverse reaction related to TAC. Conclusion:  This TAC application technique was safe and highly effective in providing anesthesia for minor oral lacerations.

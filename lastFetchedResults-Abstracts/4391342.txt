For a better exploitation of radio resources in the fourth generation networks (4G) Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) and for a better guarantee of service quality requested for users, radio resources management and specifically scheduling, play a key role in reaching the objective. In this paper, we propose a new packet scheduling (PS) algorithm for LTE-A downlink transmission that adds a new functionality of an adaptive Time Domain (TD) scheduler to adaptively allocate available resources to GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate) and NGBR (Non GBR) traffic. Evaluation of our algorithm and comparison with previous works are also presented. The simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of the system throughput as well as the delay and the Packet Drop Rate (PDR) for both GBR and NGBR traffic.

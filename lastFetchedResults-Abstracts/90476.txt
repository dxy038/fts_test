A database which holds results of field and laboratory experiments on the impact of subsoil compaction on physical and mechanical soil parameters and on crop yields and environmental impact is being developed within the EU sponsored concerted action (CA) project "Experiences with the impact of subsoil compaction on soil, crop growth and environment and ways to prevent subsoil compaction". The database accumulates and can provide all available data from the participants of the European Union countries, and is compatible with the European Soil Database and other related databases. More than 600 sets of data (Excel workbooks) from participants from the European Union, plus Poland, Switzerland and Norway are included in the database. Through a similar EU sponsored CA, Eastern European countries are expected to deliver 260 sets of data thus bringing the total number of Excel workbooks to approximately 860. In total, the database will contain approximately 13,500 data spreadsheets. The objective of the database is to collect data on subsoil compaction, to store it in a structured format and to make it available for analysis and use. Thereby it will enable elucidation of the impact of subsoil compaction on soil properties, crop yields and environment and evaluate the vulnerability of soils to compaction.

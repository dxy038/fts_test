Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an auto-piloted and remote-controlled vehicle sustained by the aerodynamic lift over its whole flight profile. It has many applications such as weather forecast, terrain surveying, environment surveillance, hazardous cleanup, military defense, and so on. In this paper, a simplified nonlinear equational modeling of UAV dynamics is conducted and then linearization and adaptive control approaches are designed. The objective is to apply aerodynamic theory and adaptive control theory on accurate UAV explicit modeling to enhance capabilities of UAV navigation and prediction against various severe conditions

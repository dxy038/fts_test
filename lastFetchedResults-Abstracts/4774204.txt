WENDELSTEIN 7-X, being under construction at the Greifswald branch of the Max-Planck-Institut fur Plasmaphysik, has the objective to prove the reactor relevance of a HELIAS type stellarator. Energy and particle confinement will be investigated in an optimised magnetic configuration and stationary operation of a reactor relevant divertor system will be demonstrated. After an intensive R&amp;D program, the project is in the phase of procurement of the main components. This holds for the magnet system, the cryostat, the in-vessel components, the heating systems as well as for various tools for the assembly. Start of operation is scheduled for 2006.

Objective: To assess the outcome of closure of temporary loop ileostomies by comparing frequency of post operative complication. Methodology: This was an experimental study conducted at the surgical A unit of Lady Reading Hospital Between Jan 2005 and Dec 2009. All patients who were primarily operated and ended up with temporary loop ileostomy were admitted via the out-patient department. Consecutively allocated into group A whose stomae were closed at 8 weeks and group B whose stomae closed at 4 weeks. Postoperative complications including wound infection, anastamotic leak:, dehiscence etc. were recorded and statistical analysis done using version 13.0 SPSS for windows. Results: Group A included 155 patients and Group B 156 patient with male predominance in both groups (p=0.869). The mean age in both groups was similar 33.6 years and 32. 7 years respectively Anastamotic leak rate and wound dehiscence was lower in early closure group but p value was insignificant. The frequency of wound infection was higher in the early stoma closure group (p=0.001). The mean hospital stay was similar. Conclusion: Apart from wound infection the frequency of complication following early closure (4 weeks) of temporary loop stoma is similar to delayed closure. Thus delayed closure of stomae should be abandoned.

Campylobacteriosis is considered as a zoonotic disease and in some cases carrier are the sources of infection in humans. Dogs and Cats might have no Clinical signs but shed the bacteria in their feces and sometimes show samples of dogs and cats were examined. Primers were used related to 16S rRNA, gly A, mapA, and lpxA genes. First, positive samples which contained nucleotide sequence related to Campylobacter spp. were identified using universal Clinical sign (such as enterits). Therefore the rapid and accurate diagnosis of infected animals is important. The objective of the present study was to detection of Campylobacter species in stool samples of dogs and cats referred to small animal hospitals in Tehran, Iran, using Multiplex PCR technique. In the present study 100 stool primers. Then identification of Campylobacter spp. was performed using multiplex PCR. PCR products were analyzed and scanned using gel electrophoresis and UV illuminator, respectively. Thirty nine samples were positive for Campylobacter spp. Of these, 2 and 11 samples were related to Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter upsaliensis, respectively. Statistical analysis was showed that Campylobacter upsaliensis infection was more common has a higher prevalence in cats compared to dogs. It was concluded that PCR technique can be used as a useful test for rapid diagnosis of Campylobacter spp. in stool samples of diseased or carrier animals.

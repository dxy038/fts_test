A crucial objective in battery operated embedded systems is to work under the minimal power consumption that provides a desired level of performance. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM) are typical techniques used on processors and devices to reduce the power consumption through speed variations and power switching, respectively. The effectiveness of DVFS and DPM methods needs to be considered in the development of a power management policy for systems that consist of DVFS-enabled or DPM-enabled components. This paper explores how to efficiently reduce the power consumption of real-time applications with constrained resources, like energy, CPU and transmission bandwidth. A combined DVFS-DPM approach with a reduced complexity is proposed to make use of on-line strategies for embedded systems.

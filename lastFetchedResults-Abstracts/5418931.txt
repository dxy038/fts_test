This paper presents an improved dual output full-bridge series resonant inverter with asymmetrical voltage-cancellation (AVC) control for cooking appliance. The important advantage of the proposed control is that the output power can be adjustable independently while achieving the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation. The power loss analysis on the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and an improved efficiency are provided. A laboratory hardware prototype has been implemented on the DSPIC2010 microcontroller. Experimental results are presented to validate the objective of the controlled scheme.

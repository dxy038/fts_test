This paper presents a new modeling of elevator group intelligent scheduling system with destination floor guidance. The traditional input mode of separate hall call registration and the destination selection is improved to a single-input mode that makes the acquired ensemble of hall call communication more determinate and integrated. Meanwhile, the ensemble of hall call communication is regrouped and classified, the prediction algorithms of multi-objective evaluation items are proposed based on destination floor guidance, and Fuzzy Neural Network optimized by Genetic Algorithm is constructed and applied further to fulfill the matching scheduling scheme. Simulated results show that the optimized scheduling algorithm efficiently ameliorates the evaluation items and the scheduling system has the advantaged improvement for overall performance.

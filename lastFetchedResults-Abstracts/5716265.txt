The OECD Halden Reactor Project is a joint undertaking of national nuclear organisations in 20 countries, who together sponsor a research programme under the auspices of the OECD-Nuclear Energy Agency. One important research area addresses control room design and the role of the operator within such an environment. The simulator-based Halden Man-Machine Laboratory (HAMMLAB) has, since its establishment in 1983, been the main facility for conducting research in this area. It´s overall objective is to provide knowledge for improving today´s control rooms, through the introduction of computer-based solutions for effective and safe control of the plant, across all process conditions. The paper introduces the facility and the recent upgrades carried out, and also provides an overview of the breadth of the research topics addressed within the programme. This breadth is illustrated with results from recent studies, focusing on the design of usable systems and staffing levels within an advanced control room. The establishment of a virtual reality centre at Halden has further extended the capabilities and possibilities for control room design and evaluation. The Halden approach of combining human factors knowledge and virtual reality technology in control room design, is illustrated by projects from the nuclear and electrical distribution industries

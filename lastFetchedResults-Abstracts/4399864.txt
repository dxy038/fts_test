The objective of the research is to prove the 3D reconstruction capability of the range-gated laser imaging technique. To investigate this, we have designed and developed a whole set of system for high precision three-dimensional imaging. The system uses a Nd: YAG electro-optical Q-switched 532nm laser as transmitter, an image intensify tube with double micro channel plate as gated sensor, and all the components are controlled by a trigger control unit with accuracy of sub nanosecond. For imaging various aspects of the target object, a multi-directional imaging scheme is designed, experiments are performed to obtain the sequences of images. A set of algorithms is also developed and used to reconstruct the 3D image basing on centroid algorithm. Experimental results imply that the multidirectional imaging method is efficient and feasible.

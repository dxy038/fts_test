Background and Objective: Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Present available pharmacological treatments can only slow down the progression of symptoms but can not treat the disease. It has been established that benzodiazepines and related agonists at the benzodiazepine site of GABA receptor present anxiolytic and amnesic properties, whereas inverse agonists such as B-carbolines, (norharmane) could exert anxiogenic and learning-enhancing actions. This finding has directed the focus of researches on the potential use of B-carbolines as anti-AD drug.  The goal of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of norharmane on spatial memory of streptozotocin (STZ) rat model of AD.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 48 male Wistar rates were divided into control, STZ, STZ+ alcohol and STZ+ norharmane groups. Rats in alcohol and norharmane groups received alcohol (0.2 ml) or norharmane (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 days before training and for 6 days during training, 30 min before each session of experiment. For induction of AD, STZ (3 mg/kg, i.c.v, 10 ?l each) was administered bilaterally into lateral ventricles. All rats were tested for spatial memory in the Morris water maze. 

Results: Pre-training injection of norharmane improved spatial memory at low doses (1 and 2 mg/kg) but attenuated spatial memory retention at high doses (4 mg/kg) in STZ rat model of AD.  There was no significant difference between control and STZ+norharmane groups (2 mg/kg), whereas the differece between control and STZ +norharmane (1 and 4 mg/kg) groups were significant. 

Conclusion: According to these findings, norharmane at low doses may be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by its ability to influence the GABAergic system.

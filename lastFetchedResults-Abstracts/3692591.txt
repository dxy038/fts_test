Numerical field solutions employing the charge simulation method (CSM) have been obtained for the rod-plane gap geometry which is of considerable importance in High Voltage Engineering research. It is shown that conventional techniques do not necessarily lead to accurate solutions in the entire interelectrode space. A method is suggested which uses an optimization technique employing a modified objective function which minimizes not only the accumulated squared potential error but also the tangential electric field along the conducting surface. This method yields solutions with good accuracy in the entire interelectrode space.

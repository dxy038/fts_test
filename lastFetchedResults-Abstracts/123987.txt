BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vasectomy is a current method for birth control. In common technique that used in vasectomy, cutting ends of vas deferens is surgically obliterated. Percutaneous obliterating of vas that due to azoospermia without any surgical incision is much more comfortable and has less side effects. In this study, ethanol as a sclerosing substance was used to induce obliteration.
METHODS: This study was performed on 36 rats aged 4-5 months. Before cutting of vas deferens at the left side, its proximal part was obliterated under general anesthesia. At the right side, vas was clamped at two points with 10 mm from each other and after injecting ethanol (20 units) and whitening of the location, clamps were removed.
FINDINGS: Ethanol as a sclerosing substance fixed the area and due to any sperm wasn't found at the distal part of vas in days of 2, 6 and 9. But, after 15th

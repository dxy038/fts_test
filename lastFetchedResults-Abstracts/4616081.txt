Mechanical prosthetic heart valves generate sounds which may be used to infer their structural status. Acoustical signal processing methods have been applied to the Bjork-Shiley Convexo-Concave (BSCC) heart valve, which in rare instances may experience outlet strut fracture. An objective classifier has been developed that isolates and characterizes a frequency component shown to be associated with the intact BSCC valve. Analysis of recordings from 24 confirmed clinical cases resulted in a 93% specificity (13 of 14 properly classified as intact) and 100% sensitivity (10 of 10 properly classified as structurally altered)

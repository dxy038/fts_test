The authors have developed a multi-agent system for autonomous energy management aboard an all electric naval ship. Simulation results were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies. To prove the concept and gain insight into this important problem, a hardware prototype is being built. The objective of this paper is to describe the prototype, its hardware components, and the communication scheme that has been adopted. We also discuss the integrated system setup with its multi-agent components to perform tests.

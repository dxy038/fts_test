The output filters play a very important role in DC/DC converters. Important aspects of converters such as dynamic response, size and cost are closely related to the components of the filter. Small values for the filter components improve the performance of the converters and increase the power density, whereas minimum values should be provided to guarantee the filtering objective. A comparison of the typical LC configuration as output filter for several DC/DC converters, taking into account switching frequency issues and soft switching techniques, is described in this paper. Results show that some converters have advantages from the point of view of the output filter

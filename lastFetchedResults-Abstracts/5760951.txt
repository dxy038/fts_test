This paper presents an H.264-compatible temporal sub band coding scheme for static background scenes of soccer video. We utilize orthonormal wavelet transforms to decompose a group of successive frames into temporal sub bands. By exploiting the property of energy conservation of orthonormal wavelet transforms, we construct a rate distortion model for optimal bit rate allocation among different sub bands. To take advantage of the high efficiency video codec H.264/AVC, we encode each sub band with H.264/AVC Fidelity Range Extension (FRExt) intra-coding by assigning optimal bit rates. The experimental results show that our proposed coding scheme outperforms conventional video coding with H.264/AVC for both subjective and objective evaluations.

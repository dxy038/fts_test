Background and Objective: Recurrent caries are one of the main reasons for replacing restorations. There are different methods for the detection of secondary caries. However, radiography is an excellent method for detection of carries which are not clinically obvious. Aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of digital and conventional radiography in the diagnosis of recurrent caries. 
Subjects and Methods: In this in vitro study, 52 healthy human premolars were used. Amalgam class 2 cavities were prepared on both proximal surfaces. Artificial caries lesions were made by a round 0.5 mm bur in half of the boxes. The other half were considered as control boxes. Then the teeth were embedded in acryl in a similar position to clinic. Digital and conventional radiographs were obtained. Images were evaluated by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists for recurrent carries. The resulting data was analyzed using Pearson Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact Tests.
Results: In the mesial surface, the specificity and sensitivity were 0.990 and 0.962 for digital radiography versus 0.928 and 0.920 for conventional radiography. In the distal surface, the specificity and sensitivity were 0.928 and 0.920 for digital radiography compare with 0.954 and 0.971 for conventional radiography.
Conclusion: The results of this in vitro study suggest that digital radiography technique is a safe method for the diagnosis of secondary caries with higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional radiography.

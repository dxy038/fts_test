Summary form only given, as follows. This paper details the path taken to develop a sampling strategy for monitoring defects within an advanced fabrication facility. The objective of this program is to develop a sampling plan that will provide for efficient process monitoring and effective yield prediction. The sampling plan will incorporate a strategy for the percentage of lots, the number of wafers within each lot and the diagnostic model formulated by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California at Berkeley, data collected during the start-up phase of the fabrication process will be used in conjunction with factors such as equipment capacity, cost-of-ownership details and minimization of cycle time contributions by inspections to develop an inspection strategy that will allow for a quick progression from process development to a higher yielding manufacturing process.

Bridge construction quality inspection and evaluation systems previously developed have been no more than just conventional management information systems, in which no mapping or sophisticated visual analysis capabilities are supported or even considered, not to mention network connectivity, especially Internet access. To address the problem, it is herein presented a WEBGIS-based quality inspection and evaluation system for bridge construction, applicable to not only simply-supported, old-fashioned bridges like arches, girders, etc., but also complex bridges like suspension, cable stayed, and other bridges with unique characteristics. Great efforts have been made to incorporate into the system the features like: real-time visualization, online spatial queries, comprehensive analysis, damage pattern recognition, decision making, and so on. The objective of this study is to demonstrate various new possibilities that Internet and GIS technology could bring to bridge construction quality inspection and evaluation, through the design and implementation of the Shenyang WEBGIS-based quality inspection and evaluation system for bridge construction.

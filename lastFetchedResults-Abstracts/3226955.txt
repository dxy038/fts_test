The vehicular communication protocols in the context of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) are typically based on simulation models, because the practical experiments are not feasible. One of the main challenges in the Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network domain is the Realistic Simulation of Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols. For providing meaningful evaluation result of IVC protocols, an exact modelling of road traffic i.e. an exact movement and position of involved vehicles is very important. Here, the study of various mobility models with different methodology and need of bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic simulation as well as the use of a new Hybrid Location Based Ad-Hoc Routing Protocol instead of DYMO in bidirectional coupling of SUMO and OMNeT++(Veins) is proposed.

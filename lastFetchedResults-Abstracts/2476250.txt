In this paper, we propose a new adaptive internal model control scheme based on adaptive finite impulse response filters. This scheme provides the same design procedure for both minimum and nonminimum phase plants. The plants under consideration may contain time delay. The tracking objective is accomplished for both invertible and noninvert-ible stable plants. The internal model of the plant and its inverse are estimated by recursive least-squares and least-mean-squares algorithms, respectively. The closed loop is designed such that the system from the reference input to the plant output can be approximately represented by a pure delay. The effect of the process zeros on the output is compensated by using adaptive finite impulse response filters. This avoids the cancellation of noncancellable zeros of the plant and forces the plant output to track the reference input with a delay. The stability of the closed loop for both minimum and nonminimum phase systems is guaranteed. Computer simulation and laboratory scale experimental results are included in the paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

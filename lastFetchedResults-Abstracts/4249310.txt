This paper contains a review of objective measurements for VoIP compression algorithms. An overview of VoIP networks is presented along with a description of the main characteristics of ITU-T G.729 and G.723.1 standards. PSQM, PAMS, and PESQ measurements for voice clarity are reviewed, and an explanation of the application of perceptual models for the objective measurement of voice clarity is presented. The factors that affect voice quality, delay, echo, and clarity, are discussed briefly.

In many applications, the control objectives and constraints can be assigned a hierarchy of levels of priority. Often a disturbance or a fault occurs, resulting in some constraints or objectives being violated. Inadequate handling of this situation might result in component or even system-wide failures. This paper presents several methods for handling a large class of multi-objective formulations and prioritisations for model predictive control of hybrid systems, using the new mixed logic dynamical (MLD) framework. A new method, which does not require logic variables for prioritising soft constraints, is also presented

The authors use the edge and face basis functions to reduce DEs to first and second-order, respectively. They establish the relationship between the edge-based finite element frequency and time domain (FEFD and FETD) algorithms and present numerical results that illustrate the accuracy of these techniques. In the first experiment, the FEFD algorithm was applied to compute the bistatic radar cross section (RCS) of a 1/spl lambda/ square conducting plate. In the second experiment, the time-domain algorithm was applied to compute the bistatic RCS of a conducting cone, of base radius 1 m and height 1.1 m, at a frequency of 300 MHz. The third experiment was carried out with the objective of comparing the bistatic RCS results predicted by these two algorithms.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

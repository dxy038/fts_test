Purpoe
To determine the effect of viually ignificant cataract on Accumap multifocal objective perimetry.
Deign
Interventional cae erie.
Method
Fifteen eye of 15 adult patient who underwent tandard outpatient phacoemulification cataract urgery with poterior chamber intraocular len inertion with ubequent improvement of bet-corrected viual acuity underwent Accumap teting before and after cataract extraction. Patient had no other ophthalmic dieae or other condition that may have affected viual evoked potential. Reult were analyzed tatitically.
Reult
Viually ignificant cataract wa aociated with a tatitically ignificant reduction of mean Accumap amplitude within the central 107 degree (zone 1, P = .002; zone 2, P = .003; zone 3, P = .001) but did not affect the outer two zone (zone 4, P = .074; zone 5, P = .931).
Concluion
Accumap viual field may be affected by viually ignificant cataract. Multifocal objective perimetry defect in the central 10 degree hould be interpreted with caution in patient with cataract.

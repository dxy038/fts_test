Study Objective
To determine if there is an association between pediatric ovarian malignancies and elevated platelet counts:
Design
Retrospective chart review.
Setting
Large referral children's hospital.
Participants
154 patients taken to the operating room between February 1993 and February 2006 with an adnexal mass where ovarian tissue was submitted for pathological analysis.
Main Outcome Measures
The principle outcome was the presence of ovarian malignancy.
Results
We found that there is an increase in thrombocytosis among individuals with ovarian malignancy, with as high as 33% of those with ovarian germ cell tumors demonstrating preoperative thrombocytosis.
Conclusion
These results suggest that thrombocytosis may be a useful marker for ovarian malignancy in this population. Further studies will be needed to determine if there is any prognostic value to thrombocytosis among these patients, with a potential value for counseling and future intervention based on these findings.

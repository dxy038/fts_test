A coplanar waveguide-feed pentagonal-cut fractal antenna and its backscattering are considered. The proposed antenna has been fabricated with optimised dimensions. The experimental results of this antenna exhibit ultra-wide bandwidth characteristics from 2.5 to 15 GHz. The proposed antenna has been simulated using a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulator. The experimental and simulated results are in good agreement. The effects of design parameters on impedance bandwidth have also been studied in detail. The experimental radiation patterns of this antenna are omni-directional in the <i>H</i> plane and bidirectional in the <i>E</i> plane. The measured group delay of the proposed antenna is almost constant throughout the band. The backscattering reduction of this proposed antenna is good throughout the band. This antenna can be useful for high data rate transmission in modern wireless communication, microwave imaging and vehicular radar.

The objective of this paper was to study the fatigue characteristics of zirconium (Zr)-based bulk-metallic glasses (BMGs) and to investigate the mechanisms of fatigue-crack initiation, crack propagation, and fracture in BMGs. The fatigue ratios (fatigue limit/tensile strength) (0.30â€“0.55) of Zr-based BMGs were found to be generally comparable with those of crystalline alloys, such as steel and titanium alloys. Fatigue cracks typically initiate from shear bands, inclusions, and/or porosities. The striations resulting from the blunting and resharpening of the fatigue-crack tip formed in the fatigue-crack-growth region. The fine striation spacing seems to be comparable to that of the crystalline alloys.

This paper presents a modified technique for the tuning of power system controller parameters in order to improve the power quality and dynamic stability of the system. The technique uses symbolic Eigen value sensitivity analysis and linear programming approach to determine the optimum value of controller parameters in the system. The main objective function aims to shift critical Eigen values to the left of the imaginary axis in the s-plane, as far as possible. The proposed method presents new constraints including a new formula for convergence and a controlling parameter to reduce the effect of numerical approximation resulting from the linearization of the objective function. Proper selection of the most effective parameters to be tuned is also performed. The proposed technique is general, effective and simple to apply using the developed MATLAB-SIMULINK software program which has a friendly user interface. A case study is considered which is a single synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus-bar through a transmission line equipped with a Power System Stabilizer (PSS). Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed technique in enhancing system stability.

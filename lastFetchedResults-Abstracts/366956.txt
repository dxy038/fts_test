Neutron-induced electron radiography is a technique suitable for inspection of thin samples. The first tests were performed with conventional X-ray films, which made it possible to distinguish between thicknesses of materials of the order of 1 Î¼m. The objective of this work was to investigate the performance of the technique when an imaging plate is used instead of an X-ray film to register the image. Due to their wide dynamic range and much higher sensitivity, imaging plates offer significant advantages over the conventional X-ray films.

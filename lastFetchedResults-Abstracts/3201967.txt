In this work, a multibody dynamics model of a wheeled mobile robot is developed to characterize the terrain reaction forces in terms of the physical and control parameters of the system. A common strategy for simulating the motion of mobile robots on soft soil is to compute the soil reaction forces using terramechanics models and to solve a forward dynamics problem by considering the soil reactions as a set of forces applied to the system. This intends to provide an accurate computation of the forces involved in the wheel-soil interaction; however, a series of factors such as the sensitivity of reaction forces to soil parameters limits the applicability of the existing terramechanics models in unstructured environments. We propose an alternative approach which does not rely on the soil properties, but at the same time does not intend to provide an exact computation of wheel-soil interaction forces. The main objective of this approach is to estimate the effect of changes in control and design parameters on the performance of the system, using the information provided by the dynamics model of the vehicle. To this end, the reaction forces for the wheel-terrain interaction in the ideal limit case of pure rolling and no penetration are obtained upon the specification of the motion at the contact points, via kinematic constraints. The validity of the analysis results obtained using the proposed paradigm is verified by simulation runs and experiments. The experimental results suggest that this approach is successful in predicting the variation of a set of important performance indicators in terms of the changes in the parameters of the system.

In recent years, power electronic energy storage systems using super capacitor bank have been widely studied and developed for the electronic vehicles. In this paper, a full-bridge/centertapped push-pull circuit with active clamp-based soft switching bidirectional DC-DC converter and its control method are presented and discussed. From the results of basic experimental demonstration, the proposed system is able to perform adequate charging and discharging operation between low-voltage high-current super capacitor side and high-voltage low-current side with drive train and main battery. In addition, RCDi snubber losses appeared in the basic circuit topology are drastically reduced by ZCS/ZVS operation with the assistance of newly added active clump circuit, as well as ZVS operation with lossless snubber capacitor in high-voltage primary side.

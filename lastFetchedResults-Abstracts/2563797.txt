Objective(s): Phthalimidebased derivatives have anticonvulsant activity like as phenytoin by inhibition of sodium channel. In our previously research we mentioned about some phthalimide derivatives as potent anticonvulsant agents. Materials and Methods: Fourteen analogs of 2substituted phthalimide pharmacophore were synthesized and then were evaluated for the anticonvulsant activities in pentylenetetrazoleinduced seizures (PTZ) and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) models. Results: The in vivo screening results showed that all the analogs have the ability to protect against the maximal electroshock and PTZ. The compounds 3 and 9 elevated clonic seizure thresholds at 30 min which were more active than the standard medicine phenytoin. Compounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14 with 100% protection were the most potent ones in tonic seizure. The most potent compound in the both PTZ and MES models was compound 3. Using a model of the open pore of sodium channel, all of the compounds were docked. Results of docking showed that the ligands interacted mainly with residues IIS6 of NaV1.2 by making hydrogen bonds and have additional hydrophobic interactions with other domains in the channel&#039;s inner pore. Conclusion: Some of these compounds are more potent than phenytoin simultaneously in the clonic and tonic seizures.

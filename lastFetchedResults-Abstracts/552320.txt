Nowadays, quality control of bread, especially in large scale production, requires application of novel methods. In this research, image analysis of digital images of Barbary bread enriched with soy flour was carried out at two storage intervals. Using Imagej software, crumb features (mean cell area and void fraction) were computed for each image. Fractal dimensions of bread crumb images were measured using Fourier transform method with a code written in Matlab. Contrast, energy, correlation and homogeneity of images also were measured and statistically analyzed. Storage time had significant effect on fractal dimension and void fraction, also resulted changes in textural parameters of bread images. The deduction of this work could be regarded as rapid, non-destructive, objective and inexpensive method for quality evaluation of bread crumb.

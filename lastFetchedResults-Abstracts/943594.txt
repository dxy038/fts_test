Background and Objective: AgRP is a powerful orexigenic peptide which is secreted by the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and plays an important role in weight control.  The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of two weight loss protocols (1.a researcher recommended weight loss protocol, 2.Traditional weight loss protocol) on resting plasma concentration of AgRP in elit wrestlers.
Subjects and Methods: Thirty elite wrestlers (age 24.33± 3.33 years, BMI 24.90±2.38 Kg.m2 and body fat percentage 12.92±3.01) were randomly divided into three groups (two experimental groups and one control group). Experimental group I: used a twelve-day diet protocol which was suggested by researchers, along with three wrestling exercise sessions on a week. Experimental group ??: used traditional diet protocol and sauna, and control group was without diet protocol. Blood samples were collected before and 12-hours after the protocols. Subject’s percent of body fat was measured using the 3-point method. 
Results: Both the experimental groups had a significant weight reduction (P > 0.001). The experimental group I showed significantly reduction in percent of body fat (P > 0.001). The levels of plasma AgRP increased in the experimental group II (P > 0.01).
Conclusion: The twelve-day weight loss protocol is more effective  than the traditional weight loss protocol. Not only it did not have a significant effect on AgRP level, it also decreased body fat percentage.

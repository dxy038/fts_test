A video display device having a lower number of bits per pixel than that required by the video to be displayed quantizes the video prior to its display. Halftoning can perform this quantization while attempting to reduce the visibility of certain quantization artifacts. Quantization artifacts are, nevertheless, not eliminated. A temporal artifact known as dirty-window effect (DWE) can be commonly observed in medium frame-rate binary video halftones. In this paper, we propose video halftone enhancement algorithms to reduce DWE. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithms by presenting objective measures for DWE in the original and the improved halftone videos. The expected contributions of this paper include three medium frame-rate binary video halftone enhancement algorithms that do the following: 1) reduce DWE under a spatial quality constraint; 2) reduce DWE under a spatial quality constraint with reduced complexity; and 3) reduce DWE under spatial and temporal quality constraints.

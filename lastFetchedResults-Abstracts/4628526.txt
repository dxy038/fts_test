The main objective of our project is to implicate a learner in an interaction with a virtual partner to learn language. To reach this objective, our approach is based on the communicative approach and on second language acquisition principles and their implications when building a multimedia environment. In this article, we address the problem of the conception of the interaction model and its reification in an interactive environment. We present also the results of the first tests.

A valveless solar solid adsorption ice maker has been used for carrying out experiments under real solar radiation intensity conditions. Different performance variations of the solar ice maker are obtained under the effect of sky cloudy cover. The experimental results indicated that the performance of the solar ice maker was severely affected by the sky cloudy cover, and no ice would be obtained if cloudy conditions prevailed for intervals exceeding 3 h. A heat and mass transfer model validated by the experiments has been used to analyze intermittent refrigeration phenomenon of solar solid adsorption refrigeration. The performance variation due to the effecting of sky cloudy cover has also been demonstrated by simulated results. The analysis of both experimental and simulated results has provided an objective climate resource choice which could be available now in applications to solar solid refrigeration, it also has made a scientific analysis method for solar solid adsorption ice maker application.

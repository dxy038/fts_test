The distribution systems need to adjust and intensify the use of new available technologies and incorporate intelligence to combat non-technical loss processes. Its detection is one of the greatest challenges to energy distribution companies. Studies and research involving load modeling or load estimation (LM/LE) on power system distribution combined with smart grid functionality will help control commercial loses in electric power distribution systems. The use of algorithms is proposed for LM/LE using monthly energy consumption data converted to hourly demand. This information and the remote monitoring consumption data via smart meters will be processed by a computational tool that will indicate the feeder with the greater probability of presenting non-technical losses, with the objective of locating energy fraud, directing companyÂ´s investment on combating non-technical losses.

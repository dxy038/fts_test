The ability to enable a quick reconfiguration in order to fulfill the quickly changing market needs is one of the essential requirements of future production systems. Against this background, the central objective of this paper is the discussion of a concept to simplify the application of task-oriented programming for assembly systems. After a summary of existing concepts to facilitate the programming and configuration of manufacturing systems, a new concept is exposed. This includes a method to automate the building of a world model for implicit programming. Furthermore other important elements of the approach are described. Finally a demonstration scenario, for the evaluation of the results discussed in this paper, is outlined.

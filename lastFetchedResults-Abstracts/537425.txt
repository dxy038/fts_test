Objective
Febrile seizure is the most common convulsive disorder in childhood. The role
of iron in metabolism of neurotransmitters and carrying oxygen to the brain
suggests the possibility of a relationship between iron deficiency anemia and
febrile seizures.
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between iron deficiency
anemia and febrile seizures.
Materials & Methods
This case - control study was performed on 132 cases and 88 controls, aged 9
months to 5 years, from July 2007 to June 2009 in Baqyiatallah Hospital. Patients
were selected using simple random sampling. The case group included children
with first febrile seizure (core temperature over 38.5?C during seizure) without
a central nervous system infection or an acute brain insult. The control group
included children suffering from a febrile illness without seizure. Iron deficiency
anemia was defined with one of these laboratory indexes: 1) Hemoglobin (Hb)
 < 10.5mg/dl 2) Plasma ferritin  < 12ng/dl 3) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)  < 70
fl. The data collected from patients were analyzed with SPSS.13 software.
Results
Low plasma ferritin was found in 35 cases (26.5%) compared to 26 controls
(29.5%), low Hb level was found in 4 cases (3%) compared to 6 controls (6.8%)
and low MCV was found in 5 cases (3.8%) compared to 6 controls (6.8%).
There was no significant difference in plasma ferritin , Hb level and MCV
indices between the two group.
Conclusion
Considering the above-mentioned results, there is no relationship between iron
deficiency anemia and febrile seizures.

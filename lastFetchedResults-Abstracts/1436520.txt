The objective of the present work is to develop a sensitive and selective voltammetric method for the determination of amoxicillin (AMX) based on the polyaniline film modified carbon past electrode (CPE) in micellar media. The adsorptive voltammetric behavior of amoxicillin at polyaniline film modified carbon past electrode was investigated and validated in pharmaceuticals and biological fluids by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV), and squarewave adsorptive stripping voltammetry (SWAdSV). The voltammograms of the AMX in 0.2 M acetate buffers of pH 2.0–6.5 exhibit a single well defined oxidation peak which may be due to the oxidation of OH group. The cyclic voltammetric studies indicate, the oxidation of amoxicillin at the electrode surface is a reversible step and diffusion-controlled. Various chemical and instrumental parameters affecting the monitored electroanalytical response were investigated and optimized for amoxicillin determination. The achieved limits of detection and quantification were 3.5 × 10−10 M and 1.5 × 10−9 M by SWAdSV and 7.3 × 10−10 M and 5.4 × 10−9 M by DPAdSV, respectively. The applicability of the proposed method was tested in biological samples and pharmaceutical preparations.

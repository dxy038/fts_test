Blindness is a widespread medical condition which affects millions of people around the world. Many travel aids have been introduced to help the blind but they are either complicated or over simplified and based on theoretical studies that donÂ´t meet the real needs of the blind. Some blind people have developed a unique technique to navigate similar to bats by which they can imagine a realistic sonograph of a scene including distance and object recognition taking advantage of the unique signatures of reflected sound waves of objects. The objective of this study is to design a novel device that mimics and advances human echolocation techniques and simplifies its teaching potential.

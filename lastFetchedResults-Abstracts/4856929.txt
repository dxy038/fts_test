In this paper, a new pulse width modulation switching strategy based on carrier amalgamation that provides maximum utilization of dc-link voltage in the linear region. The modified carrier is derived from the amalgamation of inverted sine and triangular carrier at the peak of reference sine waveform. The objective of the proposed strategy is to achieve enhanced fundamental voltage over wide output voltage range while improving THD. The performance of proposed modulation strategy is tested in single phase 11 level inverter in terms of fundamental component and total harmonic distortion (THD) through MATLAB/Simulink.

Color quantization reduces the number of the
colors in a color image, while the subsequent dithering operation
attempts to create the illusion of more colors with this reduced
palette. In quantization, the palette is designed to minimize the
mean squared error (MSE). However, the dithering that follows
enhances the color appearance at the expense of increasing the
MSE. We introduce three joint quantization and dithering algorithms
to overcome this contradiction. The basic idea is the same
in two of the approaches: introducing the dithering error to the
quantizer in the training phase. The fuzzy C-means (FCM) and the
fuzzy learning vector quantization (FLVQ) algorithms are used
to develop two combined mechanisms. In the third algorithm, we
minimize an objective function including an inter-cluster separation
(ICS) term to obtain a color palette which is more suitable for
dithering. The goal is to enlarge the convex hull of the quantization
colors to obtain the illusion of more colors after error diffusion.
The color contrasts of images are also enhanced with the proposed
algorithm. We test the results of these three new algorithms using
quality metrics which model the perception of the human visual
system and illustrate that substantial improvements are achieved
after dithering.

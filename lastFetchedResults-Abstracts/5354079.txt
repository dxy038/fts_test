The objective of this paper is to propose a mechanism for adaptive computation of multiple paths to transmit a large volume of data packets from a source s to a destination d in ad hoc wireless networks. We consider two aspects in this framework. The first aspect is to perform preemptive route re-discoveries before the occurrence of route errors while transmitting a large volume of data from s to d. Consequently, this helps find out dynamically a series of multiple paths in the temporal domain to complete the data transfer. The second aspect is to select multiple paths in the spatial domain for data transfer at any instant of time and to distribute the data packets in sequential blocks over those paths in order to reduce congestion and end-to-end delay. The performance of this approach has been evaluated to show the improvement in the quality of service. It has been observed that the mechanism allows any source to transmit a large volume of data to a destination without degradation of performance due to route errors. Additionally, it would help reduce significantly the end-to-end delay and the number of route-rediscoveries needed in this process

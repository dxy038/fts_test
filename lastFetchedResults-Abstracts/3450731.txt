This note concerns the applications of the modulating function method to the input-output relation y(t)= <img alt="\\int\\liminf {0}\\limsup {t}\\phi(t-s)u(s)ds" src="/images/tex/3904.gif"/> . The problem is to determine the coefficients c<inf>k</inf>in the differential equation <img alt="\\sum \\liminf {k=0}\\limsup {N}c_{k} \\phi^{(k)}(t)=0" src="/images/tex/3905.gif"/> from integral transforms of <img alt="y(t)" src="/images/tex/3668.gif"/> and <img alt="u(t)" src="/images/tex/53.gif"/> over a finite interval [ <img alt="0, T" src="/images/tex/3906.gif"/> ]. The main objective is to present a device which obtains the c<inf>k</inf>\Â´s via the inversion of a system of <img alt="N" src="/images/tex/88.gif"/> linear equations, whereas the straightforward approach leads to a system involving twice as many equations.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type 90 strains of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from clinical cases and from meat products in Italy in the period 1987â€“95. The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the genetic profiles to determine the existence of predominant clones and to evaluate their association with the sporadic cases of listeriosis reported in recent years in Italy. A total of 32 distinct PFGE types were identified: PFGE types 1 and 9 were identified both for strains isolated from clinical samples and those isolated from food. The use of the PFGE molecular method in surveillance projects and epidemiological investigations could contribute to better understanding of microbial populations and could also be useful, as part of the HACCP programme, in conducting controls along different points of the food production line.

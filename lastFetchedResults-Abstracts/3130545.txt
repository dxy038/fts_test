This paper presents a comprehensive method for evaluation of traffic movement organization planning which considers the impact to the environment. The latest studies indicated that the traffic management and control strategies with an objective to mitigate traffic congestions and with an objective to reduce traffic emissions are usually different and sometimes conflictive, so it is essential to consider the impacts of transportation on environment in the traffic movement organization planning. Fuel consumptions and pollutant emissions are selected as environmental evaluation indexes. The analysis flow of evaluation is described. Simulated by VISSIM, the study object´s vehicle running status data is output in database and used as CMEM model´s input files to calculate vehicle fuel consumptions and emissions. The microscopic traffic-emissions simulation platform integrated with the microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM and the modal emissions model CMEM is used to output the traffic and environmental evaluation index values for decision. The evaluation method is established by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine weights of the evaluating indicators and by taking the degree of gray incidence as the evaluation criteria. An empirical application demonstrates that the method of evaluation is feasible and it is totally different whether the environmental influence is considered in the planning or not.

Introduction: One of the most important services implemented by higher
education systems is the university outreach. The main objective of this
descriptive- survey research is to analyze strategies for successful
implementation of university outreach services as perceived by faculty
members of Iranian agricultural colleges.
Materials and Methods: The statistical population of the study consisted of
the faculty members of Iranian agricultural colleges (N=1799), out of whom
140 people included in statistical sample. Sample selection was done in two
stages: at first, applying stratified random sampling technique, 10 colleges
were selected from the total of 30 colleges, and then using proportional
stratified random sampling technique, 140 faculty members were selected
from these colleges. The Instrument of study was a questionnaire. To
measure the reliability of the questionnaire, Cranach Alpha coefficients were
calculated.
Results: Results of exploratory factor analysis revealed that four factors
explained about 64.29 percent of variations in the strategies for successful
implementation of university outreach services including: educational,
communicational, research, and creating opportunities factors.
Conclusion: This study showed that low level of attention is paid to
university outreach services in Iranian agricultural higher education system.
Therefore, results revealed by this study can improve successful
implementation of university outreach services.

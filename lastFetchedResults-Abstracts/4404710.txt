The cost and size of switched mode power supplies can be reduced by eliminating the measurement of inductor´s instantaneous current value. This paper discusses the implementation of current sensorless control algorithm for bidirectional half-bridge AC/DC converter that allows shaping inductor´s current without current sensor. The operation of half-bridge converter has been simplified to an equivalent single-switch model that simplifies implementation of a digital control system. The simulation results have confirmed the analytical assumptions and correctness of mathematical model.

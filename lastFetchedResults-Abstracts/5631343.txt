The aim of this paper is to analyze the path-coverage induced on a one-dimensional path by an area coverage process in a random sensor network and obtain the values in traceability of a wireless sensor network. In addition other measures have also been implemented such as breach and support. The objective of this paper is to estimate the position of a target as a function of time. In knowing that if a sensor network will sense a path of the target, possibly for tracking an object moving , as opposed to measure some attribute of the event. An Efficient algorithm is written to find the maximal breach and supporting paths. Therefore the sensor network, which is formed from a large number of randomly deployed sensor nodes, which have collected sensing data in cooperative manner, is used to route the results to an end user.

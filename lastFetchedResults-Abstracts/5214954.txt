With the objective of monitoring the water-uptake kinetics in anti-corrosion cataphoretic paintings, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) oscillator sensor was developed based on a 5 MHz AT resonator. The sensor was experimentally characterized with the aim of determining its own sensitivity, phase noise and resolution during the water uptake process. Water uptake of the coating was investigated using the sensor, and results were compared with electrochemical impedance measurements.

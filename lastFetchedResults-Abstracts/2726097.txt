An analysis of the critical inductance and capacitor voltage ripple of bidirectional Z-source was presented in this paper. Varying inductances were found to lead to different operational modes of the inverter. The critical inductance was derived. While the Z-source capacitor voltage ripple is traditionally considered to be independent of the inductance with large inductance, it was found that dependence exists when small inductors are used. The capacitor voltage ripple was also derived. These theoretical findings have been verified using both simulations and experimental results.

This paper presents an overview of a model product certification and test laboratory accreditation program for photovoltaic (PV) modules that was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Arizona State University. The specific objective of this project was to produce a document that details the equipment, facilities, quality assurance procedures, and technical expertise an accredited laboratory needs for performance and qualification testing of PV modules, along with the specific tests needed for a module design to be certified. Development of the document was done in conjunction with a criteria development committee consisting of representatives from 30 US PV manufacturers, end users, standards and codes organizations, and testing laboratories. The intent is to lay the groundwork for a future US PV certification and accreditation program that will be beneficial to the PV industry as a whole

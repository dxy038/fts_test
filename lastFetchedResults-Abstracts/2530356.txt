Background & Objective: Increasing population growth, and therefore, increasing requirements for development of the agricultural productions, lead to be overused the pesticides. So, their residues in environment, particularly surface and groundwater resources, create human health risks. Therefore due to the serious risk to human health, this study was carried out for assessing the diazinon residues in groundwater samples of Hamedan-Bahar Plain in 2014.
Material and Methods: Water samples were collected from 20 stations along the Hamedan-Bahar Plain in summer 2014. After preparation and processing the samples in the laboratory according to liquid phase extraction, diazinon residues in samples were determined using a spectrophotometric method in three replications. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 20 software using Kolmogrov-Smirnov, one-way ANOVA, One Sample T Test and  Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.
Results: The results showed that the mean concentration of diazinon residues in samples was 0.23±0.06 µg/mL-1, being upper than the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) provided by the WHO. 

Conclusion: Since based on WHO guideline the mean concentrations of diazinon residues in groundwater resources of Hamedan-Bahar Plain were upper than MCLs, therefore; exploitation of water for drinking has adverse effect on consumers' health. In this regards, concerning increased use of agricultural inputs especially pesticides, regular periodic monitoring of chemical pollutants content in groundwater resources of study area is recommended.

We present a framework for automated Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol generation based on a model that incorporates multiple MAC neighborhoods as well as acknowledgments. Both the advertisement and acknowledgment packets are automatically generated by an optimization program that is built based on symbolic Monte Carlo simulation. The design flow chain produces an optimal MAC protocol with respect to any desired objective function. The simulation results show that RTS/CTS control packets are automatically generated as the topology changes from single neighborhood to multi-neighborhood, and display fast convergence to the optimal solution within very reasonable computational time. This approach has the potential to change the way that MAC protocols are designed from "hand-designed protocols" to protocols designed via design automation chains.

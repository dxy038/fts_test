Objective: The aim of the current ‎study was to examine the ‎effectiveness of Barkley's parent ‎training program, working ‎memory training and the ‎combination of these two ‎interventions for children with ‎Attention deficit hyperactivity ‎disorder (ADHD)‎‏.‏
Methods: In this study, 36 ‎participants with ADHD (aged 6 ‎to 12 years) were selected by ‎convenience sampling. Revision ‎of the Swanson, Nolan and ‎Pelham (SNAP) questionnaire ‎‎(SNAP–IV), Child Behavior ‎Checklist (CBCL) and clinical ‎interviews were employed to ‎diagnose ADHD. Wechsler ‎Intelligence Scale for Children-‎Fourth Edition was also ‎implemented. The participants ‎were randomly assigned to the ‎three intervention groups of ‎Barkley's parent training ‎program, working memory ‎training and the combined group. ‎SNAP-IV and CBCL were used ‎as pre-tests and post-tests across ‎all three groups. Data were ‎analyzed using MANCOVA ‎‎(SPSS version18).‎
Results: There was a significant ‎difference (p <  0.05) in the ‎decline of attention deficit and ‎hyperactivity /impulsivity ‎symptoms between the ‎combined treatment group and ‎working memory training group ‎and also between the combined ‎treatment group and the parent ‎training group in SNAP. In terms ‎of attention problems ‎‎(experience-based subscales) of ‎CBCL, there was a significant ‎difference (p <  0.001) between ‎the combined treatment group ‎and working memory training ‎group. Furthermore, compared to ‎the working memory training and ‎parent training groups, the ‎combined group demonstrated a ‎significant decline (p <  0.01) in ‎clinical symptoms of ADHD ‎‎(based on DSM).‎
Conclusion: It was revealed that ‎combined treatment in ‎comparison with the other two ‎methods suppressed the clinical ‎symptoms of ADHD more ‎significantly.‎

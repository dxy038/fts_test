Fiber–metal laminates (FMLs) are structural composites developed for aeronautical applications. The application of FMLs to structures demands a deep knowledge of a wide set of properties, including fracture toughness. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of crack orientation on the fracture toughness (critical J-integral and CTOD δ5) of unidirectional FMLs. Small C(T) and SE(B) specimens with notches parallel and perpendicular to the fibers direction were tested. A study of the relation and equivalence between JC and δ5C, which heavily depend on the yield strength and on the stress state, was performed motivated by apparently contradictory experimental results. These results can be explained by the direction-dependent yielding properties of unidirectional FMLs. The best overall equivalence between JC and δ5C was obtained considering plane stress state and using the effective yield strength, both for unidirectional FMLs notched parallel and perpendicular to the fibers direction.

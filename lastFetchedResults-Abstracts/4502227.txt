In this article we focus on the problem of assessing individuals in the group or team of learning and therefore this should lead to the evaluation of the group or the team itself as a learning entity. We distinguish between the concepts of group and team in function of parameters such as membership (sense of belonging that is strong in teams) and cohesion (harmony sought to carry out work). Lots of problems at the level the device of distant learning is the absence of possibilities for structuring and planning of the evaluation activity. Hence the lack of consideration of susceptible scenarios to be exploited in testing situations to reap the maximum of indicators that will help a more objective assessment knowing that any evaluation system is afraid of being subjecttive. To do so, we propose an extension of the IMS-LD meta-model to better support assessment activities thanks to workflow management systems considering four aspects: organizational, functional, behavioral and informational.

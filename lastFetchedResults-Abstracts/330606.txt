Objective:  Reaction layer structure of the titanium castings surface was investigated when a new centrifuge-vacuum-pressure cast titanium machine and a zirconite inner investment was used.

Methods: The micro-hardness of titanium castings was measured using a Knoop's hardness tester. The structure of reaction layers and the distribution of elements on the surfaces of titanium castings were analysed by SEM and EDS, respectively, when zirconite was used as the inner investment for cast titanium.

Results: Knoop's micro-hardness at distances of 50 and 75 μm from the titanium casting surfaces made directly in phosphate investment molds had significantly harder surfaces than those made in zirconite coating molds. The thickness of the reaction layer on the surface of titanium castings was <35 μm with zirconite coating and was >50 μm without zirconite coating. The structure of reaction layer was divided into four layers from the outer surface to the inner including: sintering layer, α-Case, Si-rich layer, acicular crystal structure. The distribution of elements was different on each layer.

Significance: The thickness of the cast titanium reaction layer was reduced when the wax patterns were coated with zirconite. The surface of the titanium castings was smooth and without cracks, and the investment on the surface of titanium castings was easily removed.

Abstract
Introduction: Nowadays, Silica nano particles are used in various industries such as ceramics, glass, steel, gypsum and in pigment and catalysts, cosmetics, drugs, magnetic compounds, thermal damper and varnishes. If used in an uncontrolled manner and enter sewage system, these small and useful particles may be changed to one of the toxic substances for living organisms in aquatic ecosystems even zooplanktons that after phytoplanktons are in the second level of food chains and plays an important role.
Objective: This study investigates the toxicity of these particles for Daphnia magna that is one of the crustacean zooplankton in fresh water.
Materials and Methods: In this study, the experimental concentrations were 0.5, 1.6, 5.0, 15.8, 50.0 and 100 mg/L with three replicates for each treatment. The effects of these nanoparticles were studied and recorded during each 24 hour interval. The experimental period was 96 hours and OECD method was used for toxicity examination. The toxicity factors were calculated based on probit value.
Results: LC50 of this nanoparticle for Daphnia magna was found to be 1.73 mg/L. Also, NOEC and LOEC value was 0.173 mg/l.
Conclusion: Based on the results, silica nanoparticles have toxic effects on daphni at low concentrations

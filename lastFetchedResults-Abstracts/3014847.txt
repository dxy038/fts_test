The objective of mixed macro and standard cell placement is to arrange components on a chip such that the resultant layout area and interconnection wire lengths are minimal. A common approach is to divide the problem into separate macro cell and standard cell placement problems. However, this approach ignores the relationships between the macro and standard cells, which can affect the quality of the final solution. This paper describes a genetic algorithm that uses the relationship information to determine a more efficient placement solution.

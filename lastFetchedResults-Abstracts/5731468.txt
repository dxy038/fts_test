This paper describes the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, FLUENT, to model friction stir welding process. The objective is to investigate the material flow across the welding joint of material that has been friction stir welded. This will further describe and give better understanding of material properties during friction stir welding process. This paper describes flow around cylindrical tool in 2D using multiple rotating reference frame solver.

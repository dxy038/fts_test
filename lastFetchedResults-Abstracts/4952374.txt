This paper investigates the problem of finding two link-disjoint paths in mesh networks. Different from traditional studies, such as MIN-SUM, MIN-MAX, and MIN-MIN, the objective in this paper is to minimize the end-to-end failure probability, or equivalently, maximize the survivability under multiple link failures. We refer to this problem as MAX-SURV. Solving MAX-SURV provides 100% protection against single failure while maximizing the survivability under multiple failures. We prove that this problem is NP-complete, and we propose a heuristic algorithm for finding a solution. The corresponding upper bound and lower bound for given networks are also found. The time efficiency of the algorithms is analyzed, and the performance of the algorithms is evaluated through simulation.

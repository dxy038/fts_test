The objective of this paper is to provide information about solid phase extraction (SPE) as an alternative to liquidâ€“liquid extraction of amines from several matrices. Different sorbents ranging from non-polar phases, such as C18 silica to more polar such as cyanopropylsilica (CN) have been tested for analysis of aliphatic amines as monoamines, diamines and polyamines. Phenylalkylamines such as amphetamine or methamphetamine and heterocyclic amines such as histamine or cephalosporins (which also contain a carboxylic group), have also been studied. The different steps involved in the extraction procedure have been tested (conditioning, retention, pre-concentration, washing and elution) in order to obtain extracts free of interferences and enough sensitivity. C18 silica (100 mg) was selected as optimal phase with recoveries nearly of 100%. The elution of more polar amines was performed in acidic conditions while less polar amines required organic solvents. Cephalosporin retention was performed in acid condition by using disk cartridges EM C18, which gave better selectivity. The optimised clean-up procedures have been discussed to the quantification of the corresponding amines in real samples (urine, water and beer). The accuracy and precision were outlined.

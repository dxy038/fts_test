A system that would harness the brainpower of vast numbers of humans and orchestrate their efforts could be used to solve hard problems that are beyond the reach of computational methods. This paper describes such a system. This system will use a recursive problem solving life cycle model based on a continuously evolving distributed supply chain infrastructure. The problems to be addressed using this system are &#8220;wicked&#8221;-that is, they have no definitive formulation, no absolute answer, and objective definition of equity. The problem solving infrastructure must continuously evolve and adapt, as does the community of stakeholders that enact it, concomitant with their developing understanding of the problem and its solutions. The system defined here provides an effective, repeatable mechanism for using mass collaboration to address wicked problems. This paper discusses the motivation, system architecture, and future directions.

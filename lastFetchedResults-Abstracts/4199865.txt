This letter describes a measuring system developed to investigate time and frequency variant impedances. The proposed measurement set-up is designed to determine complex input impedances of coaxial resonators generating plasma at the upper part of the inner conductor. The main objective is to measure the input impedance before, during and after the process of plasma generation.

ABSTRACT: The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with multiple modes (MRCPSP) is an extension of the well-known single-mode RCPSP and involves the selection of a time/resource combination for each activity such that the total project makespan is minimized This research has made use of the Bees Algorithm to solve the reputed multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) that has two objective and called bi-objective and the result revealed that this population based algorithm performed good enough.

In this paper, two algorithms have been developed for allocation and size determination of Active Power Filters (APF) in power systems. In the first algorithm, the objective is to minimize harmonic voltage distortion. The objective in the second algorithm is to minimize the new APF injection currents while satisfying harmonic standards. Genetic algorithm is proposed for these two optimization problems. The simulation results for an 18-bus system show the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm for these two optimization problems.

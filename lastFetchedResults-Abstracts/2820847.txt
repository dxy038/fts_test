It is expected that cognitive Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication will be indispensable in near future. Moreover, M2M networks must be Internet Protocol (IP) enabled for ubiquitous connectivity. Recently, IETF has standardized RPL (Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks), which is expected to be the standard routing protocol for majority of M2M applications. Our objective in this paper is to enhance RPL for cognitive radio enabled M2M networks. Our enhanced protocol provides novel modifications to RPL in order to address the routing challenges in cognitive radio environments along with protecting the primary users as well as meeting the utility requirements of secondary network. The proposed protocol is evaluated through system level simulation studies.

The new stake in design today is to examine the global purpose of the design activities. In this perspective, project design management not only consists in allocating resources but also in stimulating collaboration among the actors involved in the project. Objective is to increase the performance of design teams. In this paper, we focus on factors influencing performance of the design process. Elements of the design performance are identified and an integrated product-process-organisation model is developed to manage design process. UML models of a prototype of software integrating this model to help decision makers and an example of specific GUI are also provided

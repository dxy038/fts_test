The major objective of paper is to contribute to solve of problems of machining (technological operation &#8212; turning) of wood plastic composite (material with natural reinforcement and matrix from plastic). During turning with tools with big nose radius and positive geometry, the spindle speed n (from 450 min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 1400 min<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and feed rate f (from 0.1 to 0.61 mm) were changed. Output from measured data (Rvk, Rk, Rpk, Mr, and Mr<inf>2</inf> probability descriptors) is Abbott-Firestone curve.

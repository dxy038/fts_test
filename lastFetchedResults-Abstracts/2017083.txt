The main objective of the present work is enhancement of the performance of gas hydrate kinetic inhibitors in the presence of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polypropylene oxide (PPO) for simple gas hydrate formation in a flow mini-loop apparatus. PEO and PPO are high molecular weight polymers that are not kinetic inhibitors by their self. For this investigation, a laboratory flow mini-loop apparatus was set up to measure the induction time and rate of gas hydrate formation when a hydrate-forming substance (such as C1, C3, CO2 and i-C4) is contacted with water containing dissolved inhibitor in presence or absence of PEO or PPO under suitable temperature and pressure conditions. In each experiment, water containing inhibitors blend saturated with pure gas is circulated up to a required pressure. Pressure is maintained at a constant value during experimental runs by means of required gas make-up. The effect of PEO and PPO on induction time and gas consumption during hydrate formation is investigated in the presence or absence of PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) and l-tyrosine as kinetic inhibitors. Results were shown that the induction time is prolonged in the presence of PEO or PPO compared to the inhibitor only. Inclusion of PPO into a kinetic hydrate inhibitor solution shows a higher enhancement in its inhibiting performance compare to PEO. Thus, the induction time for simple gas hydrate formation in presence of kinetic hydrate inhibitor with PPO is higher, compare to kinetic hydrate inhibitor with PEO.

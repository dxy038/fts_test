The features and organization of a hardware architecture that is designed to facilitate the real-time display and manipulation of a single three-dimensional object on a raster-scan video display are briefly summarized. The author then outlines the major features of an extension to the architecture that will permit the high-speed display and manipulation of multiple, independent, shaded three-dimensional objects represented as a voxel (volume-element) database with gray scale. The objective is to provide many useful capabilities at or near video rates facilitating extensive real-time interaction. The architecture is highly modular, permitting a cost tradeoff to be made to achieve a given level of performance. It also includes a great deal of regularity in its structure, making it directly suitable for VLSI implementation. A key feature is that no computational operations more complex than adds, shifts, and comparisons are required in real time. The display characteristics for each object are controlled by a concise object descriptor table, which contains all of the control parameters required to process that object.

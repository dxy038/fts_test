E-learning has become very popular in higher education institutions. Various educational technologies are being used to deliver courses and one of the most popular is e-learning. It is thus imperative that educators research on the perception of students toward e-learning in order to study the effectiveness of such offerings. The objective of the paper is to highlight a research carried out in a private university in Indonesia where students were exposed to e-learning from the beginning of their studies. It was believed that a study of studentsÂ´ perceptions towards e-learning was necessary so as to evaluate the receptiveness towards e-learning. The study was conducted after two semesters of use of e-learning. There were three main research questions: (1) What are the benefits and drawbacks of e-learning, (2) What did students liked or disliked about e-learning, (3) What other features should be included in e-learning. Among the findings include students reporting that the most useful feature of e-learning was that it enabled increased access opportunities to the course materials irrespective of where they were (on or off campus). Students also found that it was easier to submit their assignments via e-learning. They also suggested additional features, that were, interestingly, were associated with those of social media.

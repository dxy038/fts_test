This paper generalizes the newly developed DSC-Element method for free vibration analysis of skew plates using the first-order shear deformable plate theory. Basically, the DSC-Element method not only embraces the discrete singular convolution (DSC) delta type wavelet kernel as a trial function with the Ritz principle, but also incorporates the concept of the finite element method. The current approach is novel and flexible as contrast to the global numerical methods in treating the complex kinematic supporting edges. The objective of this paper is to examine the efficiency and validity of the DSC-Element method for oblique plates having large skew angles. Parametric studies for the vibration analysis of skew plates with various skew angles, thickness ratios, aspect ratios and continuous or discontinuous periphery supports are presented as well. The natural frequencies are directly compared and discussed with those reported in the open literature. Some frequency solutions for skew plates with mixed edge conditions are also presented.

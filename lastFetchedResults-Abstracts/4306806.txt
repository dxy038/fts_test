For the mass demands of wireless communication services, the mobile location technologies have drawn much attention around the world. In wireless communication, one of the main problems with accurate location is nonline of sight (NLoS) propagation. To solve the problem, we present a new location algorithm with clustering technology by utilizing the geometrical feature of cell layout, time of arrival range measurements, and three base stations. The mobile location is estimated by solving the optimal solution of the objective junction based on the high density cluster. Simulations study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm for different NLoS error distributions and various upper bound of NLoS error. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is significantly more effective in location accuracy than range scaling algorithm, linear lines of position algorithm, and Taylor series algorithm, and also satisfies the location accuracy demand of E-911.

Diverse advanced oxidation process (AOP) techniques applying UV, TiO2/UV, O3 and O3/UV were used to degrade pollutants contained in tannery wastewater. The total mineralization of these pollutants is desirable, but it is quite energy consuming and sometimes impossible. Therefore the objective was to achieve an enhancement of biodegradability, preferentially with a decrease in toxicity in parallel. This work demonstrates that the dominant pollutants were chemically degraded by oxidation, while changes in carbon content were only marginal. These results were obtained monitoring the total organic carbon content (TOC), chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD and BOD), and substance-specific pollutant content by application of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC–MS). Daphnia magna toxicity testing performed in parallel proved a decrease in toxicity after AOP treatment of the tannery wastewater.

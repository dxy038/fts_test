Objective:  The present paper investigates the existing services offerd by digital libraries in Iran and around the world in order to introduce proposed services for Iranian digital libraries
Methodoloy: A comparative and adaptive method was used. The necessary information on services offered by digital libraries surveyed were gleaned from their websites
Findings:  Services offered in 59 (11 Iranian and 48 non-Iranian) digital libraries were studied. Services offered included contact, indexes, news, and remote membership, FAQ, “Ask-a-Librarian”, RSS, My Library and Online Chat.  Among Iranian digital libraries, “search” was the most common service complied with and “Ask-a-Librarian” was the least service. None offered contact, indexes, news, RSS and online chat. Among digital libraries abroad, the most prevalent service was “Search” while “My Library” was the least. Proposed services for Iranian Digital Libraries are suggested.

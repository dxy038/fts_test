Weed interference with the growth and yield of corn plants is affected by both mechanical and chemical means of weed control. Recently, corn hybrids accumulating more leaf area, maturing earlier, yielding better in narrower row spacings and tolerating higher plant populations better than conventional hybrids have been developed. Because of more rapid leaf area accumulation during the earliest stages of canopy development and overall canopy architecture, they may be more susceptible to damage due to mechanical weed control. The objective of this study was to assess the response of corn hybrids with a wide range of canopy architectures to chemical and mechanical (rotary hoeing) weed control, with an emphasis on quantifying morphology and grain yield responses. Field experiments were conducted in 1997 and 1998 at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec. Three hybrids were tested: leafy reduced-stature (LRS1 and LRS2), and the conventional hybrid Pioneer 3979 (P3979). Rotary hoeing alone had very little effect, while herbicide application reduced the interference of weeds with growth and grain yield of all hybrids. Hybrid P3979 had more total leaf area than LRS1 and LRS2, but the percentage of leaf area above the ear was much higher for LRS hybrids (70 %) than for P3979 (51 %). Generally, LRS hybrids were much shorter with more leaf area above the ear than P3979, contributing to the large differences in canopy architecture between the LRS hybrids and P3979. However, morphology and grain yield response of hybrids to rotary hoeing and herbicide weed control was not different, indicating that the new hybrids were not more susceptible to damage caused by mechanical weed control than a corn hybrid with a conventional canopy architecture.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic diagnoses made from a placental biopsy specimen compared with diagnoses made from a complete placental examination.
STUDY DESIGN: Biopsy was performed on 200 singleton placentas with a 16-gauge Rutner biopsy needle shortly after delivery. The biopsy specimens and placentas were evaluated by standard placental pathologic criteria.
RESULTS: The presence of villous edema on the biopsy specimen led to the diagnosis of placental villous edema with a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 86%, yielding a positive predictive value of 0.97. The sensitivity of the biposy diagnosis of “increased syncytial knots” was 86%, whereas the specificity was 82%, yielding a positive predictive value of 0.90.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of placental biopsy specimen after delivery is reasonably sensitive for diagnosing villous abnormalities that reflect acute and chronic stresses to the placenta, it may be useful to develop a placental biopsy that can be performed safely during pregnancy. Such a biopsy could be the basis for the rational treatment of some diseases of pregnancy.

Today, the development of telecommunications infrastructure has led to rapid exchange of data between the distribution network components and the control center. On the other hand, renewable energy sources (RES) are increasing due to deregulation and restructuring in power systems, global warming and reduction of fossil fuels .These sources are connected to the distribution network therefore behavior of these networks will change. One of the most important problems is the optimal operation of the distribution network including renewable energy sources. Optimal operation of distribution network is a mixed integer, nonlinear and multi-objective problem. Therefore in this paper, binary particle swarm optimization and fuzzy set theory are used for solved the problem. Finally, a practical distribution test system is used to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

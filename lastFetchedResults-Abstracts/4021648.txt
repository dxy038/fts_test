This letter presents two novel power allocation schemes for bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying over Rayleigh fading channels through the exploitation of channel mean strength. The first scheme aims to maximize the upper bound of average sum rate, and the other aims to achieve the trade-off of outage probability between two terminals. Numerical results show considerable performance improvement in comparison with conventional power allocation approaches.

The objective of the Molecularized FM Telemetry Program was to provide more reliable FM subcarrier oscillators that have reduced size, weight, and power consumption. Both conventional circuit functional electronic block oscillators and the more truly molecular drift field oscillator were considered. The molecular drift field oscillator was selected. The final design for the oscillators required only one power supply (+28V). In addition, the design approaches the goal of a single design for all of the oscillators in that a standardized design for the input amplifier, feedback amplifier, output amplifier, and regulator was achieved using only one type of general purpose epitaxial monolith. Using this design, five subcarrier oscillators operating over IRIG band 11, <img src="/images/tex/12325.gif" alt="A, C, E"/> , and <img src="/images/tex/12326.gif" alt="H\\ast"/> (7kc/s to 165kc/s) were successfully built and tested. The feasibility of operation over -20&#176;C to +80&#176;C was shown. In addition, the five oscillators were operated together driving a linear mixer with no intermodulation effects. These molecular oscillators have a volume that is one-ninth, weight that is one-fourteenth, and power dissipation that is one-half to one-third that of conventional transistorized FM oscillators.

The model developed for predicting the polarimetric bistatic scattering characteristics from statistically rough surfaces in this paper is based upon the integral equation model with multiple scattering. For better understanding the scattering behavior from randomly rough surfaces, the information about scattering must be known omnidirectionally, not just in the specular or backscatter direction. The objective of this paper is to examine the bistatic scattering characteristics from randomly rough surfaces along the different azimuth angles. Comparisons between the model prediction and the experimental measurements are made for both like and cross polarizations. This model prediction demonstrates good agreement with experimental data

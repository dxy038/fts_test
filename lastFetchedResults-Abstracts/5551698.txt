This paper suggests a hybrid, vertical configuration of multi-bladed and multi-stage (multi-S) Savonius rotors for capturing and storing wind energy. The intended hybrid design is expected to provide small- or near-medium-sized wind turbine of unique design in terms of the gained energy and speed factors. The whole system is dedicated for stand-alone power plants. Integration of wind power into electricity generation is associated with some challenges as wind power generation is known by its fluctuating nature. The operation philosophy here is based on continual storing of wind energy into temporal energy storage systems. This paper is pioneering in developing a bidirectional process by which storing and expanding energy take place simultaneously or separately. A continual energy storing goes forward by a mechanically-actuated compressor in order to compress air into air tanks which is simultaneously providing air expanders by the necessary energy. These expanders concurrently generate electricity and/or produce hydrogen and nitrogen. Pumping air into storage by using a wind turbine is normally done at high delivered torques rather than high speeds, while electricity generation finds most of its impact at relatively high speeds. A conflict is then exists which adds more complexity to the system operation in addition to the wind and load fluctuation problems. This paper suggests a solution to this problem by the integration of four storage facilities in order to realize a consistent, sustainable electricity generation, pumping air into air storage and generating hydrogen and nitrogen.

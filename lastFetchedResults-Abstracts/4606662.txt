We study the non-cooperative game when many WLAN stations compete for responses from WLAN access points in order to find their positions. The main objective of the WLAN stations, which are the players in our game, is to minimize the positioning error under various constraints on power consumption and network throughput. We provide a rigorous and general formulation of the game model where we use the Cramer-Rao bound of the WLAN positioning error so that the analysis is independent of the underlying positioning algorithm. The strategies for each player are combinations of the frequency of probe requests within the network and the corresponding listening time. We compute the Nash Equilibrium for the game under different practical network scenarios.

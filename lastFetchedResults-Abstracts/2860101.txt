This paper presents the theoretical analysis followed by experimental investigation of a bidirectional LCL-CPT system, where voltage-control is used for the regulation of the transferred power. The system uses an Air Core Transformer, which is a loosely coupled system, where SiC MOSFETs have been experimentally tested to push the frequency up to 110 kHz. The issues rising from the combination of the voltage-controlled LCL-CPT system are underlined and validated through the experimental prototype. In addition, an appropriate control scheme is presented and various control aspects regarding the implementation of the voltage-control are pointed out.

Background and Objective: Several studies have been performed to achieve a scaffold for growing stem cells. The purpose of the study was to provide a biodegradable scaffold of chitosan - poly ethylene oxide (PEO) with the ability for growing, proliferation, un-differentiation and apoptosis of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).

Materials and Methods: First, formation of chitosan-PEO nanofibers composed of 90 to 10 and 80 to 20 per electro technique were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM). These scaffolds were located on 1% gelatin in 24-well plates and were then steriled. Femoral BMSCs of rats were cultured on scaffolds after two passages from the house empty plate as controls. BMSCs proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were studied in days II, IV and VI.

Results: The results showed that the morphology of cells was maintained on scaffolds similar to controls. The rate of cell proliferation on the scaffold on consecutive days increased in cultured cells of control group but the differences were not significant. The results also showed that at the end of the six days, BMSCs differentiation and the percentage of cell death on the scaffold were similar with cultured cells in control group.

Conclusion: Proliferation, un-differentiation and no apoptosis of BMSCs on biodegradable chitosan-PEO nanofiber are obtained as a model that can be used in tissue engineering and cell therapy.

A two-switch cycloconverter circuit that converts single-phase alternating current into an effective three-phase alternating current is presented. Since this design features only two bidirectional switches, it has a simple and inexpensive construction. The design requires a control circuit, which assures that the average output voltage on its two switches is sinusoidal with a 60&#176; difference in phase. The results of some simulation studies and an experimental model of the two-switch cycloconverter are discussed. Some problems and potential areas of circuit improvement are presented

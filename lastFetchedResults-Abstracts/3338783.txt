In this paper, energy saving of two-tier network: macrocells overlaid by randomly distributed picos is considered. A pico on/off algorithm based on offload bandwidth is proposed to save energy and improve the energy efficiency. Pico on/off selection will be triggered when the traffic load of macro base station (BS) exceeds thresholds. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the number of active picos. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can save more energy compared with state of the art scheme.

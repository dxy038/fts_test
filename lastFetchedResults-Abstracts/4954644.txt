The &#949; constrained method is an algorithm transformation method, which can convert algorithms for unconstrained problems to algorithms for constrained problems using the &#949; level comparison, which compares search points based on the pair of objective value and constraint violation of them. We have proposed the &#949; constrained differential evolution (&#949;DE), which is the combination of the &#949; constrained method and differential evolution (DE). It has been shown that the &#949;DE can run very fast and can find very high quality solutions. Also, we proposed the &#949;DE with gradient-based mutation (&#949;DEg), which utilized gradients of constraints in order to solve problems with difficult constraints. In this study, we propose the &#949; constrained DE with an archive and gradient-based mutation (&#949;DEag). The &#949;DEag utilizes an archive to maintain the diversity of individuals and adopts a new way of selecting the &#949; level control parameter in the &#949;DEg. The 18 problems, which are given in special session on &#8220;Single Objective Constrained RealParameter Optimization&#8221; in CEC2010, are solved by the &#949;DEag and the results are shown in this paper.

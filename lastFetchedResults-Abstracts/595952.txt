introduction The pelvis is the central part of the body that receives the weight from the vertebral column and transfers it to the lower extremities. It protects the internal organs with its specific structure and shape. Objective The study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of emergency non-surgical and surgical treatment of such patients, to analyze the types and severity of complications and final functional outcome. Material and methods We present a series of 47 patients treated in the period between 1999 and 2009 at the Traumatology Clinic, CHC Banja Luka. According to Marvin Tile's classification, fractures were distributed as follows: Type A fractures occurred in 19 patients (40.6%), Type B in 18 (38.1%) and Type C in 10 (21.3%). 30 patients (63.8%) were polytraumatised, with craniocerebral injuries in 12 patients (25.5%), chest cavity injuries in 5 (10.6%) and abdominal organ injuries in 13 patients (27.6%). 27 patients (57.4%) had clinical and laboratory signs of hemorrhagic shock on admission, while 26 patients (56.2%) received conservative treatment and 21 patients (43.8%) were treated using surgical methods of stabilization of the pelvic ring. Results The analysis of the outcomes of treating pelvic ring fractures in our series of patients by using radiography (x-rays according to Slatis) showed that out of 47 treated patients, the outcomes were excellent in 28 (60%), good in 7 (15%), fair in 5 (12%) and poor in 7 (14%). The functional outcomes in all patients were evaluated according to the D'Aubigne-Postel scale, on average 18 months after the trauma. The outcomes were excellent in 22 patients (45%), good in 15 (31%), fair in 4 (9%) and poor in 6 (14%). The chi-square test showed that there was no significant statistical difference between the outcomes monitored using x-rays and functional outcomes monitored using the D'Aubigne-Postel scale (p=0.097). The surgical treatment efficiency coefficient was introduced for the purpose of comparative evaluation of treatment outcomes. The surgical treatment efficiency coefficient, compared with conservative treatment, showed that all evaluated parameters were between 1.56 and 16.33 times lower in surgical treatment, which represents the more favorable outcome. Conclusion We can conclude that conservative treatment is the treatment of choice for Tile's Type A fractures, external fixator for treating Type B fractures (including all subtypes), and internal fixation, as mono therapy or in combination with external fixator, for treating Type C2 and Type C3 fractures. Surgical treatment, compared with conservative treatment, allows faster mobilisation of the patient and it shortens the recovery period, which in turn lowers the total treatment costs.

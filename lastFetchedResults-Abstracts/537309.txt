The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of blood meal (BM) on carnosine (L-Car) and anserine (L-Ans) content in the chicken breast muscle (CBM). In Experiment 1,384 Ross® broiler chicks of 1 d old were assigned to 3 dietary treatments: 100% basal diet (BM-0), 95% basal diet+5% BM (BM-5), and 90% basal diet + 10% BM (BM-10). In Experiment 2, 144 Ross® broiler chicks of 1 d old were fed BM-treated diets, including 0% BM (BMI-0), 5% BM (BMI-5), and 10% BM (BMI-10), with isocalorie and isonitrogen adjustment. Broilers were reared in stainless steel cages for 5 wk in both experiments. In Experiment 1, the content of L-Car and L-Arg increased as the birds aged. The increase was quadratic in L-Car and linear in L-Ans. The content of L-Car linearly (P<0.01) increased as the level of BM increased at wk 4 and 5, but there was no significant difference between BM-5 and BM-10 treatment. Conversely, the content of L-Ans linearly (P<0.01) decreased as the level of BM increased at wk 1, 3, 4, and 5. In Experiment 2, the content of L-Car and L-Arg showed quadratic increase as the birds aged. The content of L-Car showed a significant (P< 0.01) negative quadratic response as the level of BM increased at wk 1, 3, and 5. The content of L-Ans showed a significant (P<0.05) positive quadratic response as the level of BM increased at wk 3 and 5. The growth performances were not significantly affected by treatments in Experiment 1; in Experiment 2, however, a linear decrease (P< 0.01) in feed intake and weight gain, and a linear increase (P<0.01) in feed conversion ratio were observed as the BM was increased. In conclusion, addition of 5% BM in broiler diet increases the L-Car but not L-Ans in CBM.

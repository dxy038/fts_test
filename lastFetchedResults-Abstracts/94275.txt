Subjective evaluation by human observers is usually used to analyze and select an edge detector parametric setup when real-world images are considered. We propose a statistical objective performance analysis and detector parameter selection, using detection results produced by different detector parameters. Using the correspondence between the different detection results, an estimated best edge map, utilized as an estimated ground truth (EGT), is obtained. This is done using both a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and a Chi-square test, and considers the trade off between information and noisiness in the detection results. The best edge detector parameter set (PS) is then selected by the same statistical approach, using the EGT. Results are demonstrated for several edge detection techniques, and compared to published subjective evaluation results. The method developed here suggests a general tool to assist in practical implementations of parametric edge detectors where an automatic process is required.

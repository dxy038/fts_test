It is pointed out that airline deregulation and associated cost factors have increased the operational need for airspace users and providers of the air traffic control (ATC) service to define new methods of providing airspace operational improvements. Some of these improvements will result from the use of integrated traffic flow planning and management systems that dynamically adapt to the changing operational environment. The authors describe the development and application of new technology and concepts that meet the challenges of providing improved airspace utilization that is integrated with users´ operational needs and ATC system capabilities. Examples of the use of simulation and modeling in the air transportation system that consists of the users and ATC providers are presented. It is pointed out that the ATC providers have as the primary objective safety followed by the optimal use of airspace resources. The users´ system seeks to maximize operational efficiency, which translates to economic performance. A users´ flight planning system only considers single aircraft in the planning. This points to the need for increased integration of the user and ATC systems from the system perspective. This translates to a total system objective of providing the best operational condition for an airspace user in the presence of competition between users for system resources

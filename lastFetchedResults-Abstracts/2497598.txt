The prime objective of the current study was to comparative the impact of game and pharmacotherpay upon the development of the attention span and gross motor skills in children suffering from ADHD. Amongst the 65 children diagnosed with ADHD, 45 were randomly selected and divided in 4 groups on the basis of their age and the results of given pretests conducted via Ulrichâ€™s test and KLT ticking mini-test. These four groups included the control group, the game therapy group, the pharmacotherpay group, and the combined game and pharmacotherpay group. The game therapy group was then subjected to eighteen 45-minute-long sessions of games selected from "sport for all program" designed by American Institution of Human Kinetics. The pharmacotherpay group was subjected to a six-week-long medication-based treatment prescribed by a specialist, and the combined game and pharmacotherpay group were simoltunuously subjected to both therapeutic strategies. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data. The findings indicated that both combined game and pharmacotherapy and game therapy strategies could significantly improve the attention span and motor skills of children with ADHD, whereas pharmacotherpay alone could solely develop the attention span of these children. Based on the findings oft he present research, it is strongly recommended that a combined game and pharmacotherapeutical strategy be applied to ensure the efficient improvement of attention span and motor skills in children with ADHD.

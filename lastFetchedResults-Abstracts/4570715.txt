Classification systems optimization is often performed with population based genetic algorithms. These methods are known for their efficacy on solving these problems, but are associated to a high computational burden with classification systems. This paper evaluates an annealing based approach to optimize a classification system, and compares results obtained with a multi-objective genetic algorithm in the same problem. Experiments conducted with isolated handwritten digits demonstrate the effectiveness of the annealing based approach, which encourages further research in this direction.

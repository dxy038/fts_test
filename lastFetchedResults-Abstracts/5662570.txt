In this paper, a modified resistively loaded wire-bow is designed for impulse ground-penetrating radar applications. The new bow-tie is improved in terms of VSWR and band width. The improvements are achieved by tapering the arms and applying genetic algorithm to choose the optimum parameters for the tapered configuration. Curving arms is designed to decrease the reflection at the drive point, which in turn increases energy radiated to the ground. Genetic algorithm is applied to find the optimum curved antenna parameters. The objective function is composed of broadband performance and VSWR which constitutes a multi-objective optimization problem. The genetic algorithm is used to find, the optimal parameters for the antenna, i.e., resistive loads, loadsÂ´ locations, number of arms and angular distances between arms. The performance of the proposed antenna is validated in terms of bandwidth and VSWR. Simulation results are presentated to validate the effectiveness of the new antenna as compared with those antennas previously reported in the literatures.

This work presents a new hybrid method to compute boundaries of power flow feasible region, which is pertinent to static voltage stability analysis. The hybrid method is derived from a ´predictor-corrector´ framework. It converts the problem into an optimization problem, whose objective is to determine the minimum distance from an external point to the boundary of the feasible region. The proposed hybrid method can reduce the computation dimension in comparison with using ´predictor-corrector´ method. In addition to visualizing boundaries in two dimension space, the method can be utilized as a powerful tool to compute the closest boundary point associated with a specific operating point. It also can be used to compute the operating limit of facilities. In order to handle concave topology on the boundary, a modification of hybrid method is also proposed. Numerical simulations on two systems illustrate that the hybrid method is reliable and effective in terms of computing the boundaries of power flow feasible region.

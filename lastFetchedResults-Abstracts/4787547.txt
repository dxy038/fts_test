This paper describes the validation of the enlisted grade model gradebreaks and describes a current application of simulation in operations research. The enlisted grade model is part of a suite of models used by army strength analysts to forecast active army strength to develop the Active Army Military Manpower Program and for use in the PresidentÂ´s Budget and the Program Objective Memorandum. The enlisted grade model gradebreaks were tested by predictive validation, comparison to the Military Occupational Specialty Level System and face validity before acceptance. The validation of the enlisted grade gradebreaks was the final milestone in the acceptance of the enlisted grade model.

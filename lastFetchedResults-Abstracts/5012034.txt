Even though an analogue high-pass single pole filter with 0.05 Hz cut-off has been used for decades to define the low frequency response of electrocardiographs, in recent years the requirements for diagnostic quality ECG recordings have been expressed in terms of the system magnitude characteristic and its response to a rectangular pulse. The objective of this work is to design an analogue high-pass filter for the front-end of an ECG monitoring system directly from these new specifications. A constrained numerical optimisation procedure is implemented to determine the parameters of second and third order filters having the best rejection properties allowed by the requirements for distortion-free ECG recording. The outcome of the process, aimed at maximising the filter 3 dB point, is a system having better attenuation characteristics than the reference 0.05 Hz first order filter. The cut-off frequency of the optimised second order filter is indeed equal to 0.068 Hz, whereas for the third order system the 3 dB point can be as high as 0.123 Hz.

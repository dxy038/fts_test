With the policy of "plant and network separation, electricity price bidding" carrying out, the maximum profit is pursued, and the rule of maximum power generation energy in the past is substituted by the power generation benefit in the electric power market. The time-varying electricity price policy is analyzed and a optimal operation model is established. The model takes the maximum annual power generation benefit and the maximum output of the minimal output stage in the year as the objectives, and ecological water requirement, water quantity balance, reservoir storage, reservoir discharge flow and output as the constraints. A multi-objective chaotic genetic optimization algorithm (MCGOA) is put forward to solve the model. An example is given to prove the advantages and efficiency.

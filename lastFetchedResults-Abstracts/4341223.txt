Electric utility industry is currently facing a market deregulated environment and many technological advances. In this context, the demand for electric power having higher network security, better power quality, improved system reliability, and availability is increasing every day. This complex scenario put the electric utilities under conflicting pressure between meeting the growth demands, reducing its operation cost, keeping maintenance and construction and try to provide lower rates for customers or to improve the company profits. Therefore, solutions for planning, design and operation of power systems involve the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, often conflicting between them. This work presents the state of the art of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms applications to electrical power systems, in order to provide the power system engineering community with the expertise about the development of multi-objective optimization paradigms and trends in the applications of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, altogether useful for tackling down every-day electrical networks challenges.

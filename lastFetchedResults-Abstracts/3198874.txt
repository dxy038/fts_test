Modern robust control theory was brought in the parameters design of tank stabilizers for ship, which can solve the nonlinear and model uncertainty exist in ship-tank-stabilizer system. An objective function for parameters optimization of tank stabilizers was established, which is suitable for tanks of different structure and system composed of multiple tanks. The simulation result shows that the stabilizers designed with this method can provide more effective roll reduction under nonlinear condition. And the double-tank system had more effective roll reduction in extended frequencies.

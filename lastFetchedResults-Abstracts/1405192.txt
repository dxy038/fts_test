Objective : High-intensity interval training (HIT) is an efficient means of improving performance in a short period of time. The effects of HIT program on performance in elite athletes are not well known .
Methods : So , present study was provided by effect of four weeks HIT on some functional variables . For this work, fourteen of Iranian volunteer players in national Basketball team (Mean±SD , age=23/0±3/24 , weigth=63/6±8/50 , BMI=21/8±3/15) 
were selected and were randomly divided into two groups: Experimental (EXP: n=7) and Control (CON: n=7) groups.Before and after training , subjects performed (a) a graded exercise test ; (b) Wingate test for determining peak power output (PPO) and mean power output (MPO). Both groups followed the same basketball training program for four weeks , additionally EXP group performed Running-based anaerobic sprint test (RAST) (six 35-m runs at maximum pace with a 10-second recovery between each run) as a HIT protocol for four weeks , two sessions per week .Statistical analysis was done by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), using spss 16 and P value  < 0/05 was considered significant .
Results : According the results of ANCOVA test EXP group showed significant improvement in VO2 max (p=0/001), vLT (p=0/011) and vVO2 max (p=0/001) .Training program led to significant increases in PPO (p=0/03) and MPO (p=0/02).
Conclusion : The current findings suggest that HIT program with short recovery can increase both aerobic and anaerobic performances

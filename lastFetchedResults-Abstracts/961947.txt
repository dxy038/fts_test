Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a bioactive material because its chemical structure is close to the natural bone. Its bioactive properties make it attractive
material in biomedical applications. Gas tunnel type plasma spraying (GTPS) technique was employed in the present study to deposit HA coatings
on SUS 304 stainless steel substrate. GTPS is composed of two plasma sources: gun which produces internal low power plasma (1.3–8 kW) and
vortex which produces the main plasma with high power level (10–40 kW). Controlling the spraying parameters is the key role for spraying high
crystalline HA coatings on the metallic implants. In this study, the arc gun current was changed while the vortex arc current was kept constant at
450 A during the spraying process of HA coatings. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of gun current on the microstructure,
phase crystallinity and hardness properties of HA coatings. The surface morphology and microstructure of as-sprayed coatings were examined by
scanning electron microscope. The phase structure of HA coatings was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis. HA coatings sprayed at high gun
current (100 A) are dense, and have high hardness. The crystallinity of HA coatings was decreased with the increasing in the gun current. On the
other hand, the hardness was slightly decreased and the coatings suffer from some porosity at gun currents 0, 30 and 50 A.

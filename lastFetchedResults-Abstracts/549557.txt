While expressing the way nature images and its various perspectives are used in non-mystical poetry, the writer is going to deal with the differences in the way these elements are used in Mowlavi's Mathnavi, Attar's Mathnavi and Sanaee's Hadeeqa, which are close to each other in thoughts.

A quick look at the various periods of Persian poetry reveals that Persian poetry has always been in need of profiting from nature imagery. The poets of the first period of Persain poetry (khorasani style) are poets who picture nature and have objective movement, while, in Mowlavi's Mathnavi and his contemporaries, this movement is abstract and is used as a means of inspiring meanings. What is noteworthy here is the point that the way nature perspectives are used and dscribed in Sanaee and Attar's mathnavis is stereotypical and repetitive, while in Mowlavi's Mathnavi this imagery is more diverse and has been expressed in a new and unique way.

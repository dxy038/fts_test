The peculiar nature of the mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) imposes several challenges when designing quality of service solutions. Traffic traveling on a MANET network can be local traffic arriving from and targeting a node within the ad-hoc network. Traffic that is not local to MANET is likely to travel over fixed topology networks that employ, typically, DiffServ. This paper proposes employing a new framework at the gateway between the ad-hoc domain and the DiffServ access domain. The proposed framework facilitates a homogeneous seamless QoS interaction between both networks built over heterogeneous components. The objective is to achieve a high level of performance and autonomy with a lightweight implementation, if any, on mobile nodes. In this paper we propose the framework solution to the cross-domain QoS problem and use the aggregate resource reservation (ARSVP) for collective resource reservations, combined with a simple sponsorship mechanism.

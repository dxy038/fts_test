This project presents the an optimization method for harmonic elimination in a cascaded multilevel inverter and energy balance in photovoltaic cells. The main objective in selective harmonic elimination pulse width modulation strategy is eliminating low-order harmonics by solving nonlinear equations, while the fundamental component is satisfied. In this paper, the Energy balance algorithm (EB) is applied to a 7-level inverter for solving the equations. The algorithm is based on the cooling of a high temperature metal behavior under fast cooling constraint. This method has higher precision and probability of convergence than the genetic algorithm (BA). MATLAB software is used for optimization and comparison of BA and EB. Simulation results are expected to show superiority of EB over BA in attaining accurate global minima and higher convergence rate. Also, its performance is almost 10 times lesser time for running.

This paper deals with two representative unbalanced traffic cases for two-hop wireless relay access systems employing network coding and a slotted ALOHA protocol. Network coding is a recent and highly regarded technology for capacity enhancement with multiple unicast and multisource multicast networks. We have analyzed the performance of network coding on a two-hop wireless relay access system employing the slotted ALOHA under a balanced bidirectional traffic. The relay nodes will generally undergo this unbalanced multidirectional traffic but the impact of this unbalanced traffic on network coding has not been analyzed. This paper provides closed-form expressions for the throughput and packet delay for two-hop unbalanced bidirectional traffic cases both with and without network coding even if the buffers on nodes are unsaturated. The analytical results are mainly derived by solving queueing systems for the buffer behavior at the relay node. The results show that the transmission probability of the relay node is a design parameter that is crucial to maximizing the achievable throughput of wireless network coding in slotted ALOHA on two-hop unbalanced traffic cases. Furthermore, we show that the throughput is enhanced even if the traffic at the relay node is unbalanced.

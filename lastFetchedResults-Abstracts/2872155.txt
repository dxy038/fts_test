The objective of this study is to investigate storage commitment and storage placement problem for island system that has intermittency of wind power generation in a diurnal wind pattern. This objective will be achieved through minimization of cost while conducting Optimal Power Flow (OPF) analysis Fu, Shahidehpour, and Li (2006). In addition to the methodology introduced by Fu et al. (2006) and Wang, Shahidehpour, and Li (2008), impact of storage will be implemented in this model to generation and demand to analysis the dispatching electric storage systems based on different intermittent generation scenarios for an island system while addressing optimal placement. The case studied in this paper which is Gotland Island has a project in place to upgrade the existing power system to a smart grid. Regional weak power grid and a combination of wind power generation, household loads and some major industries puts on challenges on the island grid structure. HVDC connection to the Swedish mainland balances the grid while in an emergency situation, emergency generators in the weak parts of grid are dispatched Ackermann (2005). Storage systems will be addressed through their contributions to demand or generation implemented. Optimal placement of storage will be implemented through the objectives of minimizing cost of generation Bose, Gayme, Topcu, and Chandy (2012) Ghofrani, Arabali, Etezadi-Amoli, and Fadali (2013) while addressing transmission line constraints. The solutions will be analyzed based on scenarios for the hourly volatility of wind power in simulated diurnal scenarios Fu et al. (2006) and Wang et al. (2008). Storage problem will be formulated as part of the cost optimization problem with the relevant power system and equipment constraints.

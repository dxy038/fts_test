Renormalization group (RG) methods provide a unifying framework for understanding critical behaviour, such as transition to chaos in area-preserving maps and other dynamical systems, which have associated with them universal scaling exponents. Recently, de la Llave etÂ al. (2007) [10] have formulated the Principle of Approximate Combination of Scaling Exponents (PACSE for short), which relates exponents for different criticalities via their combinatorial properties. The main objective of this paper is to show that certain integrable fixed points of RG operators for area-preserving maps do indeed follow the PACSE.

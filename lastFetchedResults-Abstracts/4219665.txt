This paper presents performance results of middle scale grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) system for monitoring periods. The performance and losses of PV system is quantitatively evaluated and analyzed using calculation model with monitored data so that various PV system technologies are development. The objective of this paper is to develop reliable and valid evaluation method of Photovoltaic (PV) system performance so that maximum output is achieved over the system lifetime with performance improvement.

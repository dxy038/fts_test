Objective. Compare kinetic energy and duration of task during sit-to-stand and curb-climbing of two groups: hemiparetic stroke patients and matched controls. For patients, describe relationships between selected physical impairments and sit-to-stand and curb-climbing performance.

Design. Descriptive and correlational.

Background. Measures and treatments are best selected after specific limitations in functional activities (e.g., sit-to-stand) and related impairments are identified.

Method. Fifteen patients, 29–77 (mean = 53.7) years with recent stroke and 15 demographically matched healthy controls participated. Physical performance variables measured were standing balance, maximum paretic extremity weight-bearing, and knee extension strength. Sit-to-stand and curb-climbing performance were characterized using kinetic energy and task duration. Differences in physical and functional performance between groups were determined. Spearman correlations were calculated between patients’ physical impairments and sit-to-stand and curb-climbing performance.

Results. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated reduced kinetic energy (Pless-than-or-equals, slant0.003) and prolonged duration (Pless-than-or-equals, slant0.001) for sit-to-stand and curb-climbing. Significant relationships (rs=0.49–0.50) were demonstrated between sit-to-stand kinetic energy and knee extension strength, standing balance, and maximum weight-bearing. For curb climbing, significant relationships (rs=0.45) were found between kinetic energy and standing balance and maximum weight-bearing.

Conclusion. Impaired balance and maximum weight-bearing are relevant to sit-to-stand and curb-climbing limitations after stroke.

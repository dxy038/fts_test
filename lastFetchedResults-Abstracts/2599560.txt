Introduction: Coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) and Ectasia (CAE) are diseases that have been increasingly noticed as the increase in utilization of coronary angiograms.
Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysms and ectasia and describe the patients admitted to a private clinic in 2012 to 2014.

Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involved all patient with invasive coronary angiogram that was performed at Dr.Heshmat and Golsar hospital in Rasht from may 2012 to may 2014. All data included cardiovascular disease major rick factors, demographic and angiographic characteristics were recorded in check list. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 19.

Results: A total of 1705 coronary angiography were performed during the period of the study. CAE was found in 216 patients (12.7 % of all coronary angiograms). The majority (54.6%) were male. The mean age was 61.34Â±9.44 years (range, 30 to 83 years). CAE was associated with significant coronary artery stenosis in 123 patients (56.9%).The frequency of arterial involvement was: the right coronary artery (RCA) 56.9 %; left circumflex artery (LCx), 56.9%; the left anterior descending artery (LAD), 51.9 %.Coronary ectasia involved a single vessel in 50.9 %, two vessels in26.9  %, and three vessels in 20.4  %. Hyperlipidemia (81.5%) and hypertension (73.6%) were also most comorbidty in these patients. Coronary artery aneurysm was found in 7 patients (0.4% of all coronary angiograms).

Conclusion: The prevalence of coronary artery ectasia in this study among patient who went for coronary angiography is higher than what has been published in others studies.

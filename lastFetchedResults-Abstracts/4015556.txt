Several broad spectrum, high energy neutron source facilities exist throughout the world for accelerated soft error testing. However, none accurately replicate the terrestrial neutron spectra across the range of 1 MeV to 1 GeV. The objective of this study is to quantify the errors introduced in accelerated soft error measurements from these facilities using a range of theoretical soft error cross-sections for both high and low critical charge events.

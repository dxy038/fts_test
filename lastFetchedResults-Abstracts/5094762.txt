In this paper, we described a class of nonlinear multi-agent dynamic systems in consensus problem which every agent is multi-dimensional dynamic system. The control objective is expect to find suitable consensus controller for every agent such that 1) guarantee all the signals in the dynamic systems remain bounded. 2) design the consensus controllers for every agent then the average-consensus behavior of the multi-agent systems can be obtained.

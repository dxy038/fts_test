Evaluation of the performance of video segmentation algorithms is important in both theoretical and practical considerations. This paper addresses the problem of video segmentation assessment, through both subjective and objective approaches, for the specific application of video surveillance. After an overview of the state of the art technique in video segmentation objective evaluation metrics, a general framework is proposed to cope with application dependent evaluation assessment. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared to state of the art technique and various conclusions are drawn.

In this paper, we introduce a gait generation concept for rehabilitation, namely GaitGen. GaitGen aims to provide objective gait planning for rehabilitation. An established formula of normalized gait parameters has been studied via GAITRite. Thirty subjects are recruited for the GAITRite experiment. L-index is introduced to study the significance of leg length in the modified normalized gait parameters formula. The paper ends with a summary of results, findings, and future works.

Summary
p of 40 Calabrian centenarians (12 males, 28 females) was studied from June 1 to December 31, 1993. Their age was ranging from 100 to 107 years (mean age: 102.3 Â± 1.8 years). Clinical evaluation was performed by recording anamnestic data, an objective examination, and by assessing cognitive performance, emotional and nutritional status, as well as functional activity. The following tests were applied: mini mental state examination (MMSE), geriatric depression scale (CDS), activity of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activity of daily living (IADL). The nutritional status was estimated by collecting answers to a questionnaire regarding nutritional habits and by measuring body weight, height and calculating body mass index (BMI). In assessment of the socio-economic conditions, the following parameters were considered: years of education, type of job, type of residence ownership, heating system used, toilet set available and the regular income. Our multidimensional evaluation has revealed, in agreement with other findings, that the Calabrian centenarians seem to be a selected population with an amazingly high activity, who ovarcame severe age-dependent diseases, probably because of their genetic pattern and of the environmental factors which may favor longevity.

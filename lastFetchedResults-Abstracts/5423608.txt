Summary form only given. The paper examines the improvement that can be attained with perfect knowledge of the sound source directivity pattern and orientation in beamformer designs in the problem of speech acquisition. Data-independent beamformers are derived through formulation of a constrained optimization problem with a unity-gain constraint. Using computer simulation, these beamforming schemes are compared to the delay-and-sum (DS) beamformer and the best single sensor in a reverberant room environment. Criteria used to measure performance are: (1) the direct-to-reverberant signal ratio, to assess extent of reverberation suppression; (2) an objective measure of speech intelligibility called the speech transmission index (STI). For human-speaker source directivity, simulation results show that modest improvements to performance are obtainable.

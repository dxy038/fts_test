The preparation of new tailored membranes requires a high level of optimization. With this objective in mind, all the parameters, including the morphology of the prepared membranes, must be quantified. To this end, here we present a new software that can analyze photographs of membrane surfaces or cross-sections obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The main objective of the software is to analyze the photographs quantitatively, systematically and quickly. Single or multiple photographs can be analyzed, they can be transformed (image size, canvas size and layer selection) and the presence of a graphical scale is detected or can be introduced by the user. The regularity, the symmetry, and the number of pores and a brief statistical report is provided. Graphical and numerical results are also given. The influence of the preparation parameters can be quantified as an effect on the morphology of the membranes. This article presents the results of applying the program on our new membranes and a quantitative analysis of a series of membranes obtained from the literature.

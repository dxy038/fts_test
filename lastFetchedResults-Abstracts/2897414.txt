The objective of this paper was to develop an immersive Web-based learning model to assure the quality of learning through the flipped classrooms. The proposed model was guided theoretically by the flipped classroom as a new Web-based learning trend. It was also guided pedagogically by active and reflective learning principles that support transforming the teaching and learning practices from content engagement to cognitive engagement. The targeted immersive learning model encompasses of four reciprocal phases: Pro-act, Act, Reflect, and Re-act (PARR). To validate the suggested model, a convenience sample of graduate students studying an advanced statistics course was selected from the Distance Teaching and Training Program at the Arabian Gulf University After designing and applying this new immersive Web-based learning model (PARR), findings revealed that using the flipped classroom through this immersive Web-based learning model has a statistical and practical impact on developing achievement and self-study skills among graduate students. The contribution of this research is that it qualifies the Web-based instructional practices to shift from content acquisition act to knowledge expression and creation act. In addition, the paper will be of benefit to people looking for pedagogical applications of virtual and blended learning environments for developing multiple ways to express what learners know and be able to do.

The impact dynamics of water drops on sized and unsized smooth cellulose films and paper surfaces with controlled roughness levels were studied. The objective was to better understand the effect of roughness on the liquid drop impact dynamics on paper surfaces, isolating from the effect chemical heterogeneity. Drop impact in the first few milliseconds were recorded using high-speed CCD camera and the three-phase contact line movement of the water drop was analyzed. Smooth cellulose film surface and rough paper surface showed similar impact dynamics, suggesting that the surface energy plays a more dominant role than surface roughness. Significantly different dynamic contact angles of water drop on the sized and unsized surfaces were observed during drop impact. The Laplace pressure of the curved spreading front pointing to the centre of a spreading drop on these sized cellulose and paper surfaces reduces the three-phase contact line movement, and leads to smaller maximum spreading diameter. Our results suggest that the water drop spreads on the rough surface is most likely via a “roll-over” action rather than “stick and jump” movements.

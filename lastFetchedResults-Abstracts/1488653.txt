The objective of this study was to identify genetic variants in the bovine fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene and to evaluate associations with fatty acid composition from longissimus lumborum muscle using 90 purebred Hanwoo steers. Sequence alignments observed 6 genetic variants located in exons 20, 24, 32, 34, and 39, and PCRâ€“RFLP analysis confirmed these variations. Genotypes of the g.15532A&gt;C locus were significantly associated with Linolenic acid (C18:3), and genotypes of the g.17924G&gt;A locus were significantly associated with Palmitic (C16:0), Palmitoleic (C16:1), Oleic (C18:1), saturated fatty acids, and unsaturated fatty acids. The analysis revealed that SFA and UFA showed significant correlations with fatty acid composition (Myristic (C14:0), Palmitic (C16:0), Stearic (C18:0), Oleic (C18:1), and Eicosenoic (C20:1) acids). Oleic acid (C18:1) was negatively correlated with Myristic (C14:0), Palmitic (C16:0), and Palmitoleic (C16:1) acids (P &lt; 0.001).

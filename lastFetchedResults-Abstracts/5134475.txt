The suitability of different technologies for low-cost implementation of a fiber-optic subscriber line with bit rates between 150 and 600 Mb/s is investigated. Bidirectional transmission on one single-mode fiber using wavelength-division multiplexing, lasers, p-i-n diodes, and silicon LSI circuits is found to be the best choice for a modular subscriber line that will meet future requirements. Although this proposed link design will mature over the years, cost predictions from lightsource/detector and LSI circuit manufacturers indicate that it may be possible to reach LSI-chip prices of some dollars. The optoelectric components will still cost around $100 to $200, but the cost will decrease rapidly with increasing production volume. This link design will therefore be appropriate both for feeder and overlay network in the introduction phase of fiber in the loop, as well as for the connection of all subscribers to a complete B-ISDN system

Objective
Anthropometry (measurement of body dimensions) has been used for clinical
diagnosis of growth and developmental disorders during pregnancy and after
birth. Different brain volumes have also been shown in abnormal developmental
disorders. This study compares the different horizontal diameters of the left- and
right-hand thumbnails and asymmetry of lateral cerebral ventricles in children
with developmental delays.
Materials & Methods
This retrospective case control study was carried out in the Pediatric Neurologic
Outpatient of a university hospital in Tehran, Iran (2009â€“2011). Twenty-eight
patients with motor developmental disorders (case) and 28 healthy individuals
(control) had brain MRIs and volume of lateral cerebral ventricles size had been
studied. The maximum horizontal diameters of the left and right thumbnails
were measured by calipers during physical and neurological exams by a pediatric
neurologist. Finally, we compared and analyzed different horizontal diameters of
the left and right hand thumbnails and asymmetry of lateral cerebral ventricles.
Results
There was a significant correlation between asymmetry of brain lateral ventricles
size and mean difference of horizontal diameter of thumb nails (P = 0.0001). A
meaningful relation between brain hemispheres asymmetry and developmental
delay (P = 0.04) was seen.
Conclusion
The asymmetry of thumbnails can be a marker for asymmetry of lateral ventricles
and child developmental delays.

This paper presents the enhancement of the Sniper multicore / manycore simulator with thermal measurement possibilities using the HotSpot simulator. We present a plugin that interacts with Sniper to retrieve simulation data (integration areas and power consumptions) and calls HotSpot to compute the corresponding thermal results. The plugin also builds a two dimensional floorplan for the simulated microarchitecture. Furthermore we plan to integrate the simulation methodology presented here into an automatic design space exploration process using the multi-objective optimization tool called FADSE.

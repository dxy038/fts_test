Feasibility for broadband communication over high-voltage power distribution lines is shown through study of signal to noise ratio and calculation of channel capacity for a typical rural circuit.

This is especially important for rural communities world wide, since RF PLC may furnish bidirectional broadband Internet access service where none is currently available

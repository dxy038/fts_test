We have developed a unique miniature confocal microscope with a MEMS scanner and successfully obtained a real time image. A scanning head including the MEMS scanner, an optical fiber and an aspherical objective lens is precisely and compactly assembled. By employing two reflectors optical design with the lens, an observation of a longitudinal direction was achieved. The mirrors in the scanner Its diameter and length are 3.3 mm and 8 mm, respectively. The lateral resolution of 0.5 /spl mu/m, the depth resolution of 2.9 /spl mu/m, and the field of view of 100/spl times/75 /spl mu/m were achieved.

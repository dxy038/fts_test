According to the rapid development of the situation in dispatching automation technology and application status of the remote computer experimental system in the domestic university, this paper designed a set of remote computer experimental system in traction power supply system in order to meet the requirements of professional teaching. Digital, modular, practicability design idea, polling protocol and bus industrial structure were used in this system, the simulation of various functions in traction power supply automation was implemented, it was included a series of simulation experiments such as telecontrol, teleindication, telemetering, teleadjusting of remote computer and the substation control. This paper also discussed the experimental functions, characteristics, the objective to construction, the effect of students on training comprehensive quality and enhancing skills. Actual operation showed the results that the experimental system had a good generality, flexibility and vivacity.

A dual-wavelength Tm<sup>3+</sup>:ZBLAN fibre laser operating around 1480 nm is demonstrated. A linear cascaded cavity with bidirectional upconversion pumping at 1064 nm was used; alternate single wavelength and dual-wavelength operation is achieved by simple adjustment of the pump powers. A wavelength spacing of only 0.6 nm is obtained for dual-wavelength operation.

The objective of this work was to determine the total dietary antioxidant capacity (TDAC) of the Spanish Mediterranean diet. The antioxidant capacity of plant foods and beverages included in National food consumption data was determined. TDAC of the Spanish diet was estimated at 6014 and 3549 μmol trolox equivalents by FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and ABTS (free radical-scavenging capacity) procedures, respectively. About 68% of TDAC came from beverages and 20% from fruits and vegetables, with a very low contribution from cereals. The capacity to inhibit in vitro LDL oxidation of plant foods and beverages was consistent with their antioxidant capacity. The recommended daily intakes of antioxidant vitamins, C and E, represent about 10% of TDAC. Total phenolics intake was estimated as 1171 mg gallic acid/person/day by the Folin–Ciocalteau method. TDAC may be a parameter to be considered in nutritional and epidemiological studies.

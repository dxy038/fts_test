The purpose of this article is to present the method of solving the optimization problem of the internal partitions of the building, the shape of the building, as well as heat sources.
The optimization of the internal partitions of the building is based on particular selection from the given list, and determination of the thickness of thermal insulation.
Solving the problem of the shape has been solved first in order to determine approximately the building height, proportions of building sides and orientation of the building with respect to the north–south axis, as well as to check which of the inequality constraints are active in this case. Following this, after obtaining the results, it was checked whether replacing the rectangular plan of the building by a rectangle and two trapezoids is advantageous.
The optimum choice of heat source types for heating for domestic use and the determination of share in covering the demand for heat in the time interval under consideration has been formulated and solved using continuous and discrete decision variables.
Part-problems of the optimization are solved by analytical–numerical method. They consist of determining some decision variables using analytical methods and the remaining using numerical methods applying CAMOS computer system, original algorithms and programs. In optimization of heat sources, original numerical methods were used for the determination of the compromise set in case of discontinuous objective functions.

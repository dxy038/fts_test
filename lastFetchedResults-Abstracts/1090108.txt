According to the Ahlowalia hypothesis (1995), the growth of
total factor productivity (TFP) beside infrastructure investments
of government lead to income inequality decrease in rural
areas of countries. The main objective of this study is to
investigate the effects of public investments such as agricultural
R&E, road, education and irrigation on income inequality in
rural areas of Iran. In order to get results, we used ARDL
method and time series data of 1980 to 2008. However, this
research attempts to survey the direction of causality between
the income inequality and total factor productivity (TFP) in
Iran. Empirical results show there is a negative relation between
income inequality and agricultural TFP in rural areas of Iran.
Hence, additional investments on rural education and agricultural
R&E have significance and different impacts on income inequality.
Findings showed Ahlowalia hypothesis developed for
the relation among income inequality, TFP and investment in
electricity is not rejected in case of Iran`s rural areas.

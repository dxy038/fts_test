In present study two identical with same dimensions, experimental set up of flat plate collectors using -heat pipes were fabricated. In each set up three identical wickless copper heat pipes are used having length 620 mm and outer diameter of 18 mm. The working fluid used in one set up is pure water and in another pure water with nanoparticles. The nanoparticles used are CNT having diameter 10-12 nm &amp; length 0.1-10 J.l. For the dispersion of CNTs (0.15% by volume) in aqueous media (water) functionalization process is used. These set ups are initially tested at Indian standard tilt angle 31.5&#176; and Maximum performance angle 50&#176;. At the same angles these collectors are tested using the solar tracking system. Both collectors gave maximum instantaneous efficiency at the 50&#176; for with and without tracking. The nanofluid working fluid collector gave the better performance in the all conditions. For both fluids Solar tracking system founds more effective and the trend of difference of their instantaneous efficiencies are found initially more then decreases it becomes almost equal and then their difference again increases. The main objective of this study is to reduce the size of the solar flat plate collector so that it can be a new innovation for Compaq solar collector will be utilized in commercial scale.

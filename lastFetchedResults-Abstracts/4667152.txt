This paper explores an approach trying to recognize the presence of electromagnetic attacks on an equipment. Wireless communications are widely used in railway traffic management systems. Such systems are probably susceptible to be disturbed by malicious actions involving jammers. The general objective of this work is to develop a specific method enabling to detect and to recognize these types of interfering signals. This method could be used to involve adequate reactions in order to reduce the impact on the railway network. This paper focuses on the recognition method. It is based on accurate statistical models of signals generated by jammers. This work is carried out in the framework of the European project &#8220;SECRET&#8221; for SECurity of Railways against Electromagnetic aTtacks.

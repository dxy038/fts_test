Objective
estigate the consistency of several comorbidity classifications and concomitant diseases at radical prostatectomy (RP) during a 10-year period.
s and Materials
97 patients who underwent RP between 1993 and 2002, age and several comorbidity classifications were derived from patient records and assigned to the year of surgery. Trends were evaluated using the Cochran-Armitage trend test.
s
el to an increasing frequency of RPs and a shift toward more organ-confined tumors (P = 0.0094), the proportion of patients aged ≥70 years increased (P = 0.0077). The proportion of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status class 3 increased (P &lt; 0.0001), whereas that of ASA class 1 decreased (P &lt; 0.0001). A Charlson score ≥1 has been assigned with an increasing frequency (P = 0.0008), whereas the trend with a Charlson score of ≥2 did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). In contrast to the latter 2 classifications, no significant trends were observed with classifications related to diabetes mellitus and heart disease.
sions
tudy shows that the application of the ASA classification may change significantly over time, whereas cardiac and diabetes-related conditions, as well as the Charlson score were apparently less sensitive to changing classification standards in the RP setting.

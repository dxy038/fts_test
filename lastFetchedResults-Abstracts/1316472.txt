The media narrative of events is not an objective narrative, but its representation is in the discursive and ideological frameworks. This paper tries to find out how one of the most important events in the Middle East (dismissal of Morsi) is represented by media having different discursive frameworks (Channel 1 of IRIB and BBC Persian).  Critical discourse analysis is used to evaluate this paper. The results indicate that BBC Persian television used a liberal democracy discourse within the framework of components such as legitimacy of majority, the rule of law and equality for the representation of this Egyptian event. In contrast, Channel 1 of IRIB applied components of Islamic Revolution discourse 
such as support for Islamists, support for resistance movement and conspiracy of western countries for the media construction of this Egyptian event. In addition, Channel 1 served other discourses, such as democracy and the will of the majority for the expression of its purposes.

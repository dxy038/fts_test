The subtractive clustering algorithm (SC) is a popular method for data clustering. But the radius of each cluster is an important factor which affects the performances of clustering results. This paper proposes an objective function for the genetic algorithm to estimate the optimal value of this parameter. Two experiments show that the proposed method can automatically obtain this parameter for the subtractive clustering algorithm.

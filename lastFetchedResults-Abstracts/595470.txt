Objective: To determine whether previous caesarean section and multiparity have any association with increased risk for placenta previa than in women with no history of previous caesarean section and low parity. Methodology: This was a descriptive study conducted at the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Saidu Teaching Hospital Swat from January 2006 to December 2007. Data regarding detailed obstetrical and surgical history were recorded on a proforma in the ante natal clinic and obstetrics ward. In antenatal clinic all those in second and third trimester of pregnancy with or without symptoms of placenta previa but ultra sound scan showing placental implantation in lower uterine segment were documented. In the obstetric ward all the patients presented in emergency (non booked) with antepartum haemorrhage and diagnosed as case of placenta previa by pelvic examination, were documented. Results: There were total 5267 obstetrical admissions. Two twenty six were diagnosed as cases of placenta previa. The overall incidence was 4.2% (n = 5267). Out of these 226 patients, 89 were multipara, 99 were grand multipara and rest were primigrvidas. One hundred sixty patients had previous history of one or more caesarean section. Conclusion: From the available data it is concluded that there is an association between incidence of placenta previa with the increase in parity.

The design of integrated multiple objective systems is, a complex problem involving the work of various disciplines, each dependent on the other. The computation or prediction of plane wave backscattered field is one of the primary design disciplines of future spacecraft and weapon systems. The task of computing the electromagnetic backscattered field of a spacecraft structure is by no means a new endeavor. Whereas predicting a minimal backscattered field return under the manipulation of airframe geometry in the context of multi-objective design is considered the most exhaustive approach to obtain the optimal solution and is a new endeavor. The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical method to couple the backscattered field with the defined aerodynamic performance constraints in the design process of future spacecraft.

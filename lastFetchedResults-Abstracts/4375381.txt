The embedded multicore DSP systems are playing increasingly important role for consumer electronic design. Such systems try to optimize the objective for both performance and power with mobile devices. Embedded application developers will then devise designs to optimize embedded applications for not only performance but also power. However, currently there are no power metrics support for popular application design platforms such as QEMU and SID, where application developers develop their applications. This hinders application developers to help tune optimizations for power. In this paper, we propose a power aware simulation framework on embedded multicore DSP subsystems for SID framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to attempt to build a power aware simulator based on SID simulation framework. The power estimation flow includes two phases, IP level power modeling and system level power power profiling. In the IP level power modeling, PowerMixer<sup>IP</sup> is employed to build up the power model for PAC DSP and major IPs. In the system level power profiling, we provide a power profiling hierarchy that meets the demand of embedded software developers. The granularity of power profiling can be configured to the whole simulation stage or any specific time slot in the simulation such as a dedicated function loop. In our experiments, DSP programs with SIMD intrinsics for DSPStone benchmark are examined with our proposed power aware simulator. In addition, a face detection application is deployed as a running example on multi-core DSP systems to show how our power simulator can be used to help collaborate with developers in the optimization process to illustrate views of power dissipations of applications.

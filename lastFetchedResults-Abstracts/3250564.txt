Harmony search Optimization is a recently proposed population based meta-heuristic that mimics the improvisation of the aesthetic in music by the musicians. In this paper, the proposed algorithm is tested extensively on a set of 5 benchmark functions as well as the real world Circular adaptive Antenna Array design problem. The performance of the technique is compared with an already established evolutionary technique i.e Differential Evolution. The simulation results indicate the efficacy of the Harmony search technique for a single objective function.

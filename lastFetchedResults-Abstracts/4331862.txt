This paper studies a method of enhancing QoE (Quality of Experience) in H.264-video and audio IP transmission by jointly applying FMO (Flexible Macroblock Ordering) and SCS (Switching between error Concealment and frame Skipping), which is a QoE-based video output scheme simply based on the receiver´s operation. We conducted objective and subjective experiment on the method for combinations of two slice group map types (interleaved and dispersed), four contents and three picture patterns (I, I+4P´s and I+14P´s); we measured QoS (Quality of Service) and then assessed QoE in terms of the psychological scale. As a result, we find that for the patterns I+4P´s and I+14P´s, combinations of SCS and the dispersed map type work best, whereas for the pattern I, the frame skipping only (i.e., SCS without FMO) achieves the highest QoE.

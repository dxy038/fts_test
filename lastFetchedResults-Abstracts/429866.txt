Background. Tubercular pseudoaneurysm of aorta is a rare but important complication of tuberculosis. With worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis due to increasing incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis and its association with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the tubercular pseudoaneurysm has become a real clinical entity.

Methods. In the past 3 years, 5 young patients (22 to 40 years) presented with tubercular pseudoaneurysm. Site of involvement included ascending aorta, distal aortic arch, proximal descending thoracic aorta, distal descending thoracic aorta, and infrarenal abdominal aorta. Two patients had macroscopic focus of tuberculosis in the nearby vicinity, and all 5 patients had evidence of active/treated pulmonary pericardial tuberculosis. All patients either had received antitubercular therapy previously or were receiving it at the time of presentation. Rapid deterioration in the clinical status was the most marked clinical feature. All patients underwent operation. Graft interposition was performed in 2, patch repair in 2, and direct closure of the rent was performed in 1 patient. All 5 patients received antitubercular therapy in the postoperative period.

Results. All patients survived the operation and were discharged from the hospital. One patient developed recurrence at the original site after 8 months and died at reoperation. The remaining patients are symptom free at 18 to 36 months postoperatively.

Conclusions. A combination of chemotherapy and operation yields gratifying results for the treatment of tubercular pseudoaneurysm.

Imam Khomeini considered the Quran as a source that enjoys such a comprehensiveness which can meet all the material and spiritual needs of human beings in their attempt to attain a happy life in all times and spaces. On the other hand, in viewpoint of Imam Khomein, the Quran is not merely a book for individual knowledge, upbringing and ethic, but it contains social and political doctrines for management of the society based on independence, freedom, and rejection of oppression and arrogance. Hence, in his viewpoint, Islamic uprisings in the course of history, including the Ashura Uprising, aimed to revive the role of the Quran. The Iranian nation, following the Ashura Uprising, launched their Islamic movement for the rule of the Quran and establishment of a Quranic government and by holding fast to the Quran and Quranic secret of martyrdom have attained victory over the illegitimate government that can be an eternal example for other oppressed Muslim nations. Hence, the main objective of this paper is revisiting the fundamental principles of the Quranology of Imam Khomeini and explanation of the relationship between the Quran and the Islamic Revolution through Imam Khomeiniâ€™s understanding of the Quran.

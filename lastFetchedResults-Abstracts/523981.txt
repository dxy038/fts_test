Objective: In vertebrates, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activin signals play
multiple roles in dorso-ventral patterning and development of the spinal cord. Here the
inductions of BMP 4 and activin A on embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into dorsal interneurons
have been studied.
Materials and Methods: Four different treatments have been used for mESC derived
neural precursors; they include BMP4 (1ng/ml and 10ng/ml), activin A (100 ng/ml), and
activin A+BMP4 (100ng/ml, 10ng/ml). Inductionâ€™s effect on expression of specific dorsal
interneuron markers in mature neurons have been evaluated by the use of immunocytochemistry
and RT-PCR.
Results: Treatment of ESC-derived neural precursors with BMP4, activin A, or both
showed an increased generation of both dI1 and dI3 interneurons (Lhx2 and Isl-1-positive
cells) compared to the control group. However, the synergistic effect in generation of dI3
was not observed when both factors were used. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis of differentiated
cells showed the expression of Lhx9, Lhx1, and Isl1, the transcription factors that are
markers of dI1, dI2, and dI3 interneurons respectively.
Conclusion: Our results showed that specific combination of developmental signaling
molecules can direct the differentiation of ESCs into dorsal interneurons. Furthermore,
qualitative and quantitative differences in signaling by different members of
the TGF-B superfamily may play a role in the specification of different types of dorsal
interneurons.

The objective of the studies described concern the validation and utilization of ERS-1 SAR derived liquid and solid ocean information and the study of the inter-regional, regional, and temporal variation of the microwave signatures of sea ice and snow. Initial interests are focussed on the accuracy of the estimates of ice type, ice form, deformation state, or thickness, and the ability to retrieve ice physical property information. Two in situ campaigns have been conducted for the purpose to &#8220;truth&#8221; ERS-1 SAR products and to gather data in support of the above science studies

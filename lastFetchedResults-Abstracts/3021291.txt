This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the behavioral effects, specially the learning difficulties, verified in rats of the species Rattus norvegicus, submitted to microwave radiation. Throughout the tests, an analog transmitter was used operating in the frequency of 850 MHz during a daily period of one hour. The choice of that frequency, in particular, links to the fact that in Brazil, the cellular phones use radiofrequency carriers between 800 and 900 MHz for the mobile phone service (cellular mobile service). The analysis, based on experiments with the Skinner Cage, had as main objective to verify the possible alterations on the learning ability in adult rats subjected to the influence of non-ionizing radiation and to compare their answer ratio with the control group, exempt of the influence of radiation.

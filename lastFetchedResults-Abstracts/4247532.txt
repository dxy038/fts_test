The objective of this work is to create a planar solar positioner with 3 grades of liberty. An electronic control is designed to provide two movements. The first one permits to track the Sun trajectory from 9 hrs to 17 hrs. A motor of antenna television (SG2100 DiSEqC Dish Motor) was used in the corresponding structure. The second movement provides the angle position of the mirror in accordance with the season of the year (azimuth movement). The third grade of liberty is obtained manually for the inclination corresponding to the place where the positioner is located; for CIICAp an angle of 18&#194;&#176;50Â´ is required. This angle is provided by means of the two adjustable extremes of the mechanical structure. The electronic control permits to reflect the solar beams on a specific concentration area, where it is possible to use them for diverse applications. The illumination area is determined by the size of the mirror and remains quasiuniform during the test period. The control permits to return to the initial point every day, without to calibrate again. The electronic interface to the user was programmed by means of a DSPIC.

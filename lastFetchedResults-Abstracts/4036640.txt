This study addresses the problem of an optimal actuator selection when economic value is considered. The objective is to minimise the economical cost of operating a given plant. The problem has been formulated using mathematic notions from economics. Functionals describing the business objectives of operating a power plant has been established. The selection of actuator configuration has been limited to the fuel system which in the considered plant consists of three different fuels - coal, gas and oil. The changes over 24-h of operation is established and a strategy for using a plant utilising the three fuels is developed which will yield a greater profit than a coal fired plant.

In this paper, the authors proposed to construct a high quality image based on multiple low quality input images. The relationship between one pixel and its neighbourhood should be consistent between different degraded images. Therefore, the reconstruction method is proposed by enforcing the pixel consistency property, which is ensured by estimating the parameters of piecewise image model for each pixel. Subsequently, the reconstructed coefficients are regularized within a reasonable range. Experimental results on multiple images (with different distortions of different levels) have demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the noises meanwhile preserve the detailed information. Better quality images in terms of both objective and subjective measurements can be generated.

Objective No previous studies have empirically demonstrated
a multiplicative interactive effect of anxiety disorders
and/or depression (ADD) and chronic medical
conditions on quality of life (QOL). We hypothesized that
QOL impairment was worsened by the presence of ADD
and medical co-morbidity, more than when it was with
either medical co-morbidity alone or ADD alone.
Methods Complete data of 2,801 participants from the
National Mental Health Survey of Adults in Singapore
were analyzed, using SCAN diagnoses of anxiety disorders
and depression, self-reports of chronic medical conditions,
and SF-12 measures of QOL (Mental Component Summary,
MCS, and Physical Component Summary, PCS).
Results Persons diagnosed with ADD (compared to those
without) had considerably more medical co-morbidities (59
vs. 33%, p\0.001). In multiple regression analyses, ADD
(vs. no ADD) was associated with lower PCS (b = -1.013,
p = 0.045) and MCS scores (b = -9.912, p\0.001), as
was number of medical co-morbidities (0, 1â€“2, 3 ?),
PCS scores (b = -2.058, p\0.001) and MCS scores
(b = -1.138, p\0.001). There were significant interactive
effects of medical co-morbidities and ADD on PCS
(p\0.001), and MCS (p = 0.086), suggesting that the
negative effects of medical conditions on quality of life was
aggravated non-additively by the co-morbid presence of
ADD, and vice versa.
Conclusion The individual effects of medical and psychiatric
morbidity on functional status and quality of life
were considerably worse when both were present in the
same individual. Future studies should examine the impact
of identifying and treating anxiety and depressive disorders
in patients with medical problems for better outcomes.

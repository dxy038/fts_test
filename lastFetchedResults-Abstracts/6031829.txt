This paper deals with pre-echo reduction in low bit-rate audio compression. proposed an attack restoration method based on the correction of the temporal envelop of the decoded signal. A small set of coefficients were then transmitted through a limited bit-rate auxiliary channel. However, the transmission of the transient position computed on the original audio signal was required. In this paper, we deployed a new method of attack localization based on differential algebraic, which guaranties a successful detection on the decoded audio signal. The algebraic method has also a reduced complexity compared to the index stationary detector used in. The new proposed approach is evaluated for single audio coding-decoding, using objective perceptual measures. The experimental results for MP3 coding exhibits an efficient restoration of the attacks and a significant improvement of the audio quality.

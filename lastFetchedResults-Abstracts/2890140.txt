Software evolution tools mostly implement a single technique to assist in achieving a specific objective. Overhauling, renovating, or migrating large and complex legacy software systems require the proper combination of several different techniques appropriate for each subtask. Since few tools are built for interoperability, the setup of a toolchain supporting a given software evolution process is an elaborate, time-consuming, error-prone, and redundant endeavor, which yields brittle and inflexible toolchains with little to no reusability. This paper presents SENSEI, an approach to enable the implementation of an integration framework for software evolution tools using component-based, service-oriented, and model-driven methods, to ease toolchain creation and enable agile execution of software evolution projects. It will be evaluated by implementing and using it to build the toolchains supporting two software evolution projects, and having practitioners assess its usefulness.

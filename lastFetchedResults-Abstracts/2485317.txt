Selection of the qualified and the most appropriate employee plays crucial role for the success of the businesses. The selection process is complex and contains both subjective and objective criteria to be considered. For this reason, in this paper, Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is proposed for employee selection. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, the most appropriate software engineer is selected for a technology firm. By this way, a scientific multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method is proposed to the firm that determines the best candidate intuitively with traditional methods.

The objective of this work is to study the possibility of implementing SOI rectifiers for UWB RFIDs with undoped Double Gate MOSFETs (DG-MOSFETs). For that purpose we use two commercial TCAD tools, Sentaurus Device (created by Synopsys) and ADS (created by Agilent), wherein a large signal circuit model derived for the transistors is implemented with Verilog-A. Once the DG-MOSFETs output characteristics are fit, the rectifier performance at high frequencies is simulated; numerical and electrical results are successfully compared.

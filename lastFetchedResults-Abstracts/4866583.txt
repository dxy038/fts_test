We have developed multi-dimensional streamer models that can be applied to arbitrarily shaped electrodes. Our models have generated the first fully-resolved streamers which form self-consistent, multi-dimensional structures. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the dynamical characteristics of streamers are determined by their multi-dimensional structure

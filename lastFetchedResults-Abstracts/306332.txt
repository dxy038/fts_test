OBJECTIVE

To determine whether current vascular Chlamydi pneumoniae (CPn) infection as diagnosed by circulating CPn DN is more common in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD).

BACKGROUND

Serological, pathological and animal studies have associated CPn with CAD and preliminary trials suggest antibiotics may prevent adverse coronary events. C. pneumoniae is thought to disseminate systemically within macrophages. We therefore detected CPn DN in blood to determine whether its presence was  predictor of CAD.

METHODS

One thousand, two hundred and five subjects attending for diagnostic and interventional coronary arteriography were recruited. The mononuclear cell layer and platelets were separated from collected blood and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect CPn DNA.

RESULTS

Circulating CPn DN was found in 8.8% of 669 men with CAD compared with 2.9% of 135 men with normal coronary arteries (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1â€“8.9). In men with CAD, those with CPn DN had higher mean platelet counts than those without CPn DNA. Monocyte counts and indirect fibrinogen levels were also raised but not significantly so. By contrast, no association of circulating CPn DN and CAD was seen in women.

CONCLUSIONS

Circulating CPn DN is  predictor of CAD in men. Unlike serology, it is  specific indicator of current infection and is  means of identifying subjects who may potentially benefit from antichlamydial therapy.

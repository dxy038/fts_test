Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) is generally performed using an echo planar imaging (EPI) acquisition to map directional water diffusion. However, the oscillating magnetic field gradients of the EPI acquisition can result in considerable mechanical vibrations, which lead, in turn, to magnetic field fluctuations causing Nyquist ghosting in the EPI data. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of EPI readout gradient modulation frequency, which is directly associated with the EPI readout bandwidth (BW), on the accuracy of DT-MRI measurements in a high magnetic field system. A spherical water phantom was used to study the relationship between the EPI BW and the Nyquist ghost for a spin-echo EPI acquisition with a matrix size of 128Ã—128, complemented by diffusion sensitization gradients of up to b=800 s/mm2 along six directions for DT-MRI. Nine volunteers (four males and five females) were studied using EPI at different BW acquisitions. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the EPI BW effects. The phantom studies demonstrated a systematic relationship between BWs and the intensities of Nyquist ghosts. In the human brain studies, EPI BW variations substantially corrupted diffusion anisotropy indexes (i.e., fractional anisotropy and relative anisotropy) (F=10.5, P=.0001) but were unrelated to diffusion-encoding directions (F=0.14, P=.98). It was possible to minimize BW dependence (F=1.48, P=.25) by tuning the modulation frequency of the EPI readout gradient. In conclusion, diffusion anisotropic indexes are sensitive to the readout BW of EPI due to associated Nyquist ghosting. However, the effect can be minimized by tuning the modulation frequency of the EPI readout gradient, that is, the EPI BW, to a range outside the harmonics of mechanical gradient vibrations.

The European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy or (“Fusion for Energy” of F4E for short) is a new organisation that has been established with the main objective of providing Europe's contribution to the ITER International Organisation (IO) as its Domestic Agency. Fusion for Energy is also the Implementing Agency for the Broader Approach projects being carried out with Japan and, in the longer term, will prepare a programme for the construction of demonstration fusion reactors (DEMO). The threefold mission of Fusion for Energy is consistent with the fast track strategy for the realisation of fusion energy. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current status of Fusion for Energy and highlight some of the opportunities available for research organisations and industry to participate.

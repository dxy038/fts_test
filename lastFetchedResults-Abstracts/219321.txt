Background/Objective: Detection of the tissue diagnosis of ovarian space occupying lesions (OSOL) has remained a challenging task for sonographers since many adnexal masses have nonspecific sonographic appearances. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the abdominal sonographic diagnosis of adnexal masses in 79 women with a known OSOL undergoing laparotomy for ovarian masses in Tabriz Alzahra's Haspital, northwestern Iran. Patients and Methods: From March 2004 to February 2005, sonographic reports of each patient were compared with postoperative findings. Results: Comparison of the preoperative sonographic and final pathologic diagnoses revealed a correct sonographic diagnosis in 77% of patients. The identification of ovarian cystic teratoma was correct in 17/24 cases (sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 98%). The identification of ovarian malignancy was correct in 7/10 patients (sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 98.5%). Sonograms were frankly misread in 14/79 cases, and were missed in 4/79 cases. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results show high resolution abdominal ultrasonography is an effective method in diagnosis of ovarian tumors and on 70% of patients can differentiate malignant tumors from benign tumors.

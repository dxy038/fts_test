Objective: To know the efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of axillary involvement in breast cancer.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in Surgical "A" unit of Post Graduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. A total of 30 patients with operable breast cancer diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and clinically non-palpable lymph nodes in the axilla were studied. While on the operation table for modified radical mastectomy, one ml of sterilized solution of methylene blue was injected subdermally under the areola of the diseased breast. After 5-10 minutes sentinel lymph nodes were harvested via a small incision over the axilla , marked as 'blue nodes' or blue lymphatics leading to a node.Results: All the patients were females with mean age 45±13.48 years. Mean tumor size was 3.7 ± 1.60 cm The tumor was present in upper and outer quadrant in most (63.33%) of the patients. No complications were noted related to the procedure. The sensitivity of the method was found to be 85. 7%> and false negative rate was 7.1%.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy with methylene blue is safe and cheaper and accurately predicts the axillary lymph node status in most of the patients.

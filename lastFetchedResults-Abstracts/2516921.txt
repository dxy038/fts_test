In the dairy industry, protection against species substitution or admixture is important for several reasons, including frequent human adverse reactions toward some species milk proteins, and trade and government regulations. The objective of the present study was to assess the purity of buffalo milk and it’s products offered as “pure buffalo” in the market. Using species-specific primers, a duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed to detect the fraudulent addition of cow’s milk to buffalo’s milk and it’s products. The limit of detection of cow’s milk in buffalo’s milk, yogurt and cheese is 1, 2 and 4%, respectively. Undeclared presence of cow’s milk was detected in 70% of the milk samples, 64% of the yogurt and 52% of the cheese samples. In 10% of the yogurt samples and 14% of the cheese samples, no apparent buffalo-related amplification product was observed, suggesting that cow’s milk was entirely substituted for buffalo’s milk in these samples. To avoid unfair competition and to assure consumers of accurate labeling, using this method is recommended for regulatory agencies.

Hyperspectral imaging applications are many and span civil, environmental, and military needs. Typical examples include the detection of specific terrain features and vegetation, mineral, or soil types for resource management; detecting and characterizing materials, surfaces, or paints; the detection of man-made materials in natural backgrounds for the purpose of search and rescue; the detection of specific plant species for the purposes of counter narcotics; and the detection of military vehicles for the purpose of defense and intelligence. The objective of this article is to provide a tutorial overview of detection algorithms used in current hyperspectral imaging systems that operate in the reflective part of the spectrum (0.4 - 24 &#956;m.) The same algorithms might be used in the long-wave infrared spectrum; however, the phenomenology is quite different. The covered topics and the presentation style have been chosen to illustrate the strong couplings among the underlying phenomenology, the theoretical framework for algorithm development and analysis, and the requirements of practical applications.

Background and Objective: Inadequate intake of Calcium and vitamin D is one of the common health problems, especially among the children in developed as well as developing countries, including Iran. Fortification of foodstuff, specially milk and dairy products, is being used as a major strategy to combat this problem in many countries. This study aimed to evaluate sensory desirability and compliance with  vitamin D and Calcium-fortified milk, among 9-11 year-old schoolchildren in the city of Tehran.
Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in two phases including sensory evaluation and compliance with vitamin D and Calcium fortified-milk in schoolchildren. The first phase was performed by a panel of 212 schoolchildren from both sexes using a 5- point hedonic questionnaire with both images and words. And, the second phase was carried out on 200 children using an 8-item questionnaire.
Results: In sensory evaluation 44.4% of the students described the taste of the fortified milk as bad, while in the compliance study 85% of children were satisfied with the taste of vitamin D and Calcium - fortified milk. Only less than half of the students agreed with the continuation of the fortification program.
Conclusion: Calcium and vitamin D fortification, resulting in unpleasant changes in the taste of milk, can challenge fortified milk distribution program for children. Further study is needed to provide a formulation that would result in a higher compliance among schoolchildren.

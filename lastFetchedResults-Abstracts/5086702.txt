The problem of data extraction from the deep Web can be divided into two tasks: crawling the client-side and the server-side deep Web. The objective is to define an architecture and a set of related techniques to access the information placed in the client-side deep Web. This involves dealing with aspects such as JavaScript technology, nonstandard session maintenance mechanisms, client redirections, pop-up menus, etc. We use current browser APIs as building blocks and leverage them to implement novel crawling models and algorithms

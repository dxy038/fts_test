This paper presents solar photovoltaic (SPV) inverters test results performed in Southern California Edison´s (SCE) Distributed Energy Resources (DER) laboratory. The lab´s engineers tested a variety of commercial three-phase solar PV inverters from different manufacturers and began performing commissioning tests on commercial SPV installations interconnected directly on SCE´s distribution circuits. The primary objective of these load rejection tests is to assess transient over-voltages (TOV) created when SPV inverters are disconnected from the grid and injecting electrical power to the grid (load rejection). The data acquired in this project will support the updates to existing standards. The key results presented are associated with TOV generated by SPV inverters during grid disconnection.

Background: Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. resulting from metallo-B-lactamase (MBLs)-producing strains have been reported to be among important causes of nosocomial infections and of serious therapeutic problem worldwide.
Objective: To determine the prevalence of metallo-B-lactamase among imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter isolates based on phenotypic methods.
Methods: This was an descriptive study in which 140 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. were initially tested for imipenem susceptibility and later for metallo-B-lactamase production using combined disk diffusion, double disk synergy test, and Hodge test during 2010. Antibiotic susceptibility of positive metallo-B-lactamase isolates were further evaluated by disk diffusion technique using CLSI methodology.
Findings: Of 140 isolates, 29 (20.7%) were imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter. Positive phonetypic test for metallo-B-lactamase was 24 (17.1%).
Conclusion: The result of this study is indicative of growing number of nosocomial infections associated with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. in this region leading to difficulties in antibiotic therapy.

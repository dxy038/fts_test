A gap lies between the required performance qualifications of various professions, and the knowledge and skills that students are provided with during their education. With the aim of appropriately bridging this gap, the supply chain management model for human resource development is introduced, which considers higher education as the core of its supply chain, the professions and students as the demand and supply, respectively. The ultimate objective of this model is to provide a high level human resource that would satisfy the performance demands. Moreover, the key features of Iran regarding its higher education include: education-wise human development; major employers and employment possibilities; universities; and the countryÂ´s technological capacity. In order to obtain a high level human capital, the execution of this model with the consideration of these key features, presented itself as a promising human resource development strategy.

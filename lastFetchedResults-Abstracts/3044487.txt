Future embedded and wireless devices are increasingly powerful supporting many applications including one of the most crucial; security. Although many wireless and embedded devices offer more resistance to bus probing attacks due to their compact size, susceptibility to power/electromagnetic attacks must be analyzed. This work presents optimized synthesis of new low energy masking countermeasures into cryptographic software. In particular a model for key masking with the objective of minimizing energy overhead is presented. Experimental results using real power measurements are shown to support up to 2.5 energy overhead savings and improved security compared to previous research. With the emergence of security applications in PDAs, cell phones, line card accelerators, etc, optimizing low energy countermeasures for resistance to power/ electromagnetic attacks is crucial for supporting future secure embedded devices.

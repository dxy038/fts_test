We propose a novel optical distribution network for multistage optical access network with multiple remote nodes (RNs) using 4skip0 filters. The system can be implemented by use of 1&#215;N arrayed waveguide grating in the central office, cascaded RNs, and a plurality of optical network units (ONUs). It also employs colorless ONUs based on incoherent light injected Fabry-Pe&#180;rot laser diodes for low operation and maintenance cost. Experiment shows error-free transmission with simultaneous bidirectional 1.25 Gb/s per channel up to 20 km.

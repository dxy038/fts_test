The objective of this paper is to present a feasible methodology that can achieve good control performance of a dynamic beam structure system with time delay effect. To achieve good control, a robust control called the modified fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) with phase shift method is introduced in this paper. Conventionally, the FSMC is easily designed without precise system modelling and needs very little information for online calculation. However, numerical simulation results show that increasing the time delay will reduce its performance and the system will become unstable for a large time delay. The phase shift method can assist the system in predicting the real status value as a compensation for time delay effect. The results also show improvement on both the system's robustness and stability. Furthermore, by comparing the maximum and average bending displacement reduction rates of the beam structure, it is found that the FSMC with phase shift compensation will improve the system's performance.

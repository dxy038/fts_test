The objective of this letter is to study the time evolution of a multipactor discharge in a simple dielectric waveguide structure. In particular, the investigation is performed on the case of a parallel-plate waveguide structure partially filled with a dielectric layer. The main consequence of the specific case studied in this letter is the fact that the dielectric layer charges negatively, allowing a negative static field to build up. This dc field eventually leads to a single-surface multipactor in the metallic surface before finally turning off the electron discharge.

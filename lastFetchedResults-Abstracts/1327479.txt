Detailed as-built information is essential for progress tracking, corrective actions, and schedule analysis. As-built documentation, however, has mainly been a manual process that is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes a low-cost framework that utilizes prevailing communication tools (email) to develop a project-wide system for progress tracking and bidirectional communication between project participants and head office. The framework integrates three main components: email forms for site data collection; customized scheduling application; and customized email application. In the schedule, the activities automatically initiate email requests for as-built information using an email form that has a checklist of possible site events and enables supervisors to attach notes and any requests for information. On a daily basis, the system automatically reads the supervisors' response emails and updates the schedule with all recorded as-built details. The paper discusses the development of a prototype system and demonstrates its usefulness on a small bridge-pier foundation example.

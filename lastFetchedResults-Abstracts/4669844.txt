The main objective of the research towards high density optical integration is to realize ultra-dense optical planar integrated circuits that combine passive and active optical functionalities as well as electronics playing control and logic functions. The most desirable output would be to have available for a designer a set of monolithically integrated building blocks incorporating all the necessary optical and electronic functions upon a single silicon substrate. Here we will present some of the contributions made towards highly integrated photonic circuits by a collaborative groups of the Joint Research Center of Photonics of the Royal Institute of Technology and Zhejiang University: directional coupler wavelength selective filter based on dispersive ID Bragg reflection waveguide, vertically coupled photonic crystal filter], compact arrayed waveguide grating demultiplexer based on amorphous silicon nanowires and polarization beam splitter based on two-dimensional photonic crystal of pillar type.

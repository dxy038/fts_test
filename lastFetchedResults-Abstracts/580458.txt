Abstract1
Accurate prediction of crop phenology is important in crop simulation models.
The objective of this work was to quantify the occurrence of phenological stages in
cotton and to construct a simple phenology model. Required parameters of model
were obtained from a serially sown field experiment (22 April, 5 May, 24 May, 13
June, 9 July, and 7 August in 2006). The results showed that none of
developmental stages is sensitive to photoperiod (on based phonological stages
reaction to GDD), so only temperature was taken into account. Also, there was no
difference between hourly, 3-hourly and daily temperature data. Therefore, average
daily temperature can be used in predicting developmental stages. For independent
test of the model, data from different field experiments that were carried out at
Hashem-Abad and Karkandeh stations were used. Root mean square errors
(RMSE) between simulated and experimental data were 1.8 d for emergence, 7.2 d
for squaring, 5.5 d for flowering, and 7.8 d for open boll. Therefore, this model can
be used to predict development stages in cotton simulation model in non-stress
conditions.

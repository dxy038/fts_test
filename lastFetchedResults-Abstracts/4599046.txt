This paper presents a rate-distortion optimized framework for the transmission of stereoscopic H.264/MVC video on QoS-enabled networks. The distortion caused by the loss of each encoding unit is computed by means of the analysis-by-synthesis approach, which is then used within a rate-distortion optimization framework to select the best transmission strategy. Simulation results, evaluated using an objective quality measure accounting for the peculiarities of the human visual system in stereoscopic video quality perception, show that the proposed rate-distortion optimized strategy significantly improves the communication quality with respect to a reference a priori optimization strategy.

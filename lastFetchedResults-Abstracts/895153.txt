Abstract  This paper presents an algorithm with the help of branch and bound approach for the two stage flow shop scheduling problem including transportation time and weightage of jobs; processing times are associated with their respective probabilities. Our main objective is to find the optimal/ near optimal sequence of jobs in order to minimize the total elapsed time. An algorithm is clarified with the help of a numerical example.

A novel rule request scheduling algorithm was proposed for the rule base server. The basic idea is that based on service queues classified by request classification function, the algorithm maximize the weighted values of &#8220;value rate&#8221; and system response time to reflect the performance of rule-based server and use it as the scheduling optimization objective. In addition, this algorithm uses adaptive coefficients dynamic adjustment mechanism to prevent the occurrence of &#8220;hunger&#8221;. The experimental results show that in considering the &#8220;value rate&#8221; of rules, the performance of URRS always outperforms other user-based algorithm such as APSP scheduling algorithm and it can flexible control the degree of &#8220;hunger&#8221; by regulating the value of C<sub>0</sub> in scheduling formula.

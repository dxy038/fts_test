In this paper we present an approach to optimize the cost of software quality assurance. It points out, how to optimize the investment into various software quality assurance techniques and software quality. The expected and reliable development of high quality software regularly becomes a major problem due to late removal of defect. The detection and removal of defect is a software inspection providing technical support for the defect detection activity, and large volume of documentation are related to software inspection in the development of the software quality assurance as a cost effective. The value of an inspection improves the quality and saves defect cost. We describe the optimization model for selecting the best commercial off-the-self (COTS) software product among alternatives for each module. As objective function of the models is to maximize quality within a budgetary constraint and standard quality assurance (QA) methodologies cuts maintenance costs. Increase reliability, and reduces cycle time for new distribution modeling system. An analytical and stochastic model of the economics of analytical software quality assurance (SQA) is based on expected values. The model is able to handle different type of techniques such as static and dynamic. The model can be used to analysis different type of techniques theoretically, and to optimize the software quality assurance.

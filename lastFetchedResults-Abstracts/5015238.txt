This paper is concerned with the problem of H<sub>infin</sub> controller design for networked control systems (NCSs) with time delay, packet dropout and time-varying sampling period. The considered NCSs may receive more than one control input during a sampling period. A multi-objective optimization methodology in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the discrete Jensen inequality are adopted to deal with the problem of H<sub>infin</sub> controller design for NCSs with time- varying sampling period. The proposed H<sub>infin</sub> controller design is also applicable for NCSs with constant sampling period. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed H<sub>infin</sub> controller design.

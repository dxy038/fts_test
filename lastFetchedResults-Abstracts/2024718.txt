Abstractâ€” FIR filter is a type of digital signal processing
filter whose impulse response is of finite duration because it
settles to zero in finite time. FIR filters are used in a range of
digital signal processing application and communication area.
The main objective of this paper is to modeling and simulation
of FIR filter in frequency domain for the UMTS standard and
to obtain its advantage over time domain implementation. In
this paper firstly we present two FIR filters one in time domain
and other in frequency domain. Then we abstract the filter
coefficient for time domain implementation and frequency
domain implementation of FIR filter by sampling both
representation of root raised cosine (RRC) filter. All modeling
and simulation performed using MATLAB software. A
comparison between a classical time domain FIR
implementation, and frequency domain implementation, in
terms of computational complexity, Inter symbol interference
rejection on the basis of average gain in immunity against ISI,
Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and peak distortion is
presented. It is found that frequency domain implementation of
FIR filter is better than time domain implementation of FIR
filter in all respects. This advantage of FIR filter
implementation in frequency domain makes it suitable for its
use in 3G communication system.

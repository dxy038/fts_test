A control method of variable lane based on video detection is proposed in this paper to handle the adaptive switching of the lane´s oriented attribute. Based on the image calibration, visual loop detectors are built up in the surveillance video of the intersection. Then, the characteristics of the traffic flow, such as flow rate, velocity, queue length, can be obtained by the video detection based on these detectors in real time. With further analysis of the traffic flow in the channelized lane, the variable lane´s orientation is determined for the objective of enlarging the traffic capacity of the intersection. Based on the simulation on the software VISSIM, we verify that the proposed method can enhance the traveling capability and reduce the congestion, compared with the original control method.

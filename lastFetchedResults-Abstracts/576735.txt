Background & Objective:
 At the present time, increasing of nitrate ion in water resources observed most of cities and these condition can cause various environmental health hazards. High nitrate concentrations in drinking water for infants under 6 months could make in methemoglobinemia and Blue Baby syndrome. Hence, at present study, the rate of nitrate ions removal from aqueous using the aerated electrochemical process has been studied. 
Materials & Methods: This study was conducted a laboratory-scale experimental, which done in pilot study.Experiments were performed in a batch reactor (with an effective volume 1 L), with four iron electrode connected in parallel (bipolar mode). Electrodes using a bipolar power supply were connected to convert alternating to direct current electricity . In the first time , reactor was filled synthetic samples containing nitrate anion concentrations of 5, 50 and 100 mg. The reaction was started.The efficiency of the system in removal of nitrate under various condition, pH (3, 7, 10), voltages (10, 20, 30 and 40 V), initial concentration of nitrate (5, 50 and 100 mg/L) and reaction time (15, 30, 45 and 60 min) were determined.
Results:Results obtained with synthetic solutions revealed that the most effective removal capacities of nitrate (96%) could be achieved at 40 V electrical potential, pH=10 and reaction time= 60 min for initial concentration of nitrate equal 5 mg/L. Also under these condition, the amount of energy consumption was 0.0257 kwh/L. 
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that nitrate removal efficiency using aerated electrochemical technique has a direct correlation with pH, voltage and reaction time and reverse correlation with initial nitrate concentration. Moreover, it can be concluded that this process has the potential to be utilized for the effective and safe removal of nitrate from water and wastewater.

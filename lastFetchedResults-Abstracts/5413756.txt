In this paper a simple digital implementation of one cycle control for the driving of a bidirectional three-phase back-to-back inverter is discussed. Such a digital implementation has been simulated in both grid-connected and stand alone configuration and the achieved performances have been compared with the corresponding ones obtained by adopting the standard analog implementation of one cycle control. The digital version preserves the same dynamic performances of the analog one even in presence of abrupt variations in the input current and during the transitions from grid-connected to stand-alone operating mode. The simulation results allow to assess the validity and the applicability of the proposed digital architecture in low cost microcontroller.

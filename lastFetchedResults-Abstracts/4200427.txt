Recent advances in integrated electronic devices motivated the use of wireless sensor networks in many applications including target surveillance and tracking. A number of sensor nodes are scattered within a sensitive region to detect the presence of intruders and forward subsequent events to the analysis center(s). Obviously, the sensor deployment should guarantee an optimal event detection rate. This paper proposes a tracking framework based on Voronoi tessellations. Two mobility models are proposed to control the coverage degree according to target presence. The objective is to set a non-uniform coverage within the monitored zone to allow detecting the target by multiple sensor nodes. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm to discover redundant nodes (which do not provide additional information about target position). This algorithm is shown to be effective in reducing the energy consumption using an activity scheduling approach.

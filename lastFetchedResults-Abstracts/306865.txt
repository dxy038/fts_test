Objective: Chronic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or deficiency in the antioxidant defense system are observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. As an adjunct to the usual indirect parameters for evaluating oxidative stress, we assessed the feasibility of oxyradicals detection in venous blood by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). Detection of the ascorbate pool was also performed using the validated ESR analysis of the ascorbyl free radical (AFR)-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) complex.
Methods and results: Plasma lipoperoxidation was characterized by higher levels of total MDA (1.50 ± 0.08 nmol/L), lower levels of GSH (0.54 ± 0.02 mmol/L) and of vitamin A (2.13 ± 0.52 μmol/L) in the NIDDM group than in the controls (0.75 ± 0.05 nmol/L, 0.90 ± 0.05 mmol/L, 3.52 ± 1.04 μmol/L, respectively). Improvement of the ESR measurement of oxyradical adducts has been previously obtained by addition of a new sensitive nitrone (DEPMPO), which acts as a spin-trap. However, in our experiment the ESR signal-to-noise ratio was too low to detect significative oxyradicals adducts in total venous blood of NIDDM patients having a weak production of ROS. A significant difference (p < 0.002) was observed in DMSO/AFR index between controls (24.00 ± 4.10 nmol/L) and NIDDM patients (7.28 ± 2.36 nmol/L) suggesting ascorbate depletion related to the free radical production.
Conclusion: The DMSO/AFR index could be an interesting additional marker of oxidative stress during a chronic production of ROS.

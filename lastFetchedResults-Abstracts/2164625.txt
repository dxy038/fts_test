Workplace spirituality is considered a valuable intangible asset in the management literature whose effects on significant managerial and organizational activities are under study. The main objective of the present paper is to study the impacts of this important variable on consumer’s satisfaction regarding the moderating role of organizational citizenship behavior. It is an applied research with regard to its objective and a descriptive-correlative one with regard to research methodology. Standard questionnaires were used to collect the data. The sample was taken from faculty members, staff and postgraduate students of 27 faculties of Tabriz, Sahand Technical, and Islamic Arts universities of Tabriz. Using Cochran formula at 95 percent certitude, the sample was selected through stratified random sampling method and the questionnaires were sent to 289 faculty members and staff and 359 postgraduate students. The results of stepwise regression analysis indicate that there is an independently significant relationship between workplace spirituality and consumers’ satisfaction, while organizational citizenship behavior did not play an adjusting role. Also t-test (Spearman correlation coefficients) results indicate that on individual level (working with the meaning) and organizational level (congruence of values) there are significant positive relationships between spirituality and organizational citizenship behavior and consumer’s satisfaction; but on group level (feeling of solidarity) there are no significant relationship between organizational citizenship behavior and consumer’s satisfaction.

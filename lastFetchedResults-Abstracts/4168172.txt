The objective of energy efficient routing protocol is to increase the operational lifetime of the wireless sensor networks. Multipath routing protocols enhance the lifetime of the wireless sensor networks by distributing traffic among multiple paths instead of a single optimal path. Transmission of secured data is also an important research concern in the wireless sensor networks. In this paper, a secure node disjoint multipath routing protocol for wireless sensor networks is proposed. Here, the data packets are transmitted in a secure manner by using the digital signature crypto system. It is compared with an ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing protocol. It shows better results in terms of packet delivery fraction, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay compared to the ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing.

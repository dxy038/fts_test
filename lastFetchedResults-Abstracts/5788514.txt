The National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting (NICEIC) is an independent consumer safety organisation. The CouncilÂ´s sole objective is to protect users of electricity against unsafe and unsound electrical installation work. The work of the NICEIC is outlined in this article. The NICEIC will continue to play a leading and active part in promoting electrical safety but, as a result of the pressures that will inevitably result from competition, it is unlikely to be able to continue to do so solely in the public interest, and is likely to have to work to something less than its current technical assessment standard

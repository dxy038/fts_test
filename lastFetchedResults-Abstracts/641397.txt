There is a wide variation in the reported data on the concentrations of trace elements in human milk from different countries, but such data are not available for Kuwait. The objective of this study was to analyze the concentration of zinc, copper, manganese, and iron in milk and plasma of Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti mothers during prolonged lactation. Milk samples (from 34 donors) were collected early in the morning before feeding the infant. Trace elements were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Protein content and activity of superoxide dismutase were assayed spectrophotometrically. Concentration of zinc, copper, iron, and total protein and activity of superoxide dismutase in milk and of only zinc in plasma of Kuwaiti mothers were significantly higher than those of non-Kuwaitis. Concentration of zinc, copper, manganese, and total protein in milk of both groups decreased as lactation continued but that of milk iron and plasma trace elements remained unchanged. The data of Kuwaiti mothers are consistent with those of previous reports on hyperurecemia, and the prevalence of obesity was found to be higher in the Kuwaiti population than in other countries. High protein content in association with high concentration of trace elements in milk of Kuwaiti versus non-Kuwaiti mothers may indicate that protein content in milk is an important determining factor for the concentration and bioavailability of these elements.

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are getting increasingly attractive as a means to bridge between the physical and the virtual world. The current trends in communication see vast advances in wireless connectivity, leading to dynamic and complicated systems on top of which applications must be built. The task of designing these applications with such systems thus becomes much more complex. One common problem faced by the designers is the heterogeneity of the software and hardware platforms which makes deployment and application development difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need for a generic middleware for flexible, fast integration and deployment of such heterogeneous sensor networks. This motivates the development of EasiBridge, a message-transformation service-oriented middleware for WSNs. The main objective of this work is to allow heterogeneous WSNs to be supported through a common middleware platform.

The Philippine archipelago consists of more than 7000 islands. Most of these islands have extensive coral reefs or coral communities. For centuries, reefs and their associated resources have provided the livelihood for a large portion of the coastal population. However, reefs as sources of income are threatened by over-exploitation and by the use of destructive fishing methods. The scientific community, natural resource managers and many of the small-scale fishermen are aware that catches are falling rapidly while the fast growing population requires increasing amounts of fish. Since the early 1970s, various programs have tried to counter the decline of Philippine coastal resources. This article reports about successful examples of reef conservation in the provinces of Negros Oriental, Batangas and the Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park, Palawan. In all three localities, significant areas of reefs are legally protected and sustainable management regimes are working effectively. In Negros and Batangas this success is partly a result of intensive education programs that contributed to the active involvement of the traditional fishermen and the larger coastal community. Community participation and co-operation of all institutions involved in resource management are regarded as the key elements of sustainable reef management in these areas. This paper presents the objectives, programs and achievements as well as the fruitful networking of the participating organizations. Particular emphasis is placed on the experiences and lessons emanating from 25 years of reef conservation while showing the overall objective of sustainable use is still far on the horizon. It is suggested that more integrated forms of management, involving various stakeholders, and that address the numerous intertwined issues, will save Philippine reefs.

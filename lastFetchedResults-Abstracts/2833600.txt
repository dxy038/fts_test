The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of multi-input converter during fault condition at hybrid power systems. Multi-input converters are fed with several sources of energy. During fault phenomenon, the voltages of energy sources become zero. So, the output voltage of mentioned converter is affected by this change. In this paper, at the first step, one hybrid PV/Wind power system has been proposed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. In this part, the simulation process of the power sources and double-input DC/DC converter has been explained. The other issue which is studied at this part is introducing of a proper control strategy for the simulated double-input DC/DC converter. There are some important factors to design the controller. These factors have been studied and based on these studies; the controller is designed. The last session of this survey relates to the studying of the fault effects on multi-input converter. At this part, by inserting the fault on power sources under different conditions, the output voltage and power have been analyzed. In addition, studying the dynamic and stability of designed controller is the other part of the last session.
